Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z (mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%), which is a constituent of mixture Y and widely used as a solvent. Substance Z does not react further with hydrogen. There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X.\nIndicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\n\nA) 12\nB) 18\nC) 16\nD) 22\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ is given by `(y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008)`. Using integer masses for simplicity (H=1, C=12), the fraction is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428` (which is very close to 1/7).\n    *   `7y = 12x + y`\n    *   `6y = 12x`\n    *   `y = 2x`\n    *   The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. This corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Let's verify the mass fraction for cyclohexane: H% = (12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12 * 1) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. This confirms that **Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Carbon Skeleton:**\n    *   Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   This is a crucial piece of information. It means that all the compounds in both mixtures X and Y have the same carbon skeleton: a six-membered ring.\n\n3.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   It does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   One of its components is Z, which is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n    *   Mixture Y is formed by a disproportionation reaction. In catalysis, this often involves hydrogen transfer, leading to a more saturated and a less saturated (often aromatic) compound.\n    *   A plausible second component for Y would be benzene (C₆H₆). Benzene is aromatic and does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions.\n    *   Let's check if this fits: Hydrogenation of mixture Y (cyclohexane + benzene) would convert benzene to cyclohexane (`C₆H₆ + 3H₂ → C₆H₁₂`), and cyclohexane would not react. The final product would be only cyclohexane (Z). This fits perfectly.\n    *   Therefore, **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n4.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that react to form mixture Y.\n    *   The reaction is: `X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`.\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one component of X is reduced to cyclohexane and the other is oxidized to benzene.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms must be conserved. The products have 12 + 6 = 18 hydrogen atoms. Therefore, the two molecules of mixture X must also have a total of 18 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The components of X decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n    *   The components of X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   The logical precursors to cyclohexane and benzene with a C₆ ring are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and cyclohexadienes (C₆H₈).\n    *   There are two isomers of cyclohexadiene: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). The problem states there are no conjugated bonds, so we must use **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   The other component must be **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**.\n    *   Let's check if these two components fit the conditions.\n        *   X₁ = Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)\n        *   X₂ = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)\n        *   Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n        *   Neither has conjugated double bonds.\n        *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a balanced hydrogen transfer. The 1,4-cyclohexadiene is oxidized to benzene, and the cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane.\n        *   Hydrogenation of mixture X (cyclohexene + 1,4-cyclohexadiene) would yield only cyclohexane. This also fits.\n    *   So, **mixture X consists of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   Number of H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) = 10.\n    *   Number of H atoms in one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) = 8.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n**1. Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n*   The general formula for a hydrocarbon is CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by: `(y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008) = 0.1428`.\n*   Using approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12), the formula simplifies to `y / (12x + y) ≈ 0.1428`.\n*   This gives `y ≈ 0.1428 * (12x + y)`, which simplifies to `0.8572y ≈ 1.7136x`, or `y/x ≈ 2`.\n*   The empirical formula is CH₂, and the molecular formula is (CH₂)n or CnH2n.\n*   The problem states that Z is saturated (it does not react further with hydrogen). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in any cycloalkane (CnH2n) is `(2n * 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857`, which matches the given data.\n*   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) is a very common cycloalkane solvent. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n\n**2. Characterize Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is Z, which we've identified as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Mixture X, which is unsaturated, is converted to the saturated/aromatic mixture Y upon heating with platinum. This is described as a disproportionation. This points towards a catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction. A well-known example is the Zelinsky irreversible catalysis, where an unsaturated cyclic compound disproportionates into a saturated cycloalkane and an aromatic compound.\n*   For a C₆ system, a cyclohexene or cyclohexadiene would disproportionate into cyclohexane and benzene.\n*   Let's hypothesize that mixture Y consists of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   This is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   Cyclohexane is saturated and does not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Benzene, due to its aromatic stability, does not react with bromine water under normal conditions. So, mixture Y fits this description.\n    *   Upon hydrogenation, cyclohexane does not react, while benzene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane (C₆H₆ + 3H₂ → C₆H₁₂). Thus, hydrogenating mixture Y gives only cyclohexane (Z). This fits the problem description perfectly.\n\n**3. Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   We have established the reaction that forms Y: `A + B → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`, where A and B are the equimolar components of mixture X.\n*   By balancing the atoms, the sum of the formulas of A and B must be C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   Since A and B are in an equimolar mixture and both get hydrogenated to the same C₆ skeleton (cyclohexane), they must both be C₆ hydrocarbons, let's say C₆Hx and C₆Hy.\n*   Therefore, x + y = 18.\n*   The properties of mixture X are:\n    *   It decolorizes bromine water, so A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   The molecules have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of both A and B yields only cyclohexane (Z). This confirms they must have a six-membered ring structure.\n*   Let's find two non-conjugated, unsaturated C₆ cyclic isomers that fit the condition x + y = 18.\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** is a prime candidate. It has one double bond and would decolorize bromine water. It hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n    *   To satisfy x + y = 18, if A is C₆H₁₀, then B must be C₆H₈.\n    *   We need a non-conjugated C₆H₈ isomer with a six-membered ring. **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits this description perfectly. Its two double bonds are separated by two single bonds, so they are not conjugated. It also hydrogenates to cyclohexane. The other common isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, is conjugated and thus ruled out.\n*   So, mixture X is an equimolar mix of cyclohexene (A = C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (B = C₆H₈).\n*   The disproportionation reaction is: C₆H₁₀ (cyclohexene) + C₆H₈ (1,4-cyclohexadiene) → C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane) + C₆H₆ (benzene). This is a balanced hydrogen transfer reaction. The diene is oxidized to benzene, and the monoene is reduced to the alkane.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) = 10\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) = 8\n\nTotal number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Determine the Molecular Formula of Z**: We'll use the given mass fraction of hydrogen (14.28%) to find the empirical and molecular formula of the hydrocarbon Z. Since Z is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen), it must be an alkane or a cycloalkane. The mass fraction strongly suggests a CnH2n formula, characteristic of a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Identify Z and Mixture Y**: Based on the chemical properties described (common solvent, product of hydrogenation, part of a disproportionation reaction), we can deduce the specific structure of Z. The properties of mixture Y (does not decolorize bromine water, hydrogenates to Z) allow us to identify its two components, one of which is Z. The most plausible scenario involves a C6 carbon skeleton, making Z cyclohexane and the other component of Y benzene.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction**: The reaction where mixture X forms mixture Y is a disproportionation, specifically a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X is dehydrogenated to form benzene, and the other is hydrogenated to form cyclohexane.\n\n4.  **Determine the Total Hydrogen Atoms in X**: By setting up a hydrogen balance for the disproportionation reaction, we can create an equation relating the number of hydrogen atoms in the two components of mixture X. Solving this equation will give the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two molecules, which is the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the chemistry problem by following a logical deduction based on the provided information.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of hydrocarbon Z.\n    # Z is a hydrocarbon (CnHm) with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    # Mass fraction H = (mass of H) / (total mass)\n    # Using approximate atomic masses C=12, H=1:\n    # 0.1428 is approximately 1/7.\n    # For a formula CnHm, the mass fraction of H is m / (12n + m).\n    # m / (12n + m) = 1/7  => 7m = 12n + m => 6m = 12n => m = 2n.\n    # The formula for Z is CnH2n.

Since the empirical formula is CH2, the molecular formula must be of the form CnH2n. This indicates that Z is a cycloalkane.\nLet's verify the mass fraction for CnH2n:\nMass % H = (2n * 1.008) / (n * 12.011 + 2n * 1.008) = 2.016n / 14.027n ≈ 0.1437, which is very close to 14.28% (1/7 ≈ 0.142857). So, Z is indeed a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify hydrocarbon Z and mixture Y.**\n*   Z is a cycloalkane (CnH2n) widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n*   Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* Z. This implies that all components of X and Y have a carbon skeleton that can be converted to the skeleton of Z upon hydrogenation. If Z is cyclohexane, all components must have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n*   Mixture Y is formed from X, does not decolorize bromine water, and contains Z as one of its components. Let Y = {Z, W}.\n*   Since Y does not decolorize bromine water, both Z and W must be saturated compounds (or aromatic, which also doesn't react with bromine water).\n*   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. This means hydrogenation of Z gives Z (no reaction), and hydrogenation of W must also give Z.\n*   This leads to a crucial point. If W is a saturated cycloalkane isomer of Z (like methylcyclopentane), its hydrogenation to Z would involve skeletal rearrangement, which is possible under \"severe conditions\". However, let's consider the disproportionation reaction first.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the disproportionation reaction and identify mixture X.**\n*   The reaction is: Mixture X → Mixture Y. This is a disproportionation.\n*   Let the two components of the equimolar mixture X be A and B. Let the two components of the equimolar mixture Y be Z and W.\n*   The reaction is: A + B → Z + W (in a 1:1 molar ratio).\n*   This is an intermolecular hydrogen transfer. One molecule is hydrogenated (reduced) and the other is dehydrogenated (oxidized).\n*   We know Z is cyclohexane (C6H12). So, one product is saturated.\n*   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means W must also not react with bromine water. A highly unsaturated but stable aromatic compound like benzene (C6H6) fits this description. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions.\n*   Let's test this hypothesis: Y = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y: Cyclohexane is already saturated. Benzene hydrogenates to cyclohexane (C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12). So, hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only cyclohexane (Z). This fits the condition.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of Y. This fits.\n*   Now we can deduce A and B from the reaction: A + B → C6H12 + C6H6.\n    *   The total atoms on the product side are C12H18. This must be the same for the reactants A + B.\n    *   A and B are in an equimolar mixture, and their hydrogenation both yield cyclohexane. This means A and B must be unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons with a six-membered ring skeleton.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B must contain C=C double bonds.\n    *   The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X.\n    *   Let's find two C6 cyclic alkenes, A and B, that sum to C12H18. The most common ones are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadienes (C6H8).\n    *   If we take A = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = a cyclohexadiene (C6H8), the total formula is C10H10 + C6H8 = C12H18. This matches the products.\n    *   The problem specifies no conjugated bonds. 1,3-Cyclohexadiene is conjugated. Therefore, the diene must be 1,4-Cyclohexadiene.\n*   So, let's finalize the identities:\n    *   **Mixture X** = {Cyclohexene (C6H10), 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)}\n    *   **Mixture Y** = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}\n    *   **Substance Z** = Cyclohexane (C6H12)\n\n**Step 4: Verify all conditions.**\n*   **X**: Equimolar mixture of two liquids (C6H10, C6H8). Decolorizes Br2 water (due to C=C). No conjugated bonds (1,4-diene is not conjugated). **(Checks out)**\n*   **Reaction**: C6H10 + C6H8 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 + C6H6. This is a disproportionation (hydrogen transfer) yielding an equimolar mixture Y. **(Checks out)**\n*   **Y**: Equimolar mixture of two liquids (C6H12, C6H6). Does not decolorize Br2 water (cyclohexane is saturated, benzene is unreactive). **(Checks out)**\n*   **Hydrogenation of X**: C6H10 + H2 → C6H12. C6H8 + 2H2 → C6H12. Gives only Z. **(Checks out)**\n*   **Hydrogenation of Y**: C6H12 → C6H12. C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12. Gives only Z. **(Checks out)**\n*   **Z**: C6H12, a hydrocarbon solvent, H% is 14.28%, constituent of Y. **(Checks out)**\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final answer.**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   Liquid 1: Cyclohexene (C6H10) has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Liquid 2: 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\nThe problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as:\nMass Fraction H = (Total mass of H) / (Total molecular mass)\n\nThe value 14.28% is equivalent to the decimal 0.1428. This value is very close to the fraction 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). Let's assume the ratio of hydrogen mass to total mass is 1/7. Using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1) for simplicity:\n1/7 = (y × 1) / (x × 12 + y × 1)\n12x + y = 7y\n12x = 6y\ny/x = 2/1\n\nThis gives an empirical formula of CH2. The general molecular formula is therefore (CH2)n, or CnH2n.\nThe problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which means it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\nZ is also described as being \"widely used as a solvent.\" The most common cycloalkane solvent that fits this description is cyclohexane, C6H12.\nThis fits all the descriptions, so we can confidently identify **Z as cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. We are told that Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of Y. Let's call the two components of Y, C and D. So, C = Z = cyclohexane (C6H12).\nMixture Y \"does not decolorize bromine water.\" Cyclohexane (C) is saturated and does not react. Therefore, the other component, D, must also not decolorize bromine water. This suggests D is either a saturated compound or an aromatic compound (which does not react with bromine water without a catalyst).\nThe problem states that hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane).\nHydrogenation(C + D) → Z only\nHydrogenation(cyclohexane + D) → cyclohexane only\nSince cyclohexane is already saturated, it does not react. This means that the hydrogenation of D must yield cyclohexane.\nSo, D must be a C6 hydrocarbon that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. Given that D does not decolorize bromine water, the most plausible candidate is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water under standard test conditions, and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane.\nTherefore, **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\nThe reaction X → Y is a disproportionation reaction, which means one component is oxidized while the other is reduced.\nA + B → C + D\nA + B → cyclohexane (C6H12) + benzene (C6H6)\nThis is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X loses hydrogen to form benzene (oxidation), and the other component gains hydrogen to form cyclohexane (reduction).\nThe total number of atoms must be conserved.\nTotal C atoms in products = 6 (from benzene) + 6 (from cyclohexane) = 12.\nTotal H atoms in products = 6 (from benzene) + 12 (from cyclohexane) = 18.\nTherefore, the two molecules A and B together must contain 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms.\n\nWe are also told that hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both A and B are C6 hydrocarbons, and their carbon skeletons can be hydrogenated to a six-membered ring. So, A = C6Hx and B = C6Hy.\nFrom the atom balance, we have x + y = 18.\n\nWe have several constraints for A and B:\n1.  Mixture X \"decolorizes bromine water,\" so at least one component must be unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds). This means their hydrogen counts must be less than that of the corresponding saturated cycloalkane (C6H12). So, x < 12 and y < 12.\n2.  \"There are no conjugated multiple bonds\" in the molecules of X.\n\nWe need to find two different integers, x and y, that satisfy x + y = 18, with both x < 12 and y < 12. Since stable hydrocarbons typically have an even number of hydrogen atoms, we look for a pair of even integers. The only pair that fits these conditions is **8 and 10**.\nSo, the components of mixture X have the formulas C6H8 and C6H10.\n\nLet's identify the specific structures:\n*   **C6H10**: This must be **cyclohexene**. It has one double bond, so it decolorizes bromine water. It is not conjugated. It hydrogenates to cyclohexane. This fits all conditions.\n*   **C6H8**: This must be a cyclohexadiene. The condition \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" rules out 1,3-cyclohexadiene. Therefore, it must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**. It has two isolated double bonds, decolorizes bromine water, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. This also fits all conditions.\n\nSo, mixture X consists of **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n\n**Step 4: Answer the question.**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two components.\n-   Number of hydrogen atoms in cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10\n-   Number of hydrogen atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) = 8\nTotal number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n```python\n# This code performs the final addition based on the derived molecular formulas.\n# The first liquid in mixture X is cyclohexene, C6H10.\n# The second liquid in mixture X is 1,4-cyclohexadiene, C6H8.\nhydrogen_atoms_in_liquid_1 = 10\nhydrogen_atoms_in_liquid_2 = 8\ntotal_hydrogen_atoms = hydrogen_atoms_in_liquid_1 + hydrogen_atoms_in_liquid_2\nprint(total_hydrogen_atoms)\n```\n<<<D>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: 18\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z\n\nThe problem states that substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let's determine its general formula.\n\n*   The mass percentage of hydrogen is approximately 14.28%, which is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n*   If Z were an alkane with the formula CₙH₂ₙ₊₂, the mass fraction of hydrogen would be (2n + 2) / (12n + 2n + 2) = (2n + 2) / (14n + 2). Setting this to 1/7 gives 14n + 14 = 14n + 2, which is impossible.\n*   If Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CₙH₂ₙ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is 2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7. This matches the given value of 14.28%.\n\nTherefore, Z is a cycloalkane. The problem also mentions that Z is widely used as a solvent. A very common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Composition of Mixture Y\n\nMixture Y is formed from the disproportionation of mixture X. Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic. We also know that:\n*   Substance Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only Z (cyclohexane).\n\nLet the two components of Y be C and D. We can set C = Z = cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). For the hydrogenation of Y to yield only cyclohexane, the other component, D, must also be converted into cyclohexane.\n\nThe reaction X → Y is a disproportionation, which in this context is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One species is reduced (gains hydrogen) and another is oxidized (loses hydrogen). Since one product is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), the fully reduced C₆ ring, the other product (D) is likely the fully dehydrogenated C₆ ring, which is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\nLet's check if this composition for Y fits the description:\n*   **Mixture Y = {cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), benzene (C₆H₆)}**\n*   **Does not decolorize bromine water**: Correct. Cyclohexane is saturated, and benzene, due to its aromatic stability, does not react with bromine water under normal conditions.\n*   **Hydrogenation gives only Z**: Hydrogenation of cyclohexane gives cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane (C₆H₆ + 3H₂ → C₆H₁₂). This is consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction and Mixture X\n\nThe transformation of mixture X into mixture Y is a disproportionation reaction catalyzed by platinum. Since Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and benzene, the reaction can be written as:\n\n**Component A + Component B (from Mixture X) → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆ (Mixture Y)**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms must be the same on both sides of the equation. Both components of X must have a C₆ carbon skeleton because their hydrogenation leads to a C₆ product (cyclohexane). Let the formulas of the two components of X be C₆Hₐ and C₆Hₑ.\n\nThe hydrogen balance is:\na + b = 12 + 6\na + b = 18\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is precisely the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component, which is 18.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Properties of Mixture X\n\nWe can further validate this by identifying plausible structures for the components of X.\n*   They must be unsaturated C₆ compounds to decolorize bromine water.\n*   They must not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   The reaction C₆Hₐ + C₆Hₑ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆ must be a balanced hydrogen transfer.\n\nA plausible scenario is the transfer of two hydrogen atoms:\n*   C₆H₁₀ + 2H → C₆H₁₂ (Reduction)\n*   C₆H₈ - 2H → C₆H₆ (Oxidation/Dehydrogenation)\n\nThis implies that mixture X is composed of a C₆H₁₀ isomer and a C₆H₈ isomer.\n*   **C₆H₁₀**: **Cyclohexene**. It has one double bond, decolorizes bromine water, and its hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. It does not have conjugated bonds.\n*   **C₆H₈**: A cyclohexadiene. To meet the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" condition, this must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**, not the conjugated 1,3-cyclohexadiene. 1,4-cyclohexadiene decolorizes bromine water and its hydrogenation also yields cyclohexane.\n\nThe disproportionation of cyclohexene and a cyclohexadiene over a platinum catalyst to yield cyclohexane and benzene is a known type of reaction, often referred to as Zelinsky irreversible catalysis.\n\nThus, a mixture X composed of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) fits all the conditions described in the problem. The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of these two liquids is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the answer based on the provided chemical problem.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z\n\n1.  **Analyze the composition of Z**: The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n2.  **Determine the formula type**: The mass percentage 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n    *   For a general cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n, the mass fraction of hydrogen is (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7. This matches the given data.\n    *   For a general alkane with the formula CnH2n+2, the mass fraction of hydrogen would be (2n+2) / (14n+2). Setting this to 1/7 leads to 14n + 14 = 14n + 2, which is impossible.\n3.  **Conclusion for Z**: Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n. The problem also mentions it is a widely used solvent. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common cycloalkane solvent. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n\n1.  **Properties of Y**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n2.  **Components of Y**: One component of Y is Z, which we identified as cyclohexane (C6H12).\n3.  **Hydrogenation of Y**: Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that all components of Y must have the same carbon skeleton. The other component must be a C6 compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n4.  **Identify the second component**: Since the second component does not decolorize bromine water, it is likely aromatic. Benzene (C6H6) is the aromatic compound with a C6 skeleton. Benzene does not react with bromine water under normal conditions. Hydrogenation of benzene produces cyclohexane.\n5.  **Conclusion for Y**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X and the Reaction\n\n1.  **Properties of X**: Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, indicating they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds). The molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n2.  **Hydrogenation of X**: Hydrogenation of mixture X also yields only Z (cyclohexane). This confirms that both components of X are C6 cyclic compounds.\n3.  **The Reaction (X → Y)**: Mixture X is converted to mixture Y upon heating with platinum. This is described as a disproportionation reaction, which in this context is a hydrogen transfer.\n    *   Let the two components of X be A and B.\n    *   The reaction is: A + B → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6).\n4.  **Conservation of Atoms**: Since the reaction is a 1:1 transformation of an equimolar mixture, we can balance the atoms. Let A be C6Hx and B be C6Hy.\n    *   Carbon atoms are already balanced (6+6 → 6+6).\n    *   Hydrogen atoms must also be balanced: x + y = 12 (from cyclohexane) + 6 (from benzene) = 18.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Structures of Components in X and Calculate the Final Answer\n\n1.  **Identify possible structures**: The components of X (A and B) must be unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons without conjugated bonds. The most common examples are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadienes (C6H8).\n2.  **Check for non-conjugated bonds**:\n    *   Cyclohexene (C6H10) has one double bond, so there is no conjugation. This is a valid candidate.\n    *   Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) exists as two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). The problem specifies no conjugated bonds, so the component must be 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n3.  **Solve for components**: We need two molecules whose hydrogen counts (x and y) sum to 18.\n    *   If we choose A = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8), the total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n4.  **Verify the reaction**: The proposed reaction is:\n    Cyclohexene (C6H10) + 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)\n    This is a plausible hydrogen transfer reaction where 1,4-cyclohexadiene is dehydrogenated to benzene, and cyclohexene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane. Such disproportionation and hydrogen transfer reactions over platinum catalysts are well-documented.\n5.  **Calculate the final answer**: The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in Cyclohexene) + (H atoms in 1,4-Cyclohexadiene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify Substance Z**\n\n*   Substance Z is a hydrocarbon formed from the hydrogenation of other hydrocarbons, and it does not react further with hydrogen. This indicates Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (an alkane or a cycloalkane).\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is given as 14.28%. Let the formula for Z be CnHm.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as: `(m * Ar(H)) / (n * Ar(C) + m * Ar(H))`, where Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\n*   So, `m / (12n + m) = 0.1428`.\n*   The value 0.1428 is equivalent to 1/7.\n*   `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`\n*   `7m = 12n + m`\n*   `6m = 12n`\n*   `m = 2n`\n*   The general formula for Z is CnH2n. Since Z is a saturated hydrocarbon, it must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem states that Z is widely used as a solvent. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common cycloalkane solvent that fits this description.\n*   Let's verify the mass fraction for cyclohexane (C6H12): `(12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12 * 1) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 0.1428`. This matches perfectly.\n*   Therefore, substance Z is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n**2. Analyze the Reactions and Mixtures**\n\n*   **Hydrogenation:** Both mixture X and mixture Y, when hydrogenated under severe conditions, yield only cyclohexane (Z). This implies that all constituent compounds in both mixtures are composed of a six-carbon atom ring structure.\n*   **Mixture Y:** Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated. One of its components is Z, which is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's call the components of Y, C and D. So, D = Z = cyclohexane (C6H12). The other component, C, must also be saturated and must produce cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. A well-known substance that fits this description is benzene (C6H6). Benzene is aromatic and does not decolorize bromine water without a catalyst. Under severe conditions (high pressure and temperature), it can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n*   So, mixture Y consists of benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12). This is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that do not decolorize bromine water, and one component is Z. This fits the description.\n\n**3. Deduce the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   **Disproportionation Reaction:** Mixture X is converted to mixture Y upon heating with platinum. This is described as a disproportionation reaction. In this context, it is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one molecule is dehydrogenated (oxidized) and another is hydrogenated (reduced).\n*   The reaction is: Mixture X → Mixture Y\n*   Let the components of the equimolar mixture X be A and B.\n*   The reaction is: A + B → Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   This reaction must be balanced in terms of atoms. The products have a total of 12 carbon atoms (6+6) and 18 hydrogen atoms (6+12). Therefore, the reactants A and B must also have a total of 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms. Since all compounds have a C6 skeleton, A is C6Hx and B is C6Hy, where x + y = 18.\n*   **Properties of Mixture X:**\n    *   It is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   It decolorizes bromine water, so A and B must be unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   The molecules in X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Let's consider the hydrogen transfer. To form benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12), one reactant must donate hydrogen and the other must accept it. A plausible scenario involves cyclohexene and a cyclohexadiene.\n*   Let's identify A and B. A logical candidate for the hydrogen acceptor is cyclohexene (C6H10). A logical candidate for the hydrogen donor is a cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   The reaction would be: Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) + Cyclohexene (C6H10) → Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Let's check the atom balance:\n    *   Carbons: 6 + 6 = 12 on the left; 6 + 6 = 12 on the right. (Balanced)\n    *   Hydrogens: 8 + 10 = 18 on the left; 6 + 12 = 18 on the right. (Balanced)\n*   This reaction is a known type of disproportionation called Zelinsky-Kazansky catalysis, where a hydrogen donor (like a diene) and a hydrogen acceptor (like an alkene) react over a platinum catalyst to yield more stable products (an aromatic compound and an alkane).\n*   Now let's check if these components for X fit all conditions:\n    *   **A = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8):** It is unsaturated. The double bonds are not conjugated. It hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n    *   **B = Cyclohexene (C6H10):** It is unsaturated. It has only one double bond, so no conjugation. It hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n*   Mixture X = {1,4-Cyclohexadiene, Cyclohexene}. This fits all the given conditions.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This refers to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) = 8.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in Cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `mass % H = (mass of H) / (total mass) * 100%`.\n    *   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CnHm. The mass is `12n + m` (using approximate atomic masses C=12, H=1).\n    *   The mass fraction of H is `m / (12n + m)`.\n    *   `m / (12n + m) = 0.1428`.\n    *   This value, 14.28%, is very close to 1/7 (`1/7 ≈ 0.142857`).\n    *   So, `m / (12n + m) ≈ 1/7`, which gives `7m ≈ 12n + m`, so `6m ≈ 12n`, which simplifies to `m ≈ 2n`.\n    *   A hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n can be an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means the components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one component of Y is the cycloalkane Z (CnH2n).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. This means the other component of Y, let's call it Y2, must also be converted to Z upon hydrogenation.\n    *   Since Y2 does not decolorize bromine water, it is not a simple alkene/alkyne. For it to be hydrogenated to a cycloalkane Z (CnH2n), Y2 is most likely an aromatic hydrocarbon. The hydrogenation of an aromatic ring requires severe conditions, which is mentioned in the problem.\n    *   The most common and stable aromatic hydrocarbons are based on a benzene ring. Let's assume the simplest case, where the carbon skeleton is a six-membered ring (n=6).\n    *   This makes Z = cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   The corresponding aromatic compound Y2 would be benzene (C6H6).\n    *   Let's check if this fits: Hydrogenation of benzene (C6H6 + 3H2) gives cyclohexane (C6H12). This is consistent.\n    *   So, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (Z) and benzene. Both are liquids and neither decolorizes bromine water under normal conditions. This fits all the criteria for Y.\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture X and the Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2, that undergoes disproportionation on a heated platinum catalyst to form an equimolar mixture of Y = (cyclohexane, benzene).\n    *   The overall reaction is: `X1 + X2 -> C6H12 + C6H6`.\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. To balance the atoms, the total formula of the reactants must be C12H18. Since X is an equimolar mixture, each molecule on average has the formula C6H9.\n    *   Let X1 be C6Ha and X2 be C6Hb. Since the mixture is equimolar, the average number of hydrogen atoms is `(a + b) / 2 = 9`, which means `a + b = 18`.\n    *   The components of X decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated. They must also have a C6 ring skeleton because their hydrogenation leads to cyclohexane.\n    *   The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X.\n    *   Let's look for possible unsaturated C6-ring compounds:\n        *   Cyclohexene (C6H10). It has one double bond (non-conjugated). `a = 10`.\n        *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8). It has two non-conjugated double bonds. `b = 8`. (1,3-Cyclohexadiene is conjugated and thus excluded).\n    *   Let's check if these two compounds fit the condition `a + b = 18`.\n    *   `10 + 8 = 18`. Yes, they fit perfectly.\n    *   So, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n\n4.  **Verify the Entire Process:**\n    *   **X**: Equimolar mix of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Both are unsaturated and non-conjugated.\n    *   **Reaction**: `C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)`. This is a known catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction. 1,4-cyclohexadiene acts as the hydrogen donor (is oxidized to benzene), and cyclohexene acts as the hydrogen acceptor (is reduced to cyclohexane). The reaction produces an equimolar mixture of products.\n    *   **Y**: Equimolar mix of cyclohexane and benzene. Both are \"saturated\" towards bromine water.\n    *   **Z**: Cyclohexane (C6H12). It is a component of Y, a common solvent, and fits the mass percentage of hydrogen.\n    *   **Hydrogenation of X**: `C6H10 + H2 -> C6H12` and `C6H8 + 2H2 -> C6H12`. Both give only Z.\n    *   **Hydrogenation of Y**: `C6H12 -> C6H12` and `C6H6 + 3H2 -> C6H12`. Both give only Z.\n    *   All conditions of the problem are satisfied.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Liquid 1 (X1) is cyclohexene (C6H10), which has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid 2 (X2) is 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), which has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Substance Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let its formula be CnHm.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `Mass Fraction H = (m * Ar(H)) / (n * Ar(C) + m * Ar(H))`. Using atomic masses Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\n*   `0.1428 = m / (12n + m)`\n*   This can be rearranged to `m / (12n) ≈ 0.1428 / (1 - 0.1428) = 0.1428 / 0.8572 ≈ 1/6`.\n*   So, `m / n ≈ 12 / 6 = 2`. The empirical formula of Z is CH2.\n*   The general formula for a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen-to-carbon ratio of 2 is CnH2n.\n*   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a fully saturated hydrocarbon. A hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n that is saturated must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in any cycloalkane CnH2n is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857`, which matches the given 14.28%.\n*   So, Z is a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Mixture Y and Identify Z**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are either saturated (alkanes/cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n*   Z is a constituent of Y. Let's assume C = Z. So, C is a cycloalkane.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z.\n    *   `Hydrogenation(C) -> Z`: Since C=Z and Z is a saturated cycloalkane, it does not react. This is consistent.\n    *   `Hydrogenation(D) -> Z`: D must be converted to Z. Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it's not a typical alkene or alkyne. The two main possibilities are:\n        1.  D is a saturated isomer of Z (e.g., methylcyclopentane if Z is cyclohexane). These can isomerize to the more stable Z under severe hydrogenation conditions.\n        2.  D is an aromatic compound that hydrogenates to Z (e.g., benzene hydrogenates to cyclohexane). Benzene does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation. This is a type of redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In hydrocarbon chemistry, this often involves the transfer of hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction**\n\n*   Mixture X (equimolar A + B) is converted to Mixture Y (equimolar C + D).\n*   The simplest stoichiometric representation of this is: `A + B -> C + D`.\n*   Let's consider the two possibilities for D identified in Step 2, assuming the most common cycloalkane solvent, cyclohexane (C6H12), as Z.\n    *   **Case 1**: Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12), and D is a saturated isomer, also C6H12.\n        The reaction would be `A + B -> C6H12 + C6H12`.\n        By conservation of hydrogen atoms, if A is C6Hx and B is C6Hy, then `x + y = 12 + 12 = 24`.\n        However, A and B are components of mixture X, which decolorizes bromine water, so they must be unsaturated. They also hydrogenate to form Z (cyclohexane), so they must be C6 compounds. The most hydrogen-rich unsaturated C6 cyclic compound is cyclohexene (C6H10). If both A and B were cyclohexene (which is not possible as they are different liquids), the total hydrogen count would be 10 + 10 = 20. For any other pair of different unsaturated C6 cyclic compounds, the sum will be less than 20. Therefore, `x + y = 24` is impossible. This case is ruled out.\n    *   **Case 2**: Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12), and D is its aromatic counterpart, Benzene (C6H6).\n        This fits the properties of Y: {cyclohexane, benzene} is a mixture of two liquids that do not decolorize bromine water, and upon severe hydrogenation, both yield cyclohexane. Z (cyclohexane) is a component.\n        The reaction is `A + B -> C6H12 + C6H6`.\n        By conservation of hydrogen atoms, `x + y = 12 + 6 = 18`. This is a plausible outcome.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   We need to find two different liquids, A (C6Hx) and B (C6Hy), that satisfy the following conditions:\n    1.  `x + y = 18`.\n    2.  Both A and B are unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water). This means x < 12 and y < 12.\n    3.  Hydrogenation of both A and B yields cyclohexane (Z). This implies they have a six-membered carbon ring skeleton.\n    4.  There are no conjugated multiple bonds in A or B.\n*   Let's list the possible non-conjugated unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons:\n    *   Cyclohexene (C6H10). Here, x = 10.\n    *   Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8). Here, x = 8. (Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is conjugated and thus excluded).\n*   Let's see if we can form a pair from these that sums to 18.\n    *   If we choose A = Cyclohexene (C6H10), then `10 + y = 18`, which gives `y = 8`.\n    *   This means B must be C6H8. The non-conjugated option is Cyclohexa-1,4-diene.\n*   So, the mixture X consists of A = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8). This pair fits all the conditions of the problem. The disproportionation reaction is a hydrogen transfer from the diene to the alkene: `C6H8 + C6H10 -> C6H6 + C6H12`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of liquid A and one molecule of liquid B.\n*   Number of H atoms in A (Cyclohexene, C6H10) = 10.\n*   Number of H atoms in B (Cyclohexa-1,4-diene, C6H8) = 8.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze and identify the hydrocarbon Z.**\nThe problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let the general formula of the hydrocarbon be CnHm. The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as:\nMass % H = (Total mass of H) / (Total molar mass of compound) * 100%\nMass % H = (m × Ar(H)) / (n × Ar(C) + m × Ar(H)) * 100%\n\nUsing the approximate atomic masses Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12, we can set up the equation. The value 14.28% is a well-known fraction: 14.28% ≈ 100/7 % = 1/7.\nSo, we can write:\nm / (12n + m) = 1/7\n7m = 12n + m\n6m = 12n\nm = 2n\n\nThis gives the general formula for Z as CnH2n. The problem also states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze mixture Y and the disproportionation reaction.**\nMixture Y is formed by heating mixture X with platinum, which causes a disproportionation. Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic. We also know that Z is one of the components of Y.\nSo, one component of Y is a cycloalkane (Z, with formula CnH2n). For the mixture to not decolorize bromine water, the other component must also be saturated or aromatic.\n\nThe reaction type (heating with a platinum catalyst leading to disproportionation) is characteristic of catalytic hydrogen transfer, often called Zelinsky irreversible catalysis. In this reaction, an unsaturated cyclic compound is converted into a mixture of a fully saturated cycloalkane and an aromatic compound.\nTherefore, mixture Y consists of a cycloalkane (Z) and an aromatic compound.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the specific structures of the compounds in Y.**\nThe problem states that hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z.\nLet Y = {Z, Aromatic Compound}.\nHydrogenation of Z (which is already a saturated cycloalkane) will just yield Z.\nTherefore, hydrogenation of the aromatic compound must also yield Z. This is a crucial clue: the aromatic compound and the cycloalkane Z must have the same carbon skeleton.\n\nLet's test possible ring sizes:\n*   **If the ring size is 6:** Z would be cyclohexane (C6H12). The corresponding aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton is benzene (C6H6). Hydrogenation of benzene does indeed produce cyclohexane. This is a consistent scenario. Also, cyclohexane is widely used as a solvent, matching the description of Z.\n*   **If the ring size is 7:** Z would be cycloheptane (C7H14). The corresponding aromatic compound would be toluene (C7H8). Hydrogenation of toluene yields methylcyclohexane, not cycloheptane. Their carbon skeletons are different (a 6-membered ring with a methyl group vs. a 7-membered ring). This scenario is incorrect.\n*   **If the ring size is 8:** Z would be cyclooctane (C8H16). The corresponding aromatic compounds (e.g., ethylbenzene, xylenes) would hydrogenate to ethylcyclohexane or dimethylcyclohexanes, not cyclooctane. This is also incorrect.\n\nThe only plausible case is the 6-carbon system.\nThus, we can identify:\n*   **Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12)**\n*   **Mixture Y = An equimolar mixture of Cyclohexane and Benzene (C6H6)**\n\n**Step 4: Identify the components of mixture X.**\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (A and B) that reacts to form Y.\n*   **Reaction:** A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)\n*   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one molecule is reduced (accepts hydrogen) and the other is oxidized (donates hydrogen).\n*   **Properties of X:**\n    1.  It decolorizes bromine water, so A and B are unsaturated.\n    2.  Hydrogenation of both A and B gives cyclohexane, so they must both be C6 cyclic compounds.\n    3.  There are no conjugated multiple bonds in A or B.\n\nLet's consider possible unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons:\n*   **Cyclohexene (C6H10):** Has one double bond (non-conjugated). It can be reduced to cyclohexane. This is a candidate.\n*   **Cyclohexadienes (C6H8):**\n    *   1,3-Cyclohexadiene: Has conjugated double bonds, so it is excluded by the problem statement.\n    *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene: Has isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds. It can be reduced to cyclohexane and oxidized to benzene. This is a candidate.\n\nLet's propose that mixture X consists of cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n*   Let A = Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n*   Let B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)\n\nThe disproportionation reaction would be:\nC6H10 (hydrogen acceptor) + C6H8 (hydrogen donor) → C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\nThis reaction is balanced and fits all the conditions described in the problem.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final answer.**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in Cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) = 8\n\nTotal number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   Let the formula of Z be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by (mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * 1.008) / (x * 12.01 + y * 1.008).\n*   The value 14.28% is a very close approximation of 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). This implies that for every 1 unit of mass from hydrogen, there are 6 units of mass from carbon.\n*   The mass ratio of Carbon to Hydrogen is approximately 6:1.\n*   The atomic mass ratio of Carbon to Hydrogen is approximately 12:1.\n*   To find the atom ratio (y/x), we can set up the equation: (12 * x) / (1 * y) = 6 / 1, which simplifies to y/x = 12/6 = 2.\n*   Therefore, the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and its general molecular formula is CnH2n.\n*   This general formula corresponds to either an alkene (with one double bond) or a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem states that \"Z does not react further with hydrogen\". This means Z is a saturated compound, as an alkene would react with hydrogen (hydrogenation). Thus, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent\". Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclohexane (C6H12) and methylcyclohexane (C7H14), both of which fit the CnH2n formula.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, which we can call Y1 and Y2.\n*   Mixture Y \"does not decolorize bromine water\", which means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's assume Y1 = Z. So, Y1 is a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n*   \"Hydrogenation of ... mixture Y ... gives only one substance, ... Z\".\n*   Since Y1 is already Z (a saturated cycloalkane), it will not react with hydrogen. Therefore, the hydrogenation of Y2 must produce Z.\n*   Y2 does not decolorize bromine water, but it can be hydrogenated to the cycloalkane Z. This is characteristic of an aromatic compound that has the same carbon skeleton as Z. Aromatic compounds are resistant to reaction with bromine water but can be hydrogenated to the corresponding cycloalkane under severe conditions (high pressure and/or temperature).\n*   So, mixture Y consists of a cycloalkane (Z) and its corresponding aromatic hydrocarbon.\n    *   **Scenario A (C6 system):** If Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), then Y2 must be benzene (C6H6). Mixture Y = {cyclohexane, benzene}.\n    *   **Scenario B (C7 system):** If Z is methylcyclohexane (C7H14), then Y2 must be toluene (C7H8). Mixture Y = {methylcyclohexane, toluene}.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n*   Mixture X \"decolorizes bromine water\", meaning X1 and X2 are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n*   \"Hydrogenation of ... mixture X ... gives only one substance, ... Z\". This tells us that both X1 and X2 have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n*   The reaction X → Y is a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst. In this context, it is a hydrogen transfer reaction. Since X and Y are both equimolar mixtures, the reaction can be written as:\n    X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2\n*   Let's analyze the hydrogen balance for our two scenarios.\n    *   **Scenario A (C6 system):** The products are cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6). The reactants, X1 and X2, must both be C6 cyclic compounds. The total number of hydrogen atoms in the products is 12 + 6 = 18. By conservation of mass, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (one molecule of X1 and one of X2) must also be 18.\n    *   **Scenario B (C7 system):** The products are methylcyclohexane (C7H14) and toluene (C7H8). The total number of hydrogen atoms is 14 + 8 = 22.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   Let's focus on the more common and fundamental **Scenario A (C6 system)**.\n*   We need to find two unsaturated C6 cyclic compounds, X1 and X2, whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18.\n*   Possible unsaturated C6 cyclic compounds include cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadienes (C6H8).\n*   If we choose X1 = cyclohexene (C6H10) and X2 = a cyclohexadiene (C6H8), the total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our requirement.\n*   The problem adds a crucial constraint: \"There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X\".\n    *   Cyclohexene (C6H10) has only one double bond, so it is not conjugated.\n    *   There are two common cyclohexadienes: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated).\n    *   To satisfy the condition, X2 must be 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   So, mixture X is {cyclohexene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene}.\n*   The disproportionation reaction is:\n    C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\n    This is a plausible hydrogen transfer reaction where the diene is dehydrogenated to benzene, and the released hydrogen atoms hydrogenate the cyclohexene to cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 5: Final Calculation**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene (C6H10) and one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D. While the C7 scenario is also theoretically possible (leading to 22 hydrogen atoms, option B), the C6 system involving cyclohexane and benzene is a classic and fundamental example in organic chemistry, making it the most probable intended answer for this type of problem.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n### 1. Identifying Hydrocarbon Z\n\n*   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon is given by the formula: `(mass of H) / (total mass)`. Using the atomic masses of Carbon (≈12 g/mol) and Hydrogen (≈1 g/mol), we can test the general formulas for hydrocarbons.\n    *   For an alkane (CnH2n+2): Mass % H = `(2n + 2) / (14n + 2)`. This equation does not yield an integer `n` for 14.28%.\n    *   For a cycloalkane (CnH2n): Mass % H = `(2n) / (14n)` = `2 / 14` = `1 / 7` ≈ 0.142857.\n*   This matches the given value of 14.28%. Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n.\n*   We are also told that Z is widely used as a solvent and is the sole product of the hydrogenation of all other compounds. This points to a very stable and common cycloalkane. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a prime candidate, as it is a widely used solvent and is the most stable six-carbon cycloalkane. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n### 2. Identifying the Components of Mixture Y\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates the components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y yields only Z. Let the components of Y be Z and another substance, D.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Z (cyclohexane) gives cyclohexane.\n    *   Hydrogenation of D must also yield cyclohexane.\n*   Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it could be a saturated isomer of cyclohexane (like methylcyclopentane) or an aromatic compound. Benzene (C6H6) does not react with bromine water without a catalyst and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n*   The formation of Y is described as a disproportionation. A classic example of a disproportionation reaction involving cyclic compounds is the conversion of a cycloalkene or cycloalkadiene into a cycloalkane and an aromatic compound. For instance, cyclohexene can disproportionate to form cyclohexane and benzene. This strongly suggests that the other component (D) is benzene (C6H6).\n*   So, Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}. This mixture is equimolar and its components fit the description.\n\n### 3. Identifying the Components of Mixture X and Solving the Question\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n*   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n*   The molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   The reaction from X to Y is: `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`.\n*   This reaction is a catalytic hydrogen transfer (a form of disproportionation), where one molecule is hydrogenated and the other is dehydrogenated. The total number of atoms of each element must be conserved.\n*   Let's balance the hydrogen atoms:\n    *   Total H atoms in products (Mixture Y) = H atoms in Cyclohexane + H atoms in Benzene\n    *   Total H atoms in Y = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (Mixture X) must also be 18.\n    *   Total H atoms in X = H atoms in molecule A + H atoms in molecule B = 18.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Based on the conservation of atoms in the reaction, this number is 18.\n\nTo confirm this is a plausible scenario, we can identify potential structures for A and B:\n*   Hydrogenation of both A and B must yield only cyclohexane (Z). This implies A and B are C6 cyclic compounds.\n*   A and B are unsaturated and non-conjugated.\n*   The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 18.\n*   A likely pair is **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n    *   Total hydrogens = 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated C6 rings.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated.\n    *   The reaction would be: C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) → C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene). In this reaction, the diene donates hydrogen to the alkene, a chemically sound process under catalytic conditions.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance Z**\nSubstance Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. The general formula for a hydrocarbon is CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `(y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008)`. Using the approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12), this simplifies to `y / (12x + y)`.\nSetting this equal to 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7:\n`y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n`7y = 12x + y`\n`6y = 12x`\n`y = 2x`\nThis corresponds to the general formula CnH2n, which is characteristic of cycloalkanes or alkenes. Since Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen, it must be a saturated compound, which rules out alkenes. Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane. The problem states that Z is widely used as a solvent. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common cycloalkane solvent. For C6H12, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `12 / (6*12 + 12) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%`. This confirms that Z is very likely cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Mixture Y**\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic. One of the components of Y is Z (cyclohexane, C6H12). Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that the other component of Y must also convert to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. A very common compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane is benzene (C6H6). Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions because doing so would disrupt its stable aromatic system. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction from X to Y**\nMixture X, an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them X1 and X2), is heated with platinum to form mixture Y. This is described as a disproportionation reaction. In this context, it is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one component is hydrogenated and the other is dehydrogenated.\nThe overall reaction is:\n`X1 + X2 → C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)`\nSince the starting mixture X and the resulting mixture Y are both equimolar, the stoichiometry is 1:1 for all components.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Mixture X and Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\nLet the molecular formula of X1 be C6Ha and X2 be C6Hb. The carbon skeleton must be C6 because hydrogenation of both components yields cyclohexane.\nFrom the balanced reaction in Step 3, we can balance the hydrogen atoms:\n`a + b = 12 + 6`\n`a + b = 18`\nThis means the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2 is 18.\n\nTo verify this, we can identify plausible structures for X1 and X2:\n*   They must decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n*   They must not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Hydrogenation of each must yield cyclohexane.\n\nA logical choice for X1 and X2 that fits these criteria is cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   **Cyclohexene (C6H10):** Has one double bond, so it decolorizes bromine water. It is not conjugated. Hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.\n*   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8):** Has two double bonds which are isolated (not conjugated), so it decolorizes bromine water. Hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.\n\nThe sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. The reaction would be a hydrogen transfer where 1,4-cyclohexadiene is dehydrogenated to benzene, and cyclohexene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane. This type of disproportionation is known to occur over platinum catalysts.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\nTotal H atoms = (H in X1) + (H in X2) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, meaning it contains only carbon (C) and hydrogen (H).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%. The mass fraction of carbon is therefore 100% - 14.28% = 85.72%.\n    *   To find the empirical formula, we can divide the mass percentages by the atomic masses (C ≈ 12, H ≈ 1):\n        *   For H: 14.28 / 1 = 14.28\n        *   For C: 85.72 / 12 = 7.14\n    *   The ratio of H to C atoms is 14.28 / 7.14 ≈ 2. So, the empirical formula is CH₂.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. The general formula for a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon (alkane) is CₙH₂ₙ₊₂, which does not fit the CH₂ ratio. However, the general formula for a saturated cyclic hydrocarbon (cycloalkane) is CₙH₂ₙ, which perfectly matches the empirical formula.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent that fits the formula CₙH₂ₙ is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. Let's verify the hydrogen mass fraction for cyclohexane: (12 * 1.008) / (6 * 12.011 + 12 * 1.008) ≈ 14.37%, which is very close to the given value. Thus, Z is cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hydrogenation Reactions:**\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of *both* mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions yields *only* substance Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   This is a crucial clue. It means that all chemical compounds present in both mixtures X and Y must have a six-carbon ring skeleton. Upon the addition of hydrogen, they all convert to cyclohexane.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar (1:1 molar ratio) mixture of two liquids.\n    *   Y is formed from X by a disproportionation reaction when heated with platinum. In this context, disproportionation involves a hydrogen transfer, where some molecules are hydrogenated (gain H) and others are dehydrogenated (lose H).\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, indicating its components are saturated or aromatic. Benzene, for instance, does not react with bromine water.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is one of the components of mixture Y.\n    *   Since Y is an equimolar mixture containing cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), the other component must be the product of dehydrogenation. The ultimate dehydrogenation product of a six-carbon ring is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n    *   So, Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), Benzene (C₆H₆)}. This mixture fits the description: it's equimolar, its components have a C₆ skeleton, and it doesn't decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of this mixture (cyclohexane stays the same, benzene becomes cyclohexane) yields only cyclohexane (Z).\n\n4.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   The reaction is a hydrogen transfer: A + B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   By conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (A + B) must equal the total in the products: 12 + 6 = 18 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B must be unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   The molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Both A and B must be based on a six-carbon ring, as they hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n    *   Let's consider the possible unsaturated, non-conjugated C₆-ring compounds:\n        *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**: Has one double bond (non-conjugated).\n        *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**: Has two non-conjugated double bonds. (1,3-Cyclohexadiene is excluded because its double bonds are conjugated).\n    *   Let's see if an equimolar mixture of these two fits the reaction. Let A = Cyclohexene and B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene.\n        *   The reaction would be: C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆\n        *   This is a perfectly balanced reaction. The 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) is dehydrogenated to benzene (C₆H₆), and the cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) is hydrogenated to cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). This type of catalytic hydrogen transfer is a known process.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   Mixture X consists of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   Number of H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene = 10.\n    *   Number of H atoms in one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene = 8.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let's determine its empirical formula.\n    *   Mass % of H = 14.28%, so Mass % of C = 100% - 14.28% = 85.72%.\n    *   Assuming 100 g of the substance, we have 14.28 g of H and 85.72 g of C.\n    *   Moles of H = 14.28 g / 1.008 g/mol ≈ 14.17 mol.\n    *   Moles of C = 85.72 g / 12.01 g/mol ≈ 7.14 mol.\n    *   The ratio of H atoms to C atoms is approximately 14.17 / 7.14 ≈ 2.\n    *   So, the empirical formula of Z is CH₂.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated compound. A hydrocarbon with the general formula CnH2n that is saturated must be a cycloalkane. The value 14.28% is exactly 1/7 * 100%, which corresponds to the formula CnH2n if we use approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1): %H = (2n * 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7.\n    *   Hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y gives *only* Z. This implies that all components of X and Y have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   Z is also a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Let's assume Z is cyclohexane for now. This would mean n=6.\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of them is Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂). Let's call the other one Y₂.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means Y₂ is saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means hydrogenation of Y₂ must also produce cyclohexane.\n    *   The most logical candidate for Y₂ is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is a liquid, does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions, and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane (C₆H₆ + 3H₂ → C₆H₁₂).\n    *   So, mixture Y consists of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆). This fits the description of an equimolar mixture of two liquids that doesn't decolorize bromine water and hydrogenates to a single product.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction X → Y:**\n    *   An equimolar mixture X is converted to an equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction.\n    *   This means the reaction stoichiometry is 1:1 → 1:1. Let the two components of X be X₁ and X₂.\n    *   The reaction is: X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X is oxidized (loses hydrogen) to form benzene, and the other component is reduced (gains hydrogen) to form cyclohexane.\n    *   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms must be the same on both sides of the equation.\n    *   Total C atoms in products = C from C₆H₁₂ + C from C₆H₆ = 6 + 6 = 12. So, X₁ and X₂ must each have 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   Total H atoms in products = H from C₆H₁₂ + H from C₆H₆ = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X₁ and one molecule of X₂ must be 18.\n\n4.  **Calculate the final answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   Based on our analysis, this sum is exactly the total number of hydrogen atoms in the product molecules, which is 18.\n\n5.  **Verify the properties of Mixture X (optional but good for confirmation):**\n    *   X₁ and X₂ must be C₆ compounds.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.\n    *   Both must decolorize bromine water (i.e., be unsaturated).\n    *   Hydrogenation of both must yield cyclohexane.\n    *   They must not have conjugated double bonds.\n    *   A combination that fits all these criteria is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n        *   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n        *   Both are unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds.\n        *   1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated.\n        *   The reaction C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆ is a balanced hydrogen transfer.\n    *   This confirms our conclusion.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z\n\n1.  **Composition**: Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This means the mass fraction of carbon is 100% - 14.28% = 85.72%.\n2.  **Empirical Formula**: To find the empirical formula, we can assume a 100g sample. This gives us 14.28 g of Hydrogen (H) and 85.72 g of Carbon (C).\n    *   Moles of H = 14.28 g / 1.008 g/mol ≈ 14.17 mol\n    *   Moles of C = 85.72 g / 12.011 g/mol ≈ 7.14 mol\n    *   The simplest whole-number ratio of moles is C : H = 7.14 : 14.17 ≈ 1 : 2.\n    *   Therefore, the empirical formula of Z is CH₂.\n3.  **Molecular Formula**: Z is described as a saturated hydrocarbon that doesn't react further with hydrogen. A saturated acyclic hydrocarbon (alkane) has the formula CₙH₂ₙ₊₂, while a saturated cyclic hydrocarbon (cycloalkane) has the formula CₙH₂ₙ. The empirical formula CH₂ corresponds to the general formula CₙH₂ₙ. Thus, Z is a cycloalkane.\n4.  **Identification**: The problem states that hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. Mixture Y contains Z and another substance. This second substance in Y must hydrogenate to Z. Furthermore, mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, which suggests its components are either saturated or aromatic. Since Z is saturated, the other component must be aromatic to be able to undergo hydrogenation under severe conditions. The hydrogenation of an aromatic compound like benzene (C₆H₆) produces a cycloalkane, cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n5.  **Confirmation**: Let's check if Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The molecular formula C₆H₁₂ fits the empirical formula CH₂ (n=6). The mass fraction of hydrogen in cyclohexane is (12 × 1.008) / (6 × 12.011 + 12 × 1.008) ≈ 14.37%, which is very close to the given 14.28%. Cyclohexane is also widely used as a solvent. Thus, we can confidently identify Z as **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n\n1.  **Composition**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water.\n2.  **Components**: We've established that one component is Z, which is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must hydrogenate to cyclohexane under severe conditions and not react with bromine water. This strongly points to **benzene (C₆H₆)**, which is aromatic and hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n3.  **Conclusion for Y**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X\n\n1.  **Reaction**: Mixture X, when heated with platinum, undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y. This means some molecules in X are reduced (gain hydrogen) while others are oxidized (lose hydrogen).\n    *   A + B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)\n2.  **Properties of X**: Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B. It decolorizes bromine water, indicating that A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds). The problem also states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of X.\n3.  **Structure**: Since hydrogenation of mixture X yields only cyclohexane, both A and B must be C₆ hydrocarbons with a six-membered ring structure.\n4.  **Reaction Stoichiometry**: The reaction is a hydrogen transfer. Since the products (cyclohexane and benzene) are formed in an equimolar ratio, the reactants (A and B) must react in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n    *   A (C₆Hₓ) + B (C₆Hᵧ) → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆\n    *   By balancing the hydrogen atoms: x + y = 12 + 6 = 18.\n5.  **Identifying A and B**: We need two unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds without conjugated bonds whose hydrogen counts sum to 18.\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**: Contains one double bond and thus decolorizes bromine water. It has no conjugated bonds.\n    *   **Cyclohexadienes (C₆H₈)**: There are two main isomers: cyclohexa-1,3-diene and cyclohexa-1,4-diene. Cyclohexa-1,3-diene has conjugated double bonds, so it is ruled out. **Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈)** has two isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds and will decolorize bromine water.\n6.  **Confirmation of Reaction**: Let's test if a mixture of cyclohexene and cyclohexa-1,4-diene fits the description.\n    *   In the disproportionation reaction, cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈) is oxidized to benzene (C₆H₆), losing 2 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Simultaneously, cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) is reduced to cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), gaining 2 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   C₆H₈ + C₆H₁₀ → C₆H₆ + C₆H₁₂. This is a known hydrogen transfer reaction.\n    *   The hydrogen atoms sum up: 8 + 10 = 18. This is consistent.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms\n\nThe two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈).\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each liquid is:\n*   Hydrogen atoms in cyclohexene = 10\n*   Hydrogen atoms in cyclohexa-1,4-diene = 8\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is my step-by-step thinking process to solve this chemistry puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z:** The most crucial piece of information is the mass fraction of hydrogen (14.28%) in hydrocarbon Z. Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it doesn't react further with hydrogen) formed by hydrogenating X and Y. Saturated hydrocarbons are either alkanes (CₙH₂ₙ₊₂) or cycloalkanes (CₙH₂ₙ).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as (Total Mass of H) / (Total Molar Mass).\n    *   Let's test the general formula for cycloalkanes, CₙH₂ₙ. Using atomic masses C=12 and H=1:\n        Mass % H = (2n * 1) / (n * 12 + 2n * 1) = 2n / 14n = 2 / 14 = 1/7.\n    *   Converting 1/7 to a decimal gives approximately 0.142857, which is a perfect match for the given 14.28%.\n    *   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane. Since it's a common solvent, the most likely candidate is **Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water (meaning they are saturated or aromatic).\n    *   Z (Cyclohexane) is a component of Y.\n    *   Hydrogenating mixture Y gives only Z (Cyclohexane).\n    *   This means the other component of Y must also produce Cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. Since it doesn't decolorize bromine water, it's not a typical alkene. The only common C₆ compound that fits this description is **Benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic and does not decolorize Br₂ water under normal conditions, but it can be hydrogenated under severe conditions to form Cyclohexane.\n    *   So, Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), Benzene (C₆H₆)}.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water (meaning they are unsaturated) and has no conjugated double bonds.\n    *   The reaction X -> Y is a disproportionation, which is a redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In this context, it's a hydrogen transfer reaction catalyzed by platinum.\n    *   The overall reaction conserves atoms. The two molecules in mixture X react to form the two molecules in mixture Y.\n        X₁ + X₂ → Y₁ + Y₂\n    *   Since all compounds are based on a C₆ skeleton, we can write the reaction in terms of their formulas:\n        C₆Hₐ + C₆Hₓ → C₆H₁₂ (Cyclohexane) + C₆H₆ (Benzene)\n    *   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms must be the same on both sides of the equation.\n    *   Total H atoms in products = 12 (from Cyclohexane) + 6 (from Benzene) = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be 18 (i.e., a + x = 18).\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:** The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Based on the conservation of atoms during the reaction, this total must be 18. This corresponds to option C.\n\nLet's confirm the identity of the liquids in X. They must be C₆Hₐ and C₆Hₓ where a+x=18, both must be unsaturated, and have no conjugated bonds. The most plausible candidates are **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   10 + 8 = 18.\n*   Both are unsaturated (will decolorize Br₂ water).\n*   1,4-Cyclohexadiene has non-conjugated double bonds. Cyclohexene has one double bond.\n*   In the reaction, the diene (C₆H₈) is oxidized to benzene (C₆H₆) by losing 2H, and the cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) is reduced to cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) by gaining 2H. This fits the description of a disproportionation (hydrogen transfer).\n\nThe core logic relies on the conservation of atoms. The code below will calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms in the product mixture Y, which must be equal to the total in the reactant mixture X.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the chemistry puzzle by following a logical deduction process.\n    1.

The general formula is CnH2n.\nThe problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen) and is a widely used solvent. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the properties of mixture Y.**\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. Let's call them C and D.\nMixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This implies its components are saturated (contain no C=C or C≡C bonds).\nOne component of Y is the hydrocarbon Z. So, let C = Z = CnH2n (a cycloalkane).\nHydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z. This means hydrogenation of C gives Z (which is trivial as C=Z), and hydrogenation of D also gives Z.\nSo, D must be a compound that can be converted to Z by adding hydrogen. However, Y (and thus D) is stated to be saturated. This seems like a contradiction.\nLet's reconsider the meaning of \"does not decolorize bromine water\". While this test is primarily for alkenes/alkynes, aromatic compounds like benzene also do not react with bromine water under normal conditions. Let's hypothesize that one component of Y is aromatic.\nLet's assume D is an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton as Z. The general formula for a simple mononuclear aromatic hydrocarbon is CnH2n-6 (e.g., benzene C6H6, where n=6, 2n-6 = 12-6 = 6).\nHydrogenation of an aromatic ring (like D) under severe conditions yields the corresponding cycloalkane (Z). For example, C6H6 (benzene) + 3H2 → C6H12 (cyclohexane). This fits the description perfectly.\nSo, Y is an equimolar mixture of a cycloalkane Z (CnH2n) and an aromatic hydrocarbon D (CnH2n-6).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the properties of mixture X and the reaction.**\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\nX decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and/or B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\nHydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z. This implies that both A and B have the same n-carbon skeleton as Z, and both are converted to Z upon complete hydrogenation.\nThe reaction is the disproportionation of mixture X to form mixture Y. Since both are equimolar mixtures, the simplest stoichiometry is A + B → C + D.\nSubstituting the formulas we deduced:\nA(CnHx) + B(CnH_y) → Z(CnH2n) + D(CnH2n-6)\n\n**Step 4: Perform a hydrogen atom balance and solve for n.**\nThe total number of atoms must be conserved in the reaction. Let's balance the hydrogen atoms:\nNumber of H in reactants = Number of H in products\nx + y = (2n) + (2n - 6)\nx + y = 4n - 6\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is exactly x + y.\nSo, Total H atoms = 4n - 6.\n\nWe need to find the value of n. We know that Z (CnH2n) is a widely used solvent. The most common examples are cyclohexane (n=6) and methylcyclohexane (n=7). Let's test these values.\nIf n = 6:\n*   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12). D = Benzene (C6H6). Both are liquids and widely used.\n*   The total number of hydrogen atoms in X would be x + y = 4(6) - 6 = 24 - 6 = 18.\n*   This corresponds to option D.\n*   Let's check if we can find suitable compounds A and B for mixture X. A and B must be unsaturated C6 hydrocarbons that hydrogenate to cyclohexane and are not conjugated. For x+y=18, we can choose A = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Both fit the criteria. `10 + 8 = 18`.\n\nIf n = 7:\n*   Z = Methylcyclohexane (C7H14). D = Toluene (C7H8). Both are liquids and widely used.\n*   The total number of hydrogen atoms in X would be x + y = 4(7) - 6 = 28 - 6 = 22.\n*   This corresponds to option C.\n*   Let's check for A and B. We need non-conjugated unsaturated C7 hydrocarbons. For x+y=22, we could choose A = a methylcyclohexene isomer (C7H12) and B = a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene isomer (C7H10). This is also a plausible scenario. `12 + 10 = 22`.\n\nWe have two plausible solutions corresponding to two different options (18 and 22). However, such problems in chemistry contests usually have a unique intended answer. The disproportionation of C6 hydroaromatics to cyclohexane and benzene is a classic, archetypal reaction in catalysis. It is the simplest and most fundamental example that fits the problem's constraints. Therefore, it is most likely the intended scenario.\n\nAssuming n=6 is the intended case:\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is x + y = 18.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\n*   Identify Z as a cycloalkane CnH2n.\n*   Identify Y as {CnH2n, CnH2n-6} (a cycloalkane and an aromatic compound).\n*   Identify X as {CnHx, CnH_y} (two unsaturated precursors).\n*   Balance the reaction A + B -> Z + D to get x + y = 4n - 6.\n*   Based on common examples and the options, deduce n=6.\n*   Calculate the total hydrogen atoms: x + y = 4(6) - 6 = 18.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a formula CxHy.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%, which is equivalent to 0.1428.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen can be expressed as: `mass of H / total mass = (y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008)`. For simplicity, we can use integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1).\n*   `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`\n*   The fraction 14.28% is very close to 1/7 (`1/7 ≈ 0.142857`). Let's test this assumption.\n*   `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n*   `7y = 12x + y`\n*   `6y = 12x`\n*   `y = 2x`\n*   This means the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and its general molecular formula is (CH2)n or CnH2n.\n*   Z is a saturated hydrocarbon because it does not react further with hydrogen. The general formula for a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon (alkane) is CnH2n+2. The general formula for a saturated cyclic hydrocarbon (cycloalkane) is CnH2n.\n*   Since the formula of Z is CnH2n, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem states that Z is a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkanes used as solvents are cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   We can provisionally identify Z as one of these, and we will confirm this in the next steps.\n\n**Step 2: Relate All Compounds**\n\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z.\n*   This is a critical clue. It means that all four compounds (the two in mixture X and the two in mixture Y) have the same carbon skeleton. For example, if Z is cyclohexane, all other compounds must also be based on a six-carbon ring.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X. A disproportionation reaction in this context (heating with a Pt catalyst) typically involves hydrogen transfer, where one molecule is hydrogenated and another is dehydrogenated.\n*   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is Z, which we identified as a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n*   The other component of Y must be the product of dehydrogenation. To be unreactive towards bromine water, it must be an aromatic compound.\n*   Let's assume the most common case, a six-membered ring skeleton. This would make Z **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n*   The corresponding aromatic compound formed by dehydrogenation would be **benzene (C6H6)**.\n*   So, Mixture Y = {cyclohexane, benzene}.\n*   Let's check if this fits the criteria:\n    *   Equimolar mixture of two liquids: Yes, both are liquids at room temperature.\n    *   Does not decolorize bromine water: Yes, cyclohexane is saturated, and benzene only reacts with Br2 under specific catalytic conditions (not with bromine water).\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z: Hydrogenation of cyclohexane (C6H12) gives C6H12. Hydrogenation of benzene (C6H6) gives cyclohexane (C6H12). So, hydrogenating the mixture gives only cyclohexane (Z). This fits perfectly.\n\n**Step 4: Relate Mixture X to Mixture Y and Find the Answer**\n\n*   We have established:\n    *   Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}\n    *   Mixture X = {Liquid 1 (X1), Liquid 2 (X2)}\n*   Mixture X is converted to Mixture Y in an equimolar ratio via disproportionation (hydrogen transfer). The overall reaction can be represented as:\n    `X1 + X2 --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane + Benzene`\n*   According to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction. We are interested in the hydrogen atoms.\n*   Total number of H atoms in the products = (H atoms in one molecule of Cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of Benzene)\n*   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2) must also be 18.\n\n**Step 5: (Optional) Verify the Identities of Liquids in Mixture X**\n\n*   We need two C6 compounds (X1 and X2) that:\n    1.  Have a total of 18 hydrogen atoms.\n    2.  Decolorize bromine water (i.e., are unsaturated).\n    3.  Do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    4.  Can react to form cyclohexane and benzene.\n*   Let's consider possible unsaturated C6 ring compounds:\n    *   Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n    *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) - This is non-conjugated.\n    *   1,3-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) - This is conjugated, so it's ruled out by the problem statement.\n*   Let's test the combination X = {Cyclohexene, 1,4-Cyclohexadiene}:\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 (from C6H10) + 8 (from C6H8) = 18. This works.\n    *   Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated. Cyclohexene has only one double bond, so no conjugation. This works.\n    *   The reaction `Cyclohexene (C6H10) + 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) -> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)` is a known hydrogen transfer reaction. The diene is oxidized to benzene, and the hexene is reduced to cyclohexane. This is perfectly consistent.\n\nThe logic is sound, and the calculation is confirmed. The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\n\nSubstance Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. It is a common solvent and is a saturated hydrocarbon, meaning it doesn't react further with hydrogen.\n\nThe mass percentage of hydrogen (H) in a hydrocarbon (composed of carbon C and hydrogen H) is given by:\nMass % H = (mass of H / total mass) * 100\n\nUsing the approximate atomic masses (C ≈ 12, H ≈ 1), 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\nIf the mass fraction of H is 1/7, the mass fraction of C is 6/7. The ratio of the number of atoms is (moles C) / (moles H) = (6/12) / (1/1) = 0.5, which gives an empirical formula of CH₂.\n\nA general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ, which matches the empirical formula CH₂. Let's verify the mass percentage for this class of compounds:\nMass % H = (2n * 1.008) / (n * 12.011 + 2n * 1.008) = 2.016 / 14.027 ≈ 14.37%\nUsing integer masses: Mass % H = (2n * 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%.\n\nThis confirms that Z is a cycloalkane. A widely used cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits all the descriptions for substance Z.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, indicating the components are saturated or aromatic. One component is Z, which is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n\nHydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only cyclohexane.\n*   Hydrogenating cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) gives cyclohexane.\n*   The other component of Y must also produce cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. Since it does not decolorize bromine water, it must be an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton. The only possibility is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n\nTherefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction from Mixture X to Mixture Y\n\nMixture X, an equimolar blend of two liquids (let's call them X₁ and X₂), undergoes a disproportionation reaction when heated with platinum to form mixture Y.\n\nReaction: X₁ + X₂ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆ (equimolar products from equimolar reactants)\n\nThis is a hydrogen transfer reaction where the total number of atoms must be conserved.\n*   Total carbon atoms in products = 6 (from cyclohexane) + 6 (from benzene) = 12\n*   Total hydrogen atoms in products = 12 (from cyclohexane) + 6 (from benzene) = 18\n\nSo, one molecule of X₁ and one molecule of X₂ together must contain 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the Components of Mixture X\n\nThe components of mixture X have the following properties:\n*   They are two different liquids.\n*   Hydrogenation of both X₁ and X₂ gives only cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), which means they are both C₆ hydrocarbons with a six-membered ring structure.\n*   They decolorize bromine water, indicating they are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n*   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in their molecules.\n\nLet the formulas be C₆Hₐ for X₁ and C₆Hₑ for X₂. From Step 3, we know that **a + b = 18**.\n\nLet's consider possible non-conjugated, unsaturated six-membered ring C₆ hydrocarbons:\n*   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**: Contains one double bond, so it is not conjugated.\n*   **Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈)**: Contains two double bonds separated by two single bonds, so they are not conjugated.\n*   *Cyclohexa-1,3-diene* (C₆H₈) is excluded because its double bonds are conjugated.\n\nLet's test the pair cyclohexene and cyclohexa-1,4-diene:\n*   X₁ = Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) → a = 10\n*   X₂ = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈) → b = 8\n\nThe sum of hydrogen atoms is a + b = 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our requirement from the reaction stoichiometry. All other conditions are also satisfied by this pair.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n\n*   Hydrogen atoms in X₁ (cyclohexene, C₆H₁₀) = 10\n*   Hydrogen atoms in X₂ (cyclohexa-1,4-diene, C₆H₈) = 8\n\nTotal hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   The mass percentage of hydrogen in a cycloalkane (general formula CnH2n) is:\n        Mass % H = (Total mass of H / Total mass of compound) * 100\n        Mass % H = (2n * AtomicMassH) / (n * AtomicMassC + 2n * AtomicMassH)\n        Using integer masses (H=1, C=12): Mass % H = (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7.\n    *   1/7 ≈ 0.142857, which corresponds to 14.28%.\n    *   The mass percentage of hydrogen for an alkane (CnH2n+2) does not yield this value.\n    *   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a constituent of mixture Y and is widely used as a solvent. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common cycloalkane solvent. Let's hypothesize that n=6 and Z is cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hydrogenation Reactions.**\n    *   Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions gives only substance Z (CnH2n).\n    *   This implies that all components of mixture X (let's call them A and B) and mixture Y (Z and another liquid, Z') have the same carbon skeleton, or skeletons that can be converted to Z's skeleton under the reaction conditions.\n    *   Let's assume the simplest case: all compounds (A, B, Z, Z') are based on a 6-carbon ring (n=6).\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture Y.**\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, Z and Z'.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components do not have C=C or C≡C bonds that readily react with bromine.\n    *   Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), which is saturated and does not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Z' must also not decolorize bromine water. A common substance that fits this description, besides saturated alkanes, is an aromatic compound like benzene (C6H6). Benzene does not react with bromine water under normal conditions.\n    *   Let's hypothesize that Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (Z) and benzene (Z').\n    *   Let's check if hydrogenating this mixture Y gives only Z. Hydrogenation of cyclohexane yields cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of benzene yields cyclohexane. So, hydrogenation of {cyclohexane, benzene} yields only cyclohexane. This hypothesis is consistent with the problem statement.\n\n4.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in A or B.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z (cyclohexane), so A and B must be unsaturated C6 hydrocarbons with a six-membered ring.\n    *   The reaction is: Mixture X (A + B) → Mixture Y (Cyclohexane + Benzene).\n    *   Since the mixtures are equimolar, the stoichiometry is A + B → C6H12 + C6H6.\n    *   This reaction is described as a disproportionation. In catalytic hydrocarbon chemistry, this often refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction. Let's see if this works. One molecule must be reduced (gain hydrogen) and one must be oxidized (lose hydrogen).\n        *   Reduction: A or B → C6H12 (gains H)\n        *   Oxidation: A or B → C6H6 (loses H)\n    *   The reaction conserves atoms. Let's check the hydrogen balance:\n        Total H in products = H(C6H12) + H(C6H6) = 12 + 6 = 18 atoms.\n        Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (A + B) must also be 18.\n\n5.  **Identify Liquids A and B.**\n    *   We need to find two non-conjugated, unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons, A and B, whose total hydrogen count is 18.\n    *   Let A be cyclohexene, C6H10. It is unsaturated and non-conjugated.\n    *   This means B must have 18 - 10 = 8 hydrogen atoms. The formula for B is C6H8.\n    *   A C6H8 cyclic hydrocarbon with no conjugated bonds would be 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n    *   So, let's propose Mixture X = {cyclohexene (C6H10), 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)}.\n    *   Let's check the disproportionation reaction:\n        C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C6H10 (cyclohexene) → C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane)\n    *   In this reaction, 1,4-cyclohexadiene is oxidized to benzene by losing 2 hydrogen atoms. Cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane by gaining 2 hydrogen atoms. This is a valid hydrogen transfer (disproportionation) reaction.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion.**\n    *   All conditions of the problem are met with this model:\n        *   X = {Cyclohexene (C6H10), 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)}\n        *   Y = {Benzene (C6H6), Cyclohexane (C6H12)}\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12)\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in Cyclohexene) + (H atoms in 1,4-Cyclohexadiene) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   The general formula for a saturated hydrocarbon is either CnH2n+2 (alkane) or CnH2n (cycloalkane).\n    *   Let's check the mass percentage of hydrogen for a cycloalkane (CnH2n). The molar mass is approximately 12n + 2n = 14n. The mass of hydrogen is 2n.\n    *   Mass % H = (2n / 14n) * 100% = (1/7) * 100% ≈ 14.286%. This matches the given value.\n    *   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n. The information that Z does not react further with hydrogen confirms it is saturated.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclohexane (C6H12) and methylcyclohexane (C7H14).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction and Mixtures**\n    *   Mixture X contains two liquids that decolorize bromine water, indicating the presence of carbon-carbon double bonds (unsaturation). The molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Mixture Y is formed by treating X with platinum at high temperature. This reaction is called a disproportionation.\n    *   Mixture Y contains two liquids that do *not* decolorize bromine water. This means they are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z is a component of mixture Y. Since Z is a saturated cycloalkane (CnH2n), the other component of Y must be the \"oxidized\" product of the disproportionation. For it to not decolorize bromine water, it is most likely an aromatic compound.\n    *   The most plausible reaction is an intermolecular hydrogen transfer between an unsaturated cyclic compound (cycloalkene) and a more unsaturated one (cycloalkadiene) to produce a saturated cycloalkane and an aromatic compound.\n    *   The reaction scheme is: **Cycloalkene + Cycloalkadiene → Cycloalkane + Aromatic Compound**\n    *   Let's check the stoichiometry. If all compounds are based on the same C-number 'n':\n        CnH2n-2 (cycloalkene) + CnH2n-4 (cycloalkadiene) → CnH2n (cycloalkane) + CnH2n-6 (aromatic)\n        The total atoms on both sides are C2nH4n-6, so the reaction is balanced. Since the reactants are in a 1:1 ratio, the products (mixture Y) will be an equimolar mixture, as stated in the problem.\n\n3.  **Identify the Carbon Skeleton**\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only one* substance, Z.\n    *   Let's test the C6 system.\n        *   Assume Z is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. It is a widely used solvent.\n        *   Mixture Y would then be {**cyclohexane (C6H12)**, **benzene (C6H6)**}. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water. Z is a component of Y. This fits.\n        *   Mixture X would be {**cyclohexene (C6H10)**, **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**}. The 1,4-diene is non-conjugated. Both decolorize bromine water. This fits.\n        *   Let's check hydrogenation:\n            *   Hydrogenation of X = {C6H10, C6H8} yields only cyclohexane.\n            *   Hydrogenation of Y = {C6H12, C6H6} yields only cyclohexane (since benzene hydrogenates to cyclohexane).\n        *   This C6-based scenario fits all the conditions of the problem.\n\n4.  **Consider Other Possibilities**\n    *   Let's test the C7 system as a check.\n        *   Assume Z is **methylcyclohexane (C7H14)**. It is also a solvent.\n        *   Mixture Y would be {**methylcyclohexane (C7H14)**, **toluene (C7H8)**}. This fits.\n        *   Mixture X would be {**methylcyclohexene (C7H12)**, a non-conjugated **methylcyclohexadiene (C7H10)**}. This fits.\n        *   Hydrogenation of both X and Y in this case would lead to only methylcyclohexane.\n    *   Both the C6 and C7 systems seem chemically plausible. However, the C6 system (cyclohexane/benzene) is the most fundamental and common example of this type of chemistry. In the context of such problems, the simplest, unsubstituted ring system is typically the intended answer. Thus, we proceed with the C6 system.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   Based on our deduction, mixture X consists of two liquids:\n        1.  Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n        2.  Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (i.e., in one molecule of each).\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in C6H10) + (H atoms in C6H8) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a saturated hydrocarbon, meaning its general formula is CnH2n+2 (alkane) or CnH2n (cycloalkane).\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is given as 14.28%. This value is very close to 1/7. Let's verify this: 1/7 ≈ 0.142857.\n*   Let the molecular formula of Z be CnHm. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by:\n    Mass Fraction (H) = (m × AtomicMass(H)) / (n × AtomicMass(C) + m × AtomicMass(H))\n*   Using integer atomic masses (C≈12, H≈1), we have:\n    m / (12n + m) = 1/7\n    7m = 12n + m\n    6m = 12n\n    m = 2n\n*   This means the formula for Z is CnH2n. Since Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen), it must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   We need to find the specific cycloalkane. The problem states Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n*   Let's verify the mass fraction for cyclohexane (C6H12):\n    Mass of Hydrogen = 12 × 1.008 = 12.096\n    Mass of Carbon = 6 × 12.011 = 72.066\n    Total Molar Mass = 84.162 g/mol\n    Mass Fraction (H) = 12.096 / 84.162 ≈ 0.1437. Using integer masses: 12 / (6*12 + 12) = 12/84 = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857. This is a perfect match for 14.28%.\n*   Thus, **Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This implies the components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Hydrogenation of Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Let Y be a mixture of {Y1, Y2}. We know one component is Z, so let Y2 = Z = cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Hydrogenation of Y = {Y1, cyclohexane} gives only cyclohexane. Cyclohexane is already saturated, so it does not react. This means that hydrogenation of Y1 must produce cyclohexane.\n*   Y1 must have a C6 carbon skeleton.\n*   Y1 does not decolorize bromine water. An alkene or alkyne would, but an aromatic compound like benzene reacts very slowly with bromine water without a catalyst.\n*   The most plausible candidate for Y1 is **benzene (C6H6)**. Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane (C6H6 + 3H2 -> C6H12). Benzene is a liquid and does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions.\n*   Therefore, **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the reaction from X to Y and find the properties of Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them X1 and X2.\n*   The reaction is: Mixture X --(Pt, heat)--> Mixture Y. This is described as a disproportionation.\n*   Since the reactant (X) and product (Y) mixtures are both equimolar, the reaction stoichiometry must be 1:1 for the components.\n    1 molecule of X1 + 1 molecule of X2  →  1 molecule of C6H6 + 1 molecule of C6H12\n*   This reaction is a catalytic hydrogen transfer. One component of X is dehydrogenated to benzene, and the other is hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n*   According to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction.\n*   Let's focus on the hydrogen atoms:\n    Total H in reactants = Total H in products\n    Number of H in X1 + Number of H in X2 = Number of H in C6H6 + Number of H in C6H12\n    Number of H in X1 + Number of H in X2 = 6 + 12\n    Number of H in X1 + Number of H in X2 = 18\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of the number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each liquid component.\n*   From our analysis, this sum is 18.\n\n**Step 4: Consistency Check**\n\n*   Does this model fit all the given information?\n    *   **Hydrogenation of X**: Hydrogenation of both X1 and X2 must give only cyclohexane. This implies X1 and X2 must be C6 cyclic compounds. For example, if X = {cyclohexene (C6H10), 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)}, both hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n    *   **Bromine water test**: Mixture X decolorizes bromine water. Both cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene contain C=C double bonds and would decolorize bromine water.\n    *   **No conjugated bonds**: 1,4-cyclohexadiene has non-conjugated double bonds. Cyclohexene has only one double bond. This condition is satisfied.\n    *   **H atom count**: For our example X = {C6H10, C6H8}, the total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This is consistent with our calculation.\n\nThe logic is sound and all conditions of the problem are met. The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two liquids in mixture X is 18.\n\nFinal Answer Selection:\nThe calculated total number of hydrogen atoms is 18. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of Z be C_n H_m. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `(m * Ar(H)) / (n * Ar(C) + m * Ar(H))`. Using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1), this is `m / (12n + m)`.\n    *   `m / (12n + m) = 0.1428`\n    *   Solving for the ratio m/n:\n        `m = 0.1428 * (12n + m)`\n        `m = 1.7136n + 0.1428m`\n        `0.8572m = 1.7136n`\n        `m/n = 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2.0`\n    *   Alternatively, 14.28% is very close to 1/7 (1/7 ≈ 0.142857). If the mass fraction of H is 1/7, then `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`, which gives `7m = 12n + m`, so `6m = 12n`, and `m = 2n`.\n    *   So, the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and the general formula is C_n H_2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula C_n H_2n must be a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of them is Z (the cycloalkane, C_n H_2n). Let's call the other liquid Y2.\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means both components are saturated or aromatic. Z is saturated. Y2 must also be saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z.\n        *   Hydrogenation of Z (a saturated cycloalkane) gives Z itself.\n        *   Hydrogenation of Y2 must also give Z (C_n H_2n).\n    *   For Y2 to be hydrogenated to a cycloalkane C_n H_2n, it must be an unsaturated compound with the same carbon skeleton. The most plausible candidate for a non-bromine-decolorizing, hydrogenatable liquid is an aromatic compound. The corresponding aromatic compound would have the formula C_n H_(2n-6) (assuming a single benzene-type ring).\n    *   Therefore, Mixture Y consists of {C_n H_2n (a cycloalkane), C_n H_(2n-6) (an aromatic hydrocarbon)}.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction X → Y**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n    *   When heated with a platinum catalyst, X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form the equimolar mixture Y.\n    *   Reaction: `X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2` (in 1:1 molar ratio)\n    *   Substituting the formulas for Y: `X1 + X2 → C_n H_2n + C_n H_(2n-6)`\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X is hydrogenated, and the other is dehydrogenated. For the stoichiometry to be 1:1, the number of hydrogen atoms must be conserved between the reactant and product sides.\n    *   Let the formulas of the liquids in X be C_n H_a and C_n H_b.\n    *   Conservation of atoms implies: `C_n H_a + C_n H_b → C_n H_2n + C_n H_(2n-6)`\n    *   Summing the hydrogen atoms on both sides: `a + b = 2n + (2n - 6) = 4n - 6`.\n\n4.  **Identify Mixture X**\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two molecules of mixture X is `a + b = 4n - 6`.\n    *   The liquids in X decolorize bromine water, so they contain C=C double bonds. They must be cycloalkenes or cycloalkadienes, as they both hydrogenate to the cycloalkane Z (preserving the carbon ring structure).\n    *   The simplest way to construct this reaction is to have one molecule act as a hydrogen donor and the other as an acceptor. The most logical candidates are a cycloalkene (C_n H_(2n-2), having one double bond) and a cycloalkadiene (C_n H_(2n-4), having two double bonds).\n        *   Donor: `C_n H_(2n-4)` (cycloalkadiene) → `C_n H_(2n-6)` (aromatic) + 2H\n        *   Acceptor: `C_n H_(2n-2)` (cycloalkene) + 2H → `C_n H_2n` (cycloalkane)\n    *   The components of X are X1 = C_n H_(2n-2) and X2 = C_n H_(2n-4).\n    *   Let's check the total hydrogen atoms: `a + b = (2n - 2) + (2n - 4) = 4n - 6`. This matches our earlier derivation.\n\n5.  **Determine the value of 'n'**\n    *   The problem does not provide enough information to uniquely determine 'n'. However, we are given options. Let's test the most common and chemically significant small ring systems. Z is also described as a \"widely used solvent.\"\n    *   **Case n=6**:\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12), a very common solvent.\n        *   Y = {Benzene (C6H6), Cyclohexane (C6H12)}. Both are liquids.\n        *   X = {Cyclohexene (C6H10), Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)}.\n        *   The problem states \"no conjugated multiple bonds\", so the diene must be 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n        *   This scenario is chemically sound and all components are common liquids.\n        *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is `10 + 8 = 18`. This corresponds to option A.\n    *   **Case n=7**:\n        *   Z = Methylcyclohexane (C7H14), also a common solvent.\n        *   Y = {Toluene (C7H8), Methylcyclohexane (C7H14)}.\n        *   X = {Methylcyclohexene (C7H12), Methylcyclohexadiene (C7H10)}.\n        *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is `12 + 10 = 22`. This corresponds to option D.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    *   Both n=6 and n=7 provide chemically plausible scenarios that fit the problem description and correspond to given options.\n    *   However, the system involving benzene/cyclohexene/cyclohexadiene/cyclohexane (n=6) is the most classic and fundamental example of this type of catalytic hydrogen transfer (disproportionation). In the context of typical chemistry problems, the simplest and most common example is usually the intended answer.\n    *   Let's assume the intended answer is for the C6 system.\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X are Cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms is the sum of hydrogens in their molecular formulas: 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nFinal calculation based on the most probable scenario (n=6):\n*   Liquid 1 in X: Cyclohexene, C6**H10**\n*   Liquid 2 in X: 1,4-Cyclohexadiene, C6**H8**\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Substance Z is a hydrocarbon. Let its molecular formula be CₓHᵧ.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28% (or 0.1428). The mass fraction can be calculated using atomic masses (C ≈ 12, H ≈ 1) with the formula: `Mass Fraction H = y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   We can set up the equation: `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`.\n    *   To find the ratio of y to x, we rearrange the equation:\n        `y = 0.1428 * (12x + y)`\n        `y = 1.7136x + 0.1428y`\n        `y - 0.1428y = 1.7136x`\n        `0.8572y = 1.7136x`\n        `y/x = 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2.0`\n    *   This indicates that the empirical formula for Z is CH₂. The general molecular formula is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   The problem states that \"Substance Z does not react further with hydrogen,\" which means it is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   A saturated hydrocarbon with the general formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a **cycloalkane**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. Let's call them C and D.\n    *   Mixture Y \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" which means its components are saturated (like alkanes or cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n    *   Z is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one of the components (let's say C) is the cycloalkane Z (CₙH₂ₙ).\n    *   \"Hydrogenation of... mixture Y ... gives only one substance, ... Z\". This means that hydrogenation of C gives Z (which is true since C=Z) and hydrogenation of D also gives Z.\n    *   For D to be hydrogenated to the cycloalkane Z, and also not decolorize bromine water, it must be an **aromatic hydrocarbon** with the same carbon skeleton as Z. For example, benzene (C₆H₆) is hydrogenated to cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n\n3.  **Identify the Specific Compounds**\n    *   Z is described as a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The most common and simple cycloalkane used as a solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This corresponds to n=6.\n    *   If Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), then substance D must be the corresponding aromatic hydrocarbon with 6 carbon atoms, which is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n    *   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n4.  **Relate Mixture X to Mixture Y to Find the Final Answer**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B. It is converted to Mixture Y through a **disproportionation** reaction on a platinum catalyst.\n    *   `Mixture X (A + B) → Mixture Y (C + D)`\n    *   A disproportionation reaction is a type of redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In this context, it refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction. Crucially, the law of conservation of mass applies, meaning the total number of atoms of each element is the same before and after the reaction.\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of H atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B.\n    *   Due to the conservation of atoms, this sum must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y (one molecule of C and one molecule of D).\n    *   Total H atoms in Mixture Y = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is also 18.\n\nTo confirm this, we can check the properties of mixture X. It must contain two unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds (A and B) that are non-conjugated. For example, A could be cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and B could be 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18, which matches our result. Both decolorize bromine water, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated. All conditions of the problem are satisfied.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   Let's test the general formulas for hydrocarbons. We will use integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1) as is common in such problems, and the value 14.28% suggests this.\n    *   For an alkane (CnH2n+2): %H = (2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2). This doesn't simplify to a constant value.\n    *   For a cycloalkane (CnH2n): %H = (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7.\n    *   1/7 ≈ 0.142857, which corresponds to 14.2857%. This is a perfect match for the given 14.28%.\n    *   So, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states Z is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and is a \"widely used as a solvent\". The most common cycloalkane solvents are cyclohexane (C6H12) and methylcyclohexane (C7H14).\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Hydrogenation Reactions**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mix of two liquids, C and D.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated with respect to reactions with bromine. This typically means no C=C or C≡C bonds, but aromatic rings also do not react with bromine water.\n    *   Z is a constituent of Y. Let's assume C = Z = CnH2n.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. This means hydrogenation of C gives Z (which is trivial as C=Z), and hydrogenation of D must also give Z.\n    *   So, we need to identify D. D does not react with bromine water, and its hydrogenation product is Z (CnH2n).\n        *   Possibility 1: D is a saturated isomer of Z (e.g., if Z is cyclohexane, D could be methylcyclopentane). However, if Y consists of two isomers (CnH2n and another CnH2n), the reaction X -> Y would be an isomerization, not a disproportionation (a type of redox reaction). A disproportionation requires changes in oxidation levels (or, in this context, hydrogen content). The products C and D must have different hydrogen contents. Therefore, this possibility is incorrect.\n        *   Possibility 2: D is an aromatic compound (arene). Aromatic rings do not react with bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cycloalkanes under severe conditions.\n    *   This leads to the conclusion that Y is a mixture of a cycloalkane (Z) and an arene (D). For both to produce only Z (CnH2n) upon hydrogenation, they must share the same carbon skeleton.\n    *   Thus, Y = {CnH2n (Z, the cycloalkane), CnH2n-6 (D, the corresponding arene)}. For example, if Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), then D must be benzene (C6H6).\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mix of two liquids, A and B.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, so A and/or B must contain non-aromatic C=C or C≡C bonds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z (CnH2n). This implies that both A and B are unsaturated compounds with the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   The reaction is a disproportionation: A + B → C + D. Since the mixture is equimolar on both sides, the reaction is 1A + 1B → 1C + 1D.\n    *   Let's substitute the formulas we found for C and D:\n        A + B → CnH2n + CnH2n-6\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms must be conserved. Let A = CnHx and B = CnH_y.\n        x + y = (2n) + (2n-6) = 4n - 6\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is x + y.\n\n4.  **Determine the value of 'n'**\n    *   We know Z is a widely used solvent like cyclohexane (n=6) or methylcyclohexane (n=7). Let's test both cases.\n    *   **Case 1: n = 6.**\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12). Y = {Cyclohexane, Benzene (C6H6)}.\n        *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in X is x + y = 4*6 - 6 = 24 - 6 = 18.\n        *   This is a plausible scenario. Mixture X could be cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Both have a C6 ring, are non-conjugated, and decolorize bromine water. The sum of hydrogens is 10 + 8 = 18. The disproportionation reaction C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H12 + C6H6 is a known hydrogen transfer reaction.\n    *   **Case 2: n = 7.**\n        *   Z = Methylcyclohexane (C7H14). Y = {Methylcyclohexane, Toluene (C7H8)}.\n        *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in X is x + y = 4*7 - 6 = 28 - 6 = 22.\n        *   This is also a plausible scenario. Mixture X could be a methylcyclohexene (C7H12) and a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (C7H10). The sum of hydrogens is 12 + 10 = 22.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    *   We have two plausible solutions: 18 (for the C6 system) and 22 (for the C7 system). Both options are available in the choices (D and C).\n    *   However, problems of this type usually have a single unique solution. The reaction described, the disproportionation of hydroaromatic compounds into an alkane and an arene over a platinum catalyst, is a classic reaction in organic chemistry. The most fundamental and widely-taught example of this is the Zelinsky irreversible catalysis involving the C6 system (cyclohexene/dienes disproportionating to cyclohexane and benzene). It is highly probable that the question refers to this archetypal case.\n    *   Therefore, we choose the solution corresponding to n=6.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is **18**. This corresponds to one molecule of cyclohexene (C6H10) and one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n\nFinal Calculation: 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   Substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in a cycloalkane is (2n * 1.008) / (12.011 * n + 2n * 1.008) ≈ 2/14 = 1/7 ≈ 14.3%.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a widely used solvent and is the sole product of the hydrogenation of all components in mixtures X and Y. A very common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C6H12). Its hydrogenation would not yield a different product, which is consistent with the information that Z does not react further with hydrogen.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y and its Hydrogenation:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This suggests the components are saturated (like alkanes/cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is a component of Y. Let the other component be D. So, Y = (cyclohexane + D).\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means the hydrogenation of D must also yield cyclohexane.\n    *   If D were a saturated isomer of cyclohexane (like methylcyclopentane), its hydrogenation under severe conditions would likely break the ring and form acyclic alkanes, not exclusively cyclohexane.\n    *   The only common hydrocarbon that does not decolorize bromine water and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and its reaction to Y:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them A and B) that decolorize bromine water, indicating they contain C=C double bonds (alkenes/cycloalkenes).\n    *   X is converted to Y (cyclohexane + benzene) upon heating with platinum. This is described as a disproportionation reaction, which in this context implies a hydrogen transfer.\n    *   The overall reaction is: A + B → C6H12 + C6H6.\n    *   By conservation of atoms, the reactants A and B together must contain 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms (12 from cyclohexane + 6 from benzene).\n    *   Since A and B are in an equimolar mixture and hydrogenation of both yields cyclohexane, they must both be C6 hydrocarbons with different degrees of unsaturation. Let their formulas be C6Hx and C6Hy.\n    *   From the stoichiometry, we have x + y = 18.\n    *   Both A and B are unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons. Possible candidates include cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadienes (C6H8).\n    *   The combination C6H10 and C6H8 satisfies the condition x + y = 18 (10 + 8 = 18).\n    *   The problem specifies that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in mixture X. There are two common isomers of cyclohexadiene: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated).

The general formula for a hydrocarbon is CₓHᵧ.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `(y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008) = 0.1428`.\n    *   Simplifying with approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1): `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`.\n    *   This can be rearranged to `y ≈ 2x`.\n    *   A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ is a cycloalkane or an alkene. Since substance Z does not react further with hydrogen, it must be saturated, which points to a cycloalkane.\n    *   Let's check the formula for a cycloalkane, CₙH₂ₙ: The mass fraction of H is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857`. This is a perfect match.\n    *   We are told Z is a widely used solvent. Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) is a very common cycloalkane solvent.

This means the other component of Y must also have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n    *   The other component must not decolorize bromine water. Benzene (C₆H₆) fits this description; it is aromatic and only reacts with bromine in the presence of a catalyst, not with bromine water. Hydrogenation of benzene under severe conditions produces cyclohexane.\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   When heated with platinum, X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y. This can be seen as a hydrogen transfer reaction: `A + B → Cyclohexane + Benzene`.\n    *   By conserving atoms from the products (C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆), we know that A and B must both be C₆ compounds, and the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B must be `12 + 6 = 18`.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This confirms that both A and B must have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n    *   The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X.\n    *   We need to find two different C₆ unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18.\n        *   Cyclohexene has the formula C₆H₁₀.

There are two common isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated).

Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CₓHᵧ. The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as:\nMass % H = (mass of H / total mass) * 100\n\nUsing atomic masses (C ≈ 12, H ≈ 1):\n0.1428 = (y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1)\nThis fraction (1/7 ≈ 0.1428) suggests a ratio of hydrogen mass to total mass of 1:7.\nIf the total mass is 14x (for a formula CₓH₂ₓ), then the mass of hydrogen is 2x. The ratio is 2x / 14x = 1/7.\nThus, the general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. Since Z is saturated (it does not react further with hydrogen), it must be a cycloalkane.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Mixture Y and Substance Z\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, does not decolorize bromine water, and is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X. Hydrogenation of Y yields only substance Z. One of the components of Y is Z itself.\n\nLet Y be a mixture of Z and another liquid, D.\n*   Y = {Z, D}\n*   Since Y does not decolorize bromine water, both Z and D must be saturated or aromatic. We already know Z (CₙH₂ₙ) is a saturated cycloalkane. D must also not react with bromine water, which is characteristic of saturated or aromatic compounds.\n*   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. This means hydrogenation of Z gives Z (as it's saturated), and hydrogenation of D must also give Z.\n*   For an aromatic compound D to be hydrogenated to a cycloalkane Z, they must share the same carbon skeleton.\n\nThis leads to two primary possibilities for the {Z, D} pair based on common solvents:\n1.  **The C₆ case:** The aromatic compound D is benzene (C₆H₆). Benzene does not decolorize bromine water. Its hydrogenation product is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Therefore, Z must be cyclohexane.\n    *   Y = {cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), benzene (C₆H₆)}.\n    *   Z = cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) is a widely used solvent.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y {C₆H₁₂, C₆H₆} yields {C₆H₁₂, C₆H₁₂}, which is a single substance, Z. This case is consistent.\n2.  **The C₇ case:** The aromatic compound D is toluene (C₇H₈). Toluene does not decolorize bromine water. Its hydrogenation product is methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄). Therefore, Z must be methylcyclohexane.\n    *   Y = {methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄), toluene (C₇H₈)}.\n    *   Z = methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄) is also used as a solvent.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y {C₇H₁₄, C₇H₈} yields {C₇H₁₄, C₇H₁₄}, a single substance, Z. This case also seems consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B, which decolorizes bromine water (i.e., A and B are unsaturated). When heated with platinum, X undergoes disproportionation to form the equimolar mixture Y. This suggests a 1:1 reaction:\nA + B → Z + D\n\nThis is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one molecule is hydrogenated and the other is dehydrogenated. Let's analyze the hydrogen balance for our two cases:\n\n1.  **The C₆ case:** A + B → cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B must be 12 + 6 = 18.\n2.  **The C₇ case:** A + B → methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄) + toluene (C₇H₈).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms must be 14 + 8 = 22.\n\nThe components of X (A and B) must be unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons that, upon hydrogenation, both yield Z. They also must not have conjugated double bonds.\n\n*   **For the C₆ case (Z=cyclohexane):** A and B must be unsaturated C₆ rings. With a total of 18 hydrogen atoms, plausible candidates are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   A = C₆H₁₀, B = C₆H₈. Total H = 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Cyclohexene has one double bond. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has two non-conjugated double bonds. This fits the criteria.\n    *   Hydrogenation of C₆H₁₀ gives C₆H₁₂ (Z). Hydrogenation of C₆H₈ gives C₆H₁₂ (Z). This works.\n\n*   **For the C₇ case (Z=methylcyclohexane):** A and B must be unsaturated hydrocarbons with a methylcyclohexane skeleton. With a total of 22 hydrogen atoms, plausible candidates are methylcyclohexene (C₇H₁₂) and a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (C₇H₁₀).\n    *   A = C₇H₁₂, B = C₇H₁₀. Total H = 12 + 10 = 22.\n    *   These would also fit the criteria for unsaturation, non-conjugation, and hydrogenation to Z.\n\n### Step 4: Distinguishing Between the C₆ and C₇ Cases\nWe have two plausible scenarios leading to two different answers (18 or 22). We must find a constraint that eliminates one. Let's re-examine the hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y. The problem specifies that hydrogenation of *both* mixtures gives *only* one substance, Z.\n\nConsider the C₇ case again, but without assuming Z from the start. Let's assume the components of X are based on a C₇ ring (cycloheptene C₇H₁₂ and cycloheptadiene C₇H₁₀).\n*   Hydrogenation of X {C₇H₁₂, C₇H₁₀} under normal conditions would yield cycloheptane (C₇H₁₄). So, Z would be cycloheptane.\n*   Mixture Y would be formed from the disproportionation: C₇H₁₂ + C₇H₁₀ → C₇H₁₄ (cycloheptane) + C₇H₈ (toluene). So, Y = {cycloheptane, toluene}.\n*   Now, let's test the hydrogenation of this mixture Y. Hydrogenation of cycloheptane yields cycloheptane. Hydrogenation of toluene yields methylcyclohexane.\n*   The result is a mixture of two different substances: cycloheptane and methylcyclohexane. This contradicts the condition that *only one substance* is formed.\n\nTherefore, the C₇ case built upon a cycloheptane skeleton is invalid. The only way the C₇ case could work is if Z is methylcyclohexane from the start and the \"severe conditions\" for hydrogenation are sufficient to cause skeletal isomerization of cycloheptane to methylcyclohexane.\n\nThe C₆ case, however, is perfectly consistent without requiring any extra assumptions like skeletal isomerization.\n*   Hydrogenation of X {C₆H₁₀, C₆H₈} gives only cyclohexane (Z).\n*   Hydrogenation of Y {C₆H₁₂, C₆H₆} gives only cyclohexane (Z).\n\nThe principle of Occam's razor, and the fact that the disproportionation of C₆ hydroaromatics is a classic textbook reaction (the Zelinaky-Kazansky reaction), strongly favors the C₆ scenario.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\nBased on the C₆ scenario, mixture X consists of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n\nTotal H atoms = (H atoms in C₆H₁₀) + (H atoms in C₆H₈) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the chemical transformations described, the following conclusions are drawn:\n\n1.  **Identification of Substance Z**: The hydrocarbon Z has a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%, which corresponds to the general formula CₙH₂ₙ. Since Z is a saturated substance that doesn't react further with hydrogen, it must be a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Composition of Mixture Y**: Mixture Y is equimolar, does not decolorize bromine water, and its hydrogenation yields only Z. Given that Z is a component of Y, the other component, let's call it D, must also yield Z upon hydrogenation. For D to not decolorize bromine water but still be hydrogenated, it must be an aromatic compound. The hydrogenation of D must produce Z, which implies that Z and D share the same carbon skeleton.\n\n3.  **Two Plausible Scenarios**: This leads to two main possibilities based on common cyclic hydrocarbons:\n    *   **C₆ Scenario**: If the aromatic compound is benzene (C₆H₆), its hydrogenation product is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Thus, Z would be cyclohexane. Mixture Y would be {cyclohexane, benzene}.\n    *   **C₇ Scenario**: If the aromatic compound is toluene (C₇H₈), its hydrogenation product is methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄). Thus, Z would be methylcyclohexane. Mixture Y would be {methylcyclohexane, toluene}.\n\n4.  **Analysis of the Disproportionation**: Mixture X, an equimolar mixture of two unsaturated liquids (A and B), undergoes disproportionation on a platinum catalyst to form the equimolar mixture Y. This is best described as an intermolecular hydrogen transfer reaction where A and B react in a 1:1 molar ratio to produce Z and the aromatic compound D.\n    *   **C₆ Scenario**: A + B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆). The total number of hydrogen atoms in molecules A and B is 12 + 6 = 18. The components of X would be cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and a non-conjugated cyclohexadiene like 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). Both have a cyclohexane skeleton and are unsaturated.\n    *   **C₇ Scenario**: A + B → Methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄) + Toluene (C₇H₈). The total number of hydrogen atoms is 14 + 8 = 22. The components of X would be a methylcyclohexene (C₇H₁₂) and a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (C₇H₁₀).\n\n5.  **Final Decisive Step**: The problem states that hydrogenation of *both* mixture X and mixture Y gives *only one* substance Z. Let's re-examine the C₇ case. If the components of X are based on a 7-membered ring (e.g., cycloheptene), their hydrogenation would yield cycloheptane. The disproportionation would then produce Y = {cycloheptane, toluene}. Hydrogenating this mixture Y would result in two different products: cycloheptane and methylcyclohexane. This contradicts the problem's condition. The C₆ case, however, remains consistent: hydrogenation of X {cyclohexene, cyclohexadiene} gives cyclohexane, and hydrogenation of Y {cyclohexane, benzene} also gives only cyclohexane. This reaction system is a classic example of catalytic disproportionation.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent solution is the C₆ scenario. The two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each liquid is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nctrl95>H\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n### 1. Identify Hydrocarbon Z\nThe problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CₙHₘ.\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as:\n`mass % H = (m * 1.008) / (n * 12.011 + m * 1.008)`\nApproximating with integer masses (H=1, C=12):\n`0.1428 ≈ m / (12n + m)`\nThis value, 0.1428, is very close to 1/7.\n`1/7 = m / (12n + m)  => 12n + m = 7m  => 12n = 6m  => m = 2n`\nSo, the hydrocarbon Z has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n\nThe problem also states that Z is formed by the hydrogenation of other substances and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n\nFurthermore, Z is a constituent of mixture Y and is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane used as a solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Other small cycloalkanes like cyclopropane and cyclobutane are gases at room temperature and not typically used as liquid solvents. Therefore, it is highly probable that Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### 2. Characterize Mixture Y\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, indicating the absence of typical carbon-carbon double bonds. One of these liquids is Z, which we've identified as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n\nHydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only Z (cyclohexane). This means the second component of Y, let's call it Y₂, must also be converted into cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. Since Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a simple alkene. The most plausible candidate is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene does not react with bromine water under normal conditions and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions (high pressure and/or temperature).\n\nSo, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Reaction X → Y\nMixture X, an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them A and B), is converted to mixture Y (cyclohexane and benzene) upon heating with platinum. This reaction is described as a disproportionation. In this context, it refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction where some molecules are hydrogenated and others are dehydrogenated.\n\nSince mixture Y is formed in an equimolar ratio, the reaction can be written as:\n`A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane + Benzene`\n\nBy the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal that in the products.\n-   Carbon atoms: The products are C₆H₁₂ and C₆H₆. Since hydrogenation of both A and B leads to cyclohexane (a C₆ compound), A and B must also be C₆ hydrocarbons. Let A = C₆Hₓ and B = C₆Hᵧ. The carbon atoms are balanced (6 + 6 = 6 + 6).\n-   Hydrogen atoms: `x + y = 12 + 6 = 18`.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B is 18.\n\n### 4. Verify the Properties of Mixture X\nThe components of mixture X, A (C₆Hₓ) and B (C₆Hᵧ), must satisfy the following conditions:\n*   They decolorize bromine water, meaning they are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds). This implies x < 12 and y < 12.\n*   Hydrogenation of A and B yields only cyclohexane. This confirms they have a six-membered carbon ring skeleton.\n*   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules.\n\nLet's find plausible structures for A and B based on `x + y = 18`. A combination that fits is `x=10` and `y=8`.\n*   **A = C₆H₁₀**: This corresponds to **cyclohexene**. It has one double bond, so it decolorizes bromine water and has no conjugated bonds. Hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.\n*   **B = C₆H₈**: This corresponds to a cyclohexadiene. There are two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated double bonds) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (isolated double bonds). Since the problem excludes conjugated bonds, B must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**. It decolorizes bromine water and its hydrogenation also yields cyclohexane.\n\nThe disproportionation reaction would be a hydrogen transfer from 1,4-cyclohexadiene to cyclohexene:\n`C₆H₈ (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C₆H₁₀ (cyclohexene) → C₆H₆ (benzene) + C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane)`\nIn this reaction, 1,4-cyclohexadiene loses 2 hydrogen atoms to become benzene, and cyclohexene gains those 2 hydrogen atoms to become cyclohexane. This process, known as catalytic transfer hydrogenation, fits the description perfectly.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe two liquids in the equimolar mixture X are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of these two liquids is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X is **18**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**:\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon (composed of C and H).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let's determine its empirical formula.\n    *   14.28% is very close to 1/7 (since 100/7 ≈ 14.2857).\n    *   Let the formula be CxHy. The mass fraction of H is `(y * AtomicMass(H)) / (x * AtomicMass(C) + y * AtomicMass(H))`.\n    *   Using approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12), we have: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`.\n    *   This gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   The formula is of the type CnH2n.\n    *   Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it's a saturated compound. A saturated compound with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent matching this description is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. This will be our working assumption for Z.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**:\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from mixture X.\n    *   One of the liquids in Y is Z itself (cyclohexane, C6H12). Let's call the other liquid D. So, Y = (cyclohexane + D).\n    *   Y (and therefore both its components) does not decolorize bromine water. This means D is unreactive towards bromine water under standard conditions.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. This means hydrogenation of D must also yield Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   What could D be? It must be a C6 compound (since it hydrogenates to C6H12). It's unreactive to Br2 water. The most plausible candidate is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene is aromatic and does not react with aqueous bromine, and its hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.\n    *   So, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction**:\n    *   X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n    *   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in A or B.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This confirms that both A and B have a C6 carbon skeleton (a six-membered ring).\n    *   The reaction is a disproportionation (or hydrogen transfer) where X forms Y:\n        `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> cyclohexane + benzene`\n    *   Since A and B are C6 compounds, let their formulas be C6Hx and C6Hy.\n    *   By the principle of conservation of atoms, the number of hydrogen atoms must be equal on both sides of the reaction equation:\n        `Number of H in A + Number of H in B = Number of H in cyclohexane + Number of H in benzene`\n        `x + y = 12 + 6`\n        `x + y = 18`\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**:\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is precisely the value `x + y` we just calculated.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 18. This corresponds to option B.\n\nNow, I will write a Python code snippet that formalizes this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the properties of the products in mixture Y.\n# Based on the problem description, substance Z is identified as cyclohexane,\n# and the other component of mixture Y is identified as benzene.\n# We define the number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each.\n\n# Number of hydrogen atoms in a molecule of cyclohexane (C6H12)\nh_atoms_cyclohexane = 12\n\n# Number of hydrogen atoms in a molecule of benzene (C6H6)\nh_atoms_benzene = 6\n\n# Step 2: Apply the principle of conservation of atoms.\n# The reaction is a disproportionation of mixture X (containing two liquids, A and B)\n# into an equimolar mixture Y (cyclohexane and benzene).\n# Reaction: A + B -> cyclohexane + benzene\n# The total number of hydrogen atoms must be conserved.\n# Therefore, the total hydrogen atoms in the reactants (A and B) must equal\n# the total hydrogen atoms in the products (cyclohexane and benzene).\n\ntotal_h_atoms_in_X = h_atoms_cyclohexane + h_atoms_benzene\n\n# Step 3: Print the final answer.\n# The problem asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\nprint(f\"The number of hydrogen atoms in cyclohexane is: {h_atoms_cyclohexane}\")\nprint(f\"The number of hydrogen atoms in benzene is: {h_atoms_benzene}\")\nprint(f\"By conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in the products.\")\nprint(f\"Total hydrogen atoms = {h_atoms_cyclohexane} + {h_atoms_benzene} = {total_h_atoms_in_X}\")\n\n# Step 4: Identify the correct option.\noptions = {'A': 22, 'B': 18, 'C': 16, 'D': 12}\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value == total_h_atoms_in_X:\n        correct_option = option\n        break\n\nprint(f\"The final answer is {total_h_atoms_in_X}, which corresponds to option {correct_option}.\")\nprint(f\"For reference, the choices are:\")\nprint(\"A) 22\")\nprint(\"B) 18\")\nprint(\"C) 16\")\nprint(\"D) 12\")\nprint(\"The calculated answer is 18.\")\n<<<B>>>\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: \nErrors:   File \"<stdin>\", line 43\n    <<<B>>>\n    ^^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Substance Z**\n*   Substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CₓHᵧ.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by: (mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * 1.008) / (x * 12.01 + y * 1.008) = 0.1428.\n*   The value 14.28% is very close to 1/7 (1 / 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n*   Assuming the mass fraction is exactly 1/7, this means the mass of hydrogen is 1 part and the mass of carbon is 6 parts.\n*   The ratio of the number of atoms is (moles of C) : (moles of H) = (mass of C / atomic mass of C) : (mass of H / atomic mass of H)\n*   Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1): n(C) : n(H) = (6/12) : (1/1) = 0.5 : 1 = 1 : 2.\n*   So, the empirical formula of Z is (CH₂)ₙ. This corresponds to the general formula for alkenes or cycloalkanes (CₙH₂ₙ).\n*   The problem states that mixture Y, which contains Z, does *not* decolorize bromine water. This means Z must be a saturated compound. Therefore, Z cannot be an alkene. It must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂.\n*   Let's check the mass fraction of hydrogen for cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂): H% = (12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12 * 1) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 = 14.28%. This is a perfect match.\n*   Thus, **Substance Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Mixture Y and the Hydrogenation Process**\n*   Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* cyclohexane (Z). This implies that all compounds in both mixtures have a six-carbon ring as their basic carbon skeleton.\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of them is Z (cyclohexane). Let the other be D. So, Y = {cyclohexane, D}.\n*   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, so both cyclohexane and D must be saturated compounds.\n*   Hydrogenation of Y gives only cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of cyclohexane gives cyclohexane. Therefore, hydrogenation of D must also give cyclohexane.\n*   Since D is already saturated and has a six-carbon ring skeleton, and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane, this can be reconciled if we consider the overall reaction scheme. The most likely scenario involves a substance that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction**\n*   Mixture X is treated with platinum when heated, resulting in a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y.\n*   A disproportionation reaction is a type of redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced to form two different products. In the context of hydrocarbons on a Pt catalyst, this often involves the transfer of hydrogen. One molecule gains hydrogen (is reduced), and another loses hydrogen (is oxidized).\n*   A classic example of such a reaction is the disproportionation of cyclohexene: 3 C₆H₁₀ → 2 C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆ (cyclohexane and benzene). However, this produces a 2:1 mixture, not an equimolar (1:1) mixture as stated for Y.\n*   Let's rethink mixture Y. We know Y = {cyclohexane, D}, and hydrogenation of both gives cyclohexane. A compound that fits the description for D (has a C₆ skeleton, is a liquid, does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane) is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene requires a catalyst for bromination and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n*   So, we can propose that **Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Composition of Mixture X**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n*   The disproportionation reaction is: A + B → cyclohexane + benzene.\n*   Since the products are in an equimolar ratio (1:1), the reactants A and B must also react in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   The reaction is a transfer of hydrogen. We can balance the atoms.\n    *   C atoms: The total number of carbon atoms on the left must be 6 + 6 = 12. Since A and B both have a C₆ skeleton, this is satisfied.\n    *   H atoms: The total number of hydrogen atoms must also be conserved. The total H atoms in the products are 12 (from C₆H₁₂) + 6 (from C₆H₆) = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B must be 18.\n*   The question asks for \"the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\", which means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component liquid.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion and Verification**\n*   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two molecules from mixture X (one molecule of A and one of B) is 18.\n*   Let's verify this is plausible. Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B are unsaturated (contain double bonds). They have C₆ skeletons. Let A be cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and B be a cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   Number of H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18. This fits.\n*   The problem also states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds. Cyclohexene has one double bond (non-conjugated). Cyclohexadiene has two common isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). So B must be 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n*   The reaction would be:\n    *   C₆H₁₀ (cyclohexene) + C₆H₈ (1,4-cyclohexadiene) → C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane) + C₆H₆ (benzene)\n*   In this reaction, the diene (C₆H₈) is oxidized to benzene by losing 2 H atoms, and the ene (C₆H₁₀) is reduced to cyclohexane by gaining 2 H atoms. This is a perfectly valid disproportionation reaction. All conditions of the problem are met.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of cyclohexene (10 H) and one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (8 H).\nTotal H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of Z be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `(y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1)`, assuming atomic masses H=1 and C=12.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`\n    *   `y = 0.1428 * (12x + y) = 1.7136x + 0.1428y`\n    *   `0.8572y = 1.7136x`\n    *   `y/x = 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2`.\n    *   This indicates the empirical formula is CH2, and the general formula is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not decolorize bromine water, which means it is a saturated compound. A hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n that is saturated must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z also does not react further with hydrogen, confirming it is saturated.\n\n2.  **Determine the Carbon Skeleton**\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* substance Z. This is a crucial piece of information. It means that all the compounds present in both mixtures (the two in X and the two in Y) must have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   For example, if Z is cyclohexane, all other compounds must also have a C6 ring skeleton.\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   One of its components is Z (the cycloalkane, CnH2n).\n    *   Let the other component be Y2. Since Y doesn't decolorize bromine water, Y2 must also be saturated or be an aromatic compound (which doesn't react with Br2 water without a catalyst).\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. This means hydrogenation of Y2 must also give Z. If Y2 were another saturated cycloalkane, it would have to be Z itself. But the problem says Y is a mixture of \"two other liquids\" formed from X. Let's assume the components of Y are different.\n    *   Therefore, Y2 must be an aromatic compound whose carbon skeleton is the same as Z's and which hydrogenates to Z.\n    *   So, Mixture Y = { CnH2n (Z, a cycloalkane), Aromatic compound (Ar) }.\n\n4.  **Identify Mixture X and the Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2, that decolorizes bromine water. This means they contain C=C double bonds. They must be cycloalkenes or cycloalkadienes with the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X.\n    *   Mixture X is converted to Mixture Y in a \"disproportionation\" reaction, producing an equimolar mixture. A disproportionation reaction where a single substance reacts (e.g., `3A -> B + 2C`) does not produce an equimolar mixture. Therefore, the reaction must be an intermolecular hydrogen transfer between the two components of X: `X1 + X2 -> Y1 + Y2`. This type of reaction is often referred to as disproportionation in catalysis.\n    *   In this reaction, one molecule is oxidized (loses hydrogen) to form the aromatic compound (Ar), and the other molecule is reduced (gains hydrogen) to form the cycloalkane (Z).\n    *   So, the reaction is: `Cycloalkadiene + Cycloalkene -> Aromatic + Cycloalkane`. The diene is oxidized, and the alkene is reduced.\n\n5.  **Examine Possible Skeletons and Find the Solution**\n    We need to find a cycloalkane Z that is a common solvent and has a corresponding stable aromatic analogue. The simplest and most common cases involve a six-membered ring.\n\n    *   **Case 1: C6 Skeleton**\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12). This is a very widely used solvent.\n        *   The corresponding aromatic compound is Benzene (C6H6).\n        *   Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane, Benzene}. Both are liquids, and the mixture doesn't decolorize Br2 water. This fits.\n        *   The reaction is `X1 + X2 -> C6H12 + C6H6`. By conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogens in X1 and X2 must be `12 + 6 = 18`.\n        *   Mixture X must consist of a cyclohexene (C6H10) and a cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Let's check the hydrogen sum: `10 + 8 = 18`. This fits perfectly.\n        *   The diene must be non-conjugated, which means it must be 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n        *   So, X = {Cyclohexene, 1,4-Cyclohexadiene}. All conditions are met.\n        *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of each component: 10 (from C6H10) + 8 (from C6H8) = **18**.\n\n    *   **Case 2: C7 Skeleton (Methylated C6 ring)**\n        *   Z = Methylcyclohexane (C7H14). Also a solvent.\n        *   The corresponding aromatic compound is Toluene (C7H8).\n        *   Mixture Y = {Methylcyclohexane, Toluene}. This fits.\n        *   The total number of hydrogens in the reactants (X1, X2) must be `14 + 8 = 22`.\n        *   Mixture X would be a methylcyclohexene (C7H12) and a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (C7H10). The sum of hydrogens is `12 + 10 = 22`. This case also works. The total number of H atoms would be 22.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    Both the C6 and C7 cases are chemically plausible and lead to answers listed in the options (18 for C6, 22 for C7). In the absence of further information that could distinguish between these cases, we rely on the common practice in chemistry problems to assume the simplest, unsubstituted parent structure unless otherwise specified. The C6 system (cyclohexane/benzene) is the fundamental parent system for this type of reaction.\n\n    Therefore, the most probable intended answer is the one derived from the C6 case.\n\n    The two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z:**\n    The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. We can determine its general formula.\n    -   For an alkane (CnH2n+2), the mass fraction of hydrogen is (2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2). This does not yield a simple integer solution for n.\n    -   For a cycloalkane (CnH2n), the mass fraction of hydrogen is (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7.\n    -   1/7 is approximately 0.142857, which corresponds to 14.28%. Thus, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n\n    We are also told that Z is a component of mixture Y, is widely used as a solvent, and is formed by the hydrogenation of mixtures X and Y. A very common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane, C6H12. This fits the formula CnH2n for n=6. Therefore, Z is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n2.  **Characterize Mixture Y:**\n    -   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, indicating the components are saturated or unreactive like aromatic rings.\n    -   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is one of the components.\n    -   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means the other component of Y must also convert to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n    -   A plausible candidate for the second component is benzene (C6H6). Benzene does not decolorize bromine water and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane (C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12).\n    -   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n3.  **Characterize the Reaction and Mixture X:**\n    -   Mixture X is converted to mixture Y (cyclohexane + benzene) upon heating with platinum. This reaction is described as a disproportionation, a redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized (loses hydrogen) and reduced (gains hydrogen).\n    -   The formation of an equimolar mixture of benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12) from an equimolar mixture of two compounds (X1 and X2) can be represented by the following hydrogen transfer reaction:\n        X1 + X2 → C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane)\n    -   By balancing the atoms, the total composition of X1 and X2 must be C12H18. Since both X1 and X2 must have the same carbon skeleton (a C6 ring, as they hydrogenate to cyclohexane), their formulas must be C6Ha and C6Hb where a + b = 18.\n    -   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning its components (X1 and X2) are unsaturated (contain double bonds). They must be cycloalkenes or cycloalkadienes.\n    -   The condition that there are no conjugated multiple bonds rules out 1,3-cyclohexadiene.\n    -   Let's test the pair of a=10 and b=8. This corresponds to X1 = cyclohexene (C6H10) and X2 = a cyclohexadiene (C6H8). To meet the non-conjugated bond condition, this must be 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    -   The proposed disproportionation reaction is:\n        C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) → C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\n    -   This reaction is chemically sound; the cyclohexadiene is oxidized to benzene, and the cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane, with platinum serving as the catalyst for hydrogen transfer. Both components of X, cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene, would decolorize bromine water and would hydrogenate to form only cyclohexane.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms:**\n    -   The two liquids constituting mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    -   The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each liquid is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in their formulas.\n    -   Total H atoms = (H atoms in C6H10) + (H atoms in C6H8) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nThe reasoning behind the solution is consistent and supported by established chemical principles. Here is a summary of the logical steps taken:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z**: Substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage corresponds to the general formula CnH2n. Since Z does not react further with hydrogen and is used as a solvent, it is identified as the saturated cycloalkane, cyclohexane (C6H12). The hydrogenation of benzene is a common industrial method to produce cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water and contains Z. Hydrogenation of mixture Y yields only Z (cyclohexane). This indicates the other component must also have a six-carbon ring structure that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. The prime candidate that fits these criteria is benzene (C6H6). Benzene's aromaticity makes it stable, and it does not react with bromine water under normal conditions. Hydrogenation of benzene does produce cyclohexane. Therefore, mixture Y consists of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction X to Y**: An equimolar mixture X is converted into an equimolar mixture Y via a platinum-catalyzed disproportionation reaction. The overall reaction can be written as:\n    Component A₁ (from X) + Component A₂ (from X) → Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    This is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one component is dehydrogenated to benzene, and the other is hydrogenated to cyclohexane. By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of hydrogen atoms from the two components of X must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n    Total H atoms = H atoms in Benzene + H atoms in Cyclohexane = 6 + 12 = 18.\n\n4.  **Characterize Mixture X**: Mixture X consists of two liquids that decolorize bromine water, which confirms they are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds). Upon hydrogenation, both components yield cyclohexane, confirming they are C6 cyclic compounds. The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X.\n\n5.  **Identify Components of X**: Based on the criteria for X, we look for non-conjugated C6 cycloalkenes or cycloalkadienes.\n    *   Cyclohexene (C6H10) is a C6 cycloalkene.\n    *   Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) is a C6 cycloalkadiene with non-conjugated double bonds. Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a conjugated isomer and is thus excluded.\n    The disproportionation reaction where one molecule acts as a hydrogen donor and the other as an acceptor is well-documented, particularly for cyclohexadienes and related compounds, often referred to as Zelinsky irreversible catalysis. The most plausible reaction is the transfer of hydrogen from cyclohexa-1,4-diene to cyclohexene:\n    C6H8 (cyclohexa-1,4-diene) + C6H10 (cyclohexene) → C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane).\n    The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component of mixture X is 8 + 10 = 18. This matches the calculation from step 3.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This refers to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two different compounds.\n\n*   Liquid 1: Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)\n*   Liquid 2: Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula for the hydrocarbon be CₙHₘ.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `Mass % H = (m * Ar(H)) / (n * Ar(C) + m * Ar(H))`, where Ar is the atomic weight (Ar(H) ≈ 1, Ar(C) ≈ 12).\n    *   `0.1428 = m / (12n + m)`\n    *   `0.1428 * (12n + m) = m`\n    *   `1.7136n + 0.1428m = m`\n    *   `1.7136n = 0.8572m`\n    *   `m / n = 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2`\n    *   This gives an empirical formula of CH₂. The general formula for a hydrocarbon with this ratio is CₙH₂ₙ. This corresponds to either an alkene with one double bond or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of Z**\n    *   Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only one* substance, Z. This strongly implies that all compounds in both mixtures share the same carbon skeleton, which is that of Z.\n    *   Z is also described as being \"widely used as a solvent\". Among cycloalkanes, cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) is a very common industrial solvent.\n    *   Let's check if C₆H₁₂ fits the mass fraction: `Mass % H = (12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12 * 1) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857`. This is a perfect match.\n    *   Therefore, Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n\n3.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from the disproportionation of X.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   One component of Y is Z, which is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Let's call this Y₁.\n    *   Hydrogenation of the other component, Y₂, must also yield cyclohexane. For this to be possible, Y₂ must have the same C₆ skeleton. Since Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be an alkene or alkyne. An aromatic compound like benzene (C₆H₆) does not react with bromine water and can be hydrogenated under severe conditions (as stated in the problem) to form cyclohexane: `C₆H₆ + 3H₂ --(Pt, heat, pressure)--> C₆H₁₂`.\n    *   Thus, mixture Y consists of cyclohexane (Y₁ = C₆H₁₂) and benzene (Y₂ = C₆H₆).\n\n4.  **Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X (composed of two liquids, X₁ and X₂) reacts to form mixture Y (cyclohexane and benzene). A disproportionation reaction, in this context, is a hydrogen transfer reaction where no atoms are lost from the system.\n    *   The reaction is: `X₁ + X₂ --(Pt, heat)--> Y₁ + Y₂`.\n    *   Since mixture X and mixture Y are both equimolar, the stoichiometry is 1:1 for reactants and products: `1 X₁ + 1 X₂ → 1 Y₁ + 1 Y₂`.\n    *   According to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the equation.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the products is the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and one molecule of benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**\n    *   Since the total number of hydrogen atoms is conserved, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (one molecule of X₁ and one molecule of X₂) must also be 18.\n    *   Let's verify that plausible compounds for X exist. Mixture X must decolorize bromine water (so X₁ and X₂ are unsaturated) and have no conjugated bonds. They both must have a C₆ skeleton.\n        *   A possible candidate for X₁ is cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀).\n        *   A possible candidate for X₂ is 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈), which is not conjugated.\n        *   The sum of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n        *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ (cyclohexene) + C₆H₈ (1,4-cyclohexadiene) → C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane) + C₆H₆ (benzene)` is a balanced hydrogen transfer. This confirms our model is chemically consistent.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n\nTotal H atoms = H(X₁) + H(X₂) = 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the chemical formula of hydrocarbon Z.**\nZ is a hydrocarbon with the general formula CxHy.\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%, which is 0.1428.\nMass fraction of H = (Atomic mass of H * y) / (Molecular Mass of CxHy)\n0.1428 = (1 * y) / (12 * x + 1 * y)\n*Using approximate integer atomic masses: H=1, C=12.*\n1 / 0.1428 ≈ 7\nSo, (12x + y) / y = 7\n12x/y + 1 = 7\n12x/y = 6\nx/y = 6/12 = 1/2\nThis means the ratio of hydrogen atoms to carbon atoms is 2:1, so the empirical formula is CH2. The general formula is (CH2)n or CnH2n.\n\nThe problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen). The general formula for a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon (alkane) is CnH(2n+2). The general formula for a saturated cyclic hydrocarbon (cycloalkane) is CnH2n.\nSince the formula of Z is CnH2n, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the specific molecule Z.**\nZ is a common solvent. The simplest cycloalkanes are cyclopropane, cyclobutane, cyclopentane, and cyclohexane. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very widely used industrial solvent. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n*   Formula: C6H12. This fits CnH2n.\n*   Mass %H: (12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12 * 1) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. This matches.\n*   It's a saturated cycloalkane.\n*   It's a common solvent.\nSo, Z is very likely Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n**Step 3: Identify the components of mixture Y.**\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of these liquids is Z, which is Cyclohexane (C6H12). Let the other liquid be D.\nSo, Y = {Cyclohexane, D}.\nMixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. Cyclohexane is saturated and does not react. So, D must also not decolorize bromine water (implying it is saturated or aromatic).\nHydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (Cyclohexane).\n*   Hydrogenation of Cyclohexane gives Cyclohexane.\n*   Hydrogenation of D must also give Cyclohexane.\nFor D to be hydrogenated to Cyclohexane, it must have the same C6 carbon skeleton. The only common C6 compound that fits this and doesn't decolorize bromine water is Benzene (C6H6). Benzene is aromatic and only gets hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions (high temperature and pressure with a catalyst), which matches the description.\nTherefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of Benzene (C6H6) and Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the reaction from mixture X to mixture Y.**\nMixture X, an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them A and B), is treated with platinum when heated to form mixture Y.\nThe reaction is:\nA + B --(Pt, heat)--> Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12)\nThis is described as a disproportionation. In this context, it is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X loses hydrogen (is dehydrogenated) to form benzene, while the other component gains hydrogen (is hydrogenated) to form cyclohexane. The total number of atoms of each element must be conserved.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X.**\nBased on the principle of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\nReactants: one molecule of A + one molecule of B\nProducts: one molecule of Benzene + one molecule of Cyclohexane\n\nTotal H atoms in products = (H atoms in C6H6) + (H atoms in C6H12)\nTotal H atoms in products = 6 + 12 = 18\n\nTherefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be 18.\n\n**Verification of the scenario (Optional but confirms consistency):**\n*   **Mixture X**: Must contain two C6 cyclic compounds (since they both form C6 cyclic products). They must be unsaturated (decolorize bromine water) and not have conjugated double bonds. They must have a total of 18 hydrogen atoms. A plausible pair is Cyclohexene (C6H10) and Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n    *   H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18. (Correct)\n    *   Both are unsaturated. (Correct)\n    *   Cyclohexa-1,4-diene is not conjugated. (Correct)\n    *   Reaction: C6H8 + C6H10 -> C6H6 + C6H12. This is a balanced hydrogen transfer. The diene loses 2H to become benzene, and the hexene gains 2H to become cyclohexane. (Consistent)\n    *   Hydrogenation of X: Hydrogenating C6H10 and C6H8 both yield C6H12 (Cyclohexane). (Consistent)\n\nThe logic is sound. The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon CxHy can be approximated as `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   14.28% is approximately 1/7. So, `y / (12x + y) ≈ 1/7`, which gives `7y ≈ 12x + y`, or `6y ≈ 12x`, leading to `y = 2x`.\n    *   The general formula for Z is `CnH2n`.\n    *   The problem states Z is fully saturated (does not react further with hydrogen) and is used as a solvent. A hydrocarbon with the formula `CnH2n` that is saturated must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Identify the components of Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated (like alkanes/cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n    *   Z is a component of Y. So, one component is the cycloalkane `CnH2n`.\n    *   Let the other component be D. The problem states that hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. This means that component D must also be converted to Z upon hydrogenation.\n    *   Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be an alkene or alkyne. As it can be hydrogenated to the cycloalkane Z, it must be an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton.\n    *   The general formula for a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon corresponding to a cycloalkane `CnH2n` is `CnH(2n-6)` (e.g., benzene `C6H6` corresponds to cyclohexane `C6H12`).\n    *   So, mixture Y consists of an equimolar mixture of a cycloalkane (`CnH2n`) and an aromatic hydrocarbon (`CnH(2n-6)`).\n\n3.  **Identify the components of Mixture X and the Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B, which decolorize bromine water. This means they are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   The hydrogenation of mixture X also produces only Z (`CnH2n`). This means A and B have the same carbon skeleton as Z and are unsaturated precursors to it.\n    *   Mixture X is converted to mixture Y via a platinum-catalyzed disproportionation reaction. Since X is an equimolar mixture and Y is also an equimolar mixture, the reaction stoichiometry is likely 1:1.\n    *   The reaction is `A + B -> C + D`, where C and D are the components of Y.\n        `A + B -> CnH2n + CnH(2n-6)`\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X is reduced to the cycloalkane, and the other is oxidized to the aromatic compound.\n    *   Let's determine the formulas of A and B. Since they are unsaturated precursors to `CnH2n`, they are likely a cycloalkene and a cyclodiene.\n        *   A cycloalkene has the formula `CnH(2n-2)`.\n        *   A cyclodiene has the formula `CnH(2n-4)`.\n    *   Let's check if this fits the reaction: `CnH(2n-2) + CnH(2n-4) -> CnH2n + CnH(2n-6)`.\n    *   Total atoms on the left: C = 2n, H = (2n-2) + (2n-4) = 4n-6.\n    *   Total atoms on the right: C = 2n, H = 2n + (2n-6) = 4n-6.\n    *   The reaction is balanced. So, mixture X consists of a cycloalkene (A) and a cyclodiene (B).\n\n4.  **Apply the \"No Conjugated Bonds\" Constraint**\n    *   The problem states that compounds in mixture X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   A, the cycloalkene `CnH(2n-2)`, has only one double bond, so it cannot have conjugated bonds.\n    *   B, the cyclodiene `CnH(2n-4)`, can have conjugated or isolated double bonds. The constraint requires us to choose an isomer with isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds.\n\n5.  **Determine the value of 'n'**\n    *   We have a general solution that works for different values of n (e.g., n=6, n=7, etc.).\n        *   **Case n=6**: Z is cyclohexane (`C6H12`). Y is {cyclohexane, benzene (`C6H6`)}. X is {cyclohexene (`C6H10`), 1,4-cyclohexadiene (`C6H8`)}. 1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated. This is a valid solution.\n        *   **Case n=7**: Z is methylcyclohexane (`C7H14`). Y is {methylcyclohexane, toluene (`C7H8`)}. X is {methylcyclohexene (`C7H12`), a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene like 1-methyl-1,4-cyclohexadiene (`C7H10`)}. This is also a valid solution.\n    *   To find the final answer, we must choose between these cases. In such chemistry problems, the simplest, most fundamental parent system is usually the intended answer unless otherwise specified. The cyclohexane/benzene system (n=6) is the most fundamental example of this type of chemistry.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   Based on the choice of n=6, the two liquids in mixture X are:\n        *   Liquid A: Cyclohexene, `C6H10`\n        *   Liquid B: 1,4-Cyclohexadiene, `C6H8`\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each liquid.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in `C6H10`) + (H atoms in `C6H8`) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of hydrocarbon Z.**\nThe problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as:\nMass % of H = (y × Atomic Mass of H) / (x × Atomic Mass of C + y × Atomic Mass of H)\n\nUsing integer atomic masses for simplicity (C ≈ 12, H ≈ 1), the formula becomes:\n0.1428 = y / (12x + y)\n\nThe value 0.1428 is very close to 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). We can assume this is the intended ratio.\ny / (12x + y) = 1/7\n7y = 12x + y\n6y = 12x\ny = 2x\n\nThis means the general formula for the hydrocarbon Z is CnH2n. The problem also states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which means it is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the general formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n\nFurthermore, Z is described as a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The most common and simple cycloalkane used as a solvent is cyclohexane. Let's check if cyclohexane, C6H12, fits the data. For C6H12, n=6, and the formula is CnH2n. The mass fraction of hydrogen is:\nMass % of H = 12 / (6×12 + 12) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%.\nThis matches perfectly. Therefore, **Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the components of mixture Y.**\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. We already know one component is Z, which is cyclohexane (C6H12). Mixture Y \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" which is true for saturated compounds like cyclohexane. The other component must also not decolorize bromine water, which means it is either saturated or aromatic.\n\nThe problem states that hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Hydrogenation of the cyclohexane component of Y yields no reaction, as it's already saturated.\n*   Therefore, the other component of Y must be hydrogenated to form cyclohexane.\n\nAn aromatic compound would fit this description, as they do not react with bromine water under normal conditions but can be hydrogenated under severe conditions. The only aromatic C6 compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane is **benzene (C6H6)**.\nThus, **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the conversion of mixture X to mixture Y and find the total number of hydrogen atoms.**\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (A and B) that undergoes a disproportionation reaction when heated with platinum to form the equimolar mixture Y (benzene and cyclohexane).\nThe reaction is:\nA + B --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 + C6H12\n\nThis reaction is a catalytic hydrogen transfer. One component of X is oxidized (loses hydrogen) to become benzene, and the other component is reduced (gains hydrogen) to become cyclohexane.\n\nAccording to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms on the reactant side must equal the total on the product side. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B must equal the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of benzene and one molecule of cyclohexane.\n\nTotal H atoms in mixture X = (H atoms in benzene) + (H atoms in cyclohexane)\nTotal H atoms in mixture X = 6 + 12\nTotal H atoms in mixture X = 18\n\n**Verification:**\nMixture X must contain two C6 unsaturated hydrocarbons that, when hydrogenated, give only cyclohexane. They must not have conjugated double bonds. A plausible combination is cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n*   Sum of hydrogens: 10 + 8 = 18. This matches.\n*   Reaction: C6H8 + C6H10 --> C6H6 + C6H12. This is a balanced hydrogen transfer. The diene loses 2H to become benzene, and the alkene gains 2H to become cyclohexane, producing an equimolar mixture.\n*   Both are unsaturated (will decolorize bromine water).\n*   Neither has conjugated bonds (cyclohexa-1,4-diene has isolated double bonds).\n*   Both hydrogenate to C6H12.\nAll conditions are met.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nAn equimolar mixture X of two liquids is treated with platinum when heated to form an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids. This is a disproportionation reaction. The law of conservation of atoms must be satisfied, meaning the total number of atoms of each element in the reactants (mixture X) equals the total number of atoms in the products (mixture Y).\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n    *   Let the molecular formula be CxHy. Using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting this equal to 1/7: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`.\n    *   This gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   The general formula for Z is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (does not react further with hydrogen). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common and simple cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. This fits the formula CnH2n for n=6.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids and does not decolorize bromine water (indicating its components are saturated or aromatic).\n    *   One of the components is Z, which we identified as cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means the other component of Y must also have a C6 carbon skeleton and can be hydrogenated to form cyclohexane.\n    *   Since this second component does not decolorize bromine water, it must be aromatic (as a saturated isomer wouldn't hydrogenate to cyclohexane).\n    *   The only C6 aromatic hydrocarbon is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene fits the description: it does not decolorize bromine water on its own and hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X:**\n    *   The transformation from mixture X to mixture Y is a chemical reaction:\n        `Mixture X (A + B) → Mixture Y (C6H12 + C6H6)`\n    *   According to the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (the two liquids of mixture X) must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products (the two liquids of mixture Y).\n    *   Total H atoms in X = (H atoms in Cyclohexane) + (H atoms in Benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms in X = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\nSubstance Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. Let its formula be CnHm. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `m / (12n + m)`.\n`m / (12n + m) = 0.1428`\n`m ≈ 0.1428 * (12n + m)`\n`m ≈ 1.7136n + 0.1428m`\n`0.8572m ≈ 1.7136n`\n`m/n ≈ 2`\nThis gives an empirical formula of CH₂.\n\nSaturated hydrocarbons are either alkanes (CnH2n+2) or cycloalkanes (CnH2n).\n- For alkanes, the H/C ratio is `(2n+2)/n = 2 + 2/n`, which approaches 2 as n becomes large.\n- For cycloalkanes, the H/C ratio is `2n/n = 2`.\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen in a cycloalkane is `(2n * 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857`, which is 14.28%. This perfectly matches the data. So, Z is a cycloalkane.\n\nThe problem states that Z is a widely used solvent. It is also the sole product of hydrogenating all other compounds involved, under severe conditions. This suggests Z is a very stable cycloalkane. The most common and stable six-carbon cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\nLet's confirm the hydrogen percentage for cyclohexane: H% = (12 * 1.008) / (6 * 12.011 + 12 * 1.008) = 12.096 / 84.162 ≈ 14.37%, which is close. Using integer masses: 12 / (6*12 + 12) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. Thus, **Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Mixture Y\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from the disproportionation of X.\n- Y does not decolorize bromine water, indicating its components are saturated or aromatic.\n- One component of Y is Z (cyclohexane). Let's call the other component Y₂. So, Y = (cyclohexane + Y₂).\n- Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means hydrogenating Y₂ must also yield cyclohexane.\n- A key piece of information is that heating unsaturated six-membered rings with a platinum catalyst can cause a disproportionation reaction, yielding benzene and cyclohexane.\n- Let's test if Y could be a mixture of benzene (C₆H₆) and cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n    - It's an equimolar mixture of two different liquids. (Fits)\n    - Does it decolorize bromine water? Neither benzene nor cyclohexane reacts with bromine water under normal conditions. (Fits)\n    - Is Z (cyclohexane) a constituent of Y? Yes. (Fits)\n    - Does hydrogenation of Y give only Z? Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of cyclohexane results in no reaction. So, yes, the only final product is cyclohexane. (Fits)\nThis hypothesis is consistent with all the facts. So, **Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene (C₆H₆) and cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Mixture X\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n- The reaction is: A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Benzene (C₆H₆) + Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)\n- Since this is a disproportionation between A and B, atom counts must be conserved. The total formula on the product side is C₁₂H₁₈. Therefore, A + B must also sum to C₁₂H₁₈.\n- Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only cyclohexane. This implies that both A and B must be C₆ hydrocarbons with a six-carbon ring structure. Let A = C₆Hₓ and B = C₆Hᵧ.\n- From atom conservation, we have x + y = 18.\n- Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning both A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds), so x < 12 and y < 12.\n- A final constraint is that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X.\n\nLet's find a pair of unsaturated C₆ cyclic hydrocarbons that fit these conditions. The most common ones are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n- Let A = Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀). Here, x = 10.\n- This would require B to be C₆H₈ (since 10 + 8 = 18). This corresponds to cyclohexadiene.\n- Let's check the conditions for this pair:\n    - **Unsaturation:** Both cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water. (Fits)\n    - **Non-conjugation:** Cyclohexene has only one double bond, so there is no conjugation. Cyclohexadiene has two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated, isolated double bonds). To fit the condition, B must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**. (Fits)\n    - **Disproportionation:** The reaction C₆H₁₀ (cyclohexene) + C₆H₈ (1,4-cyclohexadiene) → C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane) + C₆H₆ (benzene) is a balanced hydrogen transfer. Cyclohexene is reduced (gains 2H), and cyclohexadiene is oxidized (loses 2H). This is a classic disproportionation reaction. (Fits)\n\nSo, **mixture X is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n- Number of hydrogen atoms in cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) = 10.\n- Number of hydrogen atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) = 8.\n- Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\n\n1.  **Composition**: Substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n2.  **Formula Calculation**: The mass fraction of hydrogen (H) in a hydrocarbon (CnHm) is given by `(m * Ar(H)) / (n * Ar(C) + m * Ar(H))`, where Ar is the atomic mass. Using approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12), the fraction is `m / (12n + m)`.\n    *   `0.1428 ≈ 1/7`\n    *   `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`\n    *   `7m = 12n + m`\n    *   `6m = 12n`\n    *   `m = 2n`\n3.  **Identification**: The general formula for substance Z is CnH2n. The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n4.  **Properties**: Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent that fits this description is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Let's verify the hydrogen mass fraction for cyclohexane:\n    *   Mass of H = 12 × 1.008 = 12.096\n    *   Molar Mass of C6H12 = (6 × 12.011) + (12 × 1.008) = 72.066 + 12.096 = 84.162 g/mol.\n    *   Mass % of H = (12.096 / 84.162) × 100 ≈ 14.37%, which is very close to 14.28% (1/7).\n\nThus, substance Z is confirmed to be **cyclohexane**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Mixture Y\n\n1.  **Composition**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of its constituents is substance Z, cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's call the other component Y2.\n2.  **Properties**: Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means both cyclohexane and Y2 are saturated compounds (or aromatic, which is unreactive to bromine water under these conditions).\n3.  **Reaction**: Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only cyclohexane. This means that hydrogenating Y2 also produces cyclohexane.\n4.  **Inference**: A plausible candidate for Y2 that fits these descriptions is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene is a liquid at room temperature and does not decolorize bromine water. Its hydrogenation quantitatively produces cyclohexane.\n5.  **Formation**: Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X when heated with platinum. The disproportionation of unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons to form cyclohexane and benzene is a known reaction, often referred to as Zelinsky irreversible catalysis.\n\nTherefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Mixture X and Solve the Question\n\n1.  **Composition**: Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two different liquids, let's call them X1 and X2.\n2.  **Properties**:\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, indicating that both X1 and X2 are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   The compounds in mixture X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only cyclohexane. This implies that both X1 and X2 are C6 hydrocarbons with a cyclic structure.\n3.  **Reaction**: The conversion of the equimolar mixture X to the equimolar mixture Y is a disproportionation reaction. This means the overall chemical equation, with a 1:1 molar ratio for the components of X and Y, is:\n    `X1 + X2 —(Pt, heat)→ Cyclohexane + Benzene`\n4.  **Atom Balancing**: Let the formula for X1 be C6Ha and for X2 be C6Hb.\n    `C6Ha + C6Hb → C6H12 + C6H6`\n    To balance the hydrogen atoms:\n    `a + b = 12 + 6`\n    `a + b = 18`\n5.  **Conclusion**: The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2, which is `a + b`.\n\nBased on the atom balance, the total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.\n\nTo further validate this, we can propose identities for X1 and X2. They must be C6 cyclic unsaturated hydrocarbons. `a` and `b` must be less than 12 and sum to 18. Plausible candidates are cyclohexene (C6H10) and a non-conjugated cyclohexadiene like 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n\n*   **X1**: Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n*   **X2**: 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This combination fits all the described conditions. The disproportionation reaction is a hydrogen transfer where cyclohexene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is dehydrogenated to benzene.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n**1. Identify Substance Z**\n*   Substance Z is a hydrocarbon, meaning it contains only carbon (C) and hydrogen (H).\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. We can determine the empirical formula from this. Let the formula be CxHy. The mass percentage of H is `(y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008) = 0.1428`.\n*   A simpler approach is to test common hydrocarbon formulas. For alkanes (CnH2n+2), the H% decreases as n increases. For cycloalkanes (CnH2n), the H% is constant:\n    `H% = (2n * 1) / (n * 12 + 2n * 1) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857`.\n*   This is a perfect match. So, Z is a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n.\n*   The problem states Z is widely used as a solvent. Among cycloalkanes, cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common industrial solvent.\n*   Z does not react further with hydrogen, confirming it is a saturated compound like a cycloalkane.\n*   Therefore, Substance Z is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Hydrogenation Reactions**\n*   Hydrogenation of Mixture X gives *only* Z (cyclohexane). This means both components of X must have a six-carbon ring structure.\n*   Hydrogenation of Mixture Y also gives *only* Z (cyclohexane). Since Z (cyclohexane) is already saturated, it won't react. This implies the other component of Y must also have a six-carbon structure that hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n\n**3. Characterize Mixture X and Mixture Y**\n*   **Mixture X** is an equimolar mix of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. This indicates the presence of carbon-carbon double bonds (unsaturation). The problem specifies there are no *conjugated* double bonds.\n*   **Mixture Y** is an equimolar mix of two liquids that does *not* decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated, or in the case of aromatic rings, do not react with bromine water under these conditions. Z (cyclohexane) is one component. The other component, let's call it W, must also not decolorize bromine water but must hydrogenate to cyclohexane. The only common substance that fits this description is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene's aromatic ring is stable and does not react with bromine water, but under severe conditions with a platinum catalyst, it hydrogenates completely to cyclohexane.\n*   So, **Mixture Y = Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**4. Determine the Disproportionation Reaction**\n*   The reaction is: Mixture X → Mixture Y.\n*   This is a disproportionation reaction where an equimolar mixture of two compounds (A and B from mixture X) reacts to form an equimolar mixture of two other compounds (Z and W from mixture Y). This strongly suggests a hydrogen transfer reaction catalyzed by platinum.\n*   The overall reaction is: `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 + C6H6`.\n*   Since A and B must both have a C6 ring structure, are unsaturated, and one lacks conjugated bonds, let's consider the likely candidates:\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**\n    *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)** (This isomer has non-conjugated double bonds, fitting the description).\n*   Let's see if an equimolar reaction between these two produces an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and benzene:\n    `C6H10 + C6H8 --> C6H12 + C6H6`\n*   Let's check the atom balance:\n    *   **Carbon:** 6 + 6 = 12 on the left; 6 + 6 = 12 on the right. (Balanced)\n    *   **Hydrogen:** 10 + 8 = 18 on the left; 12 + 6 = 18 on the right. (Balanced)\n*   The reaction is balanced and proceeds in a 1:1 molar ratio, fulfilling all conditions. In this reaction, cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is oxidized to benzene.\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Answer**\n*   Mixture X consists of two liquids:\n    *   Liquid 1: **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**, which has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid 2: **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**, which has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (i.e., in one molecule of each).\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon and is fully saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"). This means it's an alkane (CnH2n+2) or a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let's check which formula fits.\n        *   For an alkane (CnH2n+2), the mass fraction of H is `(2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2)`. Setting this to 0.1428 (or 1/7) gives `(2n+2)/(14n+2) = 1/7` => `14n + 14 = 14n + 2`, which is impossible.\n        *   For a cycloalkane (CnH2n), the mass fraction of H is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7`. Since 1/7 ≈ 0.142857, this matches the given data (14.28%).\n    *   So, Z is a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n.\n\n2.  **Determine the Carbon Skeleton**\n    *   Hydrogenation of *both* mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only* substance Z.\n    *   This is a critical piece of information. It means that all the compounds present in both mixtures X and Y are based on the same carbon skeleton, and Z is the fully saturated version of this skeleton.\n    *   Z is described as being \"widely used as a solvent\". Common cycloalkane solvents are cyclohexane (C6H12) and methylcyclohexane (C7H14). Both fit the CnH2n formula.\n\n3.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   It does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Substance Z is one of the components of Y.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n    *   Let's assume the carbon skeleton is a 6-membered ring (n=6). Then Z is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   Y contains cyclohexane. The other component must also have a C6 skeleton, be unreactive to bromine water, and hydrogenate to cyclohexane. The only compound that fits this description is benzene (C6H6). Benzene requires severe conditions for hydrogenation, which aligns with the problem description.\n    *   So, if n=6, Mixture Y = an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**. This fits all the criteria for Y.\n\n4.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   The reaction from X to Y is described as a disproportionation. Given that we start with an equimolar mixture X (let's call the components A and B) and end with an equimolar mixture Y (C and D), the most plausible reaction is a 1:1 intermolecular hydrogen transfer: A + B → C + D.\n    *   In our case, with Y being cyclohexane and benzene, the reaction is: A + B → C6H12 + C6H6.\n    *   This means one component of X is oxidized (loses hydrogen) to form benzene, and the other component is reduced (gains hydrogen) to form cyclohexane.\n    *   Let A be C6Hx and B be C6Hy.\n        *   Oxidation: C6Hx → C6H6. Hydrogen atoms lost = x - 6.\n        *   Reduction: C6Hy → C6H12. Hydrogen atoms gained = 12 - y.\n    *   For the hydrogen transfer to be balanced, the number of H atoms lost must equal the number gained: x - 6 = 12 - y, which simplifies to **x + y = 18**.\n    *   Now, let's use the other properties of X:\n        *   The components decolorize bromine water, so they must be unsaturated (contain C=C bonds). This means x < 12 and y < 12. For a C6 ring, the most saturated alkene is cyclohexene (C6H10), so x ≤ 10 and y ≤ 10.\n        *   There are no conjugated multiple bonds.\n        *   A and B must be different compounds, so x ≠ y.\n    *   We need to find two different integers, x and y, both less than or equal to 10, that sum to 18. The only possible pair is **x = 10** and **y = 8**.\n    *   So, the two liquids in mixture X have the formulas C6H10 and C6H8.\n        *   **C6H10**: This is cyclohexene. It has one double bond, is a liquid, decolorizes bromine water, and has no conjugated bonds. It hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n        *   **C6H8**: This is a cyclohexadiene. To satisfy the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" condition, it must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**, not 1,3-cyclohexadiene. It has two double bonds, is a liquid, decolorizes bromine water, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n    *   The reaction is plausible: The more unsaturated 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) is oxidized to benzene (C6H6), and the less unsaturated cyclohexene (C6H10) is reduced to cyclohexane (C6H12). The transfer involves 2 hydrogen atoms.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each liquid is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in their formulas.\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 (from C6H10) + 8 (from C6H8) = 18.\n\nThis result matches one of the options. A similar analysis for the C7 case (Z=methylcyclohexane) would lead to a total of 22 hydrogen atoms (from C7H12 and C7H10), which is also an option. However, the C6 system (cyclohexane/benzene) is the most fundamental and classic example of this type of chemistry, making it the most likely intended answer in a problem of this nature. The C6 scenario fulfills all conditions without ambiguity.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\nSubstance Z is a hydrocarbon, meaning its formula is CnHm. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%.\n\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen can be expressed as:\nMass Fraction (H) = (Total mass of H) / (Total mass of compound)\n0.1428 = (m × 1) / (n × 12 + m × 1)\n\nThis simplifies to m/n ≈ 2. The empirical formula is CH2.\nThe general formula for a hydrocarbon with this ratio is CnH2n. This corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\nThe problem states that Z is a constituent of mixture Y, which does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates that Z is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n\nFurthermore, Z is formed by the hydrogenation of mixtures X and Y and does not react further with hydrogen, confirming it is a fully saturated hydrocarbon under the given conditions. A common cycloalkane solvent with the formula CnH2n is cyclohexane (C6H12).\nLet's verify the mass fraction of hydrogen in cyclohexane (C6H12):\n*   Mass of Hydrogen = 12 × 1.008 g/mol ≈ 12 g/mol\n*   Mass of Carbon = 6 × 12.011 g/mol ≈ 72 g/mol\n*   Total Molar Mass ≈ 84 g/mol\n*   Mass fraction of H = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857, which is 14.28%.\n\nThis is a perfect match. Thus, **Substance Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Mixture Y\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from the disproportionation of X. It does not decolorize bromine water. Crucially, the hydrogenation of mixture Y yields only substance Z (cyclohexane). Also, Z itself is one of the components of mixture Y.\n\nLet the components of Y be Y1 and Y2. We know Y1 is Z, which is cyclohexane (C6H12).\nWhen mixture Y (Y1 + Y2) is hydrogenated, it gives only cyclohexane.\n*   Hydrogenation of Y1 (cyclohexane) naturally yields cyclohexane.\n*   Hydrogenation of Y2 must also yield cyclohexane.\n\nSince mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, its components are considered saturated in this context. While alkanes and cycloalkanes are saturated, aromatic compounds like benzene also do not decolorize bromine water under standard test conditions.\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that Y2 is benzene (C6H6).\n*   **Mixture Y**: An equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n*   **Does Y decolorize bromine water?**: Cyclohexane is saturated and does not react. Benzene, due to its aromatic stability, also does not decolorize bromine water. So this condition is met.\n*   **Is Z (cyclohexane) a constituent of Y?**: Yes, it is one of the two components. This condition is met.\n*   **Does hydrogenation of Y give only Z?**:\n    *   Hydrogenation of cyclohexane gives cyclohexane.\n    *   Hydrogenation of benzene (C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12) gives cyclohexane.\n    *   Therefore, hydrogenation of the entire mixture Y yields only cyclohexane (Z). This condition is met.\n\nAll conditions are satisfied. Thus, **Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Mixture X and Find the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two unsaturated liquids (X1 and X2). When heated with platinum, X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form the equimolar mixture Y. This type of reaction, where an unsaturated cyclic compound converts to a saturated cycloalkane and an aromatic ring, is a known process (e.g., Zelinsky irreversible catalysis).\n\nThe reaction is a hydrogen transfer: one component of X is hydrogenated to cyclohexane, while the other is dehydrogenated to benzene. Since the starting mixture X and the product mixture Y are both equimolar, we can write the overall transformation as:\n\nX1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2\nX1 + X2 → Cyclohexane + Benzene\nC_aH_b + C_cH_d → C6H12 + C6H6\n\nFor the atoms to be conserved:\n*   **Carbon atoms**: The fact that both products are C6 compounds, and that hydrogenation of both X1 and X2 yields cyclohexane (a C6 compound), implies that both X1 and X2 must be C6 hydrocarbons. So, a = 6 and c = 6.\n*   **Hydrogen atoms**: The total number of hydrogen atoms must be conserved as no external hydrogen is added in this step.\n    Total H atoms in reactants = Total H atoms in products\n    b + d = 12 + 6\n    b + d = 18\n\nThe two liquids in mixture X are C6H_b and C6H_d, and the sum of their hydrogen atoms is 18. The problem asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is precisely this sum.\n\nFor completeness, plausible candidates for X1 and X2 could be cyclohexene (C6H10) and a non-conjugated cycloalkadiene like cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n*   10 + 8 = 18.\n*   Both are unsaturated and would decolorize bromine water.\n*   Cyclohexa-1,4-diene is non-conjugated.\n*   Both have a C6 ring structure that would hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n*   The reaction would be: C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H12 + C6H6. This is a balanced disproportionation (hydrogen transfer).\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nOf course, I can help you solve this chemistry puzzle. Here is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Thinking Steps\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:** The first step is to determine the chemical formula of substance Z.\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, meaning it only contains Carbon (C) and Hydrogen (H).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. This value is very close to 1/7 (~0.142857).\n    *   Let's test the general formulas for hydrocarbons, using approximate atomic masses (C≈12, H≈1).\n        *   For an acyclic alkane (CnH(2n+2)): Mass % H = (2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2). This doesn't simplify to 1/7 for any integer n.\n        *   For a cycloalkane (CnH2n): Mass % H = (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 2/14 = 1/7. This is a perfect match.\n    *   So, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of mixtures X and Y gives *only* Z. This implies all compounds involved have the same carbon skeleton. Since Z is a common solvent and a cycloalkane, it is almost certainly **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids and does not decolorize bromine water (meaning it's saturated or aromatic).\n    *   Substance Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is a component of Y.\n    *   Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X. Disproportionation is a redox reaction. In this catalytic context, it means some molecules are hydrogenated (reduced) and some are dehydrogenated (oxidized).\n    *   The fully dehydrogenated, stable C6 ring compound that doesn't react with bromine water is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mix of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   We can check this: Hydrogenating this mixture (benzene + cyclohexane) would convert the benzene to cyclohexane, resulting in only one substance: cyclohexane (Z). This fits the problem description.\n\n3.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X and Find the Answer:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that is converted to mixture Y. The overall reaction is a hydrogen transfer.\n    *   `Mixture X (X1 + X2) -> Mixture Y (Benzene + Cyclohexane)`\n    *   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms must be the same on both sides of the reaction. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which means the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2.\n    *   Total H atoms in Mixture Y = (H atoms in one molecule of benzene) + (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane)\n    *   Total H atoms = 6 + 12 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be 18.\n\n    (For completeness, the two liquids in mixture X must be C6 cycloalkenes that add up to C12H18. The logical candidates are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), as 10 + 8 = 18. Both have non-conjugated double bonds and would hydrogenate to cyclohexane).\n\nNow, I will provide the Python code to formalize the final calculation.\n\n```python\n# The solution is based on logical deduction from the problem's chemical principles.\n# The code below formalizes the final calculation step based on these deductions.\n\n# Step 1: Identify the components of mixture Y.\n# From the problem analysis, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and benzene.\n# We define the number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n\n# Component 1 of Y: Cyclohexane (C6H12).

We can write this as a fraction: 14.28% ≈ 14.2857% = 1/7.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `(mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1)`.\n*   Setting this equal to 1/7: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n*   Cross-multiply: `7y = 12x + y`\n*   Simplify: `6y = 12x`, which gives `y = 2x`.\n*   So, the general formula for Z is CnH2n.\n*   The problem states that Z is formed by the hydrogenation of other substances and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Z is described as being \"widely used as a solvent\". Common cycloalkane solvents that fit the CnH2n formula are cyclohexane (C6H12) and methylcyclohexane (C7H14). Let's check the H percentage for both:\n    *   For C6H12: %H = 12 / (6*12 + 12) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. This fits.\n    *   For C7H14: %H = 14 / (7*12 + 14) = 14 / 98 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. This also fits.\n*   We will proceed by testing the more common and prototypical example, cyclohexane, first. Let's assume **Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the components of Mixture Y**\n*   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from X.\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Let the two components of Y be Y1 and Y2. We can set **Y1 = Z = cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n*   The other component, Y2, must also give cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. Since Y2 doesn't decolorize bromine water, it cannot be an alkene or alkyne. A plausible candidate is the corresponding aromatic compound, **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not react with bromine water without a catalyst, and its hydrogenation under severe conditions yields cyclohexane.\n*   So, mixture **Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**. This fits all the given conditions for Y.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the components of Mixture X**\n*   X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them X1 and X2.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning its components are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n*   Hydrogenation of both components of X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both X1 and X2 have a C6 carbon skeleton.\n*   Heating X with platinum causes a disproportionation reaction that forms an equimolar mixture of Y (cyclohexane and benzene).\n*   The reaction can be written as: `1 X1 + 1 X2 → 1 C6H12 + 1 C6H6`.\n*   By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms on the reactant side must equal the total number on the product side.\n    *   Total C atoms: X1 and X2 must both be C6 compounds. C6 + C6 = C6 + C6. OK.\n    *   Total H atoms: The sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2 must equal the sum in the products. Total H = 12 (from cyclohexane) + 6 (from benzene) = 18.\n*   So, if X1 is C6Ha and X2 is C6Hb, then **a + b = 18**.\n*   Since X1 and X2 are unsaturated precursors to cyclohexane, their hydrogen counts (a and b) must be less than 12. The common unsaturated C6 ring compounds are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadienes (C6H8).\n*   The only pair of these that adds up to 18 is {10, 8}. Therefore, mixture X is composed of a **C6H10** isomer and a **C6H8** isomer.\n*   The problem states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the compounds of X.\n    *   For C6H10, cyclohexene has only one double bond, so no conjugation. This is a valid component.\n    *   For C6H8, we need a cyclohexadiene without conjugated double bonds. Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is conjugated, but **cyclohexa-1,4-diene** is not. This is a valid component.\n*   The disproportionation reaction is an intermolecular hydrogen transfer: the diene (C6H8) is dehydrogenated to benzene (C6H6), and the cyclohexene (C6H10) is hydrogenated to cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    `C6H8 + C6H10 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 + C6H12`\n    This reaction is chemically sound and matches all the problem's descriptions.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Answer**\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of the first component (C6H8) and one molecule of the second component (C6H10).\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\nThis confirms our result. The C7 pathway (Z=methylcyclohexane) would lead to X = {C7H12, C7H10}, giving a total H count of 22 (also an option). However, cyclohexane is arguably a more \"widely used\" solvent than methylcyclohexane, and the C6 system is a more classic example of this type of reaction, making it the most probable intended answer.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the structure of hydrocarbon Z.**\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let its formula be CxHy.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `Mass_H / (Mass_C + Mass_H)`. Using atomic masses C≈12 and H≈1, we get: `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`.\n*   Rearranging the equation: `y = 0.1428 * (12x + y)` -> `y = 1.7136x + 0.1428y` -> `0.8572y = 1.7136x` -> `y/x ≈ 2`.\n*   This indicates an empirical formula of CH2 and a general molecular formula of CnH2n. The given percentage (14.28%) is a very close approximation of 1/7, which corresponds exactly to the ratio of hydrogen mass to total mass in a CnH2n compound (since mass H = 2n, mass C = 12n, total mass = 14n, so H fraction = 2n/14n = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%).\n*   Compounds with the formula CnH2n are either alkenes (containing C=C double bonds) or cycloalkanes (saturated rings).\n*   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This means Z must be a saturated compound. Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane.\n*   Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent.\" Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common cycloalkane solvent. The central role of a disproportionation reaction (see next step) strongly suggests a six-membered ring system. Let's assume Z is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**2. Determine the composition of mixture Y.**\n*   Mixture Y is formed by a disproportionation reaction from X.\n*   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is Z, which we identified as cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   The entire mixture Y, when hydrogenated under severe conditions, gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Let the other component of Y be Y2. Hydrogenation of Y2 must also produce cyclohexane.\n*   Since Y2 does not decolorize bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane, it must be **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene is a liquid at room temperature, is famously unreactive towards bromine water (unlike alkenes), and is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under high pressure and temperature (severe conditions).\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**3. Determine the composition of mixture X.**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them X1 and X2. It undergoes disproportionation on a platinum catalyst to form Y.\n    `X1 + X2 --(Pt, heat)--> cyclohexane (C6H12) + benzene (C6H6)`\n*   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One molecule is reduced (gains hydrogen) and the other is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n*   The total number of atoms must be conserved. The products have a total of (6+6)=12 Carbon atoms and (12+6)=18 Hydrogen atoms. Thus, one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2 together must also contain C12H18.\n*   Hydrogenation of both X1 and X2 gives cyclohexane (Z). This means both X1 and X2 are C6 hydrocarbons with a six-membered ring structure. Let their formulas be C6Ha and C6Hb.\n*   From atom conservation, `a + b = 18`.\n*   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, which means at least one component (and likely both, given the context) must be unsaturated (i.e., contain C=C double bonds). They must be cycloalkenes or cycloalkadienes.\n*   Let's consider the possibilities:\n    *   Cyclohexene has the formula C6H10.\n    *   Cyclohexadiene has the formula C6H8.\n*   If we choose X1 as cyclohexene (C6H10) and X2 as cyclohexadiene (C6H8), the total hydrogen atoms are `10 + 8 = 18`. This combination fits our requirement.\n*   The problem also specifies that there are \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" in mixture X.\n    *   Cyclohexene (C6H10) has only one double bond, so there is no conjugation.\n    *   Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) has two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). The condition requires us to select **1,4-cyclohexadiene**.\n*   So, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n\n**4. Calculate the final answer.**\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This refers to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) = 8.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z:**\n    *   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   The general formula for a hydrocarbon is CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by (mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008).\n    *   Using approximate masses (H=1, C=12), this becomes y / (12x + y) = 0.1428. This simplifies to y ≈ 2x.\n    *   A hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n can be an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y gives *only* Z. This implies that all compounds in both mixtures share the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common cycloalkane solvent. Methylcyclohexane (C7H14) is also a possible solvent. The mass fraction of hydrogen for any CnH2n compound is indeed 1/7 or ~14.3%.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction and Mixtures:**\n    *   **Mixture X** contains two equimolar liquids. It decolorizes bromine water, indicating the presence of carbon-carbon double bonds (unsaturation). The molecules in X do not have conjugated double bonds.\n    *   **Mixture Y** contains two other equimolar liquids. It does *not* decolorize bromine water, indicating the compounds are saturated or aromatic. Hydrocarbon Z is one of the components of mixture Y.\n    *   The transformation from X to Y upon heating with platinum is described as a **disproportionation**. In organic chemistry, this can refer to a reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized (loses hydrogen) and reduced (gains hydrogen). Often, this occurs via a catalytic hydrogen transfer.\n    *   Given that mixture Y is equimolar, a 1:1 reaction stoichiometry is required. This suggests an intermolecular hydrogen transfer between the two components of mixture X.\n\n3.  **Deduce the Structures:**\n    *   Let's assume the simplest case where Z is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. This fits the description of a widely used solvent.\n    *   Since all compounds must have the C6 carbon skeleton, we look for unsaturated C6-ring compounds for mixture X.\n    *   Mixture Y must contain Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) and another compound that doesn't decolorize bromine water and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. The only candidate for this is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   So, **Mixture Y = {Benzene (C6H6), Cyclohexane (C6H12)}**. It is equimolar and both are liquids under appropriate conditions.\n    *   The reaction must be: Component A + Component B → Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   To balance the atoms, the reactants A and B must also have C6 rings. To balance the hydrogen atoms: H(A) + H(B) = 6 + 12 = 18.\n    *   The components of Mixture X must be unsaturated C6-ring compounds that can react via hydrogen transfer to give benzene and cyclohexane. The most logical candidates are **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and a non-conjugated cyclohexadiene like **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n    *   Let's verify this proposed reaction:\n        **C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C6H10 (cyclohexene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane)**\n        This reaction is balanced and represents a catalytic hydrogen transfer where the diene donates hydrogen and the alkene accepts it.\n    *   This hypothesis fits all conditions:\n        *   X is an equimolar mix of two liquids (C6H8, C6H10), both unsaturated and non-conjugated.\n        *   Y is an equimolar mix of two liquids (C6H6, C6H12), which don't decolorize bromine water.\n        *   Z (cyclohexane) is a component of Y.\n        *   Hydrogenation of X (C6H8 and C6H10) and Y (C6H6 and C6H12) yields only Z (C6H12).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X are 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) and cyclohexene (C6H10).\n    *   Total Hydrogen Atoms = (H atoms in C6H8) + (H atoms in C6H10) = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\nThis matches option C. While a similar scenario with methylcyclohexane (C7) would lead to 22 hydrogen atoms (Option B), the cyclohexane (C6) case is the most fundamental and common example for this type of chemical problem.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let's determine its empirical formula.\n    *   Mass % of Hydrogen (H) = 14.28%\n    *   Mass % of Carbon (C) = 100% - 14.28% = 85.72%\n*   To find the ratio of atoms, we divide the percentages by the atomic masses (C≈12, H≈1):\n    *   Ratio C = 85.72 / 12 ≈ 7.14\n    *   Ratio H = 14.28 / 1 ≈ 14.28\n*   The simplest whole number ratio of H to C is 14.28 / 7.14 ≈ 2. So, the empirical formula is CH₂.\n*   The problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen). A hydrocarbon with the general formula (CH₂)n must be a cycloalkane (CnH2n), as alkanes have the formula CnH2n+2.\n*   Z is also described as being \"widely used as a solvent\". Searching for common cycloalkane solvents points towards cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) as a very common choice. Cyclohexane fits the formula CnH2n (for n=6) and is a widely used industrial solvent.\n*   Therefore, substance Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**2. Analysis of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of them is Z, which is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components are saturated or aromatic. Simple bromination of benzene, an aromatic compound, requires a catalyst and does not occur with just bromine water.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only cyclohexane (Z). This means the other component of Y must also convert to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   Let the components of Y be Z (cyclohexane) and another liquid, let's call it C. The hydrogenation of benzene (C₆H₆) yields cyclohexane. Benzene is a liquid at room temperature and does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   This makes Y an equimolar mixture of **benzene (C₆H₆)** and **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Reaction and Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is converted to mixture Y by heating with platinum. This process is described as a disproportionation. In this context, it is a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n*   Let the two components of the equimolar mixture X be A and B. The reaction is:\n    A + B → benzene (C₆H₆) + cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)\n*   In this reaction, one component of X is oxidized to benzene, and the other is reduced to cyclohexane.\n*   Since hydrogenation of both components of X gives cyclohexane, both A and B must be C₆ cyclic compounds.\n*   Let A be the compound that is oxidized to benzene, and B be the compound that is reduced to cyclohexane. The overall reaction shows that hydrogen atoms are transferred from A to B.\n    *   `A → C₆H₆ + 2H` (Oxidation)\n    *   `B + 2H → C₆H₁₂` (Reduction)\n*   From this, we can deduce the molecular formulas of A and B.\n    *   B must have two fewer hydrogen atoms than cyclohexane: C₆H₁₀. This is **cyclohexene**.\n    *   A must have two more hydrogen atoms than benzene: C₆H₈. This is a **cyclohexadiene**.\n*   So, Mixture X consists of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and a cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   Both cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water, which matches the description of mixture X.\n    *   The problem also specifies that there are no conjugated multiple bonds. Cyclohexene has only one double bond, so there is no conjugation. For cyclohexadiene, there are two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and **1,4-cyclohexadiene** (non-conjugated). Therefore, the diene in mixture X must be 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of:\n    1.  **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**\n    2.  **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (i.e., in one molecule of each component).\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = (H atoms in cyclohexene) + (H atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene)\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:** The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. The general formula for a hydrocarbon is CₙHₘ.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as `(m * 1.008) / (n * 12.011 + m * 1.008) = 0.1428`.\n    *   This simplifies to a molar ratio of `m/n ≈ 2`. The formula for Z is therefore of the type (CH₂)ₙ or CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   Substance Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a fully saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem also states Z is a constituent of mixture Y and is a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Its hydrogen mass fraction is `(12 * 1.008) / (6 * 12.011 + 12 * 1.008) = 12.096 / 84.162 = 0.1437`, which is approximately 14.3%, matching the given value. Thus, **Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n2.  **Characterize Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This implies the components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   One component of Y is Z, which is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Cyclohexane is saturated and does not react with bromine water.\n    *   Hydrogenation of both components of Y yields only cyclohexane. Therefore, the other component of Y must also have a six-carbon ring structure.\n    *   Since this second component does not decolorize bromine water but is not saturated (as it hydrogenates), it must be aromatic. The only aromatic C₆ hydrocarbon is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water without a catalyst and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n    *   Therefore, **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n3.  **Characterize Mixture X:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, indicating the presence of unsaturation (carbon-carbon double bonds).\n    *   Upon heating with platinum, mixture X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form the equimolar mixture Y ({cyclohexane, benzene}). Disproportionation here refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction where one component is reduced and the other is oxidized.\n    *   Hydrogenation of both components of X gives only cyclohexane, meaning both have a C₆ ring carbon skeleton.\n    *   The total number of atoms is conserved in the reaction from X to Y. Let the components of X be A and B. The reaction is:\n        `A + B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n    *   Since the number of atoms is conserved, the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane and one molecule of benzene.\n        Total H atoms = H atoms in (C₆H₁₂) + H atoms in (C₆H₆)\n        Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n4.  **Confirm the Plausibility:**\n    *   The components of X must be unsaturated cyclohexane derivatives. We need two molecules whose total hydrogen count is 18.\n    *   A logical combination is cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and a cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). The total hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds. Cyclohexene fits this. For cyclohexadiene, there are two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). Therefore, the diene must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   The reaction would be an intermolecular hydrogen transfer:\n        `Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) + 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) --(Pt, heat)--> Benzene (C₆H₆) + Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)`\n    *   In this reaction, cyclohexene is oxidized to benzene, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is reduced to cyclohexane. This is a chemically plausible reaction, often described as a type of Zelinsky catalysis or catalytic hydrogen transfer.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. As determined by the conservation of atoms in the disproportionation reaction, this is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is my reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CnHm. The molar masses are approximately Ar(C) = 12 g/mol and Ar(H) = 1 g/mol.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is w(H) = (m * 1) / (n * 12 + m * 1).\n    *   We are given w(H) = 0.1428. This value is very close to 1/7 (1/7 ≈ 0.142857).\n    *   So, m / (12n + m) = 1/7\n    *   7m = 12n + m\n    *   6m = 12n\n    *   m = 2n\n    *   The formula for Z is CnH2n.\n    *   We are told Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cyclic alkane solvent is cyclohexane, C6H12. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane. For C6H12, n=6, m=12, which satisfies m=2n. This is a very strong candidate.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them C and D.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This implies that C and D are either saturated compounds or aromatic compounds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   Substance Z (cyclohexane) is itself a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say D = Z = cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   Since hydrogenation of the entire mixture Y yields only cyclohexane, the other component, C, must also hydrogenate to form cyclohexane.\n    *   So, C is a compound with a C6 ring skeleton that, upon hydrogenation, becomes cyclohexane.\n    *   C does not decolorize bromine water. The only common compound that fits this description is an aromatic compound. The C6 aromatic compound is benzene (C6H6). Benzene does not react with bromine water under normal conditions but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions (high temperature/pressure with a catalyst like Pt), which is consistent with the problem statement.\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **benzene (C6H6)** and **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction**\n    *   X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and/or B contain carbon-carbon double or triple bonds (they are unsaturated).\n    *   The molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   When X is heated with platinum, it forms Y. This is described as a disproportionation reaction.\n    *   Reaction: Mixture X (A + B) --(Pt, heat)--> Mixture Y (Benzene + Cyclohexane).\n    *   Since X and Y are both equimolar mixtures, the reaction stoichiometry must be:\n        1 A + 1 B → 1 Benzene + 1 Cyclohexane\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of mixture X also gives only substance Z (cyclohexane). This confirms that both A and B must have a C6 ring carbon skeleton, just like benzene and cyclohexane.\n    *   Let the formula of A be C6Ha and the formula of B be C6Hb.\n    *   We can now apply the principle of conservation of atoms to the reaction. Specifically, let's balance the hydrogen atoms:\n        Total H in reactants = Total H in products\n        H atoms in A + H atoms in B = H atoms in Benzene + H atoms in Cyclohexane\n        a + b = 6 + 12\n        a + b = 18\n\n4.  **Answer the Question**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This corresponds to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of liquid A and one molecule of liquid B, which is `a + b`.\n    *   From our calculation, a + b = 18.\n\n5.  **Final Consistency Check**\n    *   Can we find plausible compounds for A and B? We need two non-conjugated, unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons such that the sum of their hydrogens is 18.\n    *   A good pair would be **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n    *   Sum of hydrogens = 10 + 8 = 18. Correct.\n    *   Both are liquids and have C6 rings.\n    *   Cyclohexene has one C=C bond. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has two C=C bonds separated by two CH2 groups, so they are not conjugated. Both will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Hydrogenation of cyclohexene gives cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of 1,4-cyclohexadiene gives cyclohexane.\n    *   The reaction C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H6 + C6H12 is a known type of hydrogen transfer (disproportionation) reaction over a platinum catalyst.\n    *   All conditions of the problem are met with this model.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two liquids in mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. Let its formula be CnHm.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `mass fraction H = (m * Ar(H)) / (n * Ar(C) + m * Ar(H))`. Using atomic masses Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\n    *   `0.1428 = m / (12n + m)`\n    *   The value 14.28% is very close to 1/7. Let's test this: `1/7 ≈ 0.142857`.\n    *   So, `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`. This gives `7m = 12n + m`, which simplifies to `6m = 12n`, or `m = 2n`.\n    *   The general formula for Z is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen and is formed by hydrogenation. This means Z is a fully saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent\". Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄), both of which fit the CnH2n formula.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z is a constituent of Y. Let's assume C = Z. So, C is a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y (C + D) under severe conditions gives only Z.\n    *   Hydrogenation of C (which is Z) gives Z.\n    *   Hydrogenation of D must also give Z.\n    *   Since D is part of a mixture that doesn't decolorize bromine water, it's not a simple alkene/alkyne. The most plausible structure for D is an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton as Z. An aromatic ring only reacts with H₂ under severe conditions, which fits the problem description.\n    *   Therefore, Y is a mixture of a cycloalkane (Z = CnH2n) and an aromatic hydrocarbon (D). The simplest aromatic series (benzene and its alkyl derivatives) has the formula CnH2n-6. Hydrogenation of D (CnH2n-6) adds 3 H₂ molecules to form the cycloalkane Z (CnH2n). This is consistent.\n    *   So, Mixture Y = {CnH2n, CnH2n-6}.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and/or B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in A or B.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X (A + B) gives only Z (CnH2n). This implies A and B have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   Mixture X is converted to Mixture Y by heating with platinum in a disproportionation reaction. This is characteristic of hydrogen transfer reactions catalyzed by platinum. The most plausible reaction is an intermolecular hydrogen transfer: A + B → C + D.\n    *   Since the reactant and product mixtures are equimolar, the stoichiometry is 1:1 → 1:1.\n        `A + B → C + D`\n        `A + B → (CnH2n) + (CnH2n-6)`\n    *   By conservation of atoms, the total number of H atoms in one molecule of A and one of B must be the same as in one molecule of C and one of D.\n        `H_atoms(A) + H_atoms(B) = (2n) + (2n - 6) = 4n - 6`.\n    *   Since A and B are unsaturated precursors to the cycloalkane Z, they are likely a cycloalkene and a cycloalkadiene.\n        *   Cycloalkene (one double bond): CnH2n-2. Let's assign this to A.\n        *   Cycloalkadiene (two double bonds): CnH2n-4. Let's assign this to B.\n    *   Let's check the hydrogen balance with this assignment:\n        `H_atoms(A) + H_atoms(B) = (2n - 2) + (2n - 4) = 4n - 6`.\n    *   This matches the hydrogen atoms on the product side. The reaction is:\n        `CnH2n-2 (A) + CnH2n-4 (B) → CnH2n (C) + CnH2n-6 (D)`\n        This represents the cycloalkene being hydrogenated to a cycloalkane, and the cycloalkadiene being dehydrogenated to an aromatic compound. This is a chemically sound model.\n\n4.  **Determine the Value of 'n' and the Final Answer**\n    *   We need to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of A and one molecule of B. This is `4n - 6`.\n    *   The problem leaves 'n' ambiguous. Let's test the two most likely scenarios based on common solvents:\n        *   **Case n=6**: Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). This is a very common solvent.\n            *   Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), Benzene (C₆H₆)}.\n            *   Mixture X = {Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀), 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)}. Note: 1,4-cyclohexadiene is chosen because it is not conjugated, as required.\n            *   Total H atoms in X = 10 + 8 = 18. This corresponds to the formula `4n - 6 = 4(6) - 6 = 24 - 6 = 18`. This is option D.\n        *   **Case n=7**: Z is methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄). Also a known solvent.\n            *   Mixture Y = {Methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄), Toluene (C₇H₈)}.\n            *   Mixture X = {A methylcyclohexene (C₇H₁₂), a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (C₇H₁₀)}.\n            *   Total H atoms in X = 12 + 10 = 22. This corresponds to the formula `4n - 6 = 4(7) - 6 = 28 - 6 = 22`. This is option B.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    *   Both the n=6 and n=7 scenarios are chemically consistent with all the facts given in the problem.\n    *   However, problems of this nature often refer to the most fundamental or textbook example of a reaction. The disproportionation involving the C₆ ring system (cyclohexene, cyclohexane, benzene) is the canonical example of Zelinsky catalysis.\n    *   Therefore, it is most probable that the question is based on the C₆ system.\n    *   Assuming n=6, the two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in these two liquids is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nFinal calculation using the derived formula:\nFor n=6, Total H = 4(6) - 6 = 18.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z:**\n    *   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let's determine its molecular formula.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen can be expressed as `mass_H / (mass_C + mass_H)`. Using atomic masses (C≈12, H≈1), for a formula CxHy, this is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   The value 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. So, we have the equation: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`.\n    *   Cross-multiplying gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   This means the empirical formula for Z is CH2, and its general molecular formula is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This indicates that Z is a saturated compound (contains no C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   We are also told that Z is a \"widely used as a solvent.\" A very common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane. Let's check if cyclohexane (C6H12) fits.\n    *   For cyclohexane (C6H12), the formula fits CnH2n (with n=6), it's saturated, and it's a common solvent. Its hydrogen mass fraction is `12 / (6*12 + 12) = 12/84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%`. This confirms our identification.\n    *   Therefore, **Substance Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of these liquids is Z (cyclohexane), as it is a \"constituent of mixture Y.\" Let the other liquid be D.\n    *   Mixture Y \"does not decolorize bromine water.\" Since cyclohexane is saturated, it does not react. This means liquid D must also not react with bromine water under these conditions.\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n        *   Hydrogenating cyclohexane (Z) gives cyclohexane.\n        *   Therefore, hydrogenating liquid D must also give cyclohexane. This implies that D has a six-carbon ring skeleton but is unsaturated.\n    *   An unsaturated compound with a C6 ring that does not decolorize bromine water is characteristic of an aromatic compound. The only C6 aromatic hydrocarbon is benzene (C6H6). Benzene can be hydrogenated under severe conditions (as mentioned in the problem) to form cyclohexane.\n    *   Therefore, **liquid D is benzene (C6H6)**, and **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   Mixture X \"decolorizes bromine water,\" so at least one of its components is an alkene or alkyne. Since hydrogenation of X yields only cyclohexane, both A and B must be C6 cyclic hydrocarbons.\n    *   The reaction that converts mixture X to mixture Y is a disproportionation reaction catalyzed by platinum. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one component is hydrogenated (reduced) and the other is dehydrogenated (oxidized).\n    *   The overall reaction can be written as:\n        `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Z + D`\n    *   Substituting the identified compounds:\n        `A + B --> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\" This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B.\n    *   Using the principle of conservation of atoms for the balanced chemical reaction:\n        `C6Ha + C6Hb --> C6H12 + C6H6`\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms on the reactant side must equal the total number on the product side.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in Cyclohexane) + (H atoms in Benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6\n    *   Total H atoms = 18\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\n**Detailed reasoning and thinking process:**\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z:**\n    *   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   The mass of hydrogen is ~1 g/mol and the mass of carbon is ~12 g/mol. Let the formula of Z be CnHm.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `m / (12n + m)`.\n    *   Setting this equal to 14.28%, or approximately 1/7:\n        `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`\n        `7m = 12n + m`\n        `6m = 12n`\n        `m = 2n`\n    *   So, the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and its molecular formula is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem also states that Z is formed by hydrogenation of other compounds and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is described as a widely used solvent. The most common liquid cycloalkane solvent that fits this description is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y and its Formation:**\n    *   Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X on a heated platinum catalyst. This type of reaction, especially with cyclic compounds over platinum, often involves hydrogen transfer, leading to both more saturated and less saturated (often aromatic) products.\n    *   Mixture Y consists of two equimolar liquids and does not decolorize bromine water. This implies the components are either saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   One of the components of mixture Y *is* substance Z (cyclohexane, C6H12). Let's call this Y1.\n    *   Let the other component be Y2. Since hydrogenating the entire mixture Y gives only cyclohexane, Y2 must also have a C6 carbon skeleton and hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n    *   Since Y2 is part of a mixture that doesn't decolorize bromine water and is formed by dehydrogenation (part of the disproportionation), the most logical candidate for Y2 is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene has a C6 skeleton, is a liquid, does not decolorize bromine water, and can be hydrogenated under severe conditions (as mentioned in the problem) to form cyclohexane.\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and Determine the Total Hydrogen Atoms:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them X1 and X2.\n    *   The reaction is a disproportionation: `X1 + X2 --(Pt, heat)--> Y1 (cyclohexane) + Y2 (benzene)`\n    *   According to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2) must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products (one molecule of Y1 and one molecule of Y2).\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Thus, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is **18**.\n\n4.  **Verification (Checking the properties of Mixture X):**\n    *   We need to find two C6 compounds, X1 and X2, that fit the description.\n    *   They must decolorize bromine water (be unsaturated).\n    *   They must not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of both must yield cyclohexane.\n    *   The sum of their hydrogen atoms must be 18.\n    *   A plausible pair is **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n        *   Cyclohexene has one double bond and 10 H atoms.\n        *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene has two isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds and 8 H atoms.\n        *   Both are C6 cyclic compounds, will decolorize bromine water, and will hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n        *   The sum of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n        *   The disproportionation reaction `C6H10 + C6H8 -> C6H12 + C6H6` is a balanced hydrogen transfer. The diene is dehydrogenated to benzene, and the ene is hydrogenated to the alkane. This confirms our reasoning is chemically sound.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Our calculation, based on the identified products of the disproportionation, shows this sum is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**: The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n. For any such cycloalkane, the mass percentage of hydrogen is (2n / (12n + 2n)) * 100 = (2n / 14n) * 100 = (1/7) * 100 ≈ 14.28%. The problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent and is formed by the hydrogenation of all other compounds, suggesting a stable structure. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclohexane (C6H12) and cyclopentane (C5H10). Both are used as solvents.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction**: An equimolar mixture X of two unsaturated liquids is heated with platinum, causing a disproportionation reaction to form an equimolar mixture Y of two saturated liquids. A disproportionation reaction is one where a substance is simultaneously oxidized (loses hydrogen) and reduced (gains hydrogen).\n\n3.  **Formulate a Hypothesis**: Let's assume the reaction is of the type:\n    2 * (Reactant) → (Reduced Product) + (Oxidized Product)\n    Since mixture X contains two equimolar liquids (X1 and X2), the reaction is likely X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2. As X1 and X2 are isomers that both hydrogenate to Z, it's reasonable to assume they have the same molecular formula. Let this be CnHx.\n    Mixture Y contains Z (Y1 = CnH2n) and another saturated compound (Y2).\n    So, the overall reaction becomes: 2 * CnHx → CnH2n + CnH(2x-2n).\n\n4.  **Test the Hypothesis with Cyclohexane (n=6)**:\n    *   If Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), then the reaction is 2 * C6Hx → C6H12 + C6H(2x-12).\n    *   Y2, which is C6H(2x-12), must be a saturated hydrocarbon. Saturated C6 hydrocarbons include bicyclic alkanes (C6H10) and tricyclic alkanes (C6H8).\n    *   If Y2 = C6H10 (bicyclic), then 2x-12 = 10, which means x = 11. A C6H11 compound is a radical, which is unlikely for a stable liquid.\n    *   If Y2 = C6H8 (tricyclic), then 2x-12 = 8, which means x = 10. The reactants in mixture X would be isomers of C6H10.\n    *   This leads to a total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X as 10 + 10 = 20. This answer is not among the options (A, B, C, D).\n\n5.  **Test the Hypothesis with Cyclopentane (n=5)**:\n    *   If Z is cyclopentane (C5H10), then the reaction is 2 * C5Hx → C5H10 + C5H(2x-10).\n    *   Y2, which is C5H(2x-10), must be a saturated hydrocarbon. Saturated C5 hydrocarbons can be bicyclic (C5H8) or tricyclic (C5H6).\n    *   If Y2 = C5H8 (bicyclic), then 2x-10 = 8, which means x = 9. A C5H9 compound is a radical, which is unlikely.\n    *   If Y2 = C5H6 (tricyclic), then 2x-10 = 6, which means x = 8. The reactants in mixture X would be isomers of C5H8.\n    *   This scenario is plausible. The components of mixture X (X1 and X2) would both have the formula C5H8. Examples of non-conjugated C5H8 isomers include cyclopentene, 1,4-pentadiene, and methylenecyclobutane.\n\n6.  **Verify the C5 Hypothesis**:\n    *   **Mixture X**: An equimolar mixture of two C5H8 isomers (e.g., cyclopentene and vinylcyclopropane). It is unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   **Reaction**: The disproportionation reaction is C5H8 + C5H8 → C5H10 + C5H6.\n    *   **Mixture Y**: An equimolar mixture of cyclopentane (C5H10, which is Z) and a saturated tricyclic alkane (C5H6). This mixture is saturated and will not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   **Hydrogenation**: Hydrogenation of X (C5H8) gives cyclopentane (C5H10), which is Z. Hydrogenation of Y (C5H10 and C5H6) also gives only cyclopentane (Z) under severe conditions, which involves the ring-opening of the C5H6 component.\n    *   All conditions of the problem are met with this hypothesis.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Answer**: The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   Liquid 1 (X1) has the formula C5H8, so it has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid 2 (X2) has the formula C5H8, so it has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 8 + 8 = 16.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**Step 1: Identify substance Z**\n\nThe problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n*   The general formula for an alkane is CnH2n+2. The mass fraction of hydrogen is (2n+2)/(14n+2). As n increases, this value approaches 2/14 = 1/7 ≈ 14.3%.\n*   The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n. The mass fraction of hydrogen is 2n/14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857.\nThis value is an excellent match for 14.28%. Thus, Z is a cycloalkane.\n\nThe problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common cycloalkane solvent. Additionally, the problem mentions that substance Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. This confirms that Z is a cycloalkane. Based on its common use as a solvent, we can confidently identify **Z as cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify mixture Y**\n\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D, and it does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates that C and D are saturated or aromatic compounds. It is a known chemical fact that benzene does not readily react with bromine water in the absence of a catalyst, unlike unsaturated alkenes.\n\nHydrogenation of mixture Y yields only substance Z (cyclohexane). This means:\n*   Hydrogenation of C → Cyclohexane (Z)\n*   Hydrogenation of D → Cyclohexane (Z)\n\nWe also know that Z is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's assume C is Z.\n*   **C = Cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Cyclohexane is already saturated, so its \"hydrogenation\" product is itself.\n\nNow, what is D? D must be a compound that, upon hydrogenation, yields cyclohexane. A prime candidate is **benzene (C6H6)**. The hydrogenation of benzene produces cyclohexane, although it requires severe conditions.\n\nSo, let's propose that **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**.\nThis fits all the criteria for Y:\n*   It's an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n*   It does not decolorize bromine water (cyclohexane is saturated; benzene is unreactive under these conditions).\n*   Hydrogenation of the mixture (cyclohexane and benzene) produces only cyclohexane.\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a component of Y.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the conversion of X to Y and identify mixture X**\n\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B, which undergoes disproportionation when heated with platinum to form mixture Y.\nThe reaction is:\nA + B --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)\n\nThis type of reaction, where cycloalkenes or cycloalkadienes are converted to a cycloalkane and an aromatic compound over a platinum catalyst, is a well-known process called Zelinsky irreversible catalysis.\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the reactants (one molecule of A + one molecule of B) must equal the total number in the products (one molecule of cyclohexane + one molecule of benzene).\n*   Total C atoms in products = 6 (from C6H12) + 6 (from C6H6) = 12\n*   Total H atoms in products = 12 (from C6H12) + 6 (from C6H6) = 18\n\nTherefore, the combined molecular formula of A and B is C12H18.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This corresponds to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of liquid A and one molecule of liquid B, which is 18.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the properties of mixture X**\n\nLet's check if we can find plausible structures for A and B that fit the remaining criteria.\n*   **Equimolar mixture:** Let A and B be C6Ha and C6Hb.\n*   **Total hydrogens:** a + b = 18.\n*   **Decolorize bromine water:** A and B must be unsaturated (contain double or triple bonds).\n*   **Hydrogenate to cyclohexane:** A and B must have a six-membered carbon ring skeleton.\n*   **No conjugated multiple bonds:** This rules out compounds like cyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n\nA suitable pair for A and B would be **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**.\n*   **Hydrogen sum:** 10 + 8 = 18.\n*   **Unsaturated:** Both have double bonds and will decolorize bromine water.\n*   **Hydrogenation:** Both will hydrogenate to form cyclohexane.\n*   **Non-conjugated:** Cyclohexene has one double bond. Cyclohexa-1,4-diene has two double bonds separated by two single bonds, so they are not conjugated.\n\nThe disproportionation reaction would be:\nC6H10 (Cyclohexene) + C6H8 (Cyclohexa-1,4-diene) → C6H12 (Cyclohexane) + C6H6 (Benzene)\n\nThis scenario is chemically sound and consistent with all the information given in the problem. The core of the solution lies in the stoichiometric balance of the disproportionation reaction.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of A and one of B) is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

Using integer masses for simplicity (H=1, C=12), the fraction is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428` (which is very close to 1/7).\n    *   `7y = 12x + y`\n    *   `6y = 12x`\n    *   `y = 2x`\n    *   The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. This corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Let's verify the mass fraction for cyclohexane: H% = (12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12 * 1) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. This confirms that **Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Carbon Skeleton:**\n    *   Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   This is a crucial piece of information. It means that all the compounds in both mixtures X and Y have the same carbon skeleton: a six-membered ring.\n\n3.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   It does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   One of its components is Z, which is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n    *   Mixture Y is formed by a disproportionation reaction. In catalysis, this often involves hydrogen transfer, leading to a more saturated and a less saturated (often aromatic) compound.\n    *   A plausible second component for Y would be benzene (C₆H₆). Benzene is aromatic and does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions.\n    *   Let's check if this fits: Hydrogenation of mixture Y (cyclohexane + benzene) would convert benzene to cyclohexane (`C₆H₆ + 3H₂ → C₆H₁₂`), and cyclohexane would not react. The final product would be only cyclohexane (Z). This fits perfectly.\n    *   Therefore, **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n4.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that react to form mixture Y.\n    *   The reaction is: `X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`.\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one component of X is reduced to cyclohexane and the other is oxidized to benzene.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms must be conserved. The products have 12 + 6 = 18 hydrogen atoms. Therefore, the two molecules of mixture X must also have a total of 18 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The components of X decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n    *   The components of X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   The logical precursors to cyclohexane and benzene with a C₆ ring are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and cyclohexadienes (C₆H₈).\n    *   There are two isomers of cyclohexadiene: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). The problem states there are no conjugated bonds, so we must use **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   The other component must be **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**.\n    *   Let's check if these two components fit the conditions.\n        *   X₁ = Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)\n        *   X₂ = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)\n        *   Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n        *   Neither has conjugated double bonds.\n        *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a balanced hydrogen transfer. The 1,4-cyclohexadiene is oxidized to benzene, and the cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane.\n        *   Hydrogenation of mixture X (cyclohexene + 1,4-cyclohexadiene) would yield only cyclohexane. This also fits.\n    *   So, **mixture X consists of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   Number of H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) = 10.\n    *   Number of H atoms in one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) = 8.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n**1. Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n*   The general formula for a hydrocarbon is CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by: `(y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008) = 0.1428`.\n*   Using approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12), the formula simplifies to `y / (12x + y) ≈ 0.1428`.\n*   This gives `y ≈ 0.1428 * (12x + y)`, which simplifies to `0.8572y ≈ 1.7136x`, or `y/x ≈ 2`.\n*   The empirical formula is CH₂, and the molecular formula is (CH₂)n or CnH2n.\n*   The problem states that Z is saturated (it does not react further with hydrogen). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in any cycloalkane (CnH2n) is `(2n * 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857`, which matches the given data.\n*   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) is a very common cycloalkane solvent. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n\n**2. Characterize Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is Z, which we've identified as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Mixture X, which is unsaturated, is converted to the saturated/aromatic mixture Y upon heating with platinum. This is described as a disproportionation. This points towards a catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction. A well-known example is the Zelinsky irreversible catalysis, where an unsaturated cyclic compound disproportionates into a saturated cycloalkane and an aromatic compound.\n*   For a C₆ system, a cyclohexene or cyclohexadiene would disproportionate into cyclohexane and benzene.\n*   Let's hypothesize that mixture Y consists of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   This is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   Cyclohexane is saturated and does not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Benzene, due to its aromatic stability, does not react with bromine water under normal conditions. So, mixture Y fits this description.\n    *   Upon hydrogenation, cyclohexane does not react, while benzene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane (C₆H₆ + 3H₂ → C₆H₁₂). Thus, hydrogenating mixture Y gives only cyclohexane (Z). This fits the problem description perfectly.\n\n**3. Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   We have established the reaction that forms Y: `A + B → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`, where A and B are the equimolar components of mixture X.\n*   By balancing the atoms, the sum of the formulas of A and B must be C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   Since A and B are in an equimolar mixture and both get hydrogenated to the same C₆ skeleton (cyclohexane), they must both be C₆ hydrocarbons, let's say C₆Hx and C₆Hy.\n*   Therefore, x + y = 18.\n*   The properties of mixture X are:\n    *   It decolorizes bromine water, so A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   The molecules have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of both A and B yields only cyclohexane (Z). This confirms they must have a six-membered ring structure.\n*   Let's find two non-conjugated, unsaturated C₆ cyclic isomers that fit the condition x + y = 18.\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** is a prime candidate. It has one double bond and would decolorize bromine water. It hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n    *   To satisfy x + y = 18, if A is C₆H₁₀, then B must be C₆H₈.\n    *   We need a non-conjugated C₆H₈ isomer with a six-membered ring. **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits this description perfectly. Its two double bonds are separated by two single bonds, so they are not conjugated. It also hydrogenates to cyclohexane. The other common isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, is conjugated and thus ruled out.\n*   So, mixture X is an equimolar mix of cyclohexene (A = C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (B = C₆H₈).\n*   The disproportionation reaction is: C₆H₁₀ (cyclohexene) + C₆H₈ (1,4-cyclohexadiene) → C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane) + C₆H₆ (benzene). This is a balanced hydrogen transfer reaction. The diene is oxidized to benzene, and the monoene is reduced to the alkane.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) = 10\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) = 8\n\nTotal number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Determine the Molecular Formula of Z**: We'll use the given mass fraction of hydrogen (14.28%) to find the empirical and molecular formula of the hydrocarbon Z. Since Z is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen), it must be an alkane or a cycloalkane. The mass fraction strongly suggests a CnH2n formula, characteristic of a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Identify Z and Mixture Y**: Based on the chemical properties described (common solvent, product of hydrogenation, part of a disproportionation reaction), we can deduce the specific structure of Z. The properties of mixture Y (does not decolorize bromine water, hydrogenates to Z) allow us to identify its two components, one of which is Z. The most plausible scenario involves a C6 carbon skeleton, making Z cyclohexane and the other component of Y benzene.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction**: The reaction where mixture X forms mixture Y is a disproportionation, specifically a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X is dehydrogenated to form benzene, and the other is hydrogenated to form cyclohexane.\n\n4.  **Determine the Total Hydrogen Atoms in X**: By setting up a hydrogen balance for the disproportionation reaction, we can create an equation relating the number of hydrogen atoms in the two components of mixture X. Solving this equation will give the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two molecules, which is the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the chemistry problem by following a logical deduction based on the provided information.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of hydrocarbon Z.\n    # Z is a hydrocarbon (CnHm) with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    # Mass fraction H = (mass of H) / (total mass)\n    # Using approximate atomic masses C=12, H=1:\n    # 0.1428 is approximately 1/7.\n    # For a formula CnHm, the mass fraction of H is m / (12n + m).\n    # m / (12n + m) = 1/7  => 7m = 12n + m => 6m = 12n => m = 2n.\n    # The formula for Z is CnH2n.

Since the empirical formula is CH2, the molecular formula must be of the form CnH2n. This indicates that Z is a cycloalkane.\nLet's verify the mass fraction for CnH2n:\nMass % H = (2n * 1.008) / (n * 12.011 + 2n * 1.008) = 2.016n / 14.027n ≈ 0.1437, which is very close to 14.28% (1/7 ≈ 0.142857). So, Z is indeed a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify hydrocarbon Z and mixture Y.**\n*   Z is a cycloalkane (CnH2n) widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n*   Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* Z. This implies that all components of X and Y have a carbon skeleton that can be converted to the skeleton of Z upon hydrogenation. If Z is cyclohexane, all components must have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n*   Mixture Y is formed from X, does not decolorize bromine water, and contains Z as one of its components. Let Y = {Z, W}.\n*   Since Y does not decolorize bromine water, both Z and W must be saturated compounds (or aromatic, which also doesn't react with bromine water).\n*   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. This means hydrogenation of Z gives Z (no reaction), and hydrogenation of W must also give Z.\n*   This leads to a crucial point. If W is a saturated cycloalkane isomer of Z (like methylcyclopentane), its hydrogenation to Z would involve skeletal rearrangement, which is possible under \"severe conditions\". However, let's consider the disproportionation reaction first.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the disproportionation reaction and identify mixture X.**\n*   The reaction is: Mixture X → Mixture Y. This is a disproportionation.\n*   Let the two components of the equimolar mixture X be A and B. Let the two components of the equimolar mixture Y be Z and W.\n*   The reaction is: A + B → Z + W (in a 1:1 molar ratio).\n*   This is an intermolecular hydrogen transfer. One molecule is hydrogenated (reduced) and the other is dehydrogenated (oxidized).\n*   We know Z is cyclohexane (C6H12). So, one product is saturated.\n*   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means W must also not react with bromine water. A highly unsaturated but stable aromatic compound like benzene (C6H6) fits this description. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions.\n*   Let's test this hypothesis: Y = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y: Cyclohexane is already saturated. Benzene hydrogenates to cyclohexane (C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12). So, hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only cyclohexane (Z). This fits the condition.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of Y. This fits.\n*   Now we can deduce A and B from the reaction: A + B → C6H12 + C6H6.\n    *   The total atoms on the product side are C12H18. This must be the same for the reactants A + B.\n    *   A and B are in an equimolar mixture, and their hydrogenation both yield cyclohexane. This means A and B must be unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons with a six-membered ring skeleton.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B must contain C=C double bonds.\n    *   The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X.\n    *   Let's find two C6 cyclic alkenes, A and B, that sum to C12H18. The most common ones are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadienes (C6H8).\n    *   If we take A = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = a cyclohexadiene (C6H8), the total formula is C10H10 + C6H8 = C12H18. This matches the products.\n    *   The problem specifies no conjugated bonds. 1,3-Cyclohexadiene is conjugated. Therefore, the diene must be 1,4-Cyclohexadiene.\n*   So, let's finalize the identities:\n    *   **Mixture X** = {Cyclohexene (C6H10), 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)}\n    *   **Mixture Y** = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}\n    *   **Substance Z** = Cyclohexane (C6H12)\n\n**Step 4: Verify all conditions.**\n*   **X**: Equimolar mixture of two liquids (C6H10, C6H8). Decolorizes Br2 water (due to C=C). No conjugated bonds (1,4-diene is not conjugated). **(Checks out)**\n*   **Reaction**: C6H10 + C6H8 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 + C6H6. This is a disproportionation (hydrogen transfer) yielding an equimolar mixture Y. **(Checks out)**\n*   **Y**: Equimolar mixture of two liquids (C6H12, C6H6). Does not decolorize Br2 water (cyclohexane is saturated, benzene is unreactive). **(Checks out)**\n*   **Hydrogenation of X**: C6H10 + H2 → C6H12. C6H8 + 2H2 → C6H12. Gives only Z. **(Checks out)**\n*   **Hydrogenation of Y**: C6H12 → C6H12. C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12. Gives only Z. **(Checks out)**\n*   **Z**: C6H12, a hydrocarbon solvent, H% is 14.28%, constituent of Y. **(Checks out)**\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final answer.**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   Liquid 1: Cyclohexene (C6H10) has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Liquid 2: 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\nThe problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as:\nMass Fraction H = (Total mass of H) / (Total molecular mass)\n\nThe value 14.28% is equivalent to the decimal 0.1428. This value is very close to the fraction 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). Let's assume the ratio of hydrogen mass to total mass is 1/7. Using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1) for simplicity:\n1/7 = (y × 1) / (x × 12 + y × 1)\n12x + y = 7y\n12x = 6y\ny/x = 2/1\n\nThis gives an empirical formula of CH2. The general molecular formula is therefore (CH2)n, or CnH2n.\nThe problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which means it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\nZ is also described as being \"widely used as a solvent.\" The most common cycloalkane solvent that fits this description is cyclohexane, C6H12.\nThis fits all the descriptions, so we can confidently identify **Z as cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. We are told that Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of Y. Let's call the two components of Y, C and D. So, C = Z = cyclohexane (C6H12).\nMixture Y \"does not decolorize bromine water.\" Cyclohexane (C) is saturated and does not react. Therefore, the other component, D, must also not decolorize bromine water. This suggests D is either a saturated compound or an aromatic compound (which does not react with bromine water without a catalyst).\nThe problem states that hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane).\nHydrogenation(C + D) → Z only\nHydrogenation(cyclohexane + D) → cyclohexane only\nSince cyclohexane is already saturated, it does not react. This means that the hydrogenation of D must yield cyclohexane.\nSo, D must be a C6 hydrocarbon that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. Given that D does not decolorize bromine water, the most plausible candidate is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water under standard test conditions, and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane.\nTherefore, **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\nThe reaction X → Y is a disproportionation reaction, which means one component is oxidized while the other is reduced.\nA + B → C + D\nA + B → cyclohexane (C6H12) + benzene (C6H6)\nThis is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X loses hydrogen to form benzene (oxidation), and the other component gains hydrogen to form cyclohexane (reduction).\nThe total number of atoms must be conserved.\nTotal C atoms in products = 6 (from benzene) + 6 (from cyclohexane) = 12.\nTotal H atoms in products = 6 (from benzene) + 12 (from cyclohexane) = 18.\nTherefore, the two molecules A and B together must contain 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms.\n\nWe are also told that hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both A and B are C6 hydrocarbons, and their carbon skeletons can be hydrogenated to a six-membered ring. So, A = C6Hx and B = C6Hy.\nFrom the atom balance, we have x + y = 18.\n\nWe have several constraints for A and B:\n1.  Mixture X \"decolorizes bromine water,\" so at least one component must be unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds). This means their hydrogen counts must be less than that of the corresponding saturated cycloalkane (C6H12). So, x < 12 and y < 12.\n2.  \"There are no conjugated multiple bonds\" in the molecules of X.\n\nWe need to find two different integers, x and y, that satisfy x + y = 18, with both x < 12 and y < 12. Since stable hydrocarbons typically have an even number of hydrogen atoms, we look for a pair of even integers. The only pair that fits these conditions is **8 and 10**.\nSo, the components of mixture X have the formulas C6H8 and C6H10.\n\nLet's identify the specific structures:\n*   **C6H10**: This must be **cyclohexene**. It has one double bond, so it decolorizes bromine water. It is not conjugated. It hydrogenates to cyclohexane. This fits all conditions.\n*   **C6H8**: This must be a cyclohexadiene. The condition \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" rules out 1,3-cyclohexadiene. Therefore, it must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**. It has two isolated double bonds, decolorizes bromine water, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. This also fits all conditions.\n\nSo, mixture X consists of **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n\n**Step 4: Answer the question.**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two components.\n-   Number of hydrogen atoms in cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10\n-   Number of hydrogen atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) = 8\nTotal number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n```python\n# This code performs the final addition based on the derived molecular formulas.\n# The first liquid in mixture X is cyclohexene, C6H10.\n# The second liquid in mixture X is 1,4-cyclohexadiene, C6H8.\nhydrogen_atoms_in_liquid_1 = 10\nhydrogen_atoms_in_liquid_2 = 8\ntotal_hydrogen_atoms = hydrogen_atoms_in_liquid_1 + hydrogen_atoms_in_liquid_2\nprint(total_hydrogen_atoms)\n```\n<<<D>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: 18\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z\n\nThe problem states that substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let's determine its general formula.\n\n*   The mass percentage of hydrogen is approximately 14.28%, which is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n*   If Z were an alkane with the formula CₙH₂ₙ₊₂, the mass fraction of hydrogen would be (2n + 2) / (12n + 2n + 2) = (2n + 2) / (14n + 2). Setting this to 1/7 gives 14n + 14 = 14n + 2, which is impossible.\n*   If Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CₙH₂ₙ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is 2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7. This matches the given value of 14.28%.\n\nTherefore, Z is a cycloalkane. The problem also mentions that Z is widely used as a solvent. A very common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Composition of Mixture Y\n\nMixture Y is formed from the disproportionation of mixture X. Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic. We also know that:\n*   Substance Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only Z (cyclohexane).\n\nLet the two components of Y be C and D. We can set C = Z = cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). For the hydrogenation of Y to yield only cyclohexane, the other component, D, must also be converted into cyclohexane.\n\nThe reaction X → Y is a disproportionation, which in this context is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One species is reduced (gains hydrogen) and another is oxidized (loses hydrogen). Since one product is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), the fully reduced C₆ ring, the other product (D) is likely the fully dehydrogenated C₆ ring, which is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\nLet's check if this composition for Y fits the description:\n*   **Mixture Y = {cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), benzene (C₆H₆)}**\n*   **Does not decolorize bromine water**: Correct. Cyclohexane is saturated, and benzene, due to its aromatic stability, does not react with bromine water under normal conditions.\n*   **Hydrogenation gives only Z**: Hydrogenation of cyclohexane gives cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane (C₆H₆ + 3H₂ → C₆H₁₂). This is consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction and Mixture X\n\nThe transformation of mixture X into mixture Y is a disproportionation reaction catalyzed by platinum. Since Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and benzene, the reaction can be written as:\n\n**Component A + Component B (from Mixture X) → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆ (Mixture Y)**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms must be the same on both sides of the equation. Both components of X must have a C₆ carbon skeleton because their hydrogenation leads to a C₆ product (cyclohexane). Let the formulas of the two components of X be C₆Hₐ and C₆Hₑ.\n\nThe hydrogen balance is:\na + b = 12 + 6\na + b = 18\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is precisely the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component, which is 18.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Properties of Mixture X\n\nWe can further validate this by identifying plausible structures for the components of X.\n*   They must be unsaturated C₆ compounds to decolorize bromine water.\n*   They must not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   The reaction C₆Hₐ + C₆Hₑ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆ must be a balanced hydrogen transfer.\n\nA plausible scenario is the transfer of two hydrogen atoms:\n*   C₆H₁₀ + 2H → C₆H₁₂ (Reduction)\n*   C₆H₈ - 2H → C₆H₆ (Oxidation/Dehydrogenation)\n\nThis implies that mixture X is composed of a C₆H₁₀ isomer and a C₆H₈ isomer.\n*   **C₆H₁₀**: **Cyclohexene**. It has one double bond, decolorizes bromine water, and its hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. It does not have conjugated bonds.\n*   **C₆H₈**: A cyclohexadiene. To meet the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" condition, this must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**, not the conjugated 1,3-cyclohexadiene. 1,4-cyclohexadiene decolorizes bromine water and its hydrogenation also yields cyclohexane.\n\nThe disproportionation of cyclohexene and a cyclohexadiene over a platinum catalyst to yield cyclohexane and benzene is a known type of reaction, often referred to as Zelinsky irreversible catalysis.\n\nThus, a mixture X composed of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) fits all the conditions described in the problem. The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of these two liquids is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the answer based on the provided chemical problem.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z\n\n1.  **Analyze the composition of Z**: The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n2.  **Determine the formula type**: The mass percentage 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n    *   For a general cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n, the mass fraction of hydrogen is (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7. This matches the given data.\n    *   For a general alkane with the formula CnH2n+2, the mass fraction of hydrogen would be (2n+2) / (14n+2). Setting this to 1/7 leads to 14n + 14 = 14n + 2, which is impossible.\n3.  **Conclusion for Z**: Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n. The problem also mentions it is a widely used solvent. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common cycloalkane solvent. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n\n1.  **Properties of Y**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n2.  **Components of Y**: One component of Y is Z, which we identified as cyclohexane (C6H12).\n3.  **Hydrogenation of Y**: Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that all components of Y must have the same carbon skeleton. The other component must be a C6 compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n4.  **Identify the second component**: Since the second component does not decolorize bromine water, it is likely aromatic. Benzene (C6H6) is the aromatic compound with a C6 skeleton. Benzene does not react with bromine water under normal conditions. Hydrogenation of benzene produces cyclohexane.\n5.  **Conclusion for Y**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X and the Reaction\n\n1.  **Properties of X**: Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, indicating they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds). The molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n2.  **Hydrogenation of X**: Hydrogenation of mixture X also yields only Z (cyclohexane). This confirms that both components of X are C6 cyclic compounds.\n3.  **The Reaction (X → Y)**: Mixture X is converted to mixture Y upon heating with platinum. This is described as a disproportionation reaction, which in this context is a hydrogen transfer.\n    *   Let the two components of X be A and B.\n    *   The reaction is: A + B → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6).\n4.  **Conservation of Atoms**: Since the reaction is a 1:1 transformation of an equimolar mixture, we can balance the atoms. Let A be C6Hx and B be C6Hy.\n    *   Carbon atoms are already balanced (6+6 → 6+6).\n    *   Hydrogen atoms must also be balanced: x + y = 12 (from cyclohexane) + 6 (from benzene) = 18.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Structures of Components in X and Calculate the Final Answer\n\n1.  **Identify possible structures**: The components of X (A and B) must be unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons without conjugated bonds. The most common examples are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadienes (C6H8).\n2.  **Check for non-conjugated bonds**:\n    *   Cyclohexene (C6H10) has one double bond, so there is no conjugation. This is a valid candidate.\n    *   Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) exists as two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). The problem specifies no conjugated bonds, so the component must be 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n3.  **Solve for components**: We need two molecules whose hydrogen counts (x and y) sum to 18.\n    *   If we choose A = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8), the total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n4.  **Verify the reaction**: The proposed reaction is:\n    Cyclohexene (C6H10) + 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)\n    This is a plausible hydrogen transfer reaction where 1,4-cyclohexadiene is dehydrogenated to benzene, and cyclohexene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane. Such disproportionation and hydrogen transfer reactions over platinum catalysts are well-documented.\n5.  **Calculate the final answer**: The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in Cyclohexene) + (H atoms in 1,4-Cyclohexadiene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify Substance Z**\n\n*   Substance Z is a hydrocarbon formed from the hydrogenation of other hydrocarbons, and it does not react further with hydrogen. This indicates Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (an alkane or a cycloalkane).\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is given as 14.28%. Let the formula for Z be CnHm.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as: `(m * Ar(H)) / (n * Ar(C) + m * Ar(H))`, where Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\n*   So, `m / (12n + m) = 0.1428`.\n*   The value 0.1428 is equivalent to 1/7.\n*   `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`\n*   `7m = 12n + m`\n*   `6m = 12n`\n*   `m = 2n`\n*   The general formula for Z is CnH2n. Since Z is a saturated hydrocarbon, it must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem states that Z is widely used as a solvent. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common cycloalkane solvent that fits this description.\n*   Let's verify the mass fraction for cyclohexane (C6H12): `(12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12 * 1) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 0.1428`. This matches perfectly.\n*   Therefore, substance Z is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n**2. Analyze the Reactions and Mixtures**\n\n*   **Hydrogenation:** Both mixture X and mixture Y, when hydrogenated under severe conditions, yield only cyclohexane (Z). This implies that all constituent compounds in both mixtures are composed of a six-carbon atom ring structure.\n*   **Mixture Y:** Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated. One of its components is Z, which is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's call the components of Y, C and D. So, D = Z = cyclohexane (C6H12). The other component, C, must also be saturated and must produce cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. A well-known substance that fits this description is benzene (C6H6). Benzene is aromatic and does not decolorize bromine water without a catalyst. Under severe conditions (high pressure and temperature), it can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n*   So, mixture Y consists of benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12). This is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that do not decolorize bromine water, and one component is Z. This fits the description.\n\n**3. Deduce the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   **Disproportionation Reaction:** Mixture X is converted to mixture Y upon heating with platinum. This is described as a disproportionation reaction. In this context, it is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one molecule is dehydrogenated (oxidized) and another is hydrogenated (reduced).\n*   The reaction is: Mixture X → Mixture Y\n*   Let the components of the equimolar mixture X be A and B.\n*   The reaction is: A + B → Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   This reaction must be balanced in terms of atoms. The products have a total of 12 carbon atoms (6+6) and 18 hydrogen atoms (6+12). Therefore, the reactants A and B must also have a total of 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms. Since all compounds have a C6 skeleton, A is C6Hx and B is C6Hy, where x + y = 18.\n*   **Properties of Mixture X:**\n    *   It is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   It decolorizes bromine water, so A and B must be unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   The molecules in X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Let's consider the hydrogen transfer. To form benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12), one reactant must donate hydrogen and the other must accept it. A plausible scenario involves cyclohexene and a cyclohexadiene.\n*   Let's identify A and B. A logical candidate for the hydrogen acceptor is cyclohexene (C6H10). A logical candidate for the hydrogen donor is a cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   The reaction would be: Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) + Cyclohexene (C6H10) → Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Let's check the atom balance:\n    *   Carbons: 6 + 6 = 12 on the left; 6 + 6 = 12 on the right. (Balanced)\n    *   Hydrogens: 8 + 10 = 18 on the left; 6 + 12 = 18 on the right. (Balanced)\n*   This reaction is a known type of disproportionation called Zelinsky-Kazansky catalysis, where a hydrogen donor (like a diene) and a hydrogen acceptor (like an alkene) react over a platinum catalyst to yield more stable products (an aromatic compound and an alkane).\n*   Now let's check if these components for X fit all conditions:\n    *   **A = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8):** It is unsaturated. The double bonds are not conjugated. It hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n    *   **B = Cyclohexene (C6H10):** It is unsaturated. It has only one double bond, so no conjugation. It hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n*   Mixture X = {1,4-Cyclohexadiene, Cyclohexene}. This fits all the given conditions.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This refers to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) = 8.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in Cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `mass % H = (mass of H) / (total mass) * 100%`.\n    *   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CnHm. The mass is `12n + m` (using approximate atomic masses C=12, H=1).\n    *   The mass fraction of H is `m / (12n + m)`.\n    *   `m / (12n + m) = 0.1428`.\n    *   This value, 14.28%, is very close to 1/7 (`1/7 ≈ 0.142857`).\n    *   So, `m / (12n + m) ≈ 1/7`, which gives `7m ≈ 12n + m`, so `6m ≈ 12n`, which simplifies to `m ≈ 2n`.\n    *   A hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n can be an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means the components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one component of Y is the cycloalkane Z (CnH2n).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. This means the other component of Y, let's call it Y2, must also be converted to Z upon hydrogenation.\n    *   Since Y2 does not decolorize bromine water, it is not a simple alkene/alkyne. For it to be hydrogenated to a cycloalkane Z (CnH2n), Y2 is most likely an aromatic hydrocarbon. The hydrogenation of an aromatic ring requires severe conditions, which is mentioned in the problem.\n    *   The most common and stable aromatic hydrocarbons are based on a benzene ring. Let's assume the simplest case, where the carbon skeleton is a six-membered ring (n=6).\n    *   This makes Z = cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   The corresponding aromatic compound Y2 would be benzene (C6H6).\n    *   Let's check if this fits: Hydrogenation of benzene (C6H6 + 3H2) gives cyclohexane (C6H12). This is consistent.\n    *   So, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (Z) and benzene. Both are liquids and neither decolorizes bromine water under normal conditions. This fits all the criteria for Y.\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture X and the Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2, that undergoes disproportionation on a heated platinum catalyst to form an equimolar mixture of Y = (cyclohexane, benzene).\n    *   The overall reaction is: `X1 + X2 -> C6H12 + C6H6`.\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. To balance the atoms, the total formula of the reactants must be C12H18. Since X is an equimolar mixture, each molecule on average has the formula C6H9.\n    *   Let X1 be C6Ha and X2 be C6Hb. Since the mixture is equimolar, the average number of hydrogen atoms is `(a + b) / 2 = 9`, which means `a + b = 18`.\n    *   The components of X decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated. They must also have a C6 ring skeleton because their hydrogenation leads to cyclohexane.\n    *   The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X.\n    *   Let's look for possible unsaturated C6-ring compounds:\n        *   Cyclohexene (C6H10). It has one double bond (non-conjugated). `a = 10`.\n        *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8). It has two non-conjugated double bonds. `b = 8`. (1,3-Cyclohexadiene is conjugated and thus excluded).\n    *   Let's check if these two compounds fit the condition `a + b = 18`.\n    *   `10 + 8 = 18`. Yes, they fit perfectly.\n    *   So, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n\n4.  **Verify the Entire Process:**\n    *   **X**: Equimolar mix of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Both are unsaturated and non-conjugated.\n    *   **Reaction**: `C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)`. This is a known catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction. 1,4-cyclohexadiene acts as the hydrogen donor (is oxidized to benzene), and cyclohexene acts as the hydrogen acceptor (is reduced to cyclohexane). The reaction produces an equimolar mixture of products.\n    *   **Y**: Equimolar mix of cyclohexane and benzene. Both are \"saturated\" towards bromine water.\n    *   **Z**: Cyclohexane (C6H12). It is a component of Y, a common solvent, and fits the mass percentage of hydrogen.\n    *   **Hydrogenation of X**: `C6H10 + H2 -> C6H12` and `C6H8 + 2H2 -> C6H12`. Both give only Z.\n    *   **Hydrogenation of Y**: `C6H12 -> C6H12` and `C6H6 + 3H2 -> C6H12`. Both give only Z.\n    *   All conditions of the problem are satisfied.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Liquid 1 (X1) is cyclohexene (C6H10), which has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid 2 (X2) is 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), which has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Substance Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let its formula be CnHm.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `Mass Fraction H = (m * Ar(H)) / (n * Ar(C) + m * Ar(H))`. Using atomic masses Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\n*   `0.1428 = m / (12n + m)`\n*   This can be rearranged to `m / (12n) ≈ 0.1428 / (1 - 0.1428) = 0.1428 / 0.8572 ≈ 1/6`.\n*   So, `m / n ≈ 12 / 6 = 2`. The empirical formula of Z is CH2.\n*   The general formula for a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen-to-carbon ratio of 2 is CnH2n.\n*   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a fully saturated hydrocarbon. A hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n that is saturated must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in any cycloalkane CnH2n is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857`, which matches the given 14.28%.\n*   So, Z is a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Mixture Y and Identify Z**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are either saturated (alkanes/cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n*   Z is a constituent of Y. Let's assume C = Z. So, C is a cycloalkane.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z.\n    *   `Hydrogenation(C) -> Z`: Since C=Z and Z is a saturated cycloalkane, it does not react. This is consistent.\n    *   `Hydrogenation(D) -> Z`: D must be converted to Z. Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it's not a typical alkene or alkyne. The two main possibilities are:\n        1.  D is a saturated isomer of Z (e.g., methylcyclopentane if Z is cyclohexane). These can isomerize to the more stable Z under severe hydrogenation conditions.\n        2.  D is an aromatic compound that hydrogenates to Z (e.g., benzene hydrogenates to cyclohexane). Benzene does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation. This is a type of redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In hydrocarbon chemistry, this often involves the transfer of hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction**\n\n*   Mixture X (equimolar A + B) is converted to Mixture Y (equimolar C + D).\n*   The simplest stoichiometric representation of this is: `A + B -> C + D`.\n*   Let's consider the two possibilities for D identified in Step 2, assuming the most common cycloalkane solvent, cyclohexane (C6H12), as Z.\n    *   **Case 1**: Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12), and D is a saturated isomer, also C6H12.\n        The reaction would be `A + B -> C6H12 + C6H12`.\n        By conservation of hydrogen atoms, if A is C6Hx and B is C6Hy, then `x + y = 12 + 12 = 24`.\n        However, A and B are components of mixture X, which decolorizes bromine water, so they must be unsaturated. They also hydrogenate to form Z (cyclohexane), so they must be C6 compounds. The most hydrogen-rich unsaturated C6 cyclic compound is cyclohexene (C6H10). If both A and B were cyclohexene (which is not possible as they are different liquids), the total hydrogen count would be 10 + 10 = 20. For any other pair of different unsaturated C6 cyclic compounds, the sum will be less than 20. Therefore, `x + y = 24` is impossible. This case is ruled out.\n    *   **Case 2**: Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12), and D is its aromatic counterpart, Benzene (C6H6).\n        This fits the properties of Y: {cyclohexane, benzene} is a mixture of two liquids that do not decolorize bromine water, and upon severe hydrogenation, both yield cyclohexane. Z (cyclohexane) is a component.\n        The reaction is `A + B -> C6H12 + C6H6`.\n        By conservation of hydrogen atoms, `x + y = 12 + 6 = 18`. This is a plausible outcome.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   We need to find two different liquids, A (C6Hx) and B (C6Hy), that satisfy the following conditions:\n    1.  `x + y = 18`.\n    2.  Both A and B are unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water). This means x < 12 and y < 12.\n    3.  Hydrogenation of both A and B yields cyclohexane (Z). This implies they have a six-membered carbon ring skeleton.\n    4.  There are no conjugated multiple bonds in A or B.\n*   Let's list the possible non-conjugated unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons:\n    *   Cyclohexene (C6H10). Here, x = 10.\n    *   Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8). Here, x = 8. (Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is conjugated and thus excluded).\n*   Let's see if we can form a pair from these that sums to 18.\n    *   If we choose A = Cyclohexene (C6H10), then `10 + y = 18`, which gives `y = 8`.\n    *   This means B must be C6H8. The non-conjugated option is Cyclohexa-1,4-diene.\n*   So, the mixture X consists of A = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8). This pair fits all the conditions of the problem. The disproportionation reaction is a hydrogen transfer from the diene to the alkene: `C6H8 + C6H10 -> C6H6 + C6H12`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of liquid A and one molecule of liquid B.\n*   Number of H atoms in A (Cyclohexene, C6H10) = 10.\n*   Number of H atoms in B (Cyclohexa-1,4-diene, C6H8) = 8.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze and identify the hydrocarbon Z.**\nThe problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let the general formula of the hydrocarbon be CnHm. The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as:\nMass % H = (Total mass of H) / (Total molar mass of compound) * 100%\nMass % H = (m × Ar(H)) / (n × Ar(C) + m × Ar(H)) * 100%\n\nUsing the approximate atomic masses Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12, we can set up the equation. The value 14.28% is a well-known fraction: 14.28% ≈ 100/7 % = 1/7.\nSo, we can write:\nm / (12n + m) = 1/7\n7m = 12n + m\n6m = 12n\nm = 2n\n\nThis gives the general formula for Z as CnH2n. The problem also states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze mixture Y and the disproportionation reaction.**\nMixture Y is formed by heating mixture X with platinum, which causes a disproportionation. Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic. We also know that Z is one of the components of Y.\nSo, one component of Y is a cycloalkane (Z, with formula CnH2n). For the mixture to not decolorize bromine water, the other component must also be saturated or aromatic.\n\nThe reaction type (heating with a platinum catalyst leading to disproportionation) is characteristic of catalytic hydrogen transfer, often called Zelinsky irreversible catalysis. In this reaction, an unsaturated cyclic compound is converted into a mixture of a fully saturated cycloalkane and an aromatic compound.\nTherefore, mixture Y consists of a cycloalkane (Z) and an aromatic compound.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the specific structures of the compounds in Y.**\nThe problem states that hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z.\nLet Y = {Z, Aromatic Compound}.\nHydrogenation of Z (which is already a saturated cycloalkane) will just yield Z.\nTherefore, hydrogenation of the aromatic compound must also yield Z. This is a crucial clue: the aromatic compound and the cycloalkane Z must have the same carbon skeleton.\n\nLet's test possible ring sizes:\n*   **If the ring size is 6:** Z would be cyclohexane (C6H12). The corresponding aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton is benzene (C6H6). Hydrogenation of benzene does indeed produce cyclohexane. This is a consistent scenario. Also, cyclohexane is widely used as a solvent, matching the description of Z.\n*   **If the ring size is 7:** Z would be cycloheptane (C7H14). The corresponding aromatic compound would be toluene (C7H8). Hydrogenation of toluene yields methylcyclohexane, not cycloheptane. Their carbon skeletons are different (a 6-membered ring with a methyl group vs. a 7-membered ring). This scenario is incorrect.\n*   **If the ring size is 8:** Z would be cyclooctane (C8H16). The corresponding aromatic compounds (e.g., ethylbenzene, xylenes) would hydrogenate to ethylcyclohexane or dimethylcyclohexanes, not cyclooctane. This is also incorrect.\n\nThe only plausible case is the 6-carbon system.\nThus, we can identify:\n*   **Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12)**\n*   **Mixture Y = An equimolar mixture of Cyclohexane and Benzene (C6H6)**\n\n**Step 4: Identify the components of mixture X.**\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (A and B) that reacts to form Y.\n*   **Reaction:** A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)\n*   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one molecule is reduced (accepts hydrogen) and the other is oxidized (donates hydrogen).\n*   **Properties of X:**\n    1.  It decolorizes bromine water, so A and B are unsaturated.\n    2.  Hydrogenation of both A and B gives cyclohexane, so they must both be C6 cyclic compounds.\n    3.  There are no conjugated multiple bonds in A or B.\n\nLet's consider possible unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons:\n*   **Cyclohexene (C6H10):** Has one double bond (non-conjugated). It can be reduced to cyclohexane. This is a candidate.\n*   **Cyclohexadienes (C6H8):**\n    *   1,3-Cyclohexadiene: Has conjugated double bonds, so it is excluded by the problem statement.\n    *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene: Has isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds. It can be reduced to cyclohexane and oxidized to benzene. This is a candidate.\n\nLet's propose that mixture X consists of cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n*   Let A = Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n*   Let B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)\n\nThe disproportionation reaction would be:\nC6H10 (hydrogen acceptor) + C6H8 (hydrogen donor) → C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\nThis reaction is balanced and fits all the conditions described in the problem.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final answer.**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in Cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) = 8\n\nTotal number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   Let the formula of Z be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by (mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * 1.008) / (x * 12.01 + y * 1.008).\n*   The value 14.28% is a very close approximation of 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). This implies that for every 1 unit of mass from hydrogen, there are 6 units of mass from carbon.\n*   The mass ratio of Carbon to Hydrogen is approximately 6:1.\n*   The atomic mass ratio of Carbon to Hydrogen is approximately 12:1.\n*   To find the atom ratio (y/x), we can set up the equation: (12 * x) / (1 * y) = 6 / 1, which simplifies to y/x = 12/6 = 2.\n*   Therefore, the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and its general molecular formula is CnH2n.\n*   This general formula corresponds to either an alkene (with one double bond) or a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem states that \"Z does not react further with hydrogen\". This means Z is a saturated compound, as an alkene would react with hydrogen (hydrogenation). Thus, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent\". Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclohexane (C6H12) and methylcyclohexane (C7H14), both of which fit the CnH2n formula.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, which we can call Y1 and Y2.\n*   Mixture Y \"does not decolorize bromine water\", which means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's assume Y1 = Z. So, Y1 is a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n*   \"Hydrogenation of ... mixture Y ... gives only one substance, ... Z\".\n*   Since Y1 is already Z (a saturated cycloalkane), it will not react with hydrogen. Therefore, the hydrogenation of Y2 must produce Z.\n*   Y2 does not decolorize bromine water, but it can be hydrogenated to the cycloalkane Z. This is characteristic of an aromatic compound that has the same carbon skeleton as Z. Aromatic compounds are resistant to reaction with bromine water but can be hydrogenated to the corresponding cycloalkane under severe conditions (high pressure and/or temperature).\n*   So, mixture Y consists of a cycloalkane (Z) and its corresponding aromatic hydrocarbon.\n    *   **Scenario A (C6 system):** If Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), then Y2 must be benzene (C6H6). Mixture Y = {cyclohexane, benzene}.\n    *   **Scenario B (C7 system):** If Z is methylcyclohexane (C7H14), then Y2 must be toluene (C7H8). Mixture Y = {methylcyclohexane, toluene}.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n*   Mixture X \"decolorizes bromine water\", meaning X1 and X2 are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n*   \"Hydrogenation of ... mixture X ... gives only one substance, ... Z\". This tells us that both X1 and X2 have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n*   The reaction X → Y is a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst. In this context, it is a hydrogen transfer reaction. Since X and Y are both equimolar mixtures, the reaction can be written as:\n    X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2\n*   Let's analyze the hydrogen balance for our two scenarios.\n    *   **Scenario A (C6 system):** The products are cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6). The reactants, X1 and X2, must both be C6 cyclic compounds. The total number of hydrogen atoms in the products is 12 + 6 = 18. By conservation of mass, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (one molecule of X1 and one of X2) must also be 18.\n    *   **Scenario B (C7 system):** The products are methylcyclohexane (C7H14) and toluene (C7H8). The total number of hydrogen atoms is 14 + 8 = 22.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   Let's focus on the more common and fundamental **Scenario A (C6 system)**.\n*   We need to find two unsaturated C6 cyclic compounds, X1 and X2, whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18.\n*   Possible unsaturated C6 cyclic compounds include cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadienes (C6H8).\n*   If we choose X1 = cyclohexene (C6H10) and X2 = a cyclohexadiene (C6H8), the total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our requirement.\n*   The problem adds a crucial constraint: \"There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X\".\n    *   Cyclohexene (C6H10) has only one double bond, so it is not conjugated.\n    *   There are two common cyclohexadienes: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated).\n    *   To satisfy the condition, X2 must be 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   So, mixture X is {cyclohexene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene}.\n*   The disproportionation reaction is:\n    C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\n    This is a plausible hydrogen transfer reaction where the diene is dehydrogenated to benzene, and the released hydrogen atoms hydrogenate the cyclohexene to cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 5: Final Calculation**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene (C6H10) and one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D. While the C7 scenario is also theoretically possible (leading to 22 hydrogen atoms, option B), the C6 system involving cyclohexane and benzene is a classic and fundamental example in organic chemistry, making it the most probable intended answer for this type of problem.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n### 1. Identifying Hydrocarbon Z\n\n*   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon is given by the formula: `(mass of H) / (total mass)`. Using the atomic masses of Carbon (≈12 g/mol) and Hydrogen (≈1 g/mol), we can test the general formulas for hydrocarbons.\n    *   For an alkane (CnH2n+2): Mass % H = `(2n + 2) / (14n + 2)`. This equation does not yield an integer `n` for 14.28%.\n    *   For a cycloalkane (CnH2n): Mass % H = `(2n) / (14n)` = `2 / 14` = `1 / 7` ≈ 0.142857.\n*   This matches the given value of 14.28%. Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n.\n*   We are also told that Z is widely used as a solvent and is the sole product of the hydrogenation of all other compounds. This points to a very stable and common cycloalkane. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a prime candidate, as it is a widely used solvent and is the most stable six-carbon cycloalkane. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n### 2. Identifying the Components of Mixture Y\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates the components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y yields only Z. Let the components of Y be Z and another substance, D.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Z (cyclohexane) gives cyclohexane.\n    *   Hydrogenation of D must also yield cyclohexane.\n*   Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it could be a saturated isomer of cyclohexane (like methylcyclopentane) or an aromatic compound. Benzene (C6H6) does not react with bromine water without a catalyst and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n*   The formation of Y is described as a disproportionation. A classic example of a disproportionation reaction involving cyclic compounds is the conversion of a cycloalkene or cycloalkadiene into a cycloalkane and an aromatic compound. For instance, cyclohexene can disproportionate to form cyclohexane and benzene. This strongly suggests that the other component (D) is benzene (C6H6).\n*   So, Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}. This mixture is equimolar and its components fit the description.\n\n### 3. Identifying the Components of Mixture X and Solving the Question\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n*   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n*   The molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   The reaction from X to Y is: `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`.\n*   This reaction is a catalytic hydrogen transfer (a form of disproportionation), where one molecule is hydrogenated and the other is dehydrogenated. The total number of atoms of each element must be conserved.\n*   Let's balance the hydrogen atoms:\n    *   Total H atoms in products (Mixture Y) = H atoms in Cyclohexane + H atoms in Benzene\n    *   Total H atoms in Y = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (Mixture X) must also be 18.\n    *   Total H atoms in X = H atoms in molecule A + H atoms in molecule B = 18.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Based on the conservation of atoms in the reaction, this number is 18.\n\nTo confirm this is a plausible scenario, we can identify potential structures for A and B:\n*   Hydrogenation of both A and B must yield only cyclohexane (Z). This implies A and B are C6 cyclic compounds.\n*   A and B are unsaturated and non-conjugated.\n*   The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 18.\n*   A likely pair is **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n    *   Total hydrogens = 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated C6 rings.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated.\n    *   The reaction would be: C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) → C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene). In this reaction, the diene donates hydrogen to the alkene, a chemically sound process under catalytic conditions.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance Z**\nSubstance Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. The general formula for a hydrocarbon is CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `(y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008)`. Using the approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12), this simplifies to `y / (12x + y)`.\nSetting this equal to 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7:\n`y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n`7y = 12x + y`\n`6y = 12x`\n`y = 2x`\nThis corresponds to the general formula CnH2n, which is characteristic of cycloalkanes or alkenes. Since Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen, it must be a saturated compound, which rules out alkenes. Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane. The problem states that Z is widely used as a solvent. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common cycloalkane solvent. For C6H12, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `12 / (6*12 + 12) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%`. This confirms that Z is very likely cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Mixture Y**\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic. One of the components of Y is Z (cyclohexane, C6H12). Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that the other component of Y must also convert to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. A very common compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane is benzene (C6H6). Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions because doing so would disrupt its stable aromatic system. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction from X to Y**\nMixture X, an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them X1 and X2), is heated with platinum to form mixture Y. This is described as a disproportionation reaction. In this context, it is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one component is hydrogenated and the other is dehydrogenated.\nThe overall reaction is:\n`X1 + X2 → C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)`\nSince the starting mixture X and the resulting mixture Y are both equimolar, the stoichiometry is 1:1 for all components.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Mixture X and Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\nLet the molecular formula of X1 be C6Ha and X2 be C6Hb. The carbon skeleton must be C6 because hydrogenation of both components yields cyclohexane.\nFrom the balanced reaction in Step 3, we can balance the hydrogen atoms:\n`a + b = 12 + 6`\n`a + b = 18`\nThis means the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2 is 18.\n\nTo verify this, we can identify plausible structures for X1 and X2:\n*   They must decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n*   They must not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Hydrogenation of each must yield cyclohexane.\n\nA logical choice for X1 and X2 that fits these criteria is cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   **Cyclohexene (C6H10):** Has one double bond, so it decolorizes bromine water. It is not conjugated. Hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.\n*   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8):** Has two double bonds which are isolated (not conjugated), so it decolorizes bromine water. Hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.\n\nThe sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. The reaction would be a hydrogen transfer where 1,4-cyclohexadiene is dehydrogenated to benzene, and cyclohexene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane. This type of disproportionation is known to occur over platinum catalysts.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\nTotal H atoms = (H in X1) + (H in X2) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, meaning it contains only carbon (C) and hydrogen (H).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%. The mass fraction of carbon is therefore 100% - 14.28% = 85.72%.\n    *   To find the empirical formula, we can divide the mass percentages by the atomic masses (C ≈ 12, H ≈ 1):\n        *   For H: 14.28 / 1 = 14.28\n        *   For C: 85.72 / 12 = 7.14\n    *   The ratio of H to C atoms is 14.28 / 7.14 ≈ 2. So, the empirical formula is CH₂.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. The general formula for a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon (alkane) is CₙH₂ₙ₊₂, which does not fit the CH₂ ratio. However, the general formula for a saturated cyclic hydrocarbon (cycloalkane) is CₙH₂ₙ, which perfectly matches the empirical formula.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent that fits the formula CₙH₂ₙ is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. Let's verify the hydrogen mass fraction for cyclohexane: (12 * 1.008) / (6 * 12.011 + 12 * 1.008) ≈ 14.37%, which is very close to the given value. Thus, Z is cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hydrogenation Reactions:**\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of *both* mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions yields *only* substance Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   This is a crucial clue. It means that all chemical compounds present in both mixtures X and Y must have a six-carbon ring skeleton. Upon the addition of hydrogen, they all convert to cyclohexane.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar (1:1 molar ratio) mixture of two liquids.\n    *   Y is formed from X by a disproportionation reaction when heated with platinum. In this context, disproportionation involves a hydrogen transfer, where some molecules are hydrogenated (gain H) and others are dehydrogenated (lose H).\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, indicating its components are saturated or aromatic. Benzene, for instance, does not react with bromine water.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is one of the components of mixture Y.\n    *   Since Y is an equimolar mixture containing cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), the other component must be the product of dehydrogenation. The ultimate dehydrogenation product of a six-carbon ring is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n    *   So, Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), Benzene (C₆H₆)}. This mixture fits the description: it's equimolar, its components have a C₆ skeleton, and it doesn't decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of this mixture (cyclohexane stays the same, benzene becomes cyclohexane) yields only cyclohexane (Z).\n\n4.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   The reaction is a hydrogen transfer: A + B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   By conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (A + B) must equal the total in the products: 12 + 6 = 18 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B must be unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   The molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Both A and B must be based on a six-carbon ring, as they hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n    *   Let's consider the possible unsaturated, non-conjugated C₆-ring compounds:\n        *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**: Has one double bond (non-conjugated).\n        *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**: Has two non-conjugated double bonds. (1,3-Cyclohexadiene is excluded because its double bonds are conjugated).\n    *   Let's see if an equimolar mixture of these two fits the reaction. Let A = Cyclohexene and B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene.\n        *   The reaction would be: C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆\n        *   This is a perfectly balanced reaction. The 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) is dehydrogenated to benzene (C₆H₆), and the cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) is hydrogenated to cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). This type of catalytic hydrogen transfer is a known process.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   Mixture X consists of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   Number of H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene = 10.\n    *   Number of H atoms in one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene = 8.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let's determine its empirical formula.\n    *   Mass % of H = 14.28%, so Mass % of C = 100% - 14.28% = 85.72%.\n    *   Assuming 100 g of the substance, we have 14.28 g of H and 85.72 g of C.\n    *   Moles of H = 14.28 g / 1.008 g/mol ≈ 14.17 mol.\n    *   Moles of C = 85.72 g / 12.01 g/mol ≈ 7.14 mol.\n    *   The ratio of H atoms to C atoms is approximately 14.17 / 7.14 ≈ 2.\n    *   So, the empirical formula of Z is CH₂.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated compound. A hydrocarbon with the general formula CnH2n that is saturated must be a cycloalkane. The value 14.28% is exactly 1/7 * 100%, which corresponds to the formula CnH2n if we use approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1): %H = (2n * 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7.\n    *   Hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y gives *only* Z. This implies that all components of X and Y have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   Z is also a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Let's assume Z is cyclohexane for now. This would mean n=6.\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of them is Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂). Let's call the other one Y₂.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means Y₂ is saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means hydrogenation of Y₂ must also produce cyclohexane.\n    *   The most logical candidate for Y₂ is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is a liquid, does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions, and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane (C₆H₆ + 3H₂ → C₆H₁₂).\n    *   So, mixture Y consists of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆). This fits the description of an equimolar mixture of two liquids that doesn't decolorize bromine water and hydrogenates to a single product.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction X → Y:**\n    *   An equimolar mixture X is converted to an equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction.\n    *   This means the reaction stoichiometry is 1:1 → 1:1. Let the two components of X be X₁ and X₂.\n    *   The reaction is: X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X is oxidized (loses hydrogen) to form benzene, and the other component is reduced (gains hydrogen) to form cyclohexane.\n    *   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms must be the same on both sides of the equation.\n    *   Total C atoms in products = C from C₆H₁₂ + C from C₆H₆ = 6 + 6 = 12. So, X₁ and X₂ must each have 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   Total H atoms in products = H from C₆H₁₂ + H from C₆H₆ = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X₁ and one molecule of X₂ must be 18.\n\n4.  **Calculate the final answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   Based on our analysis, this sum is exactly the total number of hydrogen atoms in the product molecules, which is 18.\n\n5.  **Verify the properties of Mixture X (optional but good for confirmation):**\n    *   X₁ and X₂ must be C₆ compounds.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.\n    *   Both must decolorize bromine water (i.e., be unsaturated).\n    *   Hydrogenation of both must yield cyclohexane.\n    *   They must not have conjugated double bonds.\n    *   A combination that fits all these criteria is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n        *   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n        *   Both are unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds.\n        *   1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated.\n        *   The reaction C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆ is a balanced hydrogen transfer.\n    *   This confirms our conclusion.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z\n\n1.  **Composition**: Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This means the mass fraction of carbon is 100% - 14.28% = 85.72%.\n2.  **Empirical Formula**: To find the empirical formula, we can assume a 100g sample. This gives us 14.28 g of Hydrogen (H) and 85.72 g of Carbon (C).\n    *   Moles of H = 14.28 g / 1.008 g/mol ≈ 14.17 mol\n    *   Moles of C = 85.72 g / 12.011 g/mol ≈ 7.14 mol\n    *   The simplest whole-number ratio of moles is C : H = 7.14 : 14.17 ≈ 1 : 2.\n    *   Therefore, the empirical formula of Z is CH₂.\n3.  **Molecular Formula**: Z is described as a saturated hydrocarbon that doesn't react further with hydrogen. A saturated acyclic hydrocarbon (alkane) has the formula CₙH₂ₙ₊₂, while a saturated cyclic hydrocarbon (cycloalkane) has the formula CₙH₂ₙ. The empirical formula CH₂ corresponds to the general formula CₙH₂ₙ. Thus, Z is a cycloalkane.\n4.  **Identification**: The problem states that hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. Mixture Y contains Z and another substance. This second substance in Y must hydrogenate to Z. Furthermore, mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, which suggests its components are either saturated or aromatic. Since Z is saturated, the other component must be aromatic to be able to undergo hydrogenation under severe conditions. The hydrogenation of an aromatic compound like benzene (C₆H₆) produces a cycloalkane, cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n5.  **Confirmation**: Let's check if Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The molecular formula C₆H₁₂ fits the empirical formula CH₂ (n=6). The mass fraction of hydrogen in cyclohexane is (12 × 1.008) / (6 × 12.011 + 12 × 1.008) ≈ 14.37%, which is very close to the given 14.28%. Cyclohexane is also widely used as a solvent. Thus, we can confidently identify Z as **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n\n1.  **Composition**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water.\n2.  **Components**: We've established that one component is Z, which is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must hydrogenate to cyclohexane under severe conditions and not react with bromine water. This strongly points to **benzene (C₆H₆)**, which is aromatic and hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n3.  **Conclusion for Y**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X\n\n1.  **Reaction**: Mixture X, when heated with platinum, undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y. This means some molecules in X are reduced (gain hydrogen) while others are oxidized (lose hydrogen).\n    *   A + B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)\n2.  **Properties of X**: Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B. It decolorizes bromine water, indicating that A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds). The problem also states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of X.\n3.  **Structure**: Since hydrogenation of mixture X yields only cyclohexane, both A and B must be C₆ hydrocarbons with a six-membered ring structure.\n4.  **Reaction Stoichiometry**: The reaction is a hydrogen transfer. Since the products (cyclohexane and benzene) are formed in an equimolar ratio, the reactants (A and B) must react in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n    *   A (C₆Hₓ) + B (C₆Hᵧ) → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆\n    *   By balancing the hydrogen atoms: x + y = 12 + 6 = 18.\n5.  **Identifying A and B**: We need two unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds without conjugated bonds whose hydrogen counts sum to 18.\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**: Contains one double bond and thus decolorizes bromine water. It has no conjugated bonds.\n    *   **Cyclohexadienes (C₆H₈)**: There are two main isomers: cyclohexa-1,3-diene and cyclohexa-1,4-diene. Cyclohexa-1,3-diene has conjugated double bonds, so it is ruled out. **Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈)** has two isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds and will decolorize bromine water.\n6.  **Confirmation of Reaction**: Let's test if a mixture of cyclohexene and cyclohexa-1,4-diene fits the description.\n    *   In the disproportionation reaction, cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈) is oxidized to benzene (C₆H₆), losing 2 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Simultaneously, cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) is reduced to cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), gaining 2 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   C₆H₈ + C₆H₁₀ → C₆H₆ + C₆H₁₂. This is a known hydrogen transfer reaction.\n    *   The hydrogen atoms sum up: 8 + 10 = 18. This is consistent.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms\n\nThe two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈).\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each liquid is:\n*   Hydrogen atoms in cyclohexene = 10\n*   Hydrogen atoms in cyclohexa-1,4-diene = 8\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is my step-by-step thinking process to solve this chemistry puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z:** The most crucial piece of information is the mass fraction of hydrogen (14.28%) in hydrocarbon Z. Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it doesn't react further with hydrogen) formed by hydrogenating X and Y. Saturated hydrocarbons are either alkanes (CₙH₂ₙ₊₂) or cycloalkanes (CₙH₂ₙ).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as (Total Mass of H) / (Total Molar Mass).\n    *   Let's test the general formula for cycloalkanes, CₙH₂ₙ. Using atomic masses C=12 and H=1:\n        Mass % H = (2n * 1) / (n * 12 + 2n * 1) = 2n / 14n = 2 / 14 = 1/7.\n    *   Converting 1/7 to a decimal gives approximately 0.142857, which is a perfect match for the given 14.28%.\n    *   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane. Since it's a common solvent, the most likely candidate is **Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water (meaning they are saturated or aromatic).\n    *   Z (Cyclohexane) is a component of Y.\n    *   Hydrogenating mixture Y gives only Z (Cyclohexane).\n    *   This means the other component of Y must also produce Cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. Since it doesn't decolorize bromine water, it's not a typical alkene. The only common C₆ compound that fits this description is **Benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic and does not decolorize Br₂ water under normal conditions, but it can be hydrogenated under severe conditions to form Cyclohexane.\n    *   So, Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), Benzene (C₆H₆)}.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water (meaning they are unsaturated) and has no conjugated double bonds.\n    *   The reaction X -> Y is a disproportionation, which is a redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In this context, it's a hydrogen transfer reaction catalyzed by platinum.\n    *   The overall reaction conserves atoms. The two molecules in mixture X react to form the two molecules in mixture Y.\n        X₁ + X₂ → Y₁ + Y₂\n    *   Since all compounds are based on a C₆ skeleton, we can write the reaction in terms of their formulas:\n        C₆Hₐ + C₆Hₓ → C₆H₁₂ (Cyclohexane) + C₆H₆ (Benzene)\n    *   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms must be the same on both sides of the equation.\n    *   Total H atoms in products = 12 (from Cyclohexane) + 6 (from Benzene) = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be 18 (i.e., a + x = 18).\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:** The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Based on the conservation of atoms during the reaction, this total must be 18. This corresponds to option C.\n\nLet's confirm the identity of the liquids in X. They must be C₆Hₐ and C₆Hₓ where a+x=18, both must be unsaturated, and have no conjugated bonds. The most plausible candidates are **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   10 + 8 = 18.\n*   Both are unsaturated (will decolorize Br₂ water).\n*   1,4-Cyclohexadiene has non-conjugated double bonds. Cyclohexene has one double bond.\n*   In the reaction, the diene (C₆H₈) is oxidized to benzene (C₆H₆) by losing 2H, and the cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) is reduced to cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) by gaining 2H. This fits the description of a disproportionation (hydrogen transfer).\n\nThe core logic relies on the conservation of atoms. The code below will calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms in the product mixture Y, which must be equal to the total in the reactant mixture X.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the chemistry puzzle by following a logical deduction process.\n    1.

The general formula is CnH2n.\nThe problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen) and is a widely used solvent. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the properties of mixture Y.**\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. Let's call them C and D.\nMixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This implies its components are saturated (contain no C=C or C≡C bonds).\nOne component of Y is the hydrocarbon Z. So, let C = Z = CnH2n (a cycloalkane).\nHydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z. This means hydrogenation of C gives Z (which is trivial as C=Z), and hydrogenation of D also gives Z.\nSo, D must be a compound that can be converted to Z by adding hydrogen. However, Y (and thus D) is stated to be saturated. This seems like a contradiction.\nLet's reconsider the meaning of \"does not decolorize bromine water\". While this test is primarily for alkenes/alkynes, aromatic compounds like benzene also do not react with bromine water under normal conditions. Let's hypothesize that one component of Y is aromatic.\nLet's assume D is an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton as Z. The general formula for a simple mononuclear aromatic hydrocarbon is CnH2n-6 (e.g., benzene C6H6, where n=6, 2n-6 = 12-6 = 6).\nHydrogenation of an aromatic ring (like D) under severe conditions yields the corresponding cycloalkane (Z). For example, C6H6 (benzene) + 3H2 → C6H12 (cyclohexane). This fits the description perfectly.\nSo, Y is an equimolar mixture of a cycloalkane Z (CnH2n) and an aromatic hydrocarbon D (CnH2n-6).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the properties of mixture X and the reaction.**\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\nX decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and/or B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\nHydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z. This implies that both A and B have the same n-carbon skeleton as Z, and both are converted to Z upon complete hydrogenation.\nThe reaction is the disproportionation of mixture X to form mixture Y. Since both are equimolar mixtures, the simplest stoichiometry is A + B → C + D.\nSubstituting the formulas we deduced:\nA(CnHx) + B(CnH_y) → Z(CnH2n) + D(CnH2n-6)\n\n**Step 4: Perform a hydrogen atom balance and solve for n.**\nThe total number of atoms must be conserved in the reaction. Let's balance the hydrogen atoms:\nNumber of H in reactants = Number of H in products\nx + y = (2n) + (2n - 6)\nx + y = 4n - 6\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is exactly x + y.\nSo, Total H atoms = 4n - 6.\n\nWe need to find the value of n. We know that Z (CnH2n) is a widely used solvent. The most common examples are cyclohexane (n=6) and methylcyclohexane (n=7). Let's test these values.\nIf n = 6:\n*   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12). D = Benzene (C6H6). Both are liquids and widely used.\n*   The total number of hydrogen atoms in X would be x + y = 4(6) - 6 = 24 - 6 = 18.\n*   This corresponds to option D.\n*   Let's check if we can find suitable compounds A and B for mixture X. A and B must be unsaturated C6 hydrocarbons that hydrogenate to cyclohexane and are not conjugated. For x+y=18, we can choose A = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Both fit the criteria. `10 + 8 = 18`.\n\nIf n = 7:\n*   Z = Methylcyclohexane (C7H14). D = Toluene (C7H8). Both are liquids and widely used.\n*   The total number of hydrogen atoms in X would be x + y = 4(7) - 6 = 28 - 6 = 22.\n*   This corresponds to option C.\n*   Let's check for A and B. We need non-conjugated unsaturated C7 hydrocarbons. For x+y=22, we could choose A = a methylcyclohexene isomer (C7H12) and B = a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene isomer (C7H10). This is also a plausible scenario. `12 + 10 = 22`.\n\nWe have two plausible solutions corresponding to two different options (18 and 22). However, such problems in chemistry contests usually have a unique intended answer. The disproportionation of C6 hydroaromatics to cyclohexane and benzene is a classic, archetypal reaction in catalysis. It is the simplest and most fundamental example that fits the problem's constraints. Therefore, it is most likely the intended scenario.\n\nAssuming n=6 is the intended case:\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is x + y = 18.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\n*   Identify Z as a cycloalkane CnH2n.\n*   Identify Y as {CnH2n, CnH2n-6} (a cycloalkane and an aromatic compound).\n*   Identify X as {CnHx, CnH_y} (two unsaturated precursors).\n*   Balance the reaction A + B -> Z + D to get x + y = 4n - 6.\n*   Based on common examples and the options, deduce n=6.\n*   Calculate the total hydrogen atoms: x + y = 4(6) - 6 = 18.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a formula CxHy.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%, which is equivalent to 0.1428.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen can be expressed as: `mass of H / total mass = (y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008)`. For simplicity, we can use integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1).\n*   `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`\n*   The fraction 14.28% is very close to 1/7 (`1/7 ≈ 0.142857`). Let's test this assumption.\n*   `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n*   `7y = 12x + y`\n*   `6y = 12x`\n*   `y = 2x`\n*   This means the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and its general molecular formula is (CH2)n or CnH2n.\n*   Z is a saturated hydrocarbon because it does not react further with hydrogen. The general formula for a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon (alkane) is CnH2n+2. The general formula for a saturated cyclic hydrocarbon (cycloalkane) is CnH2n.\n*   Since the formula of Z is CnH2n, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem states that Z is a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkanes used as solvents are cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   We can provisionally identify Z as one of these, and we will confirm this in the next steps.\n\n**Step 2: Relate All Compounds**\n\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z.\n*   This is a critical clue. It means that all four compounds (the two in mixture X and the two in mixture Y) have the same carbon skeleton. For example, if Z is cyclohexane, all other compounds must also be based on a six-carbon ring.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X. A disproportionation reaction in this context (heating with a Pt catalyst) typically involves hydrogen transfer, where one molecule is hydrogenated and another is dehydrogenated.\n*   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is Z, which we identified as a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n*   The other component of Y must be the product of dehydrogenation. To be unreactive towards bromine water, it must be an aromatic compound.\n*   Let's assume the most common case, a six-membered ring skeleton. This would make Z **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n*   The corresponding aromatic compound formed by dehydrogenation would be **benzene (C6H6)**.\n*   So, Mixture Y = {cyclohexane, benzene}.\n*   Let's check if this fits the criteria:\n    *   Equimolar mixture of two liquids: Yes, both are liquids at room temperature.\n    *   Does not decolorize bromine water: Yes, cyclohexane is saturated, and benzene only reacts with Br2 under specific catalytic conditions (not with bromine water).\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z: Hydrogenation of cyclohexane (C6H12) gives C6H12. Hydrogenation of benzene (C6H6) gives cyclohexane (C6H12). So, hydrogenating the mixture gives only cyclohexane (Z). This fits perfectly.\n\n**Step 4: Relate Mixture X to Mixture Y and Find the Answer**\n\n*   We have established:\n    *   Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}\n    *   Mixture X = {Liquid 1 (X1), Liquid 2 (X2)}\n*   Mixture X is converted to Mixture Y in an equimolar ratio via disproportionation (hydrogen transfer). The overall reaction can be represented as:\n    `X1 + X2 --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane + Benzene`\n*   According to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction. We are interested in the hydrogen atoms.\n*   Total number of H atoms in the products = (H atoms in one molecule of Cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of Benzene)\n*   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2) must also be 18.\n\n**Step 5: (Optional) Verify the Identities of Liquids in Mixture X**\n\n*   We need two C6 compounds (X1 and X2) that:\n    1.  Have a total of 18 hydrogen atoms.\n    2.  Decolorize bromine water (i.e., are unsaturated).\n    3.  Do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    4.  Can react to form cyclohexane and benzene.\n*   Let's consider possible unsaturated C6 ring compounds:\n    *   Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n    *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) - This is non-conjugated.\n    *   1,3-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) - This is conjugated, so it's ruled out by the problem statement.\n*   Let's test the combination X = {Cyclohexene, 1,4-Cyclohexadiene}:\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 (from C6H10) + 8 (from C6H8) = 18. This works.\n    *   Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated. Cyclohexene has only one double bond, so no conjugation. This works.\n    *   The reaction `Cyclohexene (C6H10) + 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) -> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)` is a known hydrogen transfer reaction. The diene is oxidized to benzene, and the hexene is reduced to cyclohexane. This is perfectly consistent.\n\nThe logic is sound, and the calculation is confirmed. The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\n\nSubstance Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. It is a common solvent and is a saturated hydrocarbon, meaning it doesn't react further with hydrogen.\n\nThe mass percentage of hydrogen (H) in a hydrocarbon (composed of carbon C and hydrogen H) is given by:\nMass % H = (mass of H / total mass) * 100\n\nUsing the approximate atomic masses (C ≈ 12, H ≈ 1), 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\nIf the mass fraction of H is 1/7, the mass fraction of C is 6/7. The ratio of the number of atoms is (moles C) / (moles H) = (6/12) / (1/1) = 0.5, which gives an empirical formula of CH₂.\n\nA general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ, which matches the empirical formula CH₂. Let's verify the mass percentage for this class of compounds:\nMass % H = (2n * 1.008) / (n * 12.011 + 2n * 1.008) = 2.016 / 14.027 ≈ 14.37%\nUsing integer masses: Mass % H = (2n * 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%.\n\nThis confirms that Z is a cycloalkane. A widely used cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits all the descriptions for substance Z.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, indicating the components are saturated or aromatic. One component is Z, which is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n\nHydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only cyclohexane.\n*   Hydrogenating cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) gives cyclohexane.\n*   The other component of Y must also produce cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. Since it does not decolorize bromine water, it must be an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton. The only possibility is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n\nTherefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction from Mixture X to Mixture Y\n\nMixture X, an equimolar blend of two liquids (let's call them X₁ and X₂), undergoes a disproportionation reaction when heated with platinum to form mixture Y.\n\nReaction: X₁ + X₂ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆ (equimolar products from equimolar reactants)\n\nThis is a hydrogen transfer reaction where the total number of atoms must be conserved.\n*   Total carbon atoms in products = 6 (from cyclohexane) + 6 (from benzene) = 12\n*   Total hydrogen atoms in products = 12 (from cyclohexane) + 6 (from benzene) = 18\n\nSo, one molecule of X₁ and one molecule of X₂ together must contain 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the Components of Mixture X\n\nThe components of mixture X have the following properties:\n*   They are two different liquids.\n*   Hydrogenation of both X₁ and X₂ gives only cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), which means they are both C₆ hydrocarbons with a six-membered ring structure.\n*   They decolorize bromine water, indicating they are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n*   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in their molecules.\n\nLet the formulas be C₆Hₐ for X₁ and C₆Hₑ for X₂. From Step 3, we know that **a + b = 18**.\n\nLet's consider possible non-conjugated, unsaturated six-membered ring C₆ hydrocarbons:\n*   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**: Contains one double bond, so it is not conjugated.\n*   **Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈)**: Contains two double bonds separated by two single bonds, so they are not conjugated.\n*   *Cyclohexa-1,3-diene* (C₆H₈) is excluded because its double bonds are conjugated.\n\nLet's test the pair cyclohexene and cyclohexa-1,4-diene:\n*   X₁ = Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) → a = 10\n*   X₂ = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈) → b = 8\n\nThe sum of hydrogen atoms is a + b = 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our requirement from the reaction stoichiometry. All other conditions are also satisfied by this pair.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n\n*   Hydrogen atoms in X₁ (cyclohexene, C₆H₁₀) = 10\n*   Hydrogen atoms in X₂ (cyclohexa-1,4-diene, C₆H₈) = 8\n\nTotal hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   The mass percentage of hydrogen in a cycloalkane (general formula CnH2n) is:\n        Mass % H = (Total mass of H / Total mass of compound) * 100\n        Mass % H = (2n * AtomicMassH) / (n * AtomicMassC + 2n * AtomicMassH)\n        Using integer masses (H=1, C=12): Mass % H = (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7.\n    *   1/7 ≈ 0.142857, which corresponds to 14.28%.\n    *   The mass percentage of hydrogen for an alkane (CnH2n+2) does not yield this value.\n    *   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a constituent of mixture Y and is widely used as a solvent. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common cycloalkane solvent. Let's hypothesize that n=6 and Z is cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hydrogenation Reactions.**\n    *   Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions gives only substance Z (CnH2n).\n    *   This implies that all components of mixture X (let's call them A and B) and mixture Y (Z and another liquid, Z') have the same carbon skeleton, or skeletons that can be converted to Z's skeleton under the reaction conditions.\n    *   Let's assume the simplest case: all compounds (A, B, Z, Z') are based on a 6-carbon ring (n=6).\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture Y.**\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, Z and Z'.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components do not have C=C or C≡C bonds that readily react with bromine.\n    *   Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), which is saturated and does not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Z' must also not decolorize bromine water. A common substance that fits this description, besides saturated alkanes, is an aromatic compound like benzene (C6H6). Benzene does not react with bromine water under normal conditions.\n    *   Let's hypothesize that Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (Z) and benzene (Z').\n    *   Let's check if hydrogenating this mixture Y gives only Z. Hydrogenation of cyclohexane yields cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of benzene yields cyclohexane. So, hydrogenation of {cyclohexane, benzene} yields only cyclohexane. This hypothesis is consistent with the problem statement.\n\n4.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in A or B.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z (cyclohexane), so A and B must be unsaturated C6 hydrocarbons with a six-membered ring.\n    *   The reaction is: Mixture X (A + B) → Mixture Y (Cyclohexane + Benzene).\n    *   Since the mixtures are equimolar, the stoichiometry is A + B → C6H12 + C6H6.\n    *   This reaction is described as a disproportionation. In catalytic hydrocarbon chemistry, this often refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction. Let's see if this works. One molecule must be reduced (gain hydrogen) and one must be oxidized (lose hydrogen).\n        *   Reduction: A or B → C6H12 (gains H)\n        *   Oxidation: A or B → C6H6 (loses H)\n    *   The reaction conserves atoms. Let's check the hydrogen balance:\n        Total H in products = H(C6H12) + H(C6H6) = 12 + 6 = 18 atoms.\n        Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (A + B) must also be 18.\n\n5.  **Identify Liquids A and B.**\n    *   We need to find two non-conjugated, unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons, A and B, whose total hydrogen count is 18.\n    *   Let A be cyclohexene, C6H10. It is unsaturated and non-conjugated.\n    *   This means B must have 18 - 10 = 8 hydrogen atoms. The formula for B is C6H8.\n    *   A C6H8 cyclic hydrocarbon with no conjugated bonds would be 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n    *   So, let's propose Mixture X = {cyclohexene (C6H10), 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)}.\n    *   Let's check the disproportionation reaction:\n        C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C6H10 (cyclohexene) → C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane)\n    *   In this reaction, 1,4-cyclohexadiene is oxidized to benzene by losing 2 hydrogen atoms. Cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane by gaining 2 hydrogen atoms. This is a valid hydrogen transfer (disproportionation) reaction.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion.**\n    *   All conditions of the problem are met with this model:\n        *   X = {Cyclohexene (C6H10), 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)}\n        *   Y = {Benzene (C6H6), Cyclohexane (C6H12)}\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12)\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in Cyclohexene) + (H atoms in 1,4-Cyclohexadiene) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   The general formula for a saturated hydrocarbon is either CnH2n+2 (alkane) or CnH2n (cycloalkane).\n    *   Let's check the mass percentage of hydrogen for a cycloalkane (CnH2n). The molar mass is approximately 12n + 2n = 14n. The mass of hydrogen is 2n.\n    *   Mass % H = (2n / 14n) * 100% = (1/7) * 100% ≈ 14.286%. This matches the given value.\n    *   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n. The information that Z does not react further with hydrogen confirms it is saturated.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclohexane (C6H12) and methylcyclohexane (C7H14).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction and Mixtures**\n    *   Mixture X contains two liquids that decolorize bromine water, indicating the presence of carbon-carbon double bonds (unsaturation). The molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Mixture Y is formed by treating X with platinum at high temperature. This reaction is called a disproportionation.\n    *   Mixture Y contains two liquids that do *not* decolorize bromine water. This means they are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z is a component of mixture Y. Since Z is a saturated cycloalkane (CnH2n), the other component of Y must be the \"oxidized\" product of the disproportionation. For it to not decolorize bromine water, it is most likely an aromatic compound.\n    *   The most plausible reaction is an intermolecular hydrogen transfer between an unsaturated cyclic compound (cycloalkene) and a more unsaturated one (cycloalkadiene) to produce a saturated cycloalkane and an aromatic compound.\n    *   The reaction scheme is: **Cycloalkene + Cycloalkadiene → Cycloalkane + Aromatic Compound**\n    *   Let's check the stoichiometry. If all compounds are based on the same C-number 'n':\n        CnH2n-2 (cycloalkene) + CnH2n-4 (cycloalkadiene) → CnH2n (cycloalkane) + CnH2n-6 (aromatic)\n        The total atoms on both sides are C2nH4n-6, so the reaction is balanced. Since the reactants are in a 1:1 ratio, the products (mixture Y) will be an equimolar mixture, as stated in the problem.\n\n3.  **Identify the Carbon Skeleton**\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only one* substance, Z.\n    *   Let's test the C6 system.\n        *   Assume Z is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. It is a widely used solvent.\n        *   Mixture Y would then be {**cyclohexane (C6H12)**, **benzene (C6H6)**}. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water. Z is a component of Y. This fits.\n        *   Mixture X would be {**cyclohexene (C6H10)**, **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**}. The 1,4-diene is non-conjugated. Both decolorize bromine water. This fits.\n        *   Let's check hydrogenation:\n            *   Hydrogenation of X = {C6H10, C6H8} yields only cyclohexane.\n            *   Hydrogenation of Y = {C6H12, C6H6} yields only cyclohexane (since benzene hydrogenates to cyclohexane).\n        *   This C6-based scenario fits all the conditions of the problem.\n\n4.  **Consider Other Possibilities**\n    *   Let's test the C7 system as a check.\n        *   Assume Z is **methylcyclohexane (C7H14)**. It is also a solvent.\n        *   Mixture Y would be {**methylcyclohexane (C7H14)**, **toluene (C7H8)**}. This fits.\n        *   Mixture X would be {**methylcyclohexene (C7H12)**, a non-conjugated **methylcyclohexadiene (C7H10)**}. This fits.\n        *   Hydrogenation of both X and Y in this case would lead to only methylcyclohexane.\n    *   Both the C6 and C7 systems seem chemically plausible. However, the C6 system (cyclohexane/benzene) is the most fundamental and common example of this type of chemistry. In the context of such problems, the simplest, unsubstituted ring system is typically the intended answer. Thus, we proceed with the C6 system.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   Based on our deduction, mixture X consists of two liquids:\n        1.  Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n        2.  Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (i.e., in one molecule of each).\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in C6H10) + (H atoms in C6H8) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a saturated hydrocarbon, meaning its general formula is CnH2n+2 (alkane) or CnH2n (cycloalkane).\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is given as 14.28%. This value is very close to 1/7. Let's verify this: 1/7 ≈ 0.142857.\n*   Let the molecular formula of Z be CnHm. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by:\n    Mass Fraction (H) = (m × AtomicMass(H)) / (n × AtomicMass(C) + m × AtomicMass(H))\n*   Using integer atomic masses (C≈12, H≈1), we have:\n    m / (12n + m) = 1/7\n    7m = 12n + m\n    6m = 12n\n    m = 2n\n*   This means the formula for Z is CnH2n. Since Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen), it must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   We need to find the specific cycloalkane. The problem states Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n*   Let's verify the mass fraction for cyclohexane (C6H12):\n    Mass of Hydrogen = 12 × 1.008 = 12.096\n    Mass of Carbon = 6 × 12.011 = 72.066\n    Total Molar Mass = 84.162 g/mol\n    Mass Fraction (H) = 12.096 / 84.162 ≈ 0.1437. Using integer masses: 12 / (6*12 + 12) = 12/84 = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857. This is a perfect match for 14.28%.\n*   Thus, **Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This implies the components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Hydrogenation of Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Let Y be a mixture of {Y1, Y2}. We know one component is Z, so let Y2 = Z = cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Hydrogenation of Y = {Y1, cyclohexane} gives only cyclohexane. Cyclohexane is already saturated, so it does not react. This means that hydrogenation of Y1 must produce cyclohexane.\n*   Y1 must have a C6 carbon skeleton.\n*   Y1 does not decolorize bromine water. An alkene or alkyne would, but an aromatic compound like benzene reacts very slowly with bromine water without a catalyst.\n*   The most plausible candidate for Y1 is **benzene (C6H6)**. Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane (C6H6 + 3H2 -> C6H12). Benzene is a liquid and does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions.\n*   Therefore, **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the reaction from X to Y and find the properties of Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them X1 and X2.\n*   The reaction is: Mixture X --(Pt, heat)--> Mixture Y. This is described as a disproportionation.\n*   Since the reactant (X) and product (Y) mixtures are both equimolar, the reaction stoichiometry must be 1:1 for the components.\n    1 molecule of X1 + 1 molecule of X2  →  1 molecule of C6H6 + 1 molecule of C6H12\n*   This reaction is a catalytic hydrogen transfer. One component of X is dehydrogenated to benzene, and the other is hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n*   According to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction.\n*   Let's focus on the hydrogen atoms:\n    Total H in reactants = Total H in products\n    Number of H in X1 + Number of H in X2 = Number of H in C6H6 + Number of H in C6H12\n    Number of H in X1 + Number of H in X2 = 6 + 12\n    Number of H in X1 + Number of H in X2 = 18\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of the number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each liquid component.\n*   From our analysis, this sum is 18.\n\n**Step 4: Consistency Check**\n\n*   Does this model fit all the given information?\n    *   **Hydrogenation of X**: Hydrogenation of both X1 and X2 must give only cyclohexane. This implies X1 and X2 must be C6 cyclic compounds. For example, if X = {cyclohexene (C6H10), 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)}, both hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n    *   **Bromine water test**: Mixture X decolorizes bromine water. Both cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene contain C=C double bonds and would decolorize bromine water.\n    *   **No conjugated bonds**: 1,4-cyclohexadiene has non-conjugated double bonds. Cyclohexene has only one double bond. This condition is satisfied.\n    *   **H atom count**: For our example X = {C6H10, C6H8}, the total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This is consistent with our calculation.\n\nThe logic is sound and all conditions of the problem are met. The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two liquids in mixture X is 18.\n\nFinal Answer Selection:\nThe calculated total number of hydrogen atoms is 18. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of Z be C_n H_m. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `(m * Ar(H)) / (n * Ar(C) + m * Ar(H))`. Using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1), this is `m / (12n + m)`.\n    *   `m / (12n + m) = 0.1428`\n    *   Solving for the ratio m/n:\n        `m = 0.1428 * (12n + m)`\n        `m = 1.7136n + 0.1428m`\n        `0.8572m = 1.7136n`\n        `m/n = 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2.0`\n    *   Alternatively, 14.28% is very close to 1/7 (1/7 ≈ 0.142857). If the mass fraction of H is 1/7, then `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`, which gives `7m = 12n + m`, so `6m = 12n`, and `m = 2n`.\n    *   So, the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and the general formula is C_n H_2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula C_n H_2n must be a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of them is Z (the cycloalkane, C_n H_2n). Let's call the other liquid Y2.\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means both components are saturated or aromatic. Z is saturated. Y2 must also be saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z.\n        *   Hydrogenation of Z (a saturated cycloalkane) gives Z itself.\n        *   Hydrogenation of Y2 must also give Z (C_n H_2n).\n    *   For Y2 to be hydrogenated to a cycloalkane C_n H_2n, it must be an unsaturated compound with the same carbon skeleton. The most plausible candidate for a non-bromine-decolorizing, hydrogenatable liquid is an aromatic compound. The corresponding aromatic compound would have the formula C_n H_(2n-6) (assuming a single benzene-type ring).\n    *   Therefore, Mixture Y consists of {C_n H_2n (a cycloalkane), C_n H_(2n-6) (an aromatic hydrocarbon)}.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction X → Y**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n    *   When heated with a platinum catalyst, X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form the equimolar mixture Y.\n    *   Reaction: `X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2` (in 1:1 molar ratio)\n    *   Substituting the formulas for Y: `X1 + X2 → C_n H_2n + C_n H_(2n-6)`\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X is hydrogenated, and the other is dehydrogenated. For the stoichiometry to be 1:1, the number of hydrogen atoms must be conserved between the reactant and product sides.\n    *   Let the formulas of the liquids in X be C_n H_a and C_n H_b.\n    *   Conservation of atoms implies: `C_n H_a + C_n H_b → C_n H_2n + C_n H_(2n-6)`\n    *   Summing the hydrogen atoms on both sides: `a + b = 2n + (2n - 6) = 4n - 6`.\n\n4.  **Identify Mixture X**\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two molecules of mixture X is `a + b = 4n - 6`.\n    *   The liquids in X decolorize bromine water, so they contain C=C double bonds. They must be cycloalkenes or cycloalkadienes, as they both hydrogenate to the cycloalkane Z (preserving the carbon ring structure).\n    *   The simplest way to construct this reaction is to have one molecule act as a hydrogen donor and the other as an acceptor. The most logical candidates are a cycloalkene (C_n H_(2n-2), having one double bond) and a cycloalkadiene (C_n H_(2n-4), having two double bonds).\n        *   Donor: `C_n H_(2n-4)` (cycloalkadiene) → `C_n H_(2n-6)` (aromatic) + 2H\n        *   Acceptor: `C_n H_(2n-2)` (cycloalkene) + 2H → `C_n H_2n` (cycloalkane)\n    *   The components of X are X1 = C_n H_(2n-2) and X2 = C_n H_(2n-4).\n    *   Let's check the total hydrogen atoms: `a + b = (2n - 2) + (2n - 4) = 4n - 6`. This matches our earlier derivation.\n\n5.  **Determine the value of 'n'**\n    *   The problem does not provide enough information to uniquely determine 'n'. However, we are given options. Let's test the most common and chemically significant small ring systems. Z is also described as a \"widely used solvent.\"\n    *   **Case n=6**:\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12), a very common solvent.\n        *   Y = {Benzene (C6H6), Cyclohexane (C6H12)}. Both are liquids.\n        *   X = {Cyclohexene (C6H10), Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)}.\n        *   The problem states \"no conjugated multiple bonds\", so the diene must be 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n        *   This scenario is chemically sound and all components are common liquids.\n        *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is `10 + 8 = 18`. This corresponds to option A.\n    *   **Case n=7**:\n        *   Z = Methylcyclohexane (C7H14), also a common solvent.\n        *   Y = {Toluene (C7H8), Methylcyclohexane (C7H14)}.\n        *   X = {Methylcyclohexene (C7H12), Methylcyclohexadiene (C7H10)}.\n        *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is `12 + 10 = 22`. This corresponds to option D.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    *   Both n=6 and n=7 provide chemically plausible scenarios that fit the problem description and correspond to given options.\n    *   However, the system involving benzene/cyclohexene/cyclohexadiene/cyclohexane (n=6) is the most classic and fundamental example of this type of catalytic hydrogen transfer (disproportionation). In the context of typical chemistry problems, the simplest and most common example is usually the intended answer.\n    *   Let's assume the intended answer is for the C6 system.\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X are Cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms is the sum of hydrogens in their molecular formulas: 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nFinal calculation based on the most probable scenario (n=6):\n*   Liquid 1 in X: Cyclohexene, C6**H10**\n*   Liquid 2 in X: 1,4-Cyclohexadiene, C6**H8**\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Substance Z is a hydrocarbon. Let its molecular formula be CₓHᵧ.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28% (or 0.1428). The mass fraction can be calculated using atomic masses (C ≈ 12, H ≈ 1) with the formula: `Mass Fraction H = y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   We can set up the equation: `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`.\n    *   To find the ratio of y to x, we rearrange the equation:\n        `y = 0.1428 * (12x + y)`\n        `y = 1.7136x + 0.1428y`\n        `y - 0.1428y = 1.7136x`\n        `0.8572y = 1.7136x`\n        `y/x = 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2.0`\n    *   This indicates that the empirical formula for Z is CH₂. The general molecular formula is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   The problem states that \"Substance Z does not react further with hydrogen,\" which means it is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   A saturated hydrocarbon with the general formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a **cycloalkane**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. Let's call them C and D.\n    *   Mixture Y \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" which means its components are saturated (like alkanes or cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n    *   Z is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one of the components (let's say C) is the cycloalkane Z (CₙH₂ₙ).\n    *   \"Hydrogenation of... mixture Y ... gives only one substance, ... Z\". This means that hydrogenation of C gives Z (which is true since C=Z) and hydrogenation of D also gives Z.\n    *   For D to be hydrogenated to the cycloalkane Z, and also not decolorize bromine water, it must be an **aromatic hydrocarbon** with the same carbon skeleton as Z. For example, benzene (C₆H₆) is hydrogenated to cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n\n3.  **Identify the Specific Compounds**\n    *   Z is described as a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The most common and simple cycloalkane used as a solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This corresponds to n=6.\n    *   If Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), then substance D must be the corresponding aromatic hydrocarbon with 6 carbon atoms, which is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n    *   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n4.  **Relate Mixture X to Mixture Y to Find the Final Answer**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B. It is converted to Mixture Y through a **disproportionation** reaction on a platinum catalyst.\n    *   `Mixture X (A + B) → Mixture Y (C + D)`\n    *   A disproportionation reaction is a type of redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In this context, it refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction. Crucially, the law of conservation of mass applies, meaning the total number of atoms of each element is the same before and after the reaction.\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of H atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B.\n    *   Due to the conservation of atoms, this sum must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y (one molecule of C and one molecule of D).\n    *   Total H atoms in Mixture Y = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is also 18.\n\nTo confirm this, we can check the properties of mixture X. It must contain two unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds (A and B) that are non-conjugated. For example, A could be cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and B could be 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18, which matches our result. Both decolorize bromine water, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated. All conditions of the problem are satisfied.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   Let's test the general formulas for hydrocarbons. We will use integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1) as is common in such problems, and the value 14.28% suggests this.\n    *   For an alkane (CnH2n+2): %H = (2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2). This doesn't simplify to a constant value.\n    *   For a cycloalkane (CnH2n): %H = (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7.\n    *   1/7 ≈ 0.142857, which corresponds to 14.2857%. This is a perfect match for the given 14.28%.\n    *   So, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states Z is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and is a \"widely used as a solvent\". The most common cycloalkane solvents are cyclohexane (C6H12) and methylcyclohexane (C7H14).\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Hydrogenation Reactions**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mix of two liquids, C and D.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated with respect to reactions with bromine. This typically means no C=C or C≡C bonds, but aromatic rings also do not react with bromine water.\n    *   Z is a constituent of Y. Let's assume C = Z = CnH2n.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. This means hydrogenation of C gives Z (which is trivial as C=Z), and hydrogenation of D must also give Z.\n    *   So, we need to identify D. D does not react with bromine water, and its hydrogenation product is Z (CnH2n).\n        *   Possibility 1: D is a saturated isomer of Z (e.g., if Z is cyclohexane, D could be methylcyclopentane). However, if Y consists of two isomers (CnH2n and another CnH2n), the reaction X -> Y would be an isomerization, not a disproportionation (a type of redox reaction). A disproportionation requires changes in oxidation levels (or, in this context, hydrogen content). The products C and D must have different hydrogen contents. Therefore, this possibility is incorrect.\n        *   Possibility 2: D is an aromatic compound (arene). Aromatic rings do not react with bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cycloalkanes under severe conditions.\n    *   This leads to the conclusion that Y is a mixture of a cycloalkane (Z) and an arene (D). For both to produce only Z (CnH2n) upon hydrogenation, they must share the same carbon skeleton.\n    *   Thus, Y = {CnH2n (Z, the cycloalkane), CnH2n-6 (D, the corresponding arene)}. For example, if Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), then D must be benzene (C6H6).\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mix of two liquids, A and B.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, so A and/or B must contain non-aromatic C=C or C≡C bonds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z (CnH2n). This implies that both A and B are unsaturated compounds with the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   The reaction is a disproportionation: A + B → C + D. Since the mixture is equimolar on both sides, the reaction is 1A + 1B → 1C + 1D.\n    *   Let's substitute the formulas we found for C and D:\n        A + B → CnH2n + CnH2n-6\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms must be conserved. Let A = CnHx and B = CnH_y.\n        x + y = (2n) + (2n-6) = 4n - 6\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is x + y.\n\n4.  **Determine the value of 'n'**\n    *   We know Z is a widely used solvent like cyclohexane (n=6) or methylcyclohexane (n=7). Let's test both cases.\n    *   **Case 1: n = 6.**\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12). Y = {Cyclohexane, Benzene (C6H6)}.\n        *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in X is x + y = 4*6 - 6 = 24 - 6 = 18.\n        *   This is a plausible scenario. Mixture X could be cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Both have a C6 ring, are non-conjugated, and decolorize bromine water. The sum of hydrogens is 10 + 8 = 18. The disproportionation reaction C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H12 + C6H6 is a known hydrogen transfer reaction.\n    *   **Case 2: n = 7.**\n        *   Z = Methylcyclohexane (C7H14). Y = {Methylcyclohexane, Toluene (C7H8)}.\n        *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in X is x + y = 4*7 - 6 = 28 - 6 = 22.\n        *   This is also a plausible scenario. Mixture X could be a methylcyclohexene (C7H12) and a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (C7H10). The sum of hydrogens is 12 + 10 = 22.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    *   We have two plausible solutions: 18 (for the C6 system) and 22 (for the C7 system). Both options are available in the choices (D and C).\n    *   However, problems of this type usually have a single unique solution. The reaction described, the disproportionation of hydroaromatic compounds into an alkane and an arene over a platinum catalyst, is a classic reaction in organic chemistry. The most fundamental and widely-taught example of this is the Zelinsky irreversible catalysis involving the C6 system (cyclohexene/dienes disproportionating to cyclohexane and benzene). It is highly probable that the question refers to this archetypal case.\n    *   Therefore, we choose the solution corresponding to n=6.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is **18**. This corresponds to one molecule of cyclohexene (C6H10) and one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n\nFinal Calculation: 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   Substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in a cycloalkane is (2n * 1.008) / (12.011 * n + 2n * 1.008) ≈ 2/14 = 1/7 ≈ 14.3%.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a widely used solvent and is the sole product of the hydrogenation of all components in mixtures X and Y. A very common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C6H12). Its hydrogenation would not yield a different product, which is consistent with the information that Z does not react further with hydrogen.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y and its Hydrogenation:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This suggests the components are saturated (like alkanes/cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is a component of Y. Let the other component be D. So, Y = (cyclohexane + D).\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means the hydrogenation of D must also yield cyclohexane.\n    *   If D were a saturated isomer of cyclohexane (like methylcyclopentane), its hydrogenation under severe conditions would likely break the ring and form acyclic alkanes, not exclusively cyclohexane.\n    *   The only common hydrocarbon that does not decolorize bromine water and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and its reaction to Y:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them A and B) that decolorize bromine water, indicating they contain C=C double bonds (alkenes/cycloalkenes).\n    *   X is converted to Y (cyclohexane + benzene) upon heating with platinum. This is described as a disproportionation reaction, which in this context implies a hydrogen transfer.\n    *   The overall reaction is: A + B → C6H12 + C6H6.\n    *   By conservation of atoms, the reactants A and B together must contain 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms (12 from cyclohexane + 6 from benzene).\n    *   Since A and B are in an equimolar mixture and hydrogenation of both yields cyclohexane, they must both be C6 hydrocarbons with different degrees of unsaturation. Let their formulas be C6Hx and C6Hy.\n    *   From the stoichiometry, we have x + y = 18.\n    *   Both A and B are unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons. Possible candidates include cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadienes (C6H8).\n    *   The combination C6H10 and C6H8 satisfies the condition x + y = 18 (10 + 8 = 18).\n    *   The problem specifies that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in mixture X. There are two common isomers of cyclohexadiene: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). Therefore, the diene must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n    *   The other component is **cyclohexene (C6H10)**.\n\n4.  **Confirm the Reaction Pathway:**\n    *   **Mixture X**: An equimolar mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   **Disproportionation Reaction**: Upon heating with platinum, cyclohexene can be dehydrogenated to benzene, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. This is a known type of reaction called catalytic hydrogen transfer.\n        *   C6H10 (cyclohexene) → C6H6 (benzene) + 4[H]\n        *   C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + 4[H] → C6H12 (cyclohexane)\n        *   Net Reaction: C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H6 + C6H12\n    *   This produces an equimolar mixture of benzene and cyclohexane (Mixture Y), which fits all the conditions.\n    *   **Hydrogenation of X**: Hydrogenation of both cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene produces cyclohexane.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in their respective molecular formulas.\n    *   Total Hydrogen Atoms = (H atoms in C6H10) + (H atoms in C6H8) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:** The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. The general formula for a hydrocarbon is CₓHᵧ.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `(y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008) = 0.1428`.\n    *   Simplifying with approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1): `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`.\n    *   This can be rearranged to `y ≈ 2x`.\n    *   A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ is a cycloalkane or an alkene. Since substance Z does not react further with hydrogen, it must be saturated, which points to a cycloalkane.\n    *   Let's check the formula for a cycloalkane, CₙH₂ₙ: The mass fraction of H is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857`. This is a perfect match.\n    *   We are told Z is a widely used solvent. Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) is a very common cycloalkane solvent. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Substance Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only Z (cyclohexane). This means the other component of Y must also have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n    *   The other component must not decolorize bromine water. Benzene (C₆H₆) fits this description; it is aromatic and only reacts with bromine in the presence of a catalyst, not with bromine water. Hydrogenation of benzene under severe conditions produces cyclohexane.\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   When heated with platinum, X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y. This can be seen as a hydrogen transfer reaction: `A + B → Cyclohexane + Benzene`.\n    *   By conserving atoms from the products (C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆), we know that A and B must both be C₆ compounds, and the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B must be `12 + 6 = 18`.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This confirms that both A and B must have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n    *   The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X.\n    *   We need to find two different C₆ unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18.\n        *   Cyclohexene has the formula C₆H₁₀. It has one double bond and decolorizes bromine water.\n        *   Cyclohexadienes have the formula C₆H₈. There are two common isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). The problem rules out conjugated bonds, so we consider **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   Let's check if this pair works: A = Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n        *   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our requirement.\n        *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ --(Pt, heat)--> C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is chemically plausible. It is a known type of disproportionation or hydrogen transfer reaction where cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is oxidized (dehydrogenated) to benzene.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of these liquids is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nTherefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Substance Z\nThe problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CₓHᵧ. The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as:\nMass % H = (mass of H / total mass) * 100\n\nUsing atomic masses (C ≈ 12, H ≈ 1):\n0.1428 = (y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1)\nThis fraction (1/7 ≈ 0.1428) suggests a ratio of hydrogen mass to total mass of 1:7.\nIf the total mass is 14x (for a formula CₓH₂ₓ), then the mass of hydrogen is 2x. The ratio is 2x / 14x = 1/7.\nThus, the general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. Since Z is saturated (it does not react further with hydrogen), it must be a cycloalkane.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Mixture Y and Substance Z\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, does not decolorize bromine water, and is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X. Hydrogenation of Y yields only substance Z. One of the components of Y is Z itself.\n\nLet Y be a mixture of Z and another liquid, D.\n*   Y = {Z, D}\n*   Since Y does not decolorize bromine water, both Z and D must be saturated or aromatic. We already know Z (CₙH₂ₙ) is a saturated cycloalkane. D must also not react with bromine water, which is characteristic of saturated or aromatic compounds.\n*   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. This means hydrogenation of Z gives Z (as it's saturated), and hydrogenation of D must also give Z.\n*   For an aromatic compound D to be hydrogenated to a cycloalkane Z, they must share the same carbon skeleton.\n\nThis leads to two primary possibilities for the {Z, D} pair based on common solvents:\n1.  **The C₆ case:** The aromatic compound D is benzene (C₆H₆). Benzene does not decolorize bromine water. Its hydrogenation product is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Therefore, Z must be cyclohexane.\n    *   Y = {cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), benzene (C₆H₆)}.\n    *   Z = cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) is a widely used solvent.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y {C₆H₁₂, C₆H₆} yields {C₆H₁₂, C₆H₁₂}, which is a single substance, Z. This case is consistent.\n2.  **The C₇ case:** The aromatic compound D is toluene (C₇H₈). Toluene does not decolorize bromine water. Its hydrogenation product is methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄). Therefore, Z must be methylcyclohexane.\n    *   Y = {methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄), toluene (C₇H₈)}.\n    *   Z = methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄) is also used as a solvent.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y {C₇H₁₄, C₇H₈} yields {C₇H₁₄, C₇H₁₄}, a single substance, Z. This case also seems consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B, which decolorizes bromine water (i.e., A and B are unsaturated). When heated with platinum, X undergoes disproportionation to form the equimolar mixture Y. This suggests a 1:1 reaction:\nA + B → Z + D\n\nThis is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one molecule is hydrogenated and the other is dehydrogenated. Let's analyze the hydrogen balance for our two cases:\n\n1.  **The C₆ case:** A + B → cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B must be 12 + 6 = 18.\n2.  **The C₇ case:** A + B → methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄) + toluene (C₇H₈).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms must be 14 + 8 = 22.\n\nThe components of X (A and B) must be unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons that, upon hydrogenation, both yield Z. They also must not have conjugated double bonds.\n\n*   **For the C₆ case (Z=cyclohexane):** A and B must be unsaturated C₆ rings. With a total of 18 hydrogen atoms, plausible candidates are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   A = C₆H₁₀, B = C₆H₈. Total H = 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Cyclohexene has one double bond. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has two non-conjugated double bonds. This fits the criteria.\n    *   Hydrogenation of C₆H₁₀ gives C₆H₁₂ (Z). Hydrogenation of C₆H₈ gives C₆H₁₂ (Z). This works.\n\n*   **For the C₇ case (Z=methylcyclohexane):** A and B must be unsaturated hydrocarbons with a methylcyclohexane skeleton. With a total of 22 hydrogen atoms, plausible candidates are methylcyclohexene (C₇H₁₂) and a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (C₇H₁₀).\n    *   A = C₇H₁₂, B = C₇H₁₀. Total H = 12 + 10 = 22.\n    *   These would also fit the criteria for unsaturation, non-conjugation, and hydrogenation to Z.\n\n### Step 4: Distinguishing Between the C₆ and C₇ Cases\nWe have two plausible scenarios leading to two different answers (18 or 22). We must find a constraint that eliminates one. Let's re-examine the hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y. The problem specifies that hydrogenation of *both* mixtures gives *only* one substance, Z.\n\nConsider the C₇ case again, but without assuming Z from the start. Let's assume the components of X are based on a C₇ ring (cycloheptene C₇H₁₂ and cycloheptadiene C₇H₁₀).\n*   Hydrogenation of X {C₇H₁₂, C₇H₁₀} under normal conditions would yield cycloheptane (C₇H₁₄). So, Z would be cycloheptane.\n*   Mixture Y would be formed from the disproportionation: C₇H₁₂ + C₇H₁₀ → C₇H₁₄ (cycloheptane) + C₇H₈ (toluene). So, Y = {cycloheptane, toluene}.\n*   Now, let's test the hydrogenation of this mixture Y. Hydrogenation of cycloheptane yields cycloheptane. Hydrogenation of toluene yields methylcyclohexane.\n*   The result is a mixture of two different substances: cycloheptane and methylcyclohexane. This contradicts the condition that *only one substance* is formed.\n\nTherefore, the C₇ case built upon a cycloheptane skeleton is invalid. The only way the C₇ case could work is if Z is methylcyclohexane from the start and the \"severe conditions\" for hydrogenation are sufficient to cause skeletal isomerization of cycloheptane to methylcyclohexane.\n\nThe C₆ case, however, is perfectly consistent without requiring any extra assumptions like skeletal isomerization.\n*   Hydrogenation of X {C₆H₁₀, C₆H₈} gives only cyclohexane (Z).\n*   Hydrogenation of Y {C₆H₁₂, C₆H₆} gives only cyclohexane (Z).\n\nThe principle of Occam's razor, and the fact that the disproportionation of C₆ hydroaromatics is a classic textbook reaction (the Zelinaky-Kazansky reaction), strongly favors the C₆ scenario.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\nBased on the C₆ scenario, mixture X consists of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n\nTotal H atoms = (H atoms in C₆H₁₀) + (H atoms in C₆H₈) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the chemical transformations described, the following conclusions are drawn:\n\n1.  **Identification of Substance Z**: The hydrocarbon Z has a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%, which corresponds to the general formula CₙH₂ₙ. Since Z is a saturated substance that doesn't react further with hydrogen, it must be a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Composition of Mixture Y**: Mixture Y is equimolar, does not decolorize bromine water, and its hydrogenation yields only Z. Given that Z is a component of Y, the other component, let's call it D, must also yield Z upon hydrogenation. For D to not decolorize bromine water but still be hydrogenated, it must be an aromatic compound. The hydrogenation of D must produce Z, which implies that Z and D share the same carbon skeleton.\n\n3.  **Two Plausible Scenarios**: This leads to two main possibilities based on common cyclic hydrocarbons:\n    *   **C₆ Scenario**: If the aromatic compound is benzene (C₆H₆), its hydrogenation product is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Thus, Z would be cyclohexane. Mixture Y would be {cyclohexane, benzene}.\n    *   **C₇ Scenario**: If the aromatic compound is toluene (C₇H₈), its hydrogenation product is methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄). Thus, Z would be methylcyclohexane. Mixture Y would be {methylcyclohexane, toluene}.\n\n4.  **Analysis of the Disproportionation**: Mixture X, an equimolar mixture of two unsaturated liquids (A and B), undergoes disproportionation on a platinum catalyst to form the equimolar mixture Y. This is best described as an intermolecular hydrogen transfer reaction where A and B react in a 1:1 molar ratio to produce Z and the aromatic compound D.\n    *   **C₆ Scenario**: A + B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆). The total number of hydrogen atoms in molecules A and B is 12 + 6 = 18. The components of X would be cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and a non-conjugated cyclohexadiene like 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). Both have a cyclohexane skeleton and are unsaturated.\n    *   **C₇ Scenario**: A + B → Methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄) + Toluene (C₇H₈). The total number of hydrogen atoms is 14 + 8 = 22. The components of X would be a methylcyclohexene (C₇H₁₂) and a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (C₇H₁₀).\n\n5.  **Final Decisive Step**: The problem states that hydrogenation of *both* mixture X and mixture Y gives *only one* substance Z. Let's re-examine the C₇ case. If the components of X are based on a 7-membered ring (e.g., cycloheptene), their hydrogenation would yield cycloheptane. The disproportionation would then produce Y = {cycloheptane, toluene}. Hydrogenating this mixture Y would result in two different products: cycloheptane and methylcyclohexane. This contradicts the problem's condition. The C₆ case, however, remains consistent: hydrogenation of X {cyclohexene, cyclohexadiene} gives cyclohexane, and hydrogenation of Y {cyclohexane, benzene} also gives only cyclohexane. This reaction system is a classic example of catalytic disproportionation.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent solution is the C₆ scenario. The two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each liquid is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nctrl95>H\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n### 1. Identify Hydrocarbon Z\nThe problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CₙHₘ.\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as:\n`mass % H = (m * 1.008) / (n * 12.011 + m * 1.008)`\nApproximating with integer masses (H=1, C=12):\n`0.1428 ≈ m / (12n + m)`\nThis value, 0.1428, is very close to 1/7.\n`1/7 = m / (12n + m)  => 12n + m = 7m  => 12n = 6m  => m = 2n`\nSo, the hydrocarbon Z has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n\nThe problem also states that Z is formed by the hydrogenation of other substances and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n\nFurthermore, Z is a constituent of mixture Y and is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane used as a solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Other small cycloalkanes like cyclopropane and cyclobutane are gases at room temperature and not typically used as liquid solvents. Therefore, it is highly probable that Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### 2. Characterize Mixture Y\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, indicating the absence of typical carbon-carbon double bonds. One of these liquids is Z, which we've identified as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n\nHydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only Z (cyclohexane). This means the second component of Y, let's call it Y₂, must also be converted into cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. Since Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a simple alkene. The most plausible candidate is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene does not react with bromine water under normal conditions and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions (high pressure and/or temperature).\n\nSo, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Reaction X → Y\nMixture X, an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them A and B), is converted to mixture Y (cyclohexane and benzene) upon heating with platinum. This reaction is described as a disproportionation. In this context, it refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction where some molecules are hydrogenated and others are dehydrogenated.\n\nSince mixture Y is formed in an equimolar ratio, the reaction can be written as:\n`A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane + Benzene`\n\nBy the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal that in the products.\n-   Carbon atoms: The products are C₆H₁₂ and C₆H₆. Since hydrogenation of both A and B leads to cyclohexane (a C₆ compound), A and B must also be C₆ hydrocarbons. Let A = C₆Hₓ and B = C₆Hᵧ. The carbon atoms are balanced (6 + 6 = 6 + 6).\n-   Hydrogen atoms: `x + y = 12 + 6 = 18`.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B is 18.\n\n### 4. Verify the Properties of Mixture X\nThe components of mixture X, A (C₆Hₓ) and B (C₆Hᵧ), must satisfy the following conditions:\n*   They decolorize bromine water, meaning they are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds). This implies x < 12 and y < 12.\n*   Hydrogenation of A and B yields only cyclohexane. This confirms they have a six-membered carbon ring skeleton.\n*   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules.\n\nLet's find plausible structures for A and B based on `x + y = 18`. A combination that fits is `x=10` and `y=8`.\n*   **A = C₆H₁₀**: This corresponds to **cyclohexene**. It has one double bond, so it decolorizes bromine water and has no conjugated bonds. Hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.\n*   **B = C₆H₈**: This corresponds to a cyclohexadiene. There are two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated double bonds) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (isolated double bonds). Since the problem excludes conjugated bonds, B must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**. It decolorizes bromine water and its hydrogenation also yields cyclohexane.\n\nThe disproportionation reaction would be a hydrogen transfer from 1,4-cyclohexadiene to cyclohexene:\n`C₆H₈ (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C₆H₁₀ (cyclohexene) → C₆H₆ (benzene) + C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane)`\nIn this reaction, 1,4-cyclohexadiene loses 2 hydrogen atoms to become benzene, and cyclohexene gains those 2 hydrogen atoms to become cyclohexane. This process, known as catalytic transfer hydrogenation, fits the description perfectly.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe two liquids in the equimolar mixture X are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of these two liquids is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X is **18**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**:\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon (composed of C and H).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let's determine its empirical formula.\n    *   14.28% is very close to 1/7 (since 100/7 ≈ 14.2857).\n    *   Let the formula be CxHy. The mass fraction of H is `(y * AtomicMass(H)) / (x * AtomicMass(C) + y * AtomicMass(H))`.\n    *   Using approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12), we have: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`.\n    *   This gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   The formula is of the type CnH2n.\n    *   Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it's a saturated compound. A saturated compound with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent matching this description is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. This will be our working assumption for Z.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**:\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from mixture X.\n    *   One of the liquids in Y is Z itself (cyclohexane, C6H12). Let's call the other liquid D. So, Y = (cyclohexane + D).\n    *   Y (and therefore both its components) does not decolorize bromine water. This means D is unreactive towards bromine water under standard conditions.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. This means hydrogenation of D must also yield Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   What could D be? It must be a C6 compound (since it hydrogenates to C6H12). It's unreactive to Br2 water. The most plausible candidate is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene is aromatic and does not react with aqueous bromine, and its hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.\n    *   So, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction**:\n    *   X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n    *   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in A or B.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This confirms that both A and B have a C6 carbon skeleton (a six-membered ring).\n    *   The reaction is a disproportionation (or hydrogen transfer) where X forms Y:\n        `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> cyclohexane + benzene`\n    *   Since A and B are C6 compounds, let their formulas be C6Hx and C6Hy.\n    *   By the principle of conservation of atoms, the number of hydrogen atoms must be equal on both sides of the reaction equation:\n        `Number of H in A + Number of H in B = Number of H in cyclohexane + Number of H in benzene`\n        `x + y = 12 + 6`\n        `x + y = 18`\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**:\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is precisely the value `x + y` we just calculated.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 18. This corresponds to option B.\n\nNow, I will write a Python code snippet that formalizes this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the properties of the products in mixture Y.\n# Based on the problem description, substance Z is identified as cyclohexane,\n# and the other component of mixture Y is identified as benzene.\n# We define the number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each.\n\n# Number of hydrogen atoms in a molecule of cyclohexane (C6H12)\nh_atoms_cyclohexane = 12\n\n# Number of hydrogen atoms in a molecule of benzene (C6H6)\nh_atoms_benzene = 6\n\n# Step 2: Apply the principle of conservation of atoms.\n# The reaction is a disproportionation of mixture X (containing two liquids, A and B)\n# into an equimolar mixture Y (cyclohexane and benzene).\n# Reaction: A + B -> cyclohexane + benzene\n# The total number of hydrogen atoms must be conserved.\n# Therefore, the total hydrogen atoms in the reactants (A and B) must equal\n# the total hydrogen atoms in the products (cyclohexane and benzene).\n\ntotal_h_atoms_in_X = h_atoms_cyclohexane + h_atoms_benzene\n\n# Step 3: Print the final answer.\n# The problem asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\nprint(f\"The number of hydrogen atoms in cyclohexane is: {h_atoms_cyclohexane}\")\nprint(f\"The number of hydrogen atoms in benzene is: {h_atoms_benzene}\")\nprint(f\"By conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in the products.\")\nprint(f\"Total hydrogen atoms = {h_atoms_cyclohexane} + {h_atoms_benzene} = {total_h_atoms_in_X}\")\n\n# Step 4: Identify the correct option.\noptions = {'A': 22, 'B': 18, 'C': 16, 'D': 12}\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value == total_h_atoms_in_X:\n        correct_option = option\n        break\n\nprint(f\"The final answer is {total_h_atoms_in_X}, which corresponds to option {correct_option}.\")\nprint(f\"For reference, the choices are:\")\nprint(\"A) 22\")\nprint(\"B) 18\")\nprint(\"C) 16\")\nprint(\"D) 12\")\nprint(\"The calculated answer is 18.\")\n<<<B>>>\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: \nErrors:   File \"<stdin>\", line 43\n    <<<B>>>\n    ^^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Substance Z**\n*   Substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CₓHᵧ.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by: (mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * 1.008) / (x * 12.01 + y * 1.008) = 0.1428.\n*   The value 14.28% is very close to 1/7 (1 / 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n*   Assuming the mass fraction is exactly 1/7, this means the mass of hydrogen is 1 part and the mass of carbon is 6 parts.\n*   The ratio of the number of atoms is (moles of C) : (moles of H) = (mass of C / atomic mass of C) : (mass of H / atomic mass of H)\n*   Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1): n(C) : n(H) = (6/12) : (1/1) = 0.5 : 1 = 1 : 2.\n*   So, the empirical formula of Z is (CH₂)ₙ. This corresponds to the general formula for alkenes or cycloalkanes (CₙH₂ₙ).\n*   The problem states that mixture Y, which contains Z, does *not* decolorize bromine water. This means Z must be a saturated compound. Therefore, Z cannot be an alkene. It must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂.\n*   Let's check the mass fraction of hydrogen for cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂): H% = (12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12 * 1) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 = 14.28%. This is a perfect match.\n*   Thus, **Substance Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Mixture Y and the Hydrogenation Process**\n*   Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* cyclohexane (Z). This implies that all compounds in both mixtures have a six-carbon ring as their basic carbon skeleton.\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of them is Z (cyclohexane). Let the other be D. So, Y = {cyclohexane, D}.\n*   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, so both cyclohexane and D must be saturated compounds.\n*   Hydrogenation of Y gives only cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of cyclohexane gives cyclohexane. Therefore, hydrogenation of D must also give cyclohexane.\n*   Since D is already saturated and has a six-carbon ring skeleton, and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane, this can be reconciled if we consider the overall reaction scheme. The most likely scenario involves a substance that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction**\n*   Mixture X is treated with platinum when heated, resulting in a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y.\n*   A disproportionation reaction is a type of redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced to form two different products. In the context of hydrocarbons on a Pt catalyst, this often involves the transfer of hydrogen. One molecule gains hydrogen (is reduced), and another loses hydrogen (is oxidized).\n*   A classic example of such a reaction is the disproportionation of cyclohexene: 3 C₆H₁₀ → 2 C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆ (cyclohexane and benzene). However, this produces a 2:1 mixture, not an equimolar (1:1) mixture as stated for Y.\n*   Let's rethink mixture Y. We know Y = {cyclohexane, D}, and hydrogenation of both gives cyclohexane. A compound that fits the description for D (has a C₆ skeleton, is a liquid, does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane) is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene requires a catalyst for bromination and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n*   So, we can propose that **Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Composition of Mixture X**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n*   The disproportionation reaction is: A + B → cyclohexane + benzene.\n*   Since the products are in an equimolar ratio (1:1), the reactants A and B must also react in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   The reaction is a transfer of hydrogen. We can balance the atoms.\n    *   C atoms: The total number of carbon atoms on the left must be 6 + 6 = 12. Since A and B both have a C₆ skeleton, this is satisfied.\n    *   H atoms: The total number of hydrogen atoms must also be conserved. The total H atoms in the products are 12 (from C₆H₁₂) + 6 (from C₆H₆) = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B must be 18.\n*   The question asks for \"the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\", which means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component liquid.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion and Verification**\n*   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two molecules from mixture X (one molecule of A and one of B) is 18.\n*   Let's verify this is plausible. Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B are unsaturated (contain double bonds). They have C₆ skeletons. Let A be cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and B be a cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   Number of H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18. This fits.\n*   The problem also states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds. Cyclohexene has one double bond (non-conjugated). Cyclohexadiene has two common isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). So B must be 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n*   The reaction would be:\n    *   C₆H₁₀ (cyclohexene) + C₆H₈ (1,4-cyclohexadiene) → C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane) + C₆H₆ (benzene)\n*   In this reaction, the diene (C₆H₈) is oxidized to benzene by losing 2 H atoms, and the ene (C₆H₁₀) is reduced to cyclohexane by gaining 2 H atoms. This is a perfectly valid disproportionation reaction. All conditions of the problem are met.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of cyclohexene (10 H) and one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (8 H).\nTotal H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of Z be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `(y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1)`, assuming atomic masses H=1 and C=12.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`\n    *   `y = 0.1428 * (12x + y) = 1.7136x + 0.1428y`\n    *   `0.8572y = 1.7136x`\n    *   `y/x = 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2`.\n    *   This indicates the empirical formula is CH2, and the general formula is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not decolorize bromine water, which means it is a saturated compound. A hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n that is saturated must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z also does not react further with hydrogen, confirming it is saturated.\n\n2.  **Determine the Carbon Skeleton**\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* substance Z. This is a crucial piece of information. It means that all the compounds present in both mixtures (the two in X and the two in Y) must have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   For example, if Z is cyclohexane, all other compounds must also have a C6 ring skeleton.\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   One of its components is Z (the cycloalkane, CnH2n).\n    *   Let the other component be Y2. Since Y doesn't decolorize bromine water, Y2 must also be saturated or be an aromatic compound (which doesn't react with Br2 water without a catalyst).\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. This means hydrogenation of Y2 must also give Z. If Y2 were another saturated cycloalkane, it would have to be Z itself. But the problem says Y is a mixture of \"two other liquids\" formed from X. Let's assume the components of Y are different.\n    *   Therefore, Y2 must be an aromatic compound whose carbon skeleton is the same as Z's and which hydrogenates to Z.\n    *   So, Mixture Y = { CnH2n (Z, a cycloalkane), Aromatic compound (Ar) }.\n\n4.  **Identify Mixture X and the Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2, that decolorizes bromine water. This means they contain C=C double bonds. They must be cycloalkenes or cycloalkadienes with the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X.\n    *   Mixture X is converted to Mixture Y in a \"disproportionation\" reaction, producing an equimolar mixture. A disproportionation reaction where a single substance reacts (e.g., `3A -> B + 2C`) does not produce an equimolar mixture. Therefore, the reaction must be an intermolecular hydrogen transfer between the two components of X: `X1 + X2 -> Y1 + Y2`. This type of reaction is often referred to as disproportionation in catalysis.\n    *   In this reaction, one molecule is oxidized (loses hydrogen) to form the aromatic compound (Ar), and the other molecule is reduced (gains hydrogen) to form the cycloalkane (Z).\n    *   So, the reaction is: `Cycloalkadiene + Cycloalkene -> Aromatic + Cycloalkane`. The diene is oxidized, and the alkene is reduced.\n\n5.  **Examine Possible Skeletons and Find the Solution**\n    We need to find a cycloalkane Z that is a common solvent and has a corresponding stable aromatic analogue. The simplest and most common cases involve a six-membered ring.\n\n    *   **Case 1: C6 Skeleton**\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12). This is a very widely used solvent.\n        *   The corresponding aromatic compound is Benzene (C6H6).\n        *   Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane, Benzene}. Both are liquids, and the mixture doesn't decolorize Br2 water. This fits.\n        *   The reaction is `X1 + X2 -> C6H12 + C6H6`. By conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogens in X1 and X2 must be `12 + 6 = 18`.\n        *   Mixture X must consist of a cyclohexene (C6H10) and a cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Let's check the hydrogen sum: `10 + 8 = 18`. This fits perfectly.\n        *   The diene must be non-conjugated, which means it must be 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n        *   So, X = {Cyclohexene, 1,4-Cyclohexadiene}. All conditions are met.\n        *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of each component: 10 (from C6H10) + 8 (from C6H8) = **18**.\n\n    *   **Case 2: C7 Skeleton (Methylated C6 ring)**\n        *   Z = Methylcyclohexane (C7H14). Also a solvent.\n        *   The corresponding aromatic compound is Toluene (C7H8).\n        *   Mixture Y = {Methylcyclohexane, Toluene}. This fits.\n        *   The total number of hydrogens in the reactants (X1, X2) must be `14 + 8 = 22`.\n        *   Mixture X would be a methylcyclohexene (C7H12) and a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (C7H10). The sum of hydrogens is `12 + 10 = 22`. This case also works. The total number of H atoms would be 22.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    Both the C6 and C7 cases are chemically plausible and lead to answers listed in the options (18 for C6, 22 for C7). In the absence of further information that could distinguish between these cases, we rely on the common practice in chemistry problems to assume the simplest, unsubstituted parent structure unless otherwise specified. The C6 system (cyclohexane/benzene) is the fundamental parent system for this type of reaction.\n\n    Therefore, the most probable intended answer is the one derived from the C6 case.\n\n    The two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z:**\n    The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. We can determine its general formula.\n    -   For an alkane (CnH2n+2), the mass fraction of hydrogen is (2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2). This does not yield a simple integer solution for n.\n    -   For a cycloalkane (CnH2n), the mass fraction of hydrogen is (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7.\n    -   1/7 is approximately 0.142857, which corresponds to 14.28%. Thus, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n\n    We are also told that Z is a component of mixture Y, is widely used as a solvent, and is formed by the hydrogenation of mixtures X and Y. A very common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane, C6H12. This fits the formula CnH2n for n=6. Therefore, Z is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n2.  **Characterize Mixture Y:**\n    -   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, indicating the components are saturated or unreactive like aromatic rings.\n    -   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is one of the components.\n    -   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means the other component of Y must also convert to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n    -   A plausible candidate for the second component is benzene (C6H6). Benzene does not decolorize bromine water and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane (C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12).\n    -   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n3.  **Characterize the Reaction and Mixture X:**\n    -   Mixture X is converted to mixture Y (cyclohexane + benzene) upon heating with platinum. This reaction is described as a disproportionation, a redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized (loses hydrogen) and reduced (gains hydrogen).\n    -   The formation of an equimolar mixture of benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12) from an equimolar mixture of two compounds (X1 and X2) can be represented by the following hydrogen transfer reaction:\n        X1 + X2 → C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane)\n    -   By balancing the atoms, the total composition of X1 and X2 must be C12H18. Since both X1 and X2 must have the same carbon skeleton (a C6 ring, as they hydrogenate to cyclohexane), their formulas must be C6Ha and C6Hb where a + b = 18.\n    -   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning its components (X1 and X2) are unsaturated (contain double bonds). They must be cycloalkenes or cycloalkadienes.\n    -   The condition that there are no conjugated multiple bonds rules out 1,3-cyclohexadiene.\n    -   Let's test the pair of a=10 and b=8. This corresponds to X1 = cyclohexene (C6H10) and X2 = a cyclohexadiene (C6H8). To meet the non-conjugated bond condition, this must be 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    -   The proposed disproportionation reaction is:\n        C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) → C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\n    -   This reaction is chemically sound; the cyclohexadiene is oxidized to benzene, and the cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane, with platinum serving as the catalyst for hydrogen transfer. Both components of X, cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene, would decolorize bromine water and would hydrogenate to form only cyclohexane.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms:**\n    -   The two liquids constituting mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    -   The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each liquid is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in their formulas.\n    -   Total H atoms = (H atoms in C6H10) + (H atoms in C6H8) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nThe reasoning behind the solution is consistent and supported by established chemical principles. Here is a summary of the logical steps taken:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z**: Substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage corresponds to the general formula CnH2n. Since Z does not react further with hydrogen and is used as a solvent, it is identified as the saturated cycloalkane, cyclohexane (C6H12). The hydrogenation of benzene is a common industrial method to produce cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water and contains Z. Hydrogenation of mixture Y yields only Z (cyclohexane). This indicates the other component must also have a six-carbon ring structure that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. The prime candidate that fits these criteria is benzene (C6H6). Benzene's aromaticity makes it stable, and it does not react with bromine water under normal conditions. Hydrogenation of benzene does produce cyclohexane. Therefore, mixture Y consists of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction X to Y**: An equimolar mixture X is converted into an equimolar mixture Y via a platinum-catalyzed disproportionation reaction. The overall reaction can be written as:\n    Component A₁ (from X) + Component A₂ (from X) → Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    This is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one component is dehydrogenated to benzene, and the other is hydrogenated to cyclohexane. By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of hydrogen atoms from the two components of X must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n    Total H atoms = H atoms in Benzene + H atoms in Cyclohexane = 6 + 12 = 18.\n\n4.  **Characterize Mixture X**: Mixture X consists of two liquids that decolorize bromine water, which confirms they are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds). Upon hydrogenation, both components yield cyclohexane, confirming they are C6 cyclic compounds. The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X.\n\n5.  **Identify Components of X**: Based on the criteria for X, we look for non-conjugated C6 cycloalkenes or cycloalkadienes.\n    *   Cyclohexene (C6H10) is a C6 cycloalkene.\n    *   Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) is a C6 cycloalkadiene with non-conjugated double bonds. Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a conjugated isomer and is thus excluded.\n    The disproportionation reaction where one molecule acts as a hydrogen donor and the other as an acceptor is well-documented, particularly for cyclohexadienes and related compounds, often referred to as Zelinsky irreversible catalysis. The most plausible reaction is the transfer of hydrogen from cyclohexa-1,4-diene to cyclohexene:\n    C6H8 (cyclohexa-1,4-diene) + C6H10 (cyclohexene) → C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane).\n    The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component of mixture X is 8 + 10 = 18. This matches the calculation from step 3.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This refers to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two different compounds.\n\n*   Liquid 1: Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)\n*   Liquid 2: Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula for the hydrocarbon be CₙHₘ.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `Mass % H = (m * Ar(H)) / (n * Ar(C) + m * Ar(H))`, where Ar is the atomic weight (Ar(H) ≈ 1, Ar(C) ≈ 12).\n    *   `0.1428 = m / (12n + m)`\n    *   `0.1428 * (12n + m) = m`\n    *   `1.7136n + 0.1428m = m`\n    *   `1.7136n = 0.8572m`\n    *   `m / n = 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2`\n    *   This gives an empirical formula of CH₂. The general formula for a hydrocarbon with this ratio is CₙH₂ₙ. This corresponds to either an alkene with one double bond or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of Z**\n    *   Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only one* substance, Z. This strongly implies that all compounds in both mixtures share the same carbon skeleton, which is that of Z.\n    *   Z is also described as being \"widely used as a solvent\". Among cycloalkanes, cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) is a very common industrial solvent.\n    *   Let's check if C₆H₁₂ fits the mass fraction: `Mass % H = (12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12 * 1) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857`. This is a perfect match.\n    *   Therefore, Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n\n3.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from the disproportionation of X.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   One component of Y is Z, which is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Let's call this Y₁.\n    *   Hydrogenation of the other component, Y₂, must also yield cyclohexane. For this to be possible, Y₂ must have the same C₆ skeleton. Since Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be an alkene or alkyne. An aromatic compound like benzene (C₆H₆) does not react with bromine water and can be hydrogenated under severe conditions (as stated in the problem) to form cyclohexane: `C₆H₆ + 3H₂ --(Pt, heat, pressure)--> C₆H₁₂`.\n    *   Thus, mixture Y consists of cyclohexane (Y₁ = C₆H₁₂) and benzene (Y₂ = C₆H₆).\n\n4.  **Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X (composed of two liquids, X₁ and X₂) reacts to form mixture Y (cyclohexane and benzene). A disproportionation reaction, in this context, is a hydrogen transfer reaction where no atoms are lost from the system.\n    *   The reaction is: `X₁ + X₂ --(Pt, heat)--> Y₁ + Y₂`.\n    *   Since mixture X and mixture Y are both equimolar, the stoichiometry is 1:1 for reactants and products: `1 X₁ + 1 X₂ → 1 Y₁ + 1 Y₂`.\n    *   According to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the equation.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the products is the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and one molecule of benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**\n    *   Since the total number of hydrogen atoms is conserved, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (one molecule of X₁ and one molecule of X₂) must also be 18.\n    *   Let's verify that plausible compounds for X exist. Mixture X must decolorize bromine water (so X₁ and X₂ are unsaturated) and have no conjugated bonds. They both must have a C₆ skeleton.\n        *   A possible candidate for X₁ is cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀).\n        *   A possible candidate for X₂ is 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈), which is not conjugated.\n        *   The sum of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n        *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ (cyclohexene) + C₆H₈ (1,4-cyclohexadiene) → C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane) + C₆H₆ (benzene)` is a balanced hydrogen transfer. This confirms our model is chemically consistent.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n\nTotal H atoms = H(X₁) + H(X₂) = 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the chemical formula of hydrocarbon Z.**\nZ is a hydrocarbon with the general formula CxHy.\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%, which is 0.1428.\nMass fraction of H = (Atomic mass of H * y) / (Molecular Mass of CxHy)\n0.1428 = (1 * y) / (12 * x + 1 * y)\n*Using approximate integer atomic masses: H=1, C=12.*\n1 / 0.1428 ≈ 7\nSo, (12x + y) / y = 7\n12x/y + 1 = 7\n12x/y = 6\nx/y = 6/12 = 1/2\nThis means the ratio of hydrogen atoms to carbon atoms is 2:1, so the empirical formula is CH2. The general formula is (CH2)n or CnH2n.\n\nThe problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen). The general formula for a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon (alkane) is CnH(2n+2). The general formula for a saturated cyclic hydrocarbon (cycloalkane) is CnH2n.\nSince the formula of Z is CnH2n, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the specific molecule Z.**\nZ is a common solvent. The simplest cycloalkanes are cyclopropane, cyclobutane, cyclopentane, and cyclohexane. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very widely used industrial solvent. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n*   Formula: C6H12. This fits CnH2n.\n*   Mass %H: (12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12 * 1) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. This matches.\n*   It's a saturated cycloalkane.\n*   It's a common solvent.\nSo, Z is very likely Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n**Step 3: Identify the components of mixture Y.**\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of these liquids is Z, which is Cyclohexane (C6H12). Let the other liquid be D.\nSo, Y = {Cyclohexane, D}.\nMixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. Cyclohexane is saturated and does not react. So, D must also not decolorize bromine water (implying it is saturated or aromatic).\nHydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (Cyclohexane).\n*   Hydrogenation of Cyclohexane gives Cyclohexane.\n*   Hydrogenation of D must also give Cyclohexane.\nFor D to be hydrogenated to Cyclohexane, it must have the same C6 carbon skeleton. The only common C6 compound that fits this and doesn't decolorize bromine water is Benzene (C6H6). Benzene is aromatic and only gets hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions (high temperature and pressure with a catalyst), which matches the description.\nTherefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of Benzene (C6H6) and Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the reaction from mixture X to mixture Y.**\nMixture X, an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them A and B), is treated with platinum when heated to form mixture Y.\nThe reaction is:\nA + B --(Pt, heat)--> Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12)\nThis is described as a disproportionation. In this context, it is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X loses hydrogen (is dehydrogenated) to form benzene, while the other component gains hydrogen (is hydrogenated) to form cyclohexane. The total number of atoms of each element must be conserved.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X.**\nBased on the principle of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\nReactants: one molecule of A + one molecule of B\nProducts: one molecule of Benzene + one molecule of Cyclohexane\n\nTotal H atoms in products = (H atoms in C6H6) + (H atoms in C6H12)\nTotal H atoms in products = 6 + 12 = 18\n\nTherefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be 18.\n\n**Verification of the scenario (Optional but confirms consistency):**\n*   **Mixture X**: Must contain two C6 cyclic compounds (since they both form C6 cyclic products). They must be unsaturated (decolorize bromine water) and not have conjugated double bonds. They must have a total of 18 hydrogen atoms. A plausible pair is Cyclohexene (C6H10) and Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n    *   H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18. (Correct)\n    *   Both are unsaturated. (Correct)\n    *   Cyclohexa-1,4-diene is not conjugated. (Correct)\n    *   Reaction: C6H8 + C6H10 -> C6H6 + C6H12. This is a balanced hydrogen transfer. The diene loses 2H to become benzene, and the hexene gains 2H to become cyclohexane. (Consistent)\n    *   Hydrogenation of X: Hydrogenating C6H10 and C6H8 both yield C6H12 (Cyclohexane). (Consistent)\n\nThe logic is sound. The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon CxHy can be approximated as `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   14.28% is approximately 1/7. So, `y / (12x + y) ≈ 1/7`, which gives `7y ≈ 12x + y`, or `6y ≈ 12x`, leading to `y = 2x`.\n    *   The general formula for Z is `CnH2n`.\n    *   The problem states Z is fully saturated (does not react further with hydrogen) and is used as a solvent. A hydrocarbon with the formula `CnH2n` that is saturated must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Identify the components of Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated (like alkanes/cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n    *   Z is a component of Y. So, one component is the cycloalkane `CnH2n`.\n    *   Let the other component be D. The problem states that hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. This means that component D must also be converted to Z upon hydrogenation.\n    *   Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be an alkene or alkyne. As it can be hydrogenated to the cycloalkane Z, it must be an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton.\n    *   The general formula for a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon corresponding to a cycloalkane `CnH2n` is `CnH(2n-6)` (e.g., benzene `C6H6` corresponds to cyclohexane `C6H12`).\n    *   So, mixture Y consists of an equimolar mixture of a cycloalkane (`CnH2n`) and an aromatic hydrocarbon (`CnH(2n-6)`).\n\n3.  **Identify the components of Mixture X and the Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B, which decolorize bromine water. This means they are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   The hydrogenation of mixture X also produces only Z (`CnH2n`). This means A and B have the same carbon skeleton as Z and are unsaturated precursors to it.\n    *   Mixture X is converted to mixture Y via a platinum-catalyzed disproportionation reaction. Since X is an equimolar mixture and Y is also an equimolar mixture, the reaction stoichiometry is likely 1:1.\n    *   The reaction is `A + B -> C + D`, where C and D are the components of Y.\n        `A + B -> CnH2n + CnH(2n-6)`\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X is reduced to the cycloalkane, and the other is oxidized to the aromatic compound.\n    *   Let's determine the formulas of A and B. Since they are unsaturated precursors to `CnH2n`, they are likely a cycloalkene and a cyclodiene.\n        *   A cycloalkene has the formula `CnH(2n-2)`.\n        *   A cyclodiene has the formula `CnH(2n-4)`.\n    *   Let's check if this fits the reaction: `CnH(2n-2) + CnH(2n-4) -> CnH2n + CnH(2n-6)`.\n    *   Total atoms on the left: C = 2n, H = (2n-2) + (2n-4) = 4n-6.\n    *   Total atoms on the right: C = 2n, H = 2n + (2n-6) = 4n-6.\n    *   The reaction is balanced. So, mixture X consists of a cycloalkene (A) and a cyclodiene (B).\n\n4.  **Apply the \"No Conjugated Bonds\" Constraint**\n    *   The problem states that compounds in mixture X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   A, the cycloalkene `CnH(2n-2)`, has only one double bond, so it cannot have conjugated bonds.\n    *   B, the cyclodiene `CnH(2n-4)`, can have conjugated or isolated double bonds. The constraint requires us to choose an isomer with isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds.\n\n5.  **Determine the value of 'n'**\n    *   We have a general solution that works for different values of n (e.g., n=6, n=7, etc.).\n        *   **Case n=6**: Z is cyclohexane (`C6H12`). Y is {cyclohexane, benzene (`C6H6`)}. X is {cyclohexene (`C6H10`), 1,4-cyclohexadiene (`C6H8`)}. 1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated. This is a valid solution.\n        *   **Case n=7**: Z is methylcyclohexane (`C7H14`). Y is {methylcyclohexane, toluene (`C7H8`)}. X is {methylcyclohexene (`C7H12`), a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene like 1-methyl-1,4-cyclohexadiene (`C7H10`)}. This is also a valid solution.\n    *   To find the final answer, we must choose between these cases. In such chemistry problems, the simplest, most fundamental parent system is usually the intended answer unless otherwise specified. The cyclohexane/benzene system (n=6) is the most fundamental example of this type of chemistry.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   Based on the choice of n=6, the two liquids in mixture X are:\n        *   Liquid A: Cyclohexene, `C6H10`\n        *   Liquid B: 1,4-Cyclohexadiene, `C6H8`\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each liquid.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in `C6H10`) + (H atoms in `C6H8`) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of hydrocarbon Z.**\nThe problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as:\nMass % of H = (y × Atomic Mass of H) / (x × Atomic Mass of C + y × Atomic Mass of H)\n\nUsing integer atomic masses for simplicity (C ≈ 12, H ≈ 1), the formula becomes:\n0.1428 = y / (12x + y)\n\nThe value 0.1428 is very close to 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). We can assume this is the intended ratio.\ny / (12x + y) = 1/7\n7y = 12x + y\n6y = 12x\ny = 2x\n\nThis means the general formula for the hydrocarbon Z is CnH2n. The problem also states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which means it is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the general formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n\nFurthermore, Z is described as a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The most common and simple cycloalkane used as a solvent is cyclohexane. Let's check if cyclohexane, C6H12, fits the data. For C6H12, n=6, and the formula is CnH2n. The mass fraction of hydrogen is:\nMass % of H = 12 / (6×12 + 12) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%.\nThis matches perfectly. Therefore, **Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the components of mixture Y.**\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. We already know one component is Z, which is cyclohexane (C6H12). Mixture Y \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" which is true for saturated compounds like cyclohexane. The other component must also not decolorize bromine water, which means it is either saturated or aromatic.\n\nThe problem states that hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Hydrogenation of the cyclohexane component of Y yields no reaction, as it's already saturated.\n*   Therefore, the other component of Y must be hydrogenated to form cyclohexane.\n\nAn aromatic compound would fit this description, as they do not react with bromine water under normal conditions but can be hydrogenated under severe conditions. The only aromatic C6 compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane is **benzene (C6H6)**.\nThus, **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the conversion of mixture X to mixture Y and find the total number of hydrogen atoms.**\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (A and B) that undergoes a disproportionation reaction when heated with platinum to form the equimolar mixture Y (benzene and cyclohexane).\nThe reaction is:\nA + B --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 + C6H12\n\nThis reaction is a catalytic hydrogen transfer. One component of X is oxidized (loses hydrogen) to become benzene, and the other component is reduced (gains hydrogen) to become cyclohexane.\n\nAccording to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms on the reactant side must equal the total on the product side. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B must equal the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of benzene and one molecule of cyclohexane.\n\nTotal H atoms in mixture X = (H atoms in benzene) + (H atoms in cyclohexane)\nTotal H atoms in mixture X = 6 + 12\nTotal H atoms in mixture X = 18\n\n**Verification:**\nMixture X must contain two C6 unsaturated hydrocarbons that, when hydrogenated, give only cyclohexane. They must not have conjugated double bonds. A plausible combination is cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n*   Sum of hydrogens: 10 + 8 = 18. This matches.\n*   Reaction: C6H8 + C6H10 --> C6H6 + C6H12. This is a balanced hydrogen transfer. The diene loses 2H to become benzene, and the alkene gains 2H to become cyclohexane, producing an equimolar mixture.\n*   Both are unsaturated (will decolorize bromine water).\n*   Neither has conjugated bonds (cyclohexa-1,4-diene has isolated double bonds).\n*   Both hydrogenate to C6H12.\nAll conditions are met.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

This means the other component of Y must also have a C6 carbon skeleton and can be hydrogenated to form cyclohexane.\n    *   Since this second component does not decolorize bromine water, it must be aromatic (as a saturated isomer wouldn't hydrogenate to cyclohexane).\n    *   The only C6 aromatic hydrocarbon is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene fits the description: it does not decolorize bromine water on its own and hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X:**\n    *   The transformation from mixture X to mixture Y is a chemical reaction:\n        `Mixture X (A + B) → Mixture Y (C6H12 + C6H6)`\n    *   According to the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (the two liquids of mixture X) must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products (the two liquids of mixture Y).\n    *   Total H atoms in X = (H atoms in Cyclohexane) + (H atoms in Benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms in X = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\nSubstance Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.

The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `m / (12n + m)`.\n`m / (12n + m) = 0.1428`\n`m ≈ 0.1428 * (12n + m)`\n`m ≈ 1.7136n + 0.1428m`\n`0.8572m ≈ 1.7136n`\n`m/n ≈ 2`\nThis gives an empirical formula of CH₂.\n\nSaturated hydrocarbons are either alkanes (CnH2n+2) or cycloalkanes (CnH2n).\n- For alkanes, the H/C ratio is `(2n+2)/n = 2 + 2/n`, which approaches 2 as n becomes large.\n- For cycloalkanes, the H/C ratio is `2n/n = 2`.\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen in a cycloalkane is `(2n * 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857`, which is 14.28%. This perfectly matches the data. So, Z is a cycloalkane.\n\nThe problem states that Z is a widely used solvent. It is also the sole product of hydrogenating all other compounds involved, under severe conditions. This suggests Z is a very stable cycloalkane. The most common and stable six-carbon cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\nLet's confirm the hydrogen percentage for cyclohexane: H% = (12 * 1.008) / (6 * 12.011 + 12 * 1.008) = 12.096 / 84.162 ≈ 14.37%, which is close. Using integer masses: 12 / (6*12 + 12) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. Thus, **Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Mixture Y\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from the disproportionation of X.\n- Y does not decolorize bromine water, indicating its components are saturated or aromatic.\n- One component of Y is Z (cyclohexane). Let's call the other component Y₂. So, Y = (cyclohexane + Y₂).\n- Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means hydrogenating Y₂ must also yield cyclohexane.\n- A key piece of information is that heating unsaturated six-membered rings with a platinum catalyst can cause a disproportionation reaction, yielding benzene and cyclohexane.\n- Let's test if Y could be a mixture of benzene (C₆H₆) and cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n    - It's an equimolar mixture of two different liquids. (Fits)\n    - Does it decolorize bromine water? Neither benzene nor cyclohexane reacts with bromine water under normal conditions. (Fits)\n    - Is Z (cyclohexane) a constituent of Y? Yes. (Fits)\n    - Does hydrogenation of Y give only Z? Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of cyclohexane results in no reaction. So, yes, the only final product is cyclohexane. (Fits)\nThis hypothesis is consistent with all the facts. So, **Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene (C₆H₆) and cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Mixture X\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n- The reaction is: A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Benzene (C₆H₆) + Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)\n- Since this is a disproportionation between A and B, atom counts must be conserved. The total formula on the product side is C₁₂H₁₈. Therefore, A + B must also sum to C₁₂H₁₈.\n- Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only cyclohexane. This implies that both A and B must be C₆ hydrocarbons with a six-carbon ring structure. Let A = C₆Hₓ and B = C₆Hᵧ.\n- From atom conservation, we have x + y = 18.\n- Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning both A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds), so x < 12 and y < 12.\n- A final constraint is that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X.\n\nLet's find a pair of unsaturated C₆ cyclic hydrocarbons that fit these conditions. The most common ones are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n- Let A = Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀). Here, x = 10.\n- This would require B to be C₆H₈ (since 10 + 8 = 18). This corresponds to cyclohexadiene.\n- Let's check the conditions for this pair:\n    - **Unsaturation:** Both cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water. (Fits)\n    - **Non-conjugation:** Cyclohexene has only one double bond, so there is no conjugation. Cyclohexadiene has two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated, isolated double bonds). To fit the condition, B must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**. (Fits)\n    - **Disproportionation:** The reaction C₆H₁₀ (cyclohexene) + C₆H₈ (1,4-cyclohexadiene) → C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane) + C₆H₆ (benzene) is a balanced hydrogen transfer. Cyclohexene is reduced (gains 2H), and cyclohexadiene is oxidized (loses 2H). This is a classic disproportionation reaction. (Fits)\n\nSo, **mixture X is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n- Number of hydrogen atoms in cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) = 10.\n- Number of hydrogen atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) = 8.\n- Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\n\n1.  **Composition**: Substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n2.  **Formula Calculation**: The mass fraction of hydrogen (H) in a hydrocarbon (CnHm) is given by `(m * Ar(H)) / (n * Ar(C) + m * Ar(H))`, where Ar is the atomic mass. Using approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12), the fraction is `m / (12n + m)`.\n    *   `0.1428 ≈ 1/7`\n    *   `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`\n    *   `7m = 12n + m`\n    *   `6m = 12n`\n    *   `m = 2n`\n3.  **Identification**: The general formula for substance Z is CnH2n. The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n4.  **Properties**: Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent that fits this description is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Let's verify the hydrogen mass fraction for cyclohexane:\n    *   Mass of H = 12 × 1.008 = 12.096\n    *   Molar Mass of C6H12 = (6 × 12.011) + (12 × 1.008) = 72.066 + 12.096 = 84.162 g/mol.\n    *   Mass % of H = (12.096 / 84.162) × 100 ≈ 14.37%, which is very close to 14.28% (1/7).\n\nThus, substance Z is confirmed to be **cyclohexane**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Mixture Y\n\n1.  **Composition**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of its constituents is substance Z, cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's call the other component Y2.\n2.  **Properties**: Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means both cyclohexane and Y2 are saturated compounds (or aromatic, which is unreactive to bromine water under these conditions).\n3.  **Reaction**: Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only cyclohexane. This means that hydrogenating Y2 also produces cyclohexane.\n4.  **Inference**: A plausible candidate for Y2 that fits these descriptions is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene is a liquid at room temperature and does not decolorize bromine water. Its hydrogenation quantitatively produces cyclohexane.\n5.  **Formation**: Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X when heated with platinum. The disproportionation of unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons to form cyclohexane and benzene is a known reaction, often referred to as Zelinsky irreversible catalysis.\n\nTherefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Mixture X and Solve the Question\n\n1.  **Composition**: Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two different liquids, let's call them X1 and X2.\n2.  **Properties**:\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, indicating that both X1 and X2 are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   The compounds in mixture X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only cyclohexane. This implies that both X1 and X2 are C6 hydrocarbons with a cyclic structure.\n3.  **Reaction**: The conversion of the equimolar mixture X to the equimolar mixture Y is a disproportionation reaction. This means the overall chemical equation, with a 1:1 molar ratio for the components of X and Y, is:\n    `X1 + X2 —(Pt, heat)→ Cyclohexane + Benzene`\n4.  **Atom Balancing**: Let the formula for X1 be C6Ha and for X2 be C6Hb.\n    `C6Ha + C6Hb → C6H12 + C6H6`\n    To balance the hydrogen atoms:\n    `a + b = 12 + 6`\n    `a + b = 18`\n5.  **Conclusion**: The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2, which is `a + b`.\n\nBased on the atom balance, the total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.\n\nTo further validate this, we can propose identities for X1 and X2. They must be C6 cyclic unsaturated hydrocarbons. `a` and `b` must be less than 12 and sum to 18. Plausible candidates are cyclohexene (C6H10) and a non-conjugated cyclohexadiene like 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n\n*   **X1**: Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n*   **X2**: 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This combination fits all the described conditions. The disproportionation reaction is a hydrogen transfer where cyclohexene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is dehydrogenated to benzene.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n**1. Identify Substance Z**\n*   Substance Z is a hydrocarbon, meaning it contains only carbon (C) and hydrogen (H).\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. We can determine the empirical formula from this. Let the formula be CxHy. The mass percentage of H is `(y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008) = 0.1428`.\n*   A simpler approach is to test common hydrocarbon formulas. For alkanes (CnH2n+2), the H% decreases as n increases. For cycloalkanes (CnH2n), the H% is constant:\n    `H% = (2n * 1) / (n * 12 + 2n * 1) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857`.\n*   This is a perfect match. So, Z is a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n.\n*   The problem states Z is widely used as a solvent. Among cycloalkanes, cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common industrial solvent.\n*   Z does not react further with hydrogen, confirming it is a saturated compound like a cycloalkane.\n*   Therefore, Substance Z is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Hydrogenation Reactions**\n*   Hydrogenation of Mixture X gives *only* Z (cyclohexane). This means both components of X must have a six-carbon ring structure.\n*   Hydrogenation of Mixture Y also gives *only* Z (cyclohexane). Since Z (cyclohexane) is already saturated, it won't react. This implies the other component of Y must also have a six-carbon structure that hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n\n**3. Characterize Mixture X and Mixture Y**\n*   **Mixture X** is an equimolar mix of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. This indicates the presence of carbon-carbon double bonds (unsaturation). The problem specifies there are no *conjugated* double bonds.\n*   **Mixture Y** is an equimolar mix of two liquids that does *not* decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated, or in the case of aromatic rings, do not react with bromine water under these conditions. Z (cyclohexane) is one component. The other component, let's call it W, must also not decolorize bromine water but must hydrogenate to cyclohexane. The only common substance that fits this description is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene's aromatic ring is stable and does not react with bromine water, but under severe conditions with a platinum catalyst, it hydrogenates completely to cyclohexane.\n*   So, **Mixture Y = Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**4. Determine the Disproportionation Reaction**\n*   The reaction is: Mixture X → Mixture Y.\n*   This is a disproportionation reaction where an equimolar mixture of two compounds (A and B from mixture X) reacts to form an equimolar mixture of two other compounds (Z and W from mixture Y). This strongly suggests a hydrogen transfer reaction catalyzed by platinum.\n*   The overall reaction is: `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 + C6H6`.\n*   Since A and B must both have a C6 ring structure, are unsaturated, and one lacks conjugated bonds, let's consider the likely candidates:\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**\n    *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)** (This isomer has non-conjugated double bonds, fitting the description).\n*   Let's see if an equimolar reaction between these two produces an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and benzene:\n    `C6H10 + C6H8 --> C6H12 + C6H6`\n*   Let's check the atom balance:\n    *   **Carbon:** 6 + 6 = 12 on the left; 6 + 6 = 12 on the right. (Balanced)\n    *   **Hydrogen:** 10 + 8 = 18 on the left; 12 + 6 = 18 on the right. (Balanced)\n*   The reaction is balanced and proceeds in a 1:1 molar ratio, fulfilling all conditions. In this reaction, cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is oxidized to benzene.\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Answer**\n*   Mixture X consists of two liquids:\n    *   Liquid 1: **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**, which has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid 2: **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**, which has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (i.e., in one molecule of each).\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon and is fully saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"). This means it's an alkane (CnH2n+2) or a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let's check which formula fits.\n        *   For an alkane (CnH2n+2), the mass fraction of H is `(2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2)`. Setting this to 0.1428 (or 1/7) gives `(2n+2)/(14n+2) = 1/7` => `14n + 14 = 14n + 2`, which is impossible.\n        *   For a cycloalkane (CnH2n), the mass fraction of H is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7`. Since 1/7 ≈ 0.142857, this matches the given data (14.28%).\n    *   So, Z is a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n.\n\n2.  **Determine the Carbon Skeleton**\n    *   Hydrogenation of *both* mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only* substance Z.\n    *   This is a critical piece of information. It means that all the compounds present in both mixtures X and Y are based on the same carbon skeleton, and Z is the fully saturated version of this skeleton.\n    *   Z is described as being \"widely used as a solvent\". Common cycloalkane solvents are cyclohexane (C6H12) and methylcyclohexane (C7H14). Both fit the CnH2n formula.\n\n3.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   It does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Substance Z is one of the components of Y.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n    *   Let's assume the carbon skeleton is a 6-membered ring (n=6). Then Z is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   Y contains cyclohexane. The other component must also have a C6 skeleton, be unreactive to bromine water, and hydrogenate to cyclohexane. The only compound that fits this description is benzene (C6H6). Benzene requires severe conditions for hydrogenation, which aligns with the problem description.\n    *   So, if n=6, Mixture Y = an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**. This fits all the criteria for Y.\n\n4.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   The reaction from X to Y is described as a disproportionation. Given that we start with an equimolar mixture X (let's call the components A and B) and end with an equimolar mixture Y (C and D), the most plausible reaction is a 1:1 intermolecular hydrogen transfer: A + B → C + D.\n    *   In our case, with Y being cyclohexane and benzene, the reaction is: A + B → C6H12 + C6H6.\n    *   This means one component of X is oxidized (loses hydrogen) to form benzene, and the other component is reduced (gains hydrogen) to form cyclohexane.\n    *   Let A be C6Hx and B be C6Hy.\n        *   Oxidation: C6Hx → C6H6. Hydrogen atoms lost = x - 6.\n        *   Reduction: C6Hy → C6H12. Hydrogen atoms gained = 12 - y.\n    *   For the hydrogen transfer to be balanced, the number of H atoms lost must equal the number gained: x - 6 = 12 - y, which simplifies to **x + y = 18**.\n    *   Now, let's use the other properties of X:\n        *   The components decolorize bromine water, so they must be unsaturated (contain C=C bonds). This means x < 12 and y < 12. For a C6 ring, the most saturated alkene is cyclohexene (C6H10), so x ≤ 10 and y ≤ 10.\n        *   There are no conjugated multiple bonds.\n        *   A and B must be different compounds, so x ≠ y.\n    *   We need to find two different integers, x and y, both less than or equal to 10, that sum to 18. The only possible pair is **x = 10** and **y = 8**.\n    *   So, the two liquids in mixture X have the formulas C6H10 and C6H8.\n        *   **C6H10**: This is cyclohexene. It has one double bond, is a liquid, decolorizes bromine water, and has no conjugated bonds. It hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n        *   **C6H8**: This is a cyclohexadiene. To satisfy the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" condition, it must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**, not 1,3-cyclohexadiene. It has two double bonds, is a liquid, decolorizes bromine water, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n    *   The reaction is plausible: The more unsaturated 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) is oxidized to benzene (C6H6), and the less unsaturated cyclohexene (C6H10) is reduced to cyclohexane (C6H12). The transfer involves 2 hydrogen atoms.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each liquid is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in their formulas.\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 (from C6H10) + 8 (from C6H8) = 18.\n\nThis result matches one of the options. A similar analysis for the C7 case (Z=methylcyclohexane) would lead to a total of 22 hydrogen atoms (from C7H12 and C7H10), which is also an option. However, the C6 system (cyclohexane/benzene) is the most fundamental and classic example of this type of chemistry, making it the most likely intended answer in a problem of this nature. The C6 scenario fulfills all conditions without ambiguity.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\nSubstance Z is a hydrocarbon, meaning its formula is CnHm. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%.\n\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen can be expressed as:\nMass Fraction (H) = (Total mass of H) / (Total mass of compound)\n0.1428 = (m × 1) / (n × 12 + m × 1)\n\nThis simplifies to m/n ≈ 2. The empirical formula is CH2.\nThe general formula for a hydrocarbon with this ratio is CnH2n. This corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\nThe problem states that Z is a constituent of mixture Y, which does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates that Z is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n\nFurthermore, Z is formed by the hydrogenation of mixtures X and Y and does not react further with hydrogen, confirming it is a fully saturated hydrocarbon under the given conditions. A common cycloalkane solvent with the formula CnH2n is cyclohexane (C6H12).\nLet's verify the mass fraction of hydrogen in cyclohexane (C6H12):\n*   Mass of Hydrogen = 12 × 1.008 g/mol ≈ 12 g/mol\n*   Mass of Carbon = 6 × 12.011 g/mol ≈ 72 g/mol\n*   Total Molar Mass ≈ 84 g/mol\n*   Mass fraction of H = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857, which is 14.28%.\n\nThis is a perfect match. Thus, **Substance Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Mixture Y\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from the disproportionation of X. It does not decolorize bromine water. Crucially, the hydrogenation of mixture Y yields only substance Z (cyclohexane). Also, Z itself is one of the components of mixture Y.\n\nLet the components of Y be Y1 and Y2. We know Y1 is Z, which is cyclohexane (C6H12).\nWhen mixture Y (Y1 + Y2) is hydrogenated, it gives only cyclohexane.\n*   Hydrogenation of Y1 (cyclohexane) naturally yields cyclohexane.\n*   Hydrogenation of Y2 must also yield cyclohexane.\n\nSince mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, its components are considered saturated in this context. While alkanes and cycloalkanes are saturated, aromatic compounds like benzene also do not decolorize bromine water under standard test conditions.\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that Y2 is benzene (C6H6).\n*   **Mixture Y**: An equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n*   **Does Y decolorize bromine water?**: Cyclohexane is saturated and does not react. Benzene, due to its aromatic stability, also does not decolorize bromine water. So this condition is met.\n*   **Is Z (cyclohexane) a constituent of Y?**: Yes, it is one of the two components. This condition is met.\n*   **Does hydrogenation of Y give only Z?**:\n    *   Hydrogenation of cyclohexane gives cyclohexane.\n    *   Hydrogenation of benzene (C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12) gives cyclohexane.\n    *   Therefore, hydrogenation of the entire mixture Y yields only cyclohexane (Z). This condition is met.\n\nAll conditions are satisfied. Thus, **Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Mixture X and Find the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two unsaturated liquids (X1 and X2). When heated with platinum, X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form the equimolar mixture Y. This type of reaction, where an unsaturated cyclic compound converts to a saturated cycloalkane and an aromatic ring, is a known process (e.g., Zelinsky irreversible catalysis).\n\nThe reaction is a hydrogen transfer: one component of X is hydrogenated to cyclohexane, while the other is dehydrogenated to benzene. Since the starting mixture X and the product mixture Y are both equimolar, we can write the overall transformation as:\n\nX1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2\nX1 + X2 → Cyclohexane + Benzene\nC_aH_b + C_cH_d → C6H12 + C6H6\n\nFor the atoms to be conserved:\n*   **Carbon atoms**: The fact that both products are C6 compounds, and that hydrogenation of both X1 and X2 yields cyclohexane (a C6 compound), implies that both X1 and X2 must be C6 hydrocarbons. So, a = 6 and c = 6.\n*   **Hydrogen atoms**: The total number of hydrogen atoms must be conserved as no external hydrogen is added in this step.\n    Total H atoms in reactants = Total H atoms in products\n    b + d = 12 + 6\n    b + d = 18\n\nThe two liquids in mixture X are C6H_b and C6H_d, and the sum of their hydrogen atoms is 18. The problem asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is precisely this sum.\n\nFor completeness, plausible candidates for X1 and X2 could be cyclohexene (C6H10) and a non-conjugated cycloalkadiene like cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n*   10 + 8 = 18.\n*   Both are unsaturated and would decolorize bromine water.\n*   Cyclohexa-1,4-diene is non-conjugated.\n*   Both have a C6 ring structure that would hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n*   The reaction would be: C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H12 + C6H6. This is a balanced disproportionation (hydrogen transfer).\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nOf course, I can help you solve this chemistry puzzle. Here is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Thinking Steps\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:** The first step is to determine the chemical formula of substance Z.\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, meaning it only contains Carbon (C) and Hydrogen (H).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. This value is very close to 1/7 (~0.142857).\n    *   Let's test the general formulas for hydrocarbons, using approximate atomic masses (C≈12, H≈1).\n        *   For an acyclic alkane (CnH(2n+2)): Mass % H = (2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2). This doesn't simplify to 1/7 for any integer n.\n        *   For a cycloalkane (CnH2n): Mass % H = (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 2/14 = 1/7. This is a perfect match.\n    *   So, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of mixtures X and Y gives *only* Z. This implies all compounds involved have the same carbon skeleton. Since Z is a common solvent and a cycloalkane, it is almost certainly **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids and does not decolorize bromine water (meaning it's saturated or aromatic).\n    *   Substance Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is a component of Y.\n    *   Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X. Disproportionation is a redox reaction. In this catalytic context, it means some molecules are hydrogenated (reduced) and some are dehydrogenated (oxidized).\n    *   The fully dehydrogenated, stable C6 ring compound that doesn't react with bromine water is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mix of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   We can check this: Hydrogenating this mixture (benzene + cyclohexane) would convert the benzene to cyclohexane, resulting in only one substance: cyclohexane (Z). This fits the problem description.\n\n3.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X and Find the Answer:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that is converted to mixture Y. The overall reaction is a hydrogen transfer.\n    *   `Mixture X (X1 + X2) -> Mixture Y (Benzene + Cyclohexane)`\n    *   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms must be the same on both sides of the reaction. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which means the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2.\n    *   Total H atoms in Mixture Y = (H atoms in one molecule of benzene) + (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane)\n    *   Total H atoms = 6 + 12 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be 18.\n\n    (For completeness, the two liquids in mixture X must be C6 cycloalkenes that add up to C12H18. The logical candidates are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), as 10 + 8 = 18. Both have non-conjugated double bonds and would hydrogenate to cyclohexane).\n\nNow, I will provide the Python code to formalize the final calculation.\n\n```python\n# The solution is based on logical deduction from the problem's chemical principles.\n# The code below formalizes the final calculation step based on these deductions.\n\n# Step 1: Identify the components of mixture Y.\n# From the problem analysis, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and benzene.\n# We define the number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n\n# Component 1 of Y: Cyclohexane (C6H12).

We can write this as a fraction: 14.28% ≈ 14.2857% = 1/7.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `(mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1)`.\n*   Setting this equal to 1/7: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n*   Cross-multiply: `7y = 12x + y`\n*   Simplify: `6y = 12x`, which gives `y = 2x`.\n*   So, the general formula for Z is CnH2n.\n*   The problem states that Z is formed by the hydrogenation of other substances and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Z is described as being \"widely used as a solvent\". Common cycloalkane solvents that fit the CnH2n formula are cyclohexane (C6H12) and methylcyclohexane (C7H14). Let's check the H percentage for both:\n    *   For C6H12: %H = 12 / (6*12 + 12) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. This fits.\n    *   For C7H14: %H = 14 / (7*12 + 14) = 14 / 98 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. This also fits.\n*   We will proceed by testing the more common and prototypical example, cyclohexane, first. Let's assume **Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the components of Mixture Y**\n*   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from X.\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Let the two components of Y be Y1 and Y2. We can set **Y1 = Z = cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n*   The other component, Y2, must also give cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. Since Y2 doesn't decolorize bromine water, it cannot be an alkene or alkyne. A plausible candidate is the corresponding aromatic compound, **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not react with bromine water without a catalyst, and its hydrogenation under severe conditions yields cyclohexane.\n*   So, mixture **Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**. This fits all the given conditions for Y.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the components of Mixture X**\n*   X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them X1 and X2.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning its components are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n*   Hydrogenation of both components of X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both X1 and X2 have a C6 carbon skeleton.\n*   Heating X with platinum causes a disproportionation reaction that forms an equimolar mixture of Y (cyclohexane and benzene).\n*   The reaction can be written as: `1 X1 + 1 X2 → 1 C6H12 + 1 C6H6`.\n*   By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms on the reactant side must equal the total number on the product side.\n    *   Total C atoms: X1 and X2 must both be C6 compounds. C6 + C6 = C6 + C6. OK.\n    *   Total H atoms: The sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2 must equal the sum in the products. Total H = 12 (from cyclohexane) + 6 (from benzene) = 18.\n*   So, if X1 is C6Ha and X2 is C6Hb, then **a + b = 18**.\n*   Since X1 and X2 are unsaturated precursors to cyclohexane, their hydrogen counts (a and b) must be less than 12. The common unsaturated C6 ring compounds are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadienes (C6H8).\n*   The only pair of these that adds up to 18 is {10, 8}. Therefore, mixture X is composed of a **C6H10** isomer and a **C6H8** isomer.\n*   The problem states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the compounds of X.\n    *   For C6H10, cyclohexene has only one double bond, so no conjugation. This is a valid component.\n    *   For C6H8, we need a cyclohexadiene without conjugated double bonds. Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is conjugated, but **cyclohexa-1,4-diene** is not. This is a valid component.\n*   The disproportionation reaction is an intermolecular hydrogen transfer: the diene (C6H8) is dehydrogenated to benzene (C6H6), and the cyclohexene (C6H10) is hydrogenated to cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    `C6H8 + C6H10 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 + C6H12`\n    This reaction is chemically sound and matches all the problem's descriptions.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Answer**\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of the first component (C6H8) and one molecule of the second component (C6H10).\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\nThis confirms our result. The C7 pathway (Z=methylcyclohexane) would lead to X = {C7H12, C7H10}, giving a total H count of 22 (also an option). However, cyclohexane is arguably a more \"widely used\" solvent than methylcyclohexane, and the C6 system is a more classic example of this type of reaction, making it the most probable intended answer.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the structure of hydrocarbon Z.**\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let its formula be CxHy.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `Mass_H / (Mass_C + Mass_H)`. Using atomic masses C≈12 and H≈1, we get: `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`.\n*   Rearranging the equation: `y = 0.1428 * (12x + y)` -> `y = 1.7136x + 0.1428y` -> `0.8572y = 1.7136x` -> `y/x ≈ 2`.\n*   This indicates an empirical formula of CH2 and a general molecular formula of CnH2n. The given percentage (14.28%) is a very close approximation of 1/7, which corresponds exactly to the ratio of hydrogen mass to total mass in a CnH2n compound (since mass H = 2n, mass C = 12n, total mass = 14n, so H fraction = 2n/14n = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%).\n*   Compounds with the formula CnH2n are either alkenes (containing C=C double bonds) or cycloalkanes (saturated rings).\n*   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This means Z must be a saturated compound. Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane.\n*   Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent.\" Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common cycloalkane solvent. The central role of a disproportionation reaction (see next step) strongly suggests a six-membered ring system. Let's assume Z is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**2. Determine the composition of mixture Y.**\n*   Mixture Y is formed by a disproportionation reaction from X.\n*   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is Z, which we identified as cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   The entire mixture Y, when hydrogenated under severe conditions, gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Let the other component of Y be Y2. Hydrogenation of Y2 must also produce cyclohexane.\n*   Since Y2 does not decolorize bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane, it must be **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene is a liquid at room temperature, is famously unreactive towards bromine water (unlike alkenes), and is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under high pressure and temperature (severe conditions).\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**3. Determine the composition of mixture X.**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them X1 and X2. It undergoes disproportionation on a platinum catalyst to form Y.\n    `X1 + X2 --(Pt, heat)--> cyclohexane (C6H12) + benzene (C6H6)`\n*   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One molecule is reduced (gains hydrogen) and the other is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n*   The total number of atoms must be conserved. The products have a total of (6+6)=12 Carbon atoms and (12+6)=18 Hydrogen atoms. Thus, one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2 together must also contain C12H18.\n*   Hydrogenation of both X1 and X2 gives cyclohexane (Z). This means both X1 and X2 are C6 hydrocarbons with a six-membered ring structure. Let their formulas be C6Ha and C6Hb.\n*   From atom conservation, `a + b = 18`.\n*   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, which means at least one component (and likely both, given the context) must be unsaturated (i.e., contain C=C double bonds). They must be cycloalkenes or cycloalkadienes.\n*   Let's consider the possibilities:\n    *   Cyclohexene has the formula C6H10.\n    *   Cyclohexadiene has the formula C6H8.\n*   If we choose X1 as cyclohexene (C6H10) and X2 as cyclohexadiene (C6H8), the total hydrogen atoms are `10 + 8 = 18`. This combination fits our requirement.\n*   The problem also specifies that there are \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" in mixture X.\n    *   Cyclohexene (C6H10) has only one double bond, so there is no conjugation.\n    *   Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) has two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). The condition requires us to select **1,4-cyclohexadiene**.\n*   So, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n\n**4. Calculate the final answer.**\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This refers to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) = 8.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z:**\n    *   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   The general formula for a hydrocarbon is CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by (mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008).\n    *   Using approximate masses (H=1, C=12), this becomes y / (12x + y) = 0.1428. This simplifies to y ≈ 2x.\n    *   A hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n can be an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y gives *only* Z. This implies that all compounds in both mixtures share the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common cycloalkane solvent. Methylcyclohexane (C7H14) is also a possible solvent. The mass fraction of hydrogen for any CnH2n compound is indeed 1/7 or ~14.3%.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction and Mixtures:**\n    *   **Mixture X** contains two equimolar liquids. It decolorizes bromine water, indicating the presence of carbon-carbon double bonds (unsaturation). The molecules in X do not have conjugated double bonds.\n    *   **Mixture Y** contains two other equimolar liquids. It does *not* decolorize bromine water, indicating the compounds are saturated or aromatic. Hydrocarbon Z is one of the components of mixture Y.\n    *   The transformation from X to Y upon heating with platinum is described as a **disproportionation**. In organic chemistry, this can refer to a reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized (loses hydrogen) and reduced (gains hydrogen). Often, this occurs via a catalytic hydrogen transfer.\n    *   Given that mixture Y is equimolar, a 1:1 reaction stoichiometry is required. This suggests an intermolecular hydrogen transfer between the two components of mixture X.\n\n3.  **Deduce the Structures:**\n    *   Let's assume the simplest case where Z is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. This fits the description of a widely used solvent.\n    *   Since all compounds must have the C6 carbon skeleton, we look for unsaturated C6-ring compounds for mixture X.\n    *   Mixture Y must contain Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) and another compound that doesn't decolorize bromine water and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. The only candidate for this is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   So, **Mixture Y = {Benzene (C6H6), Cyclohexane (C6H12)}**. It is equimolar and both are liquids under appropriate conditions.\n    *   The reaction must be: Component A + Component B → Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   To balance the atoms, the reactants A and B must also have C6 rings. To balance the hydrogen atoms: H(A) + H(B) = 6 + 12 = 18.\n    *   The components of Mixture X must be unsaturated C6-ring compounds that can react via hydrogen transfer to give benzene and cyclohexane. The most logical candidates are **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and a non-conjugated cyclohexadiene like **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n    *   Let's verify this proposed reaction:\n        **C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C6H10 (cyclohexene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane)**\n        This reaction is balanced and represents a catalytic hydrogen transfer where the diene donates hydrogen and the alkene accepts it.\n    *   This hypothesis fits all conditions:\n        *   X is an equimolar mix of two liquids (C6H8, C6H10), both unsaturated and non-conjugated.\n        *   Y is an equimolar mix of two liquids (C6H6, C6H12), which don't decolorize bromine water.\n        *   Z (cyclohexane) is a component of Y.\n        *   Hydrogenation of X (C6H8 and C6H10) and Y (C6H6 and C6H12) yields only Z (C6H12).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X are 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) and cyclohexene (C6H10).\n    *   Total Hydrogen Atoms = (H atoms in C6H8) + (H atoms in C6H10) = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\nThis matches option C. While a similar scenario with methylcyclohexane (C7) would lead to 22 hydrogen atoms (Option B), the cyclohexane (C6) case is the most fundamental and common example for this type of chemical problem.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let's determine its empirical formula.\n    *   Mass % of Hydrogen (H) = 14.28%\n    *   Mass % of Carbon (C) = 100% - 14.28% = 85.72%\n*   To find the ratio of atoms, we divide the percentages by the atomic masses (C≈12, H≈1):\n    *   Ratio C = 85.72 / 12 ≈ 7.14\n    *   Ratio H = 14.28 / 1 ≈ 14.28\n*   The simplest whole number ratio of H to C is 14.28 / 7.14 ≈ 2. So, the empirical formula is CH₂.\n*   The problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen). A hydrocarbon with the general formula (CH₂)n must be a cycloalkane (CnH2n), as alkanes have the formula CnH2n+2.\n*   Z is also described as being \"widely used as a solvent\". Searching for common cycloalkane solvents points towards cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) as a very common choice. Cyclohexane fits the formula CnH2n (for n=6) and is a widely used industrial solvent.\n*   Therefore, substance Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**2. Analysis of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of them is Z, which is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components are saturated or aromatic. Simple bromination of benzene, an aromatic compound, requires a catalyst and does not occur with just bromine water.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only cyclohexane (Z). This means the other component of Y must also convert to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   Let the components of Y be Z (cyclohexane) and another liquid, let's call it C. The hydrogenation of benzene (C₆H₆) yields cyclohexane. Benzene is a liquid at room temperature and does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   This makes Y an equimolar mixture of **benzene (C₆H₆)** and **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Reaction and Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is converted to mixture Y by heating with platinum. This process is described as a disproportionation. In this context, it is a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n*   Let the two components of the equimolar mixture X be A and B. The reaction is:\n    A + B → benzene (C₆H₆) + cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)\n*   In this reaction, one component of X is oxidized to benzene, and the other is reduced to cyclohexane.\n*   Since hydrogenation of both components of X gives cyclohexane, both A and B must be C₆ cyclic compounds.\n*   Let A be the compound that is oxidized to benzene, and B be the compound that is reduced to cyclohexane. The overall reaction shows that hydrogen atoms are transferred from A to B.\n    *   `A → C₆H₆ + 2H` (Oxidation)\n    *   `B + 2H → C₆H₁₂` (Reduction)\n*   From this, we can deduce the molecular formulas of A and B.\n    *   B must have two fewer hydrogen atoms than cyclohexane: C₆H₁₀. This is **cyclohexene**.\n    *   A must have two more hydrogen atoms than benzene: C₆H₈. This is a **cyclohexadiene**.\n*   So, Mixture X consists of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and a cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   Both cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water, which matches the description of mixture X.\n    *   The problem also specifies that there are no conjugated multiple bonds. Cyclohexene has only one double bond, so there is no conjugation. For cyclohexadiene, there are two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and **1,4-cyclohexadiene** (non-conjugated). Therefore, the diene in mixture X must be 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of:\n    1.  **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**\n    2.  **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (i.e., in one molecule of each component).\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = (H atoms in cyclohexene) + (H atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene)\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:** The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. The general formula for a hydrocarbon is CₙHₘ.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as `(m * 1.008) / (n * 12.011 + m * 1.008) = 0.1428`.\n    *   This simplifies to a molar ratio of `m/n ≈ 2`. The formula for Z is therefore of the type (CH₂)ₙ or CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   Substance Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a fully saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem also states Z is a constituent of mixture Y and is a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Its hydrogen mass fraction is `(12 * 1.008) / (6 * 12.011 + 12 * 1.008) = 12.096 / 84.162 = 0.1437`, which is approximately 14.3%, matching the given value. Thus, **Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n2.  **Characterize Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This implies the components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   One component of Y is Z, which is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Cyclohexane is saturated and does not react with bromine water.\n    *   Hydrogenation of both components of Y yields only cyclohexane. Therefore, the other component of Y must also have a six-carbon ring structure.\n    *   Since this second component does not decolorize bromine water but is not saturated (as it hydrogenates), it must be aromatic. The only aromatic C₆ hydrocarbon is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water without a catalyst and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n    *   Therefore, **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n3.  **Characterize Mixture X:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, indicating the presence of unsaturation (carbon-carbon double bonds).\n    *   Upon heating with platinum, mixture X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form the equimolar mixture Y ({cyclohexane, benzene}). Disproportionation here refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction where one component is reduced and the other is oxidized.\n    *   Hydrogenation of both components of X gives only cyclohexane, meaning both have a C₆ ring carbon skeleton.\n    *   The total number of atoms is conserved in the reaction from X to Y. Let the components of X be A and B. The reaction is:\n        `A + B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n    *   Since the number of atoms is conserved, the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane and one molecule of benzene.\n        Total H atoms = H atoms in (C₆H₁₂) + H atoms in (C₆H₆)\n        Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n4.  **Confirm the Plausibility:**\n    *   The components of X must be unsaturated cyclohexane derivatives. We need two molecules whose total hydrogen count is 18.\n    *   A logical combination is cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and a cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). The total hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds. Cyclohexene fits this. For cyclohexadiene, there are two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). Therefore, the diene must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   The reaction would be an intermolecular hydrogen transfer:\n        `Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) + 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) --(Pt, heat)--> Benzene (C₆H₆) + Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)`\n    *   In this reaction, cyclohexene is oxidized to benzene, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is reduced to cyclohexane. This is a chemically plausible reaction, often described as a type of Zelinsky catalysis or catalytic hydrogen transfer.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. As determined by the conservation of atoms in the disproportionation reaction, this is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is my reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CnHm. The molar masses are approximately Ar(C) = 12 g/mol and Ar(H) = 1 g/mol.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is w(H) = (m * 1) / (n * 12 + m * 1).\n    *   We are given w(H) = 0.1428. This value is very close to 1/7 (1/7 ≈ 0.142857).\n    *   So, m / (12n + m) = 1/7\n    *   7m = 12n + m\n    *   6m = 12n\n    *   m = 2n\n    *   The formula for Z is CnH2n.\n    *   We are told Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cyclic alkane solvent is cyclohexane, C6H12. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane. For C6H12, n=6, m=12, which satisfies m=2n. This is a very strong candidate.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them C and D.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This implies that C and D are either saturated compounds or aromatic compounds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   Substance Z (cyclohexane) is itself a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say D = Z = cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   Since hydrogenation of the entire mixture Y yields only cyclohexane, the other component, C, must also hydrogenate to form cyclohexane.\n    *   So, C is a compound with a C6 ring skeleton that, upon hydrogenation, becomes cyclohexane.\n    *   C does not decolorize bromine water. The only common compound that fits this description is an aromatic compound. The C6 aromatic compound is benzene (C6H6). Benzene does not react with bromine water under normal conditions but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions (high temperature/pressure with a catalyst like Pt), which is consistent with the problem statement.\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **benzene (C6H6)** and **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction**\n    *   X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and/or B contain carbon-carbon double or triple bonds (they are unsaturated).\n    *   The molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   When X is heated with platinum, it forms Y. This is described as a disproportionation reaction.\n    *   Reaction: Mixture X (A + B) --(Pt, heat)--> Mixture Y (Benzene + Cyclohexane).\n    *   Since X and Y are both equimolar mixtures, the reaction stoichiometry must be:\n        1 A + 1 B → 1 Benzene + 1 Cyclohexane\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of mixture X also gives only substance Z (cyclohexane). This confirms that both A and B must have a C6 ring carbon skeleton, just like benzene and cyclohexane.\n    *   Let the formula of A be C6Ha and the formula of B be C6Hb.\n    *   We can now apply the principle of conservation of atoms to the reaction. Specifically, let's balance the hydrogen atoms:\n        Total H in reactants = Total H in products\n        H atoms in A + H atoms in B = H atoms in Benzene + H atoms in Cyclohexane\n        a + b = 6 + 12\n        a + b = 18\n\n4.  **Answer the Question**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This corresponds to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of liquid A and one molecule of liquid B, which is `a + b`.\n    *   From our calculation, a + b = 18.\n\n5.  **Final Consistency Check**\n    *   Can we find plausible compounds for A and B? We need two non-conjugated, unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons such that the sum of their hydrogens is 18.\n    *   A good pair would be **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n    *   Sum of hydrogens = 10 + 8 = 18. Correct.\n    *   Both are liquids and have C6 rings.\n    *   Cyclohexene has one C=C bond. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has two C=C bonds separated by two CH2 groups, so they are not conjugated. Both will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Hydrogenation of cyclohexene gives cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of 1,4-cyclohexadiene gives cyclohexane.\n    *   The reaction C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H6 + C6H12 is a known type of hydrogen transfer (disproportionation) reaction over a platinum catalyst.\n    *   All conditions of the problem are met with this model.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two liquids in mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. Let its formula be CnHm.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `mass fraction H = (m * Ar(H)) / (n * Ar(C) + m * Ar(H))`. Using atomic masses Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\n    *   `0.1428 = m / (12n + m)`\n    *   The value 14.28% is very close to 1/7. Let's test this: `1/7 ≈ 0.142857`.\n    *   So, `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`. This gives `7m = 12n + m`, which simplifies to `6m = 12n`, or `m = 2n`.\n    *   The general formula for Z is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen and is formed by hydrogenation. This means Z is a fully saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent\". Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄), both of which fit the CnH2n formula.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z is a constituent of Y. Let's assume C = Z. So, C is a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y (C + D) under severe conditions gives only Z.\n    *   Hydrogenation of C (which is Z) gives Z.\n    *   Hydrogenation of D must also give Z.\n    *   Since D is part of a mixture that doesn't decolorize bromine water, it's not a simple alkene/alkyne. The most plausible structure for D is an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton as Z. An aromatic ring only reacts with H₂ under severe conditions, which fits the problem description.\n    *   Therefore, Y is a mixture of a cycloalkane (Z = CnH2n) and an aromatic hydrocarbon (D). The simplest aromatic series (benzene and its alkyl derivatives) has the formula CnH2n-6. Hydrogenation of D (CnH2n-6) adds 3 H₂ molecules to form the cycloalkane Z (CnH2n). This is consistent.\n    *   So, Mixture Y = {CnH2n, CnH2n-6}.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and/or B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in A or B.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X (A + B) gives only Z (CnH2n). This implies A and B have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   Mixture X is converted to Mixture Y by heating with platinum in a disproportionation reaction. This is characteristic of hydrogen transfer reactions catalyzed by platinum. The most plausible reaction is an intermolecular hydrogen transfer: A + B → C + D.\n    *   Since the reactant and product mixtures are equimolar, the stoichiometry is 1:1 → 1:1.\n        `A + B → C + D`\n        `A + B → (CnH2n) + (CnH2n-6)`\n    *   By conservation of atoms, the total number of H atoms in one molecule of A and one of B must be the same as in one molecule of C and one of D.\n        `H_atoms(A) + H_atoms(B) = (2n) + (2n - 6) = 4n - 6`.\n    *   Since A and B are unsaturated precursors to the cycloalkane Z, they are likely a cycloalkene and a cycloalkadiene.\n        *   Cycloalkene (one double bond): CnH2n-2. Let's assign this to A.\n        *   Cycloalkadiene (two double bonds): CnH2n-4. Let's assign this to B.\n    *   Let's check the hydrogen balance with this assignment:\n        `H_atoms(A) + H_atoms(B) = (2n - 2) + (2n - 4) = 4n - 6`.\n    *   This matches the hydrogen atoms on the product side. The reaction is:\n        `CnH2n-2 (A) + CnH2n-4 (B) → CnH2n (C) + CnH2n-6 (D)`\n        This represents the cycloalkene being hydrogenated to a cycloalkane, and the cycloalkadiene being dehydrogenated to an aromatic compound. This is a chemically sound model.\n\n4.  **Determine the Value of 'n' and the Final Answer**\n    *   We need to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of A and one molecule of B. This is `4n - 6`.\n    *   The problem leaves 'n' ambiguous. Let's test the two most likely scenarios based on common solvents:\n        *   **Case n=6**: Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). This is a very common solvent.\n            *   Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), Benzene (C₆H₆)}.\n            *   Mixture X = {Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀), 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)}. Note: 1,4-cyclohexadiene is chosen because it is not conjugated, as required.\n            *   Total H atoms in X = 10 + 8 = 18. This corresponds to the formula `4n - 6 = 4(6) - 6 = 24 - 6 = 18`. This is option D.\n        *   **Case n=7**: Z is methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄). Also a known solvent.\n            *   Mixture Y = {Methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄), Toluene (C₇H₈)}.\n            *   Mixture X = {A methylcyclohexene (C₇H₁₂), a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (C₇H₁₀)}.\n            *   Total H atoms in X = 12 + 10 = 22. This corresponds to the formula `4n - 6 = 4(7) - 6 = 28 - 6 = 22`. This is option B.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    *   Both the n=6 and n=7 scenarios are chemically consistent with all the facts given in the problem.\n    *   However, problems of this nature often refer to the most fundamental or textbook example of a reaction. The disproportionation involving the C₆ ring system (cyclohexene, cyclohexane, benzene) is the canonical example of Zelinsky catalysis.\n    *   Therefore, it is most probable that the question is based on the C₆ system.\n    *   Assuming n=6, the two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in these two liquids is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nFinal calculation using the derived formula:\nFor n=6, Total H = 4(6) - 6 = 18.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z:**\n    *   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let's determine its molecular formula.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen can be expressed as `mass_H / (mass_C + mass_H)`. Using atomic masses (C≈12, H≈1), for a formula CxHy, this is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   The value 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. So, we have the equation: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`.\n    *   Cross-multiplying gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   This means the empirical formula for Z is CH2, and its general molecular formula is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This indicates that Z is a saturated compound (contains no C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   We are also told that Z is a \"widely used as a solvent.\" A very common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane. Let's check if cyclohexane (C6H12) fits.\n    *   For cyclohexane (C6H12), the formula fits CnH2n (with n=6), it's saturated, and it's a common solvent. Its hydrogen mass fraction is `12 / (6*12 + 12) = 12/84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%`. This confirms our identification.\n    *   Therefore, **Substance Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of these liquids is Z (cyclohexane), as it is a \"constituent of mixture Y.\" Let the other liquid be D.\n    *   Mixture Y \"does not decolorize bromine water.\" Since cyclohexane is saturated, it does not react. This means liquid D must also not react with bromine water under these conditions.\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n        *   Hydrogenating cyclohexane (Z) gives cyclohexane.\n        *   Therefore, hydrogenating liquid D must also give cyclohexane. This implies that D has a six-carbon ring skeleton but is unsaturated.\n    *   An unsaturated compound with a C6 ring that does not decolorize bromine water is characteristic of an aromatic compound. The only C6 aromatic hydrocarbon is benzene (C6H6). Benzene can be hydrogenated under severe conditions (as mentioned in the problem) to form cyclohexane.\n    *   Therefore, **liquid D is benzene (C6H6)**, and **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   Mixture X \"decolorizes bromine water,\" so at least one of its components is an alkene or alkyne. Since hydrogenation of X yields only cyclohexane, both A and B must be C6 cyclic hydrocarbons.\n    *   The reaction that converts mixture X to mixture Y is a disproportionation reaction catalyzed by platinum. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one component is hydrogenated (reduced) and the other is dehydrogenated (oxidized).\n    *   The overall reaction can be written as:\n        `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Z + D`\n    *   Substituting the identified compounds:\n        `A + B --> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\" This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B.\n    *   Using the principle of conservation of atoms for the balanced chemical reaction:\n        `C6Ha + C6Hb --> C6H12 + C6H6`\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms on the reactant side must equal the total number on the product side.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in Cyclohexane) + (H atoms in Benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6\n    *   Total H atoms = 18\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\n**Detailed reasoning and thinking process:**\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z:**\n    *   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   The mass of hydrogen is ~1 g/mol and the mass of carbon is ~12 g/mol. Let the formula of Z be CnHm.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `m / (12n + m)`.\n    *   Setting this equal to 14.28%, or approximately 1/7:\n        `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`\n        `7m = 12n + m`\n        `6m = 12n`\n        `m = 2n`\n    *   So, the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and its molecular formula is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem also states that Z is formed by hydrogenation of other compounds and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is described as a widely used solvent. The most common liquid cycloalkane solvent that fits this description is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y and its Formation:**\n    *   Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X on a heated platinum catalyst. This type of reaction, especially with cyclic compounds over platinum, often involves hydrogen transfer, leading to both more saturated and less saturated (often aromatic) products.\n    *   Mixture Y consists of two equimolar liquids and does not decolorize bromine water. This implies the components are either saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   One of the components of mixture Y *is* substance Z (cyclohexane, C6H12). Let's call this Y1.\n    *   Let the other component be Y2. Since hydrogenating the entire mixture Y gives only cyclohexane, Y2 must also have a C6 carbon skeleton and hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n    *   Since Y2 is part of a mixture that doesn't decolorize bromine water and is formed by dehydrogenation (part of the disproportionation), the most logical candidate for Y2 is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene has a C6 skeleton, is a liquid, does not decolorize bromine water, and can be hydrogenated under severe conditions (as mentioned in the problem) to form cyclohexane.\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and Determine the Total Hydrogen Atoms:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them X1 and X2.\n    *   The reaction is a disproportionation: `X1 + X2 --(Pt, heat)--> Y1 (cyclohexane) + Y2 (benzene)`\n    *   According to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2) must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products (one molecule of Y1 and one molecule of Y2).\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Thus, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is **18**.\n\n4.  **Verification (Checking the properties of Mixture X):**\n    *   We need to find two C6 compounds, X1 and X2, that fit the description.\n    *   They must decolorize bromine water (be unsaturated).\n    *   They must not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of both must yield cyclohexane.\n    *   The sum of their hydrogen atoms must be 18.\n    *   A plausible pair is **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n        *   Cyclohexene has one double bond and 10 H atoms.\n        *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene has two isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds and 8 H atoms.\n        *   Both are C6 cyclic compounds, will decolorize bromine water, and will hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n        *   The sum of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n        *   The disproportionation reaction `C6H10 + C6H8 -> C6H12 + C6H6` is a balanced hydrogen transfer. The diene is dehydrogenated to benzene, and the ene is hydrogenated to the alkane. This confirms our reasoning is chemically sound.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Our calculation, based on the identified products of the disproportionation, shows this sum is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**: The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n. For any such cycloalkane, the mass percentage of hydrogen is (2n / (12n + 2n)) * 100 = (2n / 14n) * 100 = (1/7) * 100 ≈ 14.28%. The problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent and is formed by the hydrogenation of all other compounds, suggesting a stable structure. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclohexane (C6H12) and cyclopentane (C5H10). Both are used as solvents.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction**: An equimolar mixture X of two unsaturated liquids is heated with platinum, causing a disproportionation reaction to form an equimolar mixture Y of two saturated liquids. A disproportionation reaction is one where a substance is simultaneously oxidized (loses hydrogen) and reduced (gains hydrogen).\n\n3.  **Formulate a Hypothesis**: Let's assume the reaction is of the type:\n    2 * (Reactant) → (Reduced Product) + (Oxidized Product)\n    Since mixture X contains two equimolar liquids (X1 and X2), the reaction is likely X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2. As X1 and X2 are isomers that both hydrogenate to Z, it's reasonable to assume they have the same molecular formula. Let this be CnHx.\n    Mixture Y contains Z (Y1 = CnH2n) and another saturated compound (Y2).\n    So, the overall reaction becomes: 2 * CnHx → CnH2n + CnH(2x-2n).\n\n4.  **Test the Hypothesis with Cyclohexane (n=6)**:\n    *   If Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), then the reaction is 2 * C6Hx → C6H12 + C6H(2x-12).\n    *   Y2, which is C6H(2x-12), must be a saturated hydrocarbon. Saturated C6 hydrocarbons include bicyclic alkanes (C6H10) and tricyclic alkanes (C6H8).\n    *   If Y2 = C6H10 (bicyclic), then 2x-12 = 10, which means x = 11. A C6H11 compound is a radical, which is unlikely for a stable liquid.\n    *   If Y2 = C6H8 (tricyclic), then 2x-12 = 8, which means x = 10. The reactants in mixture X would be isomers of C6H10.\n    *   This leads to a total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X as 10 + 10 = 20. This answer is not among the options (A, B, C, D).\n\n5.  **Test the Hypothesis with Cyclopentane (n=5)**:\n    *   If Z is cyclopentane (C5H10), then the reaction is 2 * C5Hx → C5H10 + C5H(2x-10).\n    *   Y2, which is C5H(2x-10), must be a saturated hydrocarbon. Saturated C5 hydrocarbons can be bicyclic (C5H8) or tricyclic (C5H6).\n    *   If Y2 = C5H8 (bicyclic), then 2x-10 = 8, which means x = 9. A C5H9 compound is a radical, which is unlikely.\n    *   If Y2 = C5H6 (tricyclic), then 2x-10 = 6, which means x = 8. The reactants in mixture X would be isomers of C5H8.\n    *   This scenario is plausible. The components of mixture X (X1 and X2) would both have the formula C5H8. Examples of non-conjugated C5H8 isomers include cyclopentene, 1,4-pentadiene, and methylenecyclobutane.\n\n6.  **Verify the C5 Hypothesis**:\n    *   **Mixture X**: An equimolar mixture of two C5H8 isomers (e.g., cyclopentene and vinylcyclopropane). It is unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   **Reaction**: The disproportionation reaction is C5H8 + C5H8 → C5H10 + C5H6.\n    *   **Mixture Y**: An equimolar mixture of cyclopentane (C5H10, which is Z) and a saturated tricyclic alkane (C5H6). This mixture is saturated and will not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   **Hydrogenation**: Hydrogenation of X (C5H8) gives cyclopentane (C5H10), which is Z. Hydrogenation of Y (C5H10 and C5H6) also gives only cyclopentane (Z) under severe conditions, which involves the ring-opening of the C5H6 component.\n    *   All conditions of the problem are met with this hypothesis.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Answer**: The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   Liquid 1 (X1) has the formula C5H8, so it has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid 2 (X2) has the formula C5H8, so it has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 8 + 8 = 16.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**Step 1: Identify substance Z**\n\nThe problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n*   The general formula for an alkane is CnH2n+2. The mass fraction of hydrogen is (2n+2)/(14n+2). As n increases, this value approaches 2/14 = 1/7 ≈ 14.3%.\n*   The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n. The mass fraction of hydrogen is 2n/14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857.\nThis value is an excellent match for 14.28%. Thus, Z is a cycloalkane.\n\nThe problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common cycloalkane solvent. Additionally, the problem mentions that substance Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. This confirms that Z is a cycloalkane. Based on its common use as a solvent, we can confidently identify **Z as cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify mixture Y**\n\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D, and it does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates that C and D are saturated or aromatic compounds. It is a known chemical fact that benzene does not readily react with bromine water in the absence of a catalyst, unlike unsaturated alkenes.\n\nHydrogenation of mixture Y yields only substance Z (cyclohexane). This means:\n*   Hydrogenation of C → Cyclohexane (Z)\n*   Hydrogenation of D → Cyclohexane (Z)\n\nWe also know that Z is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's assume C is Z.\n*   **C = Cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Cyclohexane is already saturated, so its \"hydrogenation\" product is itself.\n\nNow, what is D? D must be a compound that, upon hydrogenation, yields cyclohexane. A prime candidate is **benzene (C6H6)**. The hydrogenation of benzene produces cyclohexane, although it requires severe conditions.\n\nSo, let's propose that **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**.\nThis fits all the criteria for Y:\n*   It's an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n*   It does not decolorize bromine water (cyclohexane is saturated; benzene is unreactive under these conditions).\n*   Hydrogenation of the mixture (cyclohexane and benzene) produces only cyclohexane.\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a component of Y.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the conversion of X to Y and identify mixture X**\n\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B, which undergoes disproportionation when heated with platinum to form mixture Y.\nThe reaction is:\nA + B --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)\n\nThis type of reaction, where cycloalkenes or cycloalkadienes are converted to a cycloalkane and an aromatic compound over a platinum catalyst, is a well-known process called Zelinsky irreversible catalysis.\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the reactants (one molecule of A + one molecule of B) must equal the total number in the products (one molecule of cyclohexane + one molecule of benzene).\n*   Total C atoms in products = 6 (from C6H12) + 6 (from C6H6) = 12\n*   Total H atoms in products = 12 (from C6H12) + 6 (from C6H6) = 18\n\nTherefore, the combined molecular formula of A and B is C12H18.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This corresponds to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of liquid A and one molecule of liquid B, which is 18.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the properties of mixture X**\n\nLet's check if we can find plausible structures for A and B that fit the remaining criteria.\n*   **Equimolar mixture:** Let A and B be C6Ha and C6Hb.\n*   **Total hydrogens:** a + b = 18.\n*   **Decolorize bromine water:** A and B must be unsaturated (contain double or triple bonds).\n*   **Hydrogenate to cyclohexane:** A and B must have a six-membered carbon ring skeleton.\n*   **No conjugated multiple bonds:** This rules out compounds like cyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n\nA suitable pair for A and B would be **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**.\n*   **Hydrogen sum:** 10 + 8 = 18.\n*   **Unsaturated:** Both have double bonds and will decolorize bromine water.\n*   **Hydrogenation:** Both will hydrogenate to form cyclohexane.\n*   **Non-conjugated:** Cyclohexene has one double bond. Cyclohexa-1,4-diene has two double bonds separated by two single bonds, so they are not conjugated.\n\nThe disproportionation reaction would be:\nC6H10 (Cyclohexene) + C6H8 (Cyclohexa-1,4-diene) → C6H12 (Cyclohexane) + C6H6 (Benzene)\n\nThis scenario is chemically sound and consistent with all the information given in the problem. The core of the solution lies in the stoichiometric balance of the disproportionation reaction.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of A and one of B) is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
