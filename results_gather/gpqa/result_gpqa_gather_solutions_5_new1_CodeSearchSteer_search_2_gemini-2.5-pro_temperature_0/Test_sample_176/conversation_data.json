Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:\n\nA) ~2.23\nB) ~2.35\nC) ~2.25\nD) ~2.32\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n1.  **Luminosity Formula:** The luminosity (L) of a star that radiates as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L = \\sigma A T^4$\n    where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, A is the surface area of the star, and T is its surface temperature. For a spherical star, the area is $A = 4\\pi R^2$, so the formula becomes:\n    $L = 4\\pi \\sigma R^2 T^4$\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio:** We want to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to that of Star_2 ($L_1/L_2$):\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (4\\pi \\sigma R_1^2 T_1^4) / (4\\pi \\sigma R_2^2 T_2^4)$\n    The constants cancel out, leaving:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 ($R_1 = 1.5 R_2$). Therefore:\n    $(R_1/R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio:** The temperature of a black body is related to the peak wavelength of its emitted radiation ($\\lambda_{emitted}$) by Wien's Displacement Law:\n    $T = b / \\lambda_{emitted}$\n    where b is Wien's constant. This means $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{emitted}$.\n\n    The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{obs}$) are the same for both stars. The observed wavelength is affected by the Doppler effect due to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$). The relationship is given by:\n    $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emitted} (1 + v_r/c)$\n    where c is the speed of light.\n\n    *   For Star_1: $v_{r,1} = 0$, so its observed wavelength is equal to its emitted wavelength: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{emitted,1}$.\n    *   For Star_2: $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s, so its light is redshifted. Its observed wavelength is: $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{emitted,2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n\n    Since we are given $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we can write:\n    $\\lambda_{emitted,1} = \\lambda_{emitted,2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n\n    Now we can find the ratio of the temperatures:\n    $T_1/T_2 = (\\lambda_{emitted,2}) / (\\lambda_{emitted,1})$\n    Substituting the expression for $\\lambda_{emitted,1}$:\n    $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{emitted,2} / [\\lambda_{emitted,2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)] = 1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Now we substitute the radius and temperature ratios into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (2.25) \\times [1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)]^4 = 2.25 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)^4$\n\n    Let's plug in the values:\n    *   $v_{r,2} = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 7 \\times 10^5 \\text{ m/s}$\n    *   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$\n    *   $v_{r,2}/c = (7 \\times 10^5) / (3 \\times 10^8) \\approx 0.002333$\n\n    Now, calculate the final ratio:\n    $L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)^4$\n    $L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.25 / (1.002333)^4$\n    $L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.25 / 1.00936$\n    $L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.229$\n\n    This value is closest to 2.23. The information about the mass of the stars is extraneous and not needed for the calculation.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to determine the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars.\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio**: We can set up a ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 (L₁) and Star_2 (L₂):\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    This simplifies to:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). Therefore, the ratio of their radii squared is:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio**: To find the temperature ratio (T₁/T₂), we use Wien's Displacement Law and account for the Doppler effect.\n    *   **Wien's Law**: This law relates a star's temperature to the peak wavelength (λ_rest) of its emitted light in its own rest frame: λ_rest = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's constant. This means T = b/λ_rest.\n    *   **Doppler Effect**: The observed wavelength (λ_obs) is shifted due to the star's radial velocity (v). For non-relativistic speeds, the formula is λ_obs ≈ λ_rest(1 + v/c), where 'c' is the speed of light. A positive velocity indicates the star is moving away (redshift).\n\n5.  **Applying the Information**:\n    *   The problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same for both stars: λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0 km/s, so its observed wavelength is the same as its rest wavelength: λ_obs,₁ = λ_rest,₁.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. Its observed wavelength is redshifted: λ_obs,₂ = λ_rest,₂(1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂, we have: λ_rest,₁ = λ_rest,₂(1 + v₂/c).\n\n6.  **Connecting to Temperature**: Now we substitute Wien's Law (λ_rest = b/T) into the equation from the previous step:\n    b/T₁ = (b/T₂)(1 + v₂/c)\n    By simplifying, we can find the ratio of the temperatures:\n    1/T₁ = (1/T₂)(1 + v₂/c)\n    T₂/T₁ = 1 + v₂/c\n    T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n7.  **Calculation**: Now, we plug in the values for the velocity of Star_2 (v₂ = 700 km/s) and the speed of light (c ≈ 300,000 km/s):\n    *   v₂/c = 700 km/s / 300,000 km/s ≈ 0.002333\n    *   T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + 0.002333) ≈ 0.99767\n    *   (T₁/T₂)⁴ ≈ (0.99767)⁴ ≈ 0.9907\n\n8.  **Final Luminosity Ratio Calculation**: Finally, we substitute the ratios for the radii and temperatures back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * 0.9907\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23. The information about the stars' masses is not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to find the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, `L1 / L2`.\n\n2.  **Recall the Governing Laws:**\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star is proportional to the square of its radius (R) and the fourth power of its surface temperature (T). The formula is `L = 4 * π * R² * σ * T⁴`. For a ratio, this simplifies to `L1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)² * (T1 / T2)⁴`.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The surface temperature (T) of a star is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation (`λ_emitted`). So, `T ∝ 1 / λ_emitted`. This means `T1 / T2 = λ_emitted_2 / λ_emitted_1`.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength (`λ_observed`) is different from the *emitted* wavelength (`λ_emitted`) if the star is moving. The formula for redshift (moving away) is `λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c)`, where `v` is the radial velocity and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n3.  **Connect the Information:**\n    *   We are given the radius ratio: `R1 / R2 = 1.5`.\n    *   We are told the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: `λ_observed_1 = λ_observed_2`.\n    *   Star 1 has zero velocity (`v1 = 0`), so its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted wavelength: `λ_observed_1 = λ_emitted_1`.\n    *   Star 2 is moving away (`v2 = 700 km/s`), so its observed wavelength is redshifted: `λ_observed_2 = λ_emitted_2 * (1 + v2/c)`.\n    *   By combining these, we find the relationship between the emitted wavelengths: `λ_emitted_1 = λ_emitted_2 * (1 + v2/c)`.\n    *   Now, we can find the temperature ratio: `T1 / T2 = λ_emitted_2 / λ_emitted_1 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:**\n    *   Substitute the radius and temperature ratios into the luminosity ratio formula: `L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * (1 / (1 + v2/c))⁴`.\n    *   I will perform this calculation using Python to get a precise result and compare it to the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given values and constants.\n# The ratio of the radii of Star_1 to Star_2.\nradius_ratio = 1.5\n# The radial velocity of Star_2 in km/s.

The key physical laws are:\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law relates a star's luminosity (L) to its radius (R) and surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a star's surface temperature (T) to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (its peak wavelength, λ_max). This law applies to the radiation as it is emitted by the star (in its rest frame). The formula is:\n    λ_max_rest * T = b\n    where 'b' is Wien's displacement constant.\n3.  **Doppler Effect for Light:** This effect describes the change in the observed wavelength of light due to the relative motion between the source and the observer. For a source moving with a radial velocity 'v' (positive if moving away, negative if moving towards), the observed wavelength (λ_obs) is related to the rest-frame emitted wavelength (λ_rest) by:\n    λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c)\n    (This is the non-relativistic approximation, which is valid here since 700 km/s is much less than the speed of light, c).\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the luminosity ratio**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) to that of Star_2 (L₂).\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\nL₁ = 4πR₁²σT₁⁴\nL₂ = 4πR₂²σT₂⁴\n\nThe ratio is:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\nThe constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, leaving:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n**Step 3: Determine the radius ratio (R₁/R₂)**\n\nThe problem explicitly states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2.\nR₁ = 1.5 * R₂\nTherefore, the radius ratio is:\nR₁ / R₂ = 1.5\n\n**Step 4: Determine the temperature ratio (T₁/T₂)**\n\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. We need to relate the temperatures using the information about their peak wavelengths and velocities.\n*   The problem states that \"the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest... are the same.\" This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs). So, λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.\n*   We use the Doppler formula to relate the observed wavelength to the rest-frame wavelength for each star.\n    *   For Star_1: v₁ = 0 km/s. So, λ_obs1 = λ_rest1 * (1 + 0/c) = λ_rest1.\n    *   For Star_2: v₂ = 700 km/s. So, λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n*   Since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, we can set the two expressions equal:\n    λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v₂/c)\n*   Now, we use Wien's Law, which connects temperature to the *rest-frame* wavelength:\n    T₁ = b / λ_rest1\n    T₂ = b / λ_rest2\n*   The ratio of the temperatures is therefore:\n    T₁ / T₂ = (b / λ_rest1) / (b / λ_rest2) = λ_rest2 / λ_rest1\n*   Substitute the relationship we found from the Doppler effect:\n    T₁ / T₂ = λ_rest2 / [λ_rest2 * (1 + v₂/c)] = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The mass information (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is extraneous and not needed for this calculation, which is based on black body radiation principles.\n*   It is crucial to distinguish between the *observed* peak wavelength and the *rest-frame* peak wavelength. Wien's Law applies to the rest-frame wavelength, while the observation is of the Doppler-shifted wavelength. The radial velocity information is essential to connect the two.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final luminosity ratio**\n\nNow we substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into our luminosity ratio formula:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n\nLet's plug in the values:\n*   (1.5)² = 2.25\n*   v₂ = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s\n*   c (speed of light) ≈ 299,792,458 m/s\n\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 700,000 / 299,792,458)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 0.00233495)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / 1.00233495]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (0.9976706)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * 0.99072\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.22912\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.

The formula for luminosity is L = 4πR²σT⁴. The ratio is therefore L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴.\n\n2.  **Radius Ratio:** We are given R₁ = 1.5 * R₂, so (R₁/R₂)² = 1.5² = 2.25.\n\n3.  **Temperature Ratio:**\n    *   Wien's Displacement Law states that a star's temperature is inversely proportional to its rest-frame peak emission wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_rest). Therefore, T₁/T₂ = λ_rest₂ / λ_rest₁.\n    *   The observed peak wavelengths are affected by the Doppler shift. The formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c).\n    *   For Star 1 (v₁ = 0), λ_obs₁ = λ_rest₁.\n    *   For Star 2 (v₂ = 700 km/s), λ_obs₂ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   We are given that the observed wavelengths are the same: λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂.\n    *   Substituting gives: λ_rest₁ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Rearranging to find the ratio needed for the temperatures: λ_rest₂ / λ_rest₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Therefore, T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Substituting the radius and temperature ratios into the luminosity ratio formula:\n        L₁/L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n        L₁/L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n    *   The Python code executed this exact formula with the given values:\n        *   `v2 = 700 * 1000` m/s\n        *   `c = 299792458` m/s\n        *   `R_ratio = 1.5`\n    *   The code's output was `2.229107561148499`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229.

The luminosity (L) of a star is given by the formula:\n\nL = 4πR²σT⁴\n\nWhere:\n*   **R** is the radius of the star.\n*   **σ** (sigma) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **T** is the effective surface temperature of the star.\n\nWe can set up a ratio of the luminosities of the two stars:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n\nThe constants (4, π, and σ) cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have the following information:\n*   The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂), so R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n*   The wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same.\n*   The radial velocity of Star_1 is 0 km/s, and for Star_2 it is 700 km/s.\n\nThe fact that the stars \"appeared\" brightest at the same wavelength implies that their *observed* peak wavelengths are identical. This observation is affected by the Doppler effect due to the stars' radial velocities. The light from Star_2, which is moving away from us, is redshifted, meaning its observed wavelength is longer than its intrinsic (source) wavelength.\n\nThe relationship between the observed peak wavelength (λ_obs) and the source peak wavelength (λ_source) is given by the Doppler shift formula. For non-relativistic speeds (as 700 km/s is much less than the speed of light), this is:\n\nλ_obs = λ_source * (1 + v/c)\n\nWhere **v** is the radial velocity and **c** is the speed of light.\n\nFor our stars:\n*   Star_1: v₁ = 0, so λ_obs,₁ = λ_source,₁\n*   Star_2: v₂ = 700 km/s, so λ_obs,₂ = λ_source,₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n\nSince λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂, we have:\nλ_source,₁ = λ_source,₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n\nNext, we use Wien's Displacement Law, which relates a star's surface temperature to its intrinsic peak emission wavelength: λ_source = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's constant. This means that the temperature is inversely proportional to the source wavelength (T = b/λ_source).\n\nThe ratio of the temperatures of the two stars is therefore:\nT₁ / T₂ = (b/λ_source,₁) / (b/λ_source,₂) = λ_source,₂ / λ_source,₁\n\nFrom our Doppler-derived relation, we can find this wavelength ratio:\nλ_source,₂ / λ_source,₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\nSo, the temperature ratio is:\nT₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\nNow we can substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into our luminosity ratio equation:\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\nFinally, we calculate the numerical value:\n*   v₂ = 700 km/s\n*   c ≈ 300,000 km/s\n*   v₂/c = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333\n\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.009365\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23. The information about the masses of the stars is not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is the step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio**: We need to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) to that of Star_2 (L₂):\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂).\n    Therefore, (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio**:\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law**: This law relates a star's temperature (T) to the rest-frame wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (λ_rest_max):\n        λ_rest_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant.\n        This implies that T is inversely proportional to λ_rest_max. So, the temperature ratio is:\n        T₁ / T₂ = λ_rest_max₂ / λ_rest_max₁\n\n    *   **Doppler Effect**: The problem states that the radial velocity of Star_2 is v₂ = 700 km/s, while Star_1 is stationary (v₁ = 0). This velocity causes a Doppler shift in the observed wavelength. The problem also states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (λ_obs_max₁ = λ_obs_max₂).\n        The relationship between the observed wavelength (λ_obs) and the rest-frame wavelength (λ_rest) for a velocity much smaller than the speed of light (c) is:\n        λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v/c)\n\n    *   For Star_1 (v₁ = 0): λ_obs_max₁ = λ_rest_max₁\n    *   For Star_2 (v₂ = 700 km/s): λ_obs_max₂ = λ_rest_max₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n\n    *   Since λ_obs_max₁ = λ_obs_max₂, we have:\n        λ_rest_max₁ = λ_rest_max₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n\n    *   Now we can find the ratio of the rest-frame wavelengths:\n        λ_rest_max₂ / λ_rest_max₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: Now substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n\n    Let's plug in the values:\n    *   v₂ = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s\n    *   c (speed of light) ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   v₂/c = 700,000 / 300,000,000 ≈ 0.002333\n\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 0.002333)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.00937\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23. The information about the stars' masses is not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe problem requires calculating the ratio of luminosities for two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, based on their physical properties. The solution involves applying the Stefan-Boltzmann law and accounting for the Doppler effect on the observed wavelengths.\n\n### Key Principles:\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is related to its radius (R) and surface temperature (T). The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law**: This law states that the peak emission wavelength (λ_max) of a black body is inversely proportional to its absolute temperature (T). This relationship pertains to the wavelength emitted by the star in its own rest frame.\n3.  **Doppler Effect**: The wavelength of light observed from a moving source is shifted. For a source moving with a radial velocity (v_r) relative to an observer, the observed wavelength (λ_obs) is related to the emitted wavelength (λ_emitted) by the non-relativistic formula λ_obs ≈ λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c), where c is the speed of light. A positive velocity indicates the source is receding.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio**: From the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴.\n\n2.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). Therefore, the ratio of their radii squared is:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n3.  **Temperature Ratio**: The temperature ratio is determined using Wien's Law, which connects temperature to the *emitted* peak wavelength. The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same for both stars (λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂). We must use the Doppler effect to relate these observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths.\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0 km/s, so there is no Doppler shift. The observed wavelength is equal to the emitted wavelength: λ_emitted₁ = λ_obs₁.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. The observed wavelength is Doppler-shifted: λ_obs₂ = λ_emitted₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂, we can write: λ_emitted₁ = λ_emitted₂ * (1 + 700 km/s / 300,000 km/s) = λ_emitted₂ * (1 + 7/3000).\n\n4.  **Connecting to Temperature**: According to Wien's Law, temperature is inversely proportional to the emitted peak wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_emitted). The ratio of the temperatures is therefore:\n    T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted₂ / λ_emitted₁ = λ_emitted₂ / [λ_emitted₂ * (1 + 7/3000)] = 1 / (1 + 7/3000) = 3000/3007.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: Now, substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * (3000/3007)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 * (0.99767)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 * 0.99073\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis result is approximately 2.23. The information about the masses of the stars is not needed for this calculation and serves as a distractor.\n\nThe luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to determine the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 (`L1 / L2`).\n\n**2. Identify Key Physical Principles**\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law relates a star's luminosity (L) to its radius (R) and surface temperature (T). The formula is `L = 4πR²σT⁴`, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law connects the surface temperature (T) of a black body to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (`λ_emitted`). The formula is `λ_emitted * T = b`, where b is Wien's constant. This implies that `T` is inversely proportional to `λ_emitted`.\n*   **Relativistic Doppler Effect:** This effect describes how the observed wavelength of light (`λ_obs`) changes due to the relative motion between the source and the observer. For an object moving with a radial velocity `v`, the observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength (`λ_emitted`) by the formula: `λ_obs = λ_emitted * sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))`, where `c` is the speed of light. A positive `v` indicates the object is moving away (redshift).\n\n**3. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law for both stars:\n`L1 = 4π(R1)²σ(T1)⁴`\n`L2 = 4π(R2)²σ(T2)⁴`\n\nThe ratio `L1 / L2` is:\n`L1 / L2 = (4π(R1)²σ(T1)⁴) / (4π(R2)²σ(T2)⁴)`\n\nThe constants `4π` and `σ` cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n`L1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)² * (T1 / T2)⁴`\n\n**4. Determine the Radius and Temperature Ratios**\n\n*   **Radius Ratio (`R1 / R2`):**\n    The problem states that `R1 = 1.5 * R2`. Therefore, `R1 / R2 = 1.5`.\n\n*   **Temperature Ratio (`T1 / T2`):**\n    From Wien's Law, temperature is inversely proportional to the emitted peak wavelength (`T ∝ 1/λ_emitted`). So, the temperature ratio is `T1 / T2 = λ_emitted_2 / λ_emitted_1`.\n    We need to find the ratio of the *emitted* wavelengths. We are given that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: `λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2`.\n\n    *   **For Star_1:** The radial velocity `v1 = 0`. With no velocity, there is no Doppler shift. Thus, `λ_obs_1 = λ_emitted_1`.\n    *   **For Star_2:** The radial velocity `v2 = 700 km/s`. This star is moving, so its light is Doppler shifted.\n        `λ_obs_2 = λ_emitted_2 * sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c))`\n\n    Since `λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2`, we can set the expressions equal:\n    `λ_emitted_1 = λ_emitted_2 * sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c))`\n\n    Now, we can find the ratio of emitted wavelengths needed for our temperature calculation:\n    `λ_emitted_2 / λ_emitted_1 = 1 / sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c)) = sqrt((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))`\n\n    Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n    `T1 / T2 = sqrt((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))`\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio**\nSubstitute the expressions for the radius and temperature ratios back into our main equation:\n`L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * [sqrt((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))]⁴`\n\nThe square root and the power of 4 simplify:\n`L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * ((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))²`\n\nNow, we plug in the numerical values:\n*   `R1 / R2 = 1.5`\n*   `v2 = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s`\n*   `c ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s`\n\nThe calculation performed by the Python script was:\n`L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * ((1 - 700000/299792458) / (1 + 700000/299792458))²`\n`L1 / L2 ≈ 2.25 * (0.9907)`\n`L1 / L2 ≈ 2.2291`\n\nRounding this result to two decimal places gives **2.23**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe code output provided is `2.2291075611484996`.\n\nThis result is obtained from the derived formula for the luminosity ratio:\n$L_1 / L_2 = (R_1 / R_2)^2 * (1 + v_{r2} / c)^{-4}$\n\nPlugging in the values:\n*   $R_1 / R_2 = 1.5$\n*   $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s\n*   $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s (speed of light)\n\n$L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 * (1 + 700 / 300000)^{-4}$\n$L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * (1.002333...)^{-4}$\n$L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.25 * 0.99071447$\n$L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.229107...$\n\nThis calculated value, `2.2291...`, is closest to the option B) ~2.23.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to the luminosity of Star_2, which can be written as $L_1 / L_2$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is determined by its radius (R) and surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n        $L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n        where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates the surface temperature (T) of a black body to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation ($\\lambda_{emit}$). The formula is:\n        $\\lambda_{emit} = b / T$\n        where b is Wien's constant. This implies that $T$ is inversely proportional to $\\lambda_{emit}$.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) of light from a moving source is shifted relative to the emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{emit}$). The formula for this shift is:\n        $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emit} (1 + v_r / c)$\n        where $v_r$ is the radial velocity of the source (positive if moving away) and c is the speed of light.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    We can write the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars using the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4)$\n    The constants ($4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$) cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1 / R_2)^2 \\times (T_1 / T_2)^4$\n\n4.  **Incorporate the Given Information:**\n    *   **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2$, so the ratio $R_1 / R_2 = 1.5$.\n    *   **Temperature Ratio:** This is the most complex part. We need to find the ratio $T_1 / T_2$. We can do this by relating temperature to the peak wavelength. From Wien's Law, $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{emit}$, which means:\n        $T_1 / T_2 = \\lambda_{emit,2} / \\lambda_{emit,1}$\n\n5.  **Relate Emitted and Observed Wavelengths:**\n    We are given that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$. We need to find the *emitted* wavelengths using the Doppler effect.\n    *   For Star_1: $v_{r1} = 0$. So, $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{emit,1} (1 + 0/c) = \\lambda_{emit,1}$.\n    *   For Star_2: $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s. So, $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{emit,2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n\n6.  **Solve for the Temperature Ratio:**\n    Since $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we can set the two expressions equal:\n    $\\lambda_{emit,1} = \\lambda_{emit,2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n    Now, we rearrange this to find the ratio of emitted wavelengths, which we need for the temperature ratio:\n    $\\lambda_{emit,2} / \\lambda_{emit,1} = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n    Since $T_1 / T_2 = \\lambda_{emit,2} / \\lambda_{emit,1}$, we have:\n    $T_1 / T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:**\n    Now we substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into our luminosity ratio equation from step 3:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 \\times [1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)]^4$\n    $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)^4$\n\n8.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation:**\n    We need to plug in the values for $v_{r2}$ and $c$.\n    *   $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s = $700,000$ m/s\n    *   $c$ (speed of light) = $299,792,458$ m/s\n    The calculation is best done with a script to maintain precision.\n\n```python\n# Define the given values and constants\nR_ratio = 1.5  # R1/R2\nvr2 = 700 * 1000  # Radial velocity of Star 2 in m/s\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# From the Doppler shift and Wien's Law, we derived the temperature ratio:\n# T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + vr2/c)\nT_ratio = 1 / (1 + vr2 / c)\n\n# The luminosity ratio is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n# L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\nL_ratio = (R_ratio**2) * (T_ratio**4)\n\nprint(L_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n2.229200280092933\n</execute_result>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 2.2292.

This law relates temperature to the *intrinsic* peak wavelength.\n-   **Doppler Effect**: The observed wavelength of a source is shifted depending on its radial velocity relative to the observer. A positive radial velocity (moving away) causes a redshift (increase in wavelength). The non-relativistic formula is v/c = Δλ/λ_rest or λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c).\n\nThe key to the problem remains the interpretation of \"the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest... are the same.\" As reasoned before, \"appeared\" refers to the observed wavelength (λ_obs). The inclusion of the specific radial velocity for Star 2 (700 km/s) and a zero velocity for Star 1 strongly suggests this information is intended to be used to correct the observed peak wavelength to the intrinsic peak wavelength, which is then used in Wien's Law to find the temperature.\n\nThe calculation I performed seems correct.\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio**: L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n2.  **Given Radius Ratio**: R₁/R₂ = 1.5, so (R₁/R₂)² = 2.25.\n3.  **Temperature Ratio from Wien's Law**: T₁/T₂ = λ_rest₂ / λ_rest₁\n4.  **Wavelengths from Doppler Effect**:\n    *   λ_obs₁ = λ_rest₁ (since v₁ = 0)\n    *   λ_obs₂ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v₂/c) (assuming redshift for positive velocity)\n5.  **Equating Observed Wavelengths**: λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂ => λ_rest₁ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n6.  **Finding Wavelength Ratio**: λ_rest₂ / λ_rest₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n7.  **Substituting into Temperature Ratio**: T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n8.  **Final Calculation**:\n    *   v₂/c = 700 km/s / 300,000 km/s ≈ 0.002333\n    *   L₁/L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 0.002333)]⁴\n    *   L₁/L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936 ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23.

Option D (2.25) would be the answer if the Doppler shift were ignored. The small difference between C and D is the key, and the provided radial velocity data allows for this distinction.\n\nThe luminosity of a star is determined by its radius and surface temperature, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The ratio of the luminosities of two stars is therefore dependent on the ratio of their radii and the ratio of their surface temperatures.\n\nThe key steps to solving this problem are:\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star radiating as a black body is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio**: For Star 1 and Star 2, the ratio of their luminosities is L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)²(T₁/T₂)⁴.\n3.  **Radius Information**: We are given that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂, so (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n4.  **Wien's Displacement Law**: This law relates the star's surface temperature to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (its peak wavelength, λ_max). Specifically, T is inversely proportional to the *intrinsic* (or rest-frame) peak wavelength (λ_rest). Therefore, the ratio of the temperatures is T₁/T₂ = λ_rest₂/λ_rest₁.\n5.  **Doppler Effect**: The problem states that the stars *appeared* brightest at the same wavelength. This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs), which is affected by the star's motion relative to the observer. The relationship between the observed and rest wavelength is given by the Doppler shift formula. For non-relativistic speeds, λ_obs = λ_rest(1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity (positive for motion away from the observer).\n6.  **Applying the Data**:\n    *   For Star 1, the radial velocity is 0, so its observed peak wavelength is equal to its rest peak wavelength: λ_obs₁ = λ_rest₁.\n    *   For Star 2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. Its observed peak wavelength is λ_obs₂ = λ_rest₂(1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂, we have λ_rest₁ = λ_rest₂(1 + v₂/c).\n7.  **Calculating the Temperature Ratio**: From the relationship in the previous step, we find the ratio of the rest wavelengths: λ_rest₂/λ_rest₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c). This means T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n8.  **Final Calculation**: We can now substitute all the values into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    *   L₁/L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + (700 km/s) / (300,000 km/s))]⁴\n    *   L₁/L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 0.002333)]⁴\n    *   L₁/L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    *   L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936\n    *   L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23.

The problem provides a crucial piece of information: \"Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same.\" This refers to the peak wavelength (λ_max) of the star's emission.\n\nWien's Displacement Law states that the peak emission wavelength of a black body is inversely proportional to its absolute temperature (T). The formula is:\n\nλ_max = b / T\n\nwhere 'b' is Wien's displacement constant.\n\nSince the astronomers determined that the peak wavelengths (λ_max) are the same for both stars, it implies that their intrinsic surface temperatures are also the same. The mention of \"spectroscopy\" is key; this analytical method allows astronomers to determine a star's intrinsic properties by accounting for factors like the Doppler effect. Therefore, we can conclude that T₁ = T₂, which means T₁/T₂ = 1.\n\nThe information about the masses and radial velocities of the stars is extraneous to this specific calculation. The radial velocity would be used to correct for Doppler shift to find the intrinsic peak wavelength, but the problem implies this has already been done.\n\nNow, we can substitute the known ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (1)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * 1\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25\n\nThus, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe problem requires calculating the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, based on a set of given astronomical data. The solution involves applying the principles of black body radiation and the Doppler effect.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio**: To find the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 (L₁) and Star_2 (L₂), we can set up the following equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Information**: The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). Therefore, the ratio of their radii squared is (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n4.  **Temperature Information from Wavelength**: According to Wien's Displacement Law, the wavelength at which a black body's radiation is most intense (λ_max) is inversely proportional to its temperature (T). The problem states that the wavelength at which the stars *appeared* brightest was the same. This implies the *observed* peak wavelengths are equal, which are affected by the stars' motion relative to the observer.\n\n5.  **Doppler Effect**: The radial velocity of a star causes a shift in the observed wavelength of its light. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, so its observed peak wavelength (λ_obs,₁) is the same as its emitted peak wavelength (λ_em,₁). Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, causing its light to be redshifted (shifted to a longer wavelength). The observed wavelength is given by the formula λ_obs ≈ λ_em * (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light.\n    *   For Star_1: λ_obs,₁ = λ_em,₁\n    *   For Star_2: λ_obs,₂ = λ_em,₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n\n6.  **Temperature Ratio Calculation**: Since the observed peak wavelengths are the same (λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂), we have:\n    λ_em,₁ = λ_em,₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n    Using Wien's Law (λ_em = b/T, where b is a constant), we can substitute for the emitted wavelengths:\n    b/T₁ = (b/T₂) * (1 + v₂/c)\n    This simplifies to T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n7.  **Final Calculation**: Now, we substitute the ratios for the radii and temperatures back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n    Using v₂ = 700 km/s (or 700,000 m/s) and c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s:\n    v₂/c ≈ 700,000 / (3 x 10⁸) ≈ 0.002333\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThe computed luminosity ratio is approximately 2.23. The information about the stars' masses is not needed for this calculation, as the problem specifies the stars should be treated as black bodies.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n1.  **Luminosity Formula:**\n    The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L = A \\cdot \\sigma \\cdot T^4$\n    Where A is the surface area ($4\\pi R^2$), R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    The formula can be written as:\n    $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n\n2.  **Ratio of Luminosities:**\n    We need to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 ($L_1$) to that of Star_2 ($L_2$):\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4)$\n    Simplifying, we get:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\cdot (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n3.  **Ratio of Radii:**\n    The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 ($R_1 = 1.5 \\cdot R_2$).\n    So, the ratio of the radii squared is:\n    $(R_1/R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$\n\n4.  **Ratio of Temperatures:**\n    To find the temperature ratio, we use the information about the peak emission wavelength. Wien's Displacement Law relates a star's temperature to its *emitted* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{emit}$):\n    $T = b / \\lambda_{emit}$ (where b is Wien's constant)\n    Therefore, the ratio of temperatures is inversely proportional to the ratio of their emitted peak wavelengths:\n    $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{emit,2} / \\lambda_{emit,1}$\n\n5.  **Relating Emitted and Observed Wavelengths:**\n    The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{obs}$) are the same for both stars. The observed wavelength is affected by the Doppler effect due to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$):\n    $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emit} (1 + v_r/c)$\n    where c is the speed of light (~$3 \\times 10^5$ km/s).\n\n    For Star_1: $v_{r1} = 0$ km/s. So, $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{emit,1}(1+0) = \\lambda_{emit,1}$.\n    For Star_2: $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s. So, $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{emit,2}(1 + 700/c)$.\n\n    Since $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we have:\n    $\\lambda_{emit,1} = \\lambda_{emit,2}(1 + 700/c)$\n\n6.  **Calculating the Temperature Ratio:**\n    From the relationship above, we can find the ratio of emitted wavelengths:\n    $\\lambda_{emit,2} / \\lambda_{emit,1} = 1 / (1 + 700/c)$\n    Since $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{emit,2} / \\lambda_{emit,1}$, we have:\n    $T_1/T_2 = 1 / (1 + 700/c)$\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Now we substitute the ratios for radius and temperature back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (2.25) \\cdot [1 / (1 + 700/c)]^4$\n    Let's plug in the value for c ($3 \\times 10^5$ km/s):\n    $v_{r2}/c = 700 / 300000 = 7/3000 \\approx 0.002333$\n    $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / (1 + 7/3000)^4$\n    $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / (1.002333...)^4$\n    $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / 1.009355$\n    $L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.229$\n\n    This value is closest to 2.23.

Therefore, the ratio of their radii is:\n    R₁ / R₂ = 1.5\n    Squaring this gives:\n    (R₁ / R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio (Wien's Law and Doppler Effect):**\n    *   Wien's Displacement Law states that the intrinsic peak emission wavelength (λ_emitted) of a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature: λ_emitted = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's constant.\n    *   The problem states that the stars *appeared* brightest at the same wavelength. This refers to the *observed* wavelength (λ_obs), which is affected by the Doppler effect due to the star's radial velocity (v_r). The relationship is λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c), where 'c' is the speed of light.\n    *   For Star 1 (v_r₁ = 0 km/s): λ_obs₁ = λ_emitted₁ * (1 + 0/c) = λ_emitted₁ = b/T₁\n    *   For Star 2 (v_r₂ = 700 km/s): λ_obs₂ = λ_emitted₂ * (1 + v_r₂/c) = (b/T₂) * (1 + v_r₂/c)\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are the same (λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂), we can equate the two expressions:\n        b/T₁ = (b/T₂) * (1 + v_r₂/c)\n    *   This simplifies to the ratio of the temperatures:\n        T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r₂/c)\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Now, we substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v_r₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v_r₂/c)⁴\n\n    Let's plug in the values:\n    *   v_r₂ = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s\n    *   c (speed of light) ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   v_r₂/c = 700,000 / 300,000,000 = 7/3000 ≈ 0.002333\n\n    Now, calculate the denominator:\n    *   (1 + 0.002333)⁴ ≈ (1.002333)⁴ ≈ 1.00936\n\n    Finally, compute the luminosity ratio:\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936 ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23. The information about the masses of the stars is not needed for this calculation.\n\nTherefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Laws:** The luminosity of a star radiating as a black body is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: `L = 4 * π * R² * σ * T⁴`, where `L` is luminosity, `R` is the radius, `T` is the surface temperature, and `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The peak emission wavelength (`λ_max`) is related to temperature by Wien's Displacement Law: `λ_max = b / T`, where `b` is Wien's constant.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** We need to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L1) to Star_2 (L2).\n    `L1 / L2 = (4 * π * R1² * σ * T1⁴) / (4 * π * R2² * σ * T2⁴)`\n    Simplifying this gives:\n    `L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)⁴`\n\n3.  **Determine the Radius Ratio:** The problem states that `R1 = 1.5 * R2`, so the ratio `R1/R2` is 1.5.\n\n4.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio:**\n    *   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths (`λ_obs`) are the same for both stars.\n    *   The observed wavelength is affected by the star's radial velocity (`v`) due to the Doppler effect. The non-relativistic approximation is `λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c)`, where `λ_rest` is the wavelength in the star's own reference frame and `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   For Star_1, `v1 = 0`, so `λ_obs_1 = λ_rest_1`.\n    *   For Star_2, `v2 = 700 km/s`, so `λ_obs_2 = λ_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c)`.\n    *   Since `λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2`, we can say `λ_rest_1 = λ_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c)`.\n    *   According to Wien's Law, temperature is inversely proportional to the rest-frame peak wavelength (`T = b / λ_rest`). Therefore, the temperature ratio is `T1/T2 = λ_rest_2 / λ_rest_1`.\n    *   Substituting our finding, we get `T1/T2 = λ_rest_2 / (λ_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c))`, which simplifies to `T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:** Substitute the radius ratio and the temperature ratio into the luminosity ratio equation and compute the final value.

Due to the Doppler effect from Star_2's velocity (`v₂ = 700 km/s`), its emitted wavelength is different from its observed wavelength. The fact that their *observed* peak wavelengths are the same means their temperatures are not. The final relationship for the temperature ratio is `(T₁/T₂)⁴ = ((1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c))²`.\n4.  **Final Calculation:** Combining these parts gives `L₁/L₂ = 2.25 * ((1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c))²`. The code executed this calculation:\n    *   `v₂ = 700,000 m/s`\n    *   `c = 299,792,458 m/s`\n    *   `L₁/L₂ = 2.25 * ((1 - 700000/299792458) / (1 + 700000/299792458))² ≈ 2.229`\n\nRounding the result `2.229` to two decimal places gives `2.23`. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nTo determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we can use the principles of black-body radiation. The key formulas are the Stefan-Boltzmann law and Wien's displacement law.\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: This law states that the total energy radiated per unit surface area of a black body is directly proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature (T). The total luminosity (L) of a spherical star with radius (R) is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law**: This law relates the temperature of a black body to the wavelength (λ_max) at which it emits the most radiation. The relationship is inverse: λ_max = b/T, where b is Wien's constant. Therefore, a star's temperature determines its peak emission wavelength.\n\n3.  **Doppler Effect**: The observed wavelength of light from a moving source is shifted. If the source is moving away, its light is redshifted to longer wavelengths; if it is moving closer, it is blueshifted to shorter wavelengths. For speeds much less than the speed of light (c), the observed wavelength (λ_obs) is related to the rest wavelength (λ_rest) by the formula λ_obs ≈ λ_rest(1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity.\n\n**Applying these principles to the problem:**\n\nThe astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest were the same. This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs).\n\n*   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0 km/s, so its observed peak wavelength is equal to its intrinsic (rest) peak wavelength: λ_obs,1 = λ_rest,1.\n*   For Star_2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. This velocity causes a Doppler shift. Its light is redshifted, so the observed peak wavelength is longer than its intrinsic peak wavelength: λ_obs,2 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n\nSince λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2, we have:\nλ_rest,1 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v₂/c)\n\nAccording to Wien's Law, the temperature (T) is inversely proportional to the rest wavelength (T = b/λ_rest). So, the ratio of the temperatures is:\nT₁/T₂ = λ_rest,2 / λ_rest,1 = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the luminosities using the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\nWe are given that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Substituting the known ratios:\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n\nNow, we plug in the values:\n*   v₂ = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s\n*   c (speed of light) ≈ 300,000,000 m/s\n*   v₂/c = 700,000 / 300,000,000 = 7/3000 ≈ 0.002333\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + 0.002333)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.009364\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23. The information about the stars' masses is not needed for this calculation.\n\nTherefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nThe search results confirm the fundamental principles needed to solve this problem.\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star is proportional to its radius (R) squared and its surface temperature (T) to the fourth power. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. This confirms that L ∝ R²T⁴.\n\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law**: The wavelength at which a black body is brightest (λ_max) is inversely proportional to its absolute temperature (T). The formula is λ_max = b/T, where b is Wien's constant.\n\nBased on these principles, the reasoning is as follows:\n\n*   The problem states that the two stars radiate as black bodies.\n*   The luminosity of a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4πR²σT⁴.\n*   To find the ratio of the luminosities (L₁/L₂), we can set up the equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n*   We are given that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2, so R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n*   We are also told that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same (λ_max₁ = λ_max₂).\n*   According to Wien's Displacement Law, λ_max = b/T. If the peak wavelengths are the same, their surface temperatures must also be the same (T₁ = T₂), which means T₁/T₂ = 1.\n*   The information about the stars' masses and radial velocities is not relevant to the calculation of luminosity based on radius and temperature as defined by the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n*   Substituting the known values into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (1)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * 1\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25\n\nThis matches option D.\n\nFinal check of the question and my logic. The question is direct, the physics principles are standard for this type of problem, and the calculation is straightforward. The extra information (mass, radial velocity) seems designed to be a distractor. The core of the problem lies in correctly applying the Stefan-Boltzmann and Wien's laws.

The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates the peak emission wavelength (λ_max) of a black body to its absolute temperature (T). The formula is λ_max = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's constant. This means that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature.\n3.  **Doppler Effect for Light:** The observed wavelength of light from a moving source is shifted depending on its velocity relative to the observer. For a source moving away, the observed wavelength (λ_obs) is longer than the rest-frame wavelength (λ_rest). For non-relativistic speeds, the relationship is approximately λ_obs / λ_rest = 1 + (v/c), where 'v' is the radial velocity and 'c' is the speed of light.\n\n### Calculation Steps\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio:** We can set up a ratio of the luminosities of the two stars using the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    *   L1 / L2 = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    *   Simplifying by canceling the constants (4, π, σ), we get:\n        L1 / L2 = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n2.  **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2.\n    *   R₁ = 1.5 * R₂\n    *   Therefore, the ratio R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n\n3.  **Temperature Ratio:** This requires combining Wien's Law and the Doppler effect.\n    *   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (λ_obs1 = λ_obs2).\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0 km/s, so its observed wavelength is its true, rest-frame wavelength: λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. We must account for the Doppler shift to find its rest-frame wavelength. Since it's moving, its light is redshifted. The formula connects the observed and rest wavelengths: λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, we have: λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Now, we apply Wien's Law (λ_rest = b/T) to each star:\n        b/T₁ = (b/T₂) * (1 + v₂/c)\n    *   This simplifies to: 1/T₁ = (1/T₂) * (1 + v₂/c), which means T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Using the values v₂ = 700 km/s and c = 300,000 km/s, we get:\n        T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + 700/300000) ≈ 1 / 1.002333\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    *   L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * [1 / (1.002333)]⁴\n    *   L1 / L2 = 2.25 * (1 / 1.00935)\n    *   L1 / L2 ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23.

So, λ_obs,2 = λ_emitted,2 * √[(1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c)].\n    *   Since λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2, we have: λ_emitted,1 = λ_emitted,2 * √[(1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c)].\n    *   From Wien's Law, T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1.\n    *   Substituting the expression for λ_emitted,1, we get:\n        T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,2 / (λ_emitted,2 * √[(1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c)])\n        T₁/T₂ = 1 / √[(1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c)] = √[(1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c)]\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Now substitute this temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n        L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n        L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (√[(1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c)])⁴\n        L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [(1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c)]²\n    *   Now, we plug in the values:\n        v₂ = 700 km/s = 7 x 10⁵ m/s\n        c (speed of light) ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s\n        v₂/c = (7 x 10⁵) / (3 x 10⁸) ≈ 0.002333\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 * [(1 - 0.002333) / (1 + 0.002333)]²\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 * [0.997667 / 1.002333]²\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 * (0.995345)²\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 * 0.99071\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23. The information about the mass of the stars is not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nThe problem requires calculating the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, based on their physical properties.\n\nThe luminosity of a star that radiates as a black body is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The formula for luminosity (L) is:\nL = 4πR²σT⁴\nwhere:\n*   **R** is the star's radius.\n*   **σ** is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **T** is the star's effective surface temperature.\n\nTo find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) to Star_2 (L₂), we can set up the following equation:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\nThis simplifies to:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n*   The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂), so R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n*   The mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. This information is a distractor and not needed for this calculation which uses the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n*   The wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same.\n*   The radial velocities are 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2.\n\nThe temperature of a star is related to the peak wavelength (λ_max) of its emitted radiation by Wien's Displacement Law. The law states that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature (λ_max = b/T, where 'b' is a constant).\n\nThe crucial part of the problem is interpreting what \"the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest\" means. This could refer to the observed wavelength or the intrinsic (rest-frame) wavelength. The inclusion of the non-zero radial velocity for Star_2 suggests that a Doppler shift calculation is intended. A positive radial velocity indicates the star is moving away, causing its light to be redshifted to longer wavelengths.\n\nLet's assume the \"appeared brightest\" wavelength refers to the **observed** peak wavelength (λ_obs), which is the same for both stars.\n\n1.  **For Star_1**, with a radial velocity of 0, the observed peak wavelength is the same as its emitted peak wavelength (λ_em₁ = λ_obs).\n\n2.  **For Star_2**, moving away at v₂ = 700 km/s, its emitted light is redshifted. The observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength (λ_em₂) by the Doppler shift formula: λ_obs ≈ λ_em₂ * (1 + v₂/c), where 'c' is the speed of light (approximately 300,000 km/s).\n\n3.  Since the observed peak wavelengths are equal (λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂), we can say:\n    λ_em₁ = λ_em₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n\n4.  From Wien's Law, temperature is inversely proportional to the emitted peak wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_em). Therefore, the ratio of the temperatures is:\n    T₁/T₂ = λ_em₂ / λ_em₁\n\n5.  Substituting the relationship from the Doppler shift:\n    T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n6.  Now, we can substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700/300000)⁴\n\n7.  Calculating the value:\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333...)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333...)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009375\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 ($L_1/L_2$).\n\n**2. Identify Key Physical Principles**\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The total power radiated (luminosity, L) by a black body is proportional to its surface area (A) and the fourth power of its surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n    $L = A \\sigma T^4 = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where R is the star's radius and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The wavelength at which a black body emits the most radiation ($\\lambda_{max, emitted}$) is inversely proportional to its surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n    $\\lambda_{max, emitted} = b/T$\n    where b is Wien's constant.\n\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength of light from a moving source is shifted. For a source moving with a radial velocity $v_r$ (positive if receding), the observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) is related to the emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{emitted}$) by:\n    $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emitted}(1 + v_r/c)$\n    where c is the speed of light ($c \\approx 3 \\times 10^5$ km/s).\n\n**3. Set up the Luminosity Ratio**\n\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities is:\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$\n\n**4. Use the Given Information**\n\n*   **Radius Ratio:** We are given $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2$, so $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$.\n    Substituting this into the equation:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4 = 2.25 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$\n\n*   **Mass Information:** The mass information ($M_1 = 1.5 M_2$) is not directly used in the black-body radiation laws and is likely included as a distractor.\n\n*   **Temperature Ratio:** To find the temperature ratio ($\\frac{T_1}{T_2}$), we must use the information about the peak emission wavelengths. The problem states that the \"wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest... are the same.\" This refers to the **observed** peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{max, obs}$).\n    So, $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2}$.\n\n**5. Relate Temperature to Observed Wavelength**\n\nWe need to connect the observed peak wavelength to the star's intrinsic temperature using the Doppler effect and Wien's Law.\n\n*   **For Star_1:**\n    The radial velocity is $v_{r,1} = 0$ km/s. There is no Doppler shift.\n    $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, emitted, 1}$\n    From Wien's Law, $T_1 = b / \\lambda_{max, emitted, 1}$. So, $T_1 = b / \\lambda_{max, obs, 1}$.\n\n*   **For Star_2:**\n    The radial velocity is $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s. The light is redshifted.\n    $\\lambda_{max, obs, 2} = \\lambda_{max, emitted, 2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n    From Wien's Law, $T_2 = b / \\lambda_{max, emitted, 2}$. So, $\\lambda_{max, emitted, 2} = b / T_2$.\n    Substituting this into the Doppler equation:\n    $\\lambda_{max, obs, 2} = (\\frac{b}{T_2}) (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n\n*   **Find the Temperature Ratio:**\n    Since $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2}$:\n    $\\frac{b}{T_1} = (\\frac{b}{T_2}) (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n    $\\frac{1}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{T_2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n    Rearranging to find the temperature ratio $\\frac{T_1}{T_2}$:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2}/c}$\n\n**6.

The formula is:\n    *   L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    *   Where:\n        *   L is the luminosity (total power radiated).\n        *   R is the star's radius.\n        *   σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n        *   T is the star's surface temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Analyze the given information on radius:** We are given that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2.\n    *   R₁ = 1.5 * R₂\n\n4.  **Analyze the information on wavelength:** The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared brightest* are the same.

We are also given the radial velocities:\n    *   v₁ = 0 km/s\n    *   v₂ = 700 km/s (receding)\n\n5.  **Consider the Doppler Effect:** Because Star_2 is moving, the light we observe from it is subject to a Doppler shift. The observed wavelength (λ_obs) is related to the intrinsic, or rest, wavelength (λ_rest) by the formula for non-relativistic speeds:\n    *   λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c)\n    *   Where 'v' is the radial velocity and 'c' is the speed of light.\n\n6.  **Relate observed wavelengths to rest wavelengths:**\n    *   For Star_1 (v₁ = 0), the observed peak wavelength is the same as its rest peak wavelength: λ_obs₁ = λ_rest₁.\n    *   For Star_2 (v₂ = 700 km/s), its light is redshifted. The observed peak wavelength is: λ_obs₂ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since the problem states λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂, we have: λ_rest₁ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n\n7.  **Apply Wien's Displacement Law:** Wien's law states that the intrinsic peak wavelength of a black body's emission is inversely proportional to its temperature (λ_rest = b/T), where 'b' is Wien's displacement constant. Therefore, T is inversely proportional to λ_rest.\n    *   T ∝ 1/λ_rest\n\n8.  **Determine the temperature ratio:** From Wien's Law, the ratio of the temperatures of the two stars is:\n    *   T₁ / T₂ = λ_rest₂ / λ_rest₁\n    *   Substituting the relationship from the Doppler effect (step 6): T₁ / T₂ = λ_rest₂ / [λ_rest₂ * (1 + v₂/c)]\n    *   T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n9.  **Calculate the luminosity ratio:** Now, we set up the ratio of the luminosities using the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n    *   L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    *   The constants (4, π, σ) cancel out: L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n10. **Substitute the known ratios and values:**\n    *   We know R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n    *   We found T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   The velocity of Star_2 is v₂ = 700 km/s = 7 x 10⁵ m/s.\n    *   The speed of light is c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s.\n    *   L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + (7x10⁵ / 3x10⁸))]⁴\n    *   L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 7/3000)]⁴\n    *   L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333...)⁴\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\n11. **Final Answer:** The calculated factor is approximately 2.229, which rounds to 2.23.

The ratio of luminosities for the two stars is therefore `L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴`.\n\n2.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that `R₁ = 1.5 * R₂`, so the ratio `R₁/R₂` is 1.5.\n\n3.  **Temperature Ratio**: The temperature of a black body is related to its peak emission wavelength (`λ_max`) by Wien's Displacement Law: `T ∝ 1/λ_max_rest`, where `λ_max_rest` is the peak wavelength in the star's own rest frame. We are told the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same. We must use the Doppler effect to relate the observed wavelength to the rest-frame wavelength. The formula is `λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + vᵣ/c)`, where `vᵣ` is the radial velocity.\n    *   For Star 1, `vᵣ₁ = 0`, so `λ_obs₁ = λ_rest₁`.\n    *   For Star 2, `vᵣ₂ = 700 km/s`, so `λ_obs₂ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + vᵣ₂/c)`.\n    *   Since `λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂`, we have `λ_rest₁ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + vᵣ₂/c)`.\n    *   The temperature ratio `T₁/T₂` is `λ_rest₂/λ_rest₁`, which simplifies to `1 / (1 + vᵣ₂/c)`.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**: I will substitute the radius ratio and the calculated temperature ratio into the luminosity ratio formula to find the final numerical answer.

Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Key Information**\n\nFirst, let's list the information provided in the problem statement:\n*   **Radius Relationship:** The radius of Star_1 ($R_1$) is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2 ($R_2$).\n    *   $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2$ or $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** The mass of Star_1 ($M_1$) is 1.5 times the mass of Star_2 ($M_2$).\n    *   $M_1 = 1.5 \\times M_2$. (This is likely extra information not needed for the direct calculation, which is a common trick in physics problems).\n*   **Observed Wavelength:** The observed wavelengths of peak brightness ($\\lambda_{obs}$) are the same for both stars.\n    *   $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n*   **Radial Velocities:**\n    *   Radial velocity of Star_1, $v_{r,1} = 0 \\text{ km/s}$.\n    *   Radial velocity of Star_2, $v_{r,2} = 700 \\text{ km/s}$.\n*   **Physical Model:** The stars are assumed to radiate as black bodies.\n*   **Goal:** Find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to the luminosity of Star_2 ($\\frac{L_1}{L_2}$).\n\n**2. Identify Relevant Physical Principles**\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law describes the total power (luminosity, $L$) radiated by a black body. It is proportional to the surface area ($A$) and the fourth power of the surface temperature ($T$).\n    *   $L = \\sigma A T^4$\n    *   Since a star is a sphere, its surface area is $A = 4\\pi R^2$.\n    *   So, $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$, where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates the temperature of a black body to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation ($\\lambda_{em}$, the *emitted* peak wavelength).\n    *   $\\lambda_{em} \\times T = b$, where $b$ is Wien's constant.\n*   **Doppler Effect for Light:** This effect describes the change in observed wavelength due to the relative motion between the source and the observer. The radial velocity ($v_r$) causes a shift in wavelength.\n    *   $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{em} (1 + \\frac{v_r}{c})$, where $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Analysis and Calculation**\n\n**Step 1: Set up the Luminosity Ratio**\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law, we can write the luminosities for Star_1 and Star_2:\n*   $L_1 = 4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4$\n*   $L_2 = 4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4$\n\nNow, we find the ratio $\\frac{L_1}{L_2}$:\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4}$\nThe constants $4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ cancel out, leaving:\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Radius Ratio Term**\nWe are given that $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$.\nSo, the first part of our equation is:\n$(\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$)**\nThis is the most complex part and requires combining Wien's Law and the Doppler effect.\n*   **Careful Point:** Wien's Law applies to the wavelength *emitted* by the star in its own rest frame ($\\lambda_{em}$), not the wavelength *observed* on Earth ($\\lambda_{obs}$). We must relate the observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths first.\n\nFrom the Doppler effect formula, we can write the emitted wavelength as: $\\lambda_{em} = \\frac{\\lambda_{obs}}{1 + v_r/c}$.\n\nLet's find the emitted peak wavelengths for each star:\n*   For Star_1: $v_{r,1} = 0$.

Therefore, (R₁/R₂) = 1.5.\n    Substituting this into the equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴ = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n5.  **Temperature Ratio:** The temperature ratio needs to be determined from the information about the peak wavelengths.\n    *   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.\n    *   According to Wien's Displacement Law, the emitted peak wavelength (λ_emitted) is inversely proportional to the temperature: λ_emitted = b / T.\n    *   The observed wavelength is affected by the Doppler shift due to the star's radial velocity (v). The relativistic Doppler formula is:\n        λ_obs = λ_emitted * √((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))\n\n6.  **Applying Doppler Shift:**\n    *   For Star_1, v₁ = 0, so there is no Doppler shift. Thus, λ_obs,1 = λ_emitted,1.\n    *   For Star_2, v₂ = 700 km/s. The light from Star_2 is redshifted. Its observed wavelength is λ_obs,2 = λ_emitted,2 * √((1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c)).\n    *   Since λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2:\n        λ_emitted,1 = λ_emitted,2 * √((1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c))\n\n7.  **Connecting Wavelengths and Temperatures:**\n    *   Using Wien's Law (T = b / λ_emitted):\n        b / T₁ = (b / T₂) * √((1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c))\n    *   Simplifying to find the temperature ratio T₁ / T₂:\n        T₂ / T₁ = √((1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c))\n        T₁ / T₂ = √((1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c))\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Substitute the expression for the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n        L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (T₁ / T₂)⁴ = 2.25 * (√((1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c)))⁴\n        L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * ((1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c))²\n\n9.  **Code Output Analysis:**\n    *   The provided Python code implements this final formula.\n    *   The code calculated the value using v₂ = 700,000 m/s and c = 299,792,458 m/s.\n    *   The output of the code is `2.22908325509156`.\n    *   This value rounds to `2.23`.\n\n10. **Conclusion:**\n    The computed luminosity ratio is approximately 2.23. This matches option D. The information about the stars' masses was not needed for the calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the correct factor.\n\n### 1. The Stefan-Boltzmann Law\nThe luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is determined by its radius (R) and its surface temperature (T). The relationship is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n*L = 4πR²σT⁴*\nwhere σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n### 2. Luminosity Ratio\nTo find how many times greater the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) is than that of Star_2 (L₂), we can set up a ratio:\n*L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)*\n\nThe constants cancel out, leaving:\n*L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴*\n\nWe are given that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, so R₁/R₂ = 1.5. Plugging this in gives:\n*L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴ = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)⁴*\n\n### 3. Temperature Ratio via Wien's Law and Doppler Shift\nThe problem states that the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength (λ_max). This observed peak wavelength is related to the star's surface temperature by Wien's Displacement Law (λ_emitted = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's constant). However, we must account for the relativistic Doppler effect, as Star_2 is moving at a significant radial velocity.\n\n*   **For Star_1:** With a radial velocity of 0 km/s, the observed wavelength is the same as the emitted wavelength.\n    *λ_obs₁ = λ_emitted₁ = b/T₁*\n\n*   **For Star_2:** With a radial velocity (v) of 700 km/s, its light is redshifted. The observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength by the relativistic Doppler shift formula.\n    *λ_obs₂ = λ_emitted₂ * √[(1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c)]*\n    Substituting Wien's law:\n    *λ_obs₂ = (b/T₂) * √[(1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c)]*\n\nSince the observed wavelengths are the same (λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂):\n*b/T₁ = (b/T₂) * √[(1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c)]*\n\nSolving for the temperature ratio (T₁/T₂):\n*T₁/T₂ = √[(1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c)]*\n\n### 4. Calculation\nNow we can calculate the numerical values. The velocity of Star_2 is v = 700 km/s, and the speed of light is c ≈ 300,000 km/s.\n*   β = v/c = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333\n\nSubstitute this value back into the temperature ratio equation:\n*(T₁/T₂)⁴ = (√[(1 - β) / (1 + β)])⁴ = [(1 - β) / (1 + β)]²*\n\nFinally, substitute this into our luminosity ratio equation:\n*L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [(1 - 0.002333) / (1 + 0.002333)]²*\n*L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [0.997667 / 1.002333]²*\n*L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (0.995345)²*\n*L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * 0.99071*\n*L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.2291*\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23. The information about the stars' masses is not needed for this calculation and serves as a distractor.\n\nThe luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nTo determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star 1 is greater than that of Star 2, we can use the principles of black-body radiation.\n\n### Key Principles:\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law states that the total energy radiated per unit surface area of a black body is directly proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature (T). The total luminosity (L) of a spherical star is given by the formula L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates the temperature of a black body to the wavelength (λ_max) at which it emits the most light. The law states that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature (λ_max ∝ 1/T). This means that if two stars have the same peak emission wavelength, they must have the same surface temperature.\n\n### Applying the Principles:\nThe problem provides the following information:\n*   The radius of Star 1 is 1.5 times that of Star 2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂).\n*   The wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same (λ_max,₁ = λ_max,₂).\n\nFrom Wien's Displacement Law, since the peak wavelengths are identical, the surface temperatures of the two stars must also be the same (T₁ = T₂).\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of their luminosities (L₁/L₂) using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n\nThe constants 4, π, and σ cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁²/R₂²) * (T₁⁴/T₂⁴)\n\nSince we established that T₁ = T₂, the temperature term (T₁⁴/T₂⁴) becomes 1. The equation further simplifies to:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = R₁² / R₂² = (R₁/R₂)²\n\nGiven that R₁/R₂ = 1.5, we can calculate the luminosity ratio:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n### Extraneous Information:\nThe information about the stars' masses and their radial velocities is not needed for this calculation. Luminosity is an intrinsic property of a star, determined by its radius and temperature. Radial velocity describes a star's motion toward or away from an observer and is related to the Doppler effect, but it does not affect the star's total energy output or luminosity.\n\nTherefore, the luminosity of Star 1 is greater than the luminosity of Star 2 by a factor of 2.25.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star radiating as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio:** We need to find the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 (L₁) and Star_2 (L₂).\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2.\n    R₁ = 1.5 * R₂  =>  R₁/R₂ = 1.5\n    Therefore, (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n4.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a star's surface temperature (T) to the peak wavelength (λ_max) of its emitted spectrum in its rest frame.\n    λ_max * T = b (where b is Wien's displacement constant)\n    This means T = b / λ_max, or T is inversely proportional to the rest-frame peak wavelength.\n    So, the temperature ratio is:\n    T₁/T₂ = λ_max,rest₂ / λ_max,rest₁\n\n5.  **Doppler Effect on Wavelength:** The problem states that astronomers measured the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared* brightest and found them to be the same. This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_max,obs), which is affected by the star's radial velocity (v) due to the Doppler effect. The relationship between the observed wavelength and the rest-frame wavelength (λ_max,rest) is:\n    λ_max,obs = λ_max,rest * (1 + v/c)\n    where c is the speed of light. A positive velocity indicates the star is moving away (redshift).\n\n6.  **Calculating Rest-Frame Wavelengths:**\n    *   **For Star_1:** The radial velocity is v₁ = 0 km/s.\n        λ_max,obs₁ = λ_max,rest₁ * (1 + 0/c) = λ_max,rest₁\n    *   **For Star_2:** The radial velocity is v₂ = 700 km/s = 7 x 10⁵ m/s.\n        λ_max,obs₂ = λ_max,rest₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n        So, λ_max,rest₂ = λ_max,obs₂ / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n7.  **Calculating Temperature Ratio:** We are given that the observed peak wavelengths are the same: λ_max,obs₁ = λ_max,obs₂.\n    Let's substitute the expressions for the rest-frame wavelengths into the temperature ratio equation from step 4:\n    T₁/T₂ = λ_max,rest₂ / λ_max,rest₁\n    T₁/T₂ = [λ_max,obs₂ / (1 + v₂/c)] / λ_max,obs₁\n    Since λ_max,obs₁ = λ_max,obs₂, they cancel out:\n    T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:** Now we substitute the radius ratio and the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio formula from step 2.\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\n    Now, let's plug in the values for v₂ and c (c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s):\n    v₂/c = (7 x 10⁵ m/s) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s) ≈ 0.002333\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.00937\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\n    This value is closest to 2.23.

Radius Ratio (R1 / R2):**\nThe problem states that \"Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2\".\nSo, R1 = 1.5 * R2, which means (R1 / R2) = 1.5.\n\n**2. Temperature Ratio (T1 / T2):**\nThe temperature of a star is related to the peak wavelength (λ_peak) of its emitted radiation by Wien's Displacement Law:\nT = b / λ_peak, where b is Wien's constant.\nThis means T is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength emitted by the star in its own rest frame (λ_rest).\nSo, T1 / T2 = (b / λ_rest,1) / (b / λ_rest,2) = λ_rest,2 / λ_rest,1.\n\nThe problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same for both stars: λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.\nWe must account for the Doppler effect, which relates the observed wavelength to the rest-frame wavelength:\nλ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light.\n\nFor Star_1: v_r1 = 0 km/s. There is no Doppler shift.\nλ_obs,1 = λ_rest,1 * (1 + 0/c) = λ_rest,1\n\nFor Star_2: v_r2 = 700 km/s. The light is redshifted.\nλ_obs,2 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v_r2 / c) = λ_rest,2 * (1 + 700/c)\n\nSince λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2, we can set the expressions equal:\nλ_rest,1 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + 700/c)\n\nNow we can find the ratio of the rest-frame wavelengths:\nλ_rest,2 / λ_rest,1 = 1 / (1 + 700/c)\n\nThis gives us the temperature ratio:\nT1 / T2 = λ_rest,2 / λ_rest,1 = 1 / (1 + 700/c)\n\n**3.

Therefore, the radius component of the ratio is:\n    `(R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25`\n\n4.  **Temperature Component:** This is the more complex part, involving Wien's Law and the Doppler effect.\n    *   **Wien's Law:** A star's temperature is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* light (λ_emitted): T ∝ 1/λ_emitted. Thus, `T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁`.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** Astronomers measure the *observed* wavelength (λ_obs), which is shifted due to the star's radial velocity (v).\n    *   **Star_1:** Has v₁ = 0, so its light is not shifted. Therefore, `λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁`.\n    *   **Star_2:** Has v₂ = 700 km/s. Its light is redshifted due to its recession. The relativistic Doppler shift formula is `λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * √[(1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c)]`.\n    *   **Connecting the two:** We are told the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (`λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂`).\n        `λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * √[(1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c)]`\n    *   **Finding the Temperature Ratio:** We can rearrange the equation above to find the ratio of emitted wavelengths, which gives us the temperature ratio:\n        `T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = √[(1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c)]`\n    *   We need this term to the fourth power for the luminosity calculation:\n        `(T₁/T₂)⁴ = (√[(1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c)])⁴ = [(1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c)]²`\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Now we combine the radius and temperature components.\n    `L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [(1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c)]²`\n    The python code you executed calculated this exact expression:\n    *   `v₂ = 700,000 m/s`\n    *   `c = 299,792,458 m/s`\n    *   The calculation yielded `2.22908325509156`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229. Rounding this to two decimal places gives 2.23.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nThe searches have confirmed the physical laws I intended to use:\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius and T is the surface temperature.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The peak emission wavelength (λ_max) of a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature (T).\n*   **Doppler Effect:** An object's motion towards or away from an observer shifts the wavelengths of its emitted light. The radial velocity can be calculated from this shift.\n\nThe core of the problem remains the interpretation of the phrase \"wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest.\"\n\n*   **Interpretation 1:** This refers to the intrinsic peak emission wavelength in the star's rest frame. In this case, since the wavelengths are the same, the temperatures are the same (T1 = T2). The velocity information is extraneous.\n*   **Interpretation 2:** This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength from Earth. In this case, the Doppler effect from Star 2's radial velocity must be accounted for.\n\nThe phrasing \"appeared brightest\" strongly suggests the observed property. Furthermore, the inclusion of the radial velocity data and a corresponding answer choice (C) makes it highly probable that this is the intended solution path. Problems in physics exams are often designed to test the application of multiple concepts, and Interpretation 2 does exactly that. Interpretation 1 ignores a key piece of information provided.\n\nTherefore, I will proceed with the more detailed calculation that incorporates the Doppler shift.\n\n**Calculation Steps:**\n\n1.  **Start with the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the ratio of luminosities:**\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n2.  **Use the given radius information:**\n    R₁ = 1.5 * R₂  =>  R₁/R₂ = 1.5\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n3.  **Determine the temperature ratio (T₁/T₂) using Wien's Law and the Doppler effect.**\n    *   Wien's Law states that temperature is inversely proportional to the rest-frame peak wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_rest). So, T₁/T₂ = λ_rest,₂ / λ_rest,₁.\n    *   The problem states the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n    *   For Star 1, radial velocity v₁ = 0, so there is no Doppler shift. Thus, λ_obs,₁ = λ_rest,₁.\n    *   For Star 2, radial velocity v₂ = 700 km/s. This causes a Doppler redshift. The observed wavelength is related to the rest wavelength by: λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c).\n    *   Therefore, λ_obs,₂ = λ_rest,₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Combining these facts: λ_rest,₁ = λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂ = λ_rest,₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   This gives us the ratio of the rest wavelengths: λ_rest,₂ / λ_rest,₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n4.  **Substitute the wavelength ratio into the temperature ratio:**\n    T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n5.  **Calculate the value of v₂/c:**\n    v₂ = 700 km/s\n    c = 300,000 km/s\n    v₂/c = 700 / 300,000 = 7/3000 ≈ 0.002333\n\n6.  **Substitute all values back into the luminosity ratio equation:**\n    L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + 7/3000)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 7/3000)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00935\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\n7.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    The calculated value of ~2.229 is closest to 2.23.\n\nThe information regarding the masses of the stars appears to be extraneous, as it is not needed for the calculation based on black body radiation laws.\n\nFinal conclusion is that the velocity information is crucial and leads to answer C.\n\nBased on a detailed analysis of the problem, the solution is derived by combining the Stefan-Boltzmann law, Wien's displacement law, and the formula for the Doppler effect.\n\nThe ratio of the luminosities (L) of the two stars is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n*   The radius of Star 1 is 1.5 times that of Star 2 (R₁/R₂ = 1.5).\n*   The radial velocity of Star 1 is 0 km/s, and for Star 2 it is 700 km/s.\n*   The stars are black bodies and the wavelengths at which they *appear* brightest are identical.\n\nThe key is to determine the ratio of the true surface temperatures (T₁/T₂) of the stars. The phrase \"appeared brightest\" refers to the observed peak wavelength (λ_obs). Since these are the same for both stars (λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂), we must account for the Doppler effect caused by Star 2's radial velocity.\n\n1.  **For Star 1 (v₁ = 0):** There is no Doppler shift, so its observed peak wavelength is the same as its rest-frame peak wavelength (λ_obs,₁ = λ_rest,₁).\n2.  **For Star 2 (v₂ = 700 km/s):** Its motion away from the observer causes a redshift. Its observed peak wavelength is related to its rest-frame wavelength by the Doppler shift formula: λ_obs,₂ = λ_rest,₂ * (1 + v₂/c), where c is the speed of light (≈ 300,000 km/s).\n\nSince λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂, we have:\nλ_rest,₁ = λ_rest,₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n\nAccording to Wien's Displacement Law, a star's temperature is inversely proportional to its rest-frame peak wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_rest). Therefore, the ratio of the temperatures is:\nT₁/T₂ = λ_rest,₂ / λ_rest,₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\nNow, we can substitute the known values into the luminosity ratio equation:\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + (700 km/s) / (300,000 km/s))]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 7/3000)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333...)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.00935...\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value rounds to 2.23. The information about the stars' masses is not needed for this calculation.\n\nTherefore, the luminosity of Star 1 is greater than that of Star 2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nTo determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we will use the fundamental laws of black-body radiation.\n\n### Key Principles\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: This law states that the luminosity (L) of a star, which is the total energy it radiates per second, is proportional to the square of its radius (R) and the fourth power of its surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n    *   L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    *   where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law**: This law relates the temperature of a black body to the wavelength (λ_max) at which it emits the most radiation. It states that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature.\n    *   λ_max * T = b\n    *   where b is Wien's constant.\n\n### Analysis of the Problem\n\nWe are given the following information:\n*   The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂).\n*   The mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times the mass of Star_2 (this information is not needed for this calculation).\n*   The wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same.\n*   The radial velocities are 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**1. Set up the Luminosity Ratio:**\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n**2. Use the Given Radius Ratio:**\nWe are given that R₁/R₂ = 1.5. Squaring this gives:\n(R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\nSo the equation becomes:\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n**3. Determine the Temperature Ratio:**\nThe problem states that \"astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same.\" In astronomical terms, \"determining\" a physical property like a star's peak emission wavelength implies that observational effects, such as the Doppler shift from radial velocity, have been corrected for. This means the intrinsic, or rest-frame, peak wavelengths (λ_max) of the two stars are equal.\n\nAccording to Wien's Law (λ_max * T = constant), if the peak wavelengths are the same (λ_max,₁ = λ_max,₂), then their surface temperatures must also be the same (T₁ = T₂).\n\nTherefore, the ratio of their temperatures is:\nT₁/T₂ = 1\n\nThe provided radial velocities are considered distractor information, as the phrasing implies that they have already been accounted for in the determination of the peak wavelength.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:**\nSubstitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (1)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25\n\nThus, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nThe provided information has been analyzed, and the initial calculation appears to be correct based on fundamental physics principles. The search results confirm the validity of the Stefan-Boltzmann law, Wien's Displacement Law, and the Doppler effect for light, which are the core concepts needed to solve this problem.\n\n**1. Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star is proportional to the square of its radius (R) and the fourth power of its surface temperature (T). The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴. This leads to the luminosity ratio:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n**2. Wien's Displacement Law:** This law connects a star's surface temperature (T) to the peak wavelength (λ_max) of its emitted light, where T is inversely proportional to λ_max. Importantly, this temperature is determined by the star's *rest* wavelength, not the wavelength observed from Earth if the star is in motion.\n\n**3. Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength of light from a star is affected by its radial velocity (its motion towards or away from us). For a star moving away, its light is \"redshifted,\" meaning the observed wavelength is longer than its rest wavelength. For a star with no radial velocity, the observed and rest wavelengths are the same.\n\nBased on the problem statement:\n*   The ratio of the radii (R₁/R₂) is 1.5.\n*   The *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂).\n*   Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, so its observed peak wavelength is equal to its rest peak wavelength (λ_obs₁ = λ_rest₁).\n*   Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s away from us, so its light is redshifted. The observed peak wavelength is longer than its rest wavelength: λ_obs₂ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v/c).\n\nFrom this, we deduce that the stars have different rest peak wavelengths and therefore different temperatures.\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n*   L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴ = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n*   From Wien's Law, T₁/T₂ = λ_rest₂ / λ_rest₁.\n*   We know λ_rest₁ = λ_obs₁ and since λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂, we have λ_rest₁ = λ_obs₂.\n*   We also have λ_obs₂ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v/c).\n*   Substituting λ_rest₁ for λ_obs₂ gives λ_rest₁ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v/c).\n*   This gives the ratio of rest wavelengths: λ_rest₂ / λ_rest₁ = 1 / (1 + v/c).\n*   Therefore, the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v/c).\n*   The luminosity ratio becomes L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + v/c)]⁴.\n*   Plugging in the values: L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / [1 + (700 km/s) / (300,000 km/s)]⁴\n*   L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 7/3000)⁴ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936 ≈ 2.229\n\nThis result is closest to 2.23. The mass information is extraneous to this calculation.\n\nThe luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to the luminosity of Star_2, which can be written as $L_1 / L_2$.\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Physical Laws**\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law relates a star's luminosity (L), radius (R), and surface temperature (T). Assuming the star is a spherical black body, the formula is:\n    $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a star's surface temperature (T) to the wavelength at which it emits the most light (its peak emitted wavelength, $\\lambda_{\\text{em,max}}$):\n    $\\lambda_{\\text{em,max}} * T = b$\n    where 'b' is Wien's displacement constant. This can be rearranged to $T = b / \\lambda_{\\text{em,max}}$.\n\n*   **Doppler Effect:** This effect describes how the observed wavelength of light changes due to the relative motion between the source and the observer. For speeds much less than the speed of light (c), the formula for the observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) is:\n    $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{em}}(1 + v_r/c)$\n    where $\\lambda_{\\text{em}}$ is the emitted wavelength and $v_r$ is the radial velocity (positive for motion away from the observer, negative for motion towards).\n\n**3. Set up the Luminosity Ratio**\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law for both stars:\n$L_1 = 4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4$\n$L_2 = 4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4$\n\nThe ratio is:\n$L_1 / L_2 = (4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4) = (R_1/R_2)^2 * (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n**4. Use the Given Information**\n*   **Radius Ratio:** We are given $R_1 = 1.5 * R_2$. So, $(R_1/R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\n*   **Peak Wavelengths:** We are told the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared* brightest are the same. This means their *observed* peak wavelengths are equal: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs,max,1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs,max,2}}$.\n*   **Radial Velocities:** $v_{r,1} = 0$ km/s and $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s. A positive velocity indicates the star is moving away from us (receding).\n*   **Mass information ($M_1 = 1.5 * M_2$):** This information is not needed for the black body calculation and is a distractor.\n\n**5. Determine the Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$)**\nThe temperature is related to the *emitted* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{em,max}}$) by Wien's Law. So, we first need to find the relationship between the emitted peak wavelengths of the two stars.\n\n*   For Star_1 ($v_{r,1} = 0$): Since it has no radial velocity, there is no Doppler shift.\n    $\\lambda_{\\text{obs,max,1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{em,max,1}}$\n\n*   For Star_2 ($v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s): Its light is redshifted because it is moving away.\n    $\\lambda_{\\text{obs,max,2}} = \\lambda_{\\text{em,max,2}} * (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n\nSince we know $\\lambda_{\\text{obs,max,1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs,max,2}}$, we can set the expressions for them to be equal:\n$\\lambda_{\\text{em,max,1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{em,max,2}} * (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n\nNow, from Wien's law, we know that $T_1 = b / \\lambda_{\\text{em,max,1}}$ and $T_2 = b / \\lambda_{\\text{em,max,2}}$. The ratio of their temperatures is:\n$T_1/T_2 = (b / \\lambda_{\\text{em,max,1}}) / (b / \\lambda_{\\text{em,max,2}}) = \\lambda_{\\text{em,max,2}} / \\lambda_{\\text{em,max,1}}$\n\nFrom our previous step, we can find this ratio:\n$\\lambda_{\\text{em,max,2}} / \\lambda_{\\text{em,max,1}} = 1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\nSo, $T_1/T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n\nThis shows that $T_1$ is slightly less than $T_2$.\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio**\nSubstitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n$L_1 / L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 * (T_1/T_2)^4$\n$L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 * [1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)]^4$\n$L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)^4$\n\nNow, plug in the values:\n*   $v_{r,2} = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 7 \\times 10^5 \\text{ m/s}$\n*   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$\n\n$v_{r,2}/c = (7 \\times 10^5) / (3 \\times 10^8) = 7/3000 \\approx 0.002333$\n\n$L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)^4$\n$L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / (1.002333)^4$\n$L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.25 / 1.00937$\n$L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.229$\n\nThis value rounds to 2.23.\n\n**Logical Check**\nSince Star_2 is moving away, its light is redshifted. For its observed peak wavelength to be the same as Star_1's, its emitted peak wavelength must be shorter. A shorter peak wavelength means a higher temperature (Wien's Law). So, $T_2 > T_1$. This means the factor $(T_1/T_2)^4$ is less than 1. Therefore, the final ratio $L_1/L_2$ must be less than $(R_1/R_2)^2 = 2.25$. Out of the given options, only 2.23 is less than 2.25.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nTo determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we can use the principles of black-body radiation. The crucial laws are the Stefan-Boltzmann Law and Wien's Displacement Law.\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: This law states that the total energy radiated per unit surface area of a black body is directly proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature (T). The total luminosity (L) of a star, which is assumed to be a spherical black body, also depends on its surface area (A = 4πR²). Therefore, the luminosity is given by the formula:\n    *   L = σ * A * T⁴ = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, R is the star's radius, and T is its surface temperature.\n\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law**: This law relates the temperature of a black body to the wavelength (λ_max) at which it emits the most radiation. The law states that λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature (T):\n    *   λ_max = b / T\n    where 'b' is Wien's displacement constant. This implies that objects with the same peak emission wavelength have the same surface temperature.\n\n**Applying the Concepts to the Stars**\n\nWe are given the following information:\n*   The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂).\n*   The wavelength of maximum brightness (λ_max) is the same for both stars.\n\nFrom Wien's Displacement Law, since both stars have the same λ_max, their surface temperatures must be equal (T₁ = T₂).\n\nNow, let's find the ratio of their luminosities (L₁ / L₂) using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n*   L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n\nSince the constants 4, π, and σ are the same for both, they cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n*   L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\nWe can now substitute the known ratios:\n*   The ratio of the radii is R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n*   The ratio of the temperatures is T₁/T₂ = 1.\n\nPlugging these values into the luminosity ratio equation:\n*   L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (1)⁴\n*   L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * 1\n*   L₁ / L₂ = 2.25\n\nThe information regarding the stars' masses and radial velocities is not needed for this calculation, as the luminosity of a black body is determined by its radius and surface temperature.\n\nTherefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the relationship between peak wavelength and temperature:** The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. According to Wien's Displacement Law for black bodies (λ_max = b/T, where λ_max is the peak wavelength, b is a constant, and T is the surface temperature), if the peak wavelengths are equal, their surface temperatures (T1 and T2) must also be equal.\n\n2.  **Analyze the relationship between luminosity, radius, and temperature:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it's a black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4 * π * R² * σ * T⁴, where R is the radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the surface temperature.\n\n3.  **Calculate the ratio of luminosities:** We need to find the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, which is the ratio L1 / L2.\n    *   L1 = 4 * π * R1² * σ * T1⁴\n    *   L2 = 4 * π * R2² * σ * T2⁴\n    *   The ratio is (4 * π * R1² * σ * T1⁴) / (4 * π * R2² * σ * T2⁴).\n\n4.  **Simplify the ratio:** Since the constants (4, π, σ) cancel out and we've established that T1 = T2, the temperature terms (T1⁴ and T2⁴) also cancel out. The equation simplifies to:\n    *   L1 / L2 = R1² / R2² = (R1 / R2)²\n\n5.  **Substitute the given values:** We are given that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2, so R1 / R2 = 1.5.\n\n6.  **Compute the final result:** Calculate (1.5)², which will give the luminosity ratio.

The key principles involved are:\n1.  The Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which relates a star's luminosity (L) to its radius (R) and surface temperature (T).\n2.  Wien's Displacement Law, which relates the surface temperature (T) of a star to the peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{max,em}$) at which it emits the most radiation.\n3.  The Doppler effect, which relates the observed wavelength of light ($\\lambda_{obs}$) to the emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{em}$) and the radial velocity ($v_r$) of the source.\n\n**Step 2: List the given information and identify any potential distractors.**\n*   Radius relation: $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2$\n*   Mass relation: $M_1 = 1.5 \\times M_2$ (This is a distractor. While mass, radius, and luminosity are related, the Stefan-Boltzmann law gives a more direct way to solve the problem with the given information).\n*   Observed peak wavelength: $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2}$. The phrase \"appeared brightest\" refers to the light as observed from Earth.\n*   Radial velocities: $v_{r,1} = 0$ km/s and $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s.\n*   Assumption: Stars radiate as black bodies.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the luminosity ratio using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law.**\nThe luminosity of a spherical black body is given by $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$, where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\nThe ratio of the luminosities is:\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$\n\n**Step 4: Substitute the known radius ratio.**\nWe are given $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$.\nSo, $(\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\nThe luminosity ratio becomes: $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$\n\n**Step 5: Determine the temperature ratio ($T_1/T_2$) by considering the observed peak wavelengths.**\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. Temperature is related to the *emitted* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{max,em}$) by Wien's Law: $T = b/\\lambda_{max,em}$, where $b$ is a constant. Therefore, $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{max,em,2}}{\\lambda_{max,em,1}}$.\n\nWe need to find the relationship between the emitted wavelengths using the given information about the *observed* wavelengths. The observed wavelength is affected by the Doppler shift: $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{em}(1 + \\frac{v_r}{c})$, where c is the speed of light.\n\n*   For Star_1: $v_{r,1} = 0$, so its observed peak wavelength is the same as its emitted one: $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, em, 1}$.\n*   For Star_2: $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s, so its observed peak wavelength is $\\lambda_{max, obs, 2} = \\lambda_{max, em, 2}(1 + \\frac{v_{r,2}}{c})$.\n\nThe problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2}$.\nTherefore, $\\lambda_{max, em, 1} = \\lambda_{max, em, 2}(1 + \\frac{v_{r,2}}{c})$.\n\nNow we can find the ratio of the emitted wavelengths: $\\frac{\\lambda_{max,em,2}}{\\lambda_{max,em,1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2}/c}$.\n\nSince $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{max,em,2}}{\\lambda_{max,em,1}}$, we have:\n$\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2}/c}$\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the numerical value of the temperature ratio.**\n*   $v_{r,2} = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 7 \\times 10^5 \\text{ m/s}$\n*   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$\n*   $\\frac{v_{r,2}}{c} = \\frac{7 \\times 10^5}{3 \\times 10^8} = \\frac{7}{3000}$\n*   $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + 7/3000} = \\frac{3000}{3007}$\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the final luminosity ratio.**\nSubstitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the equation from Step 4:\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4 = 2.25 \\times (\\frac{3000}{3007})^4$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$(\\frac{3000}{3007}) \\approx 0.997672$\n$(\\frac{3000}{3007})^4 \\approx (0.997672)^4 \\approx 0.99072$\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx 2.25 \\times 0.99072 \\approx 2.2291$\n\n**Step 8: Match the result to the given options.**\nThe calculated ratio is ~2.229, which rounds to 2.23. This matches option B.\n\n**Careful Point Summary:**\n*   Ignoring the Doppler effect would incorrectly assume $T_1 = T_2$, leading to an answer of 2.25 (Option C). This is a common trap.\n*   The mass information is irrelevant for this specific calculation method, which is based on fundamental radiation laws.\n*   The term \"appeared brightest\" must be interpreted as the observed property, not the intrinsic emitted property.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{700 \\text{ km/s}}{300000 \\text{ km/s}}}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1.002333...}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{1.009355...} \\approx 2.229$\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L1) to the luminosity of Star_2 (L2), which is L1 / L2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star that radiates as a perfect black body is determined by its surface area (A) and its surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n    L = σ * A * T⁴\n    where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Assuming the stars are spherical, their surface area is A = 4πR², where R is the radius.\n    So, the formula becomes:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n\n3.  **Set up the Luminosity Ratio:** We can write the expression for the luminosity of each star:\n    L1 = 4π(R1)²σ(T1)⁴\n    L2 = 4π(R2)²σ(T2)⁴\n    To find the ratio L1 / L2, we divide the first equation by the second. The constants 4, π, and σ cancel out:\n    L1 / L2 = [4π(R1)²σ(T1)⁴] / [4π(R2)²σ(T2)⁴] = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)⁴\n\n4.  **Incorporate the Given Information:**\n    *   **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that R1 = 1.5 * R2. Therefore, the ratio R1/R2 = 1.5. Squaring this gives (R1/R2)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n    *   **Temperature Ratio:** This requires more steps. We must relate the temperature to the given spectroscopic data (peak wavelength and radial velocity).\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio (T1/T2):**\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** For a black body, the temperature is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation (λ_emit). The law is T = b / λ_emit, where b is Wien's constant. From this, we can establish the temperature ratio:\n        T1 / T2 = (b / λ_emit,1) / (b / λ_emit,2) = λ_emit,2 / λ_emit,1\n    *   **Doppler Shift:** The wavelength we observe from Earth (λ_obs) can be different from the wavelength the star emits (λ_emit) if the star is moving towards or away from us. This is the Doppler effect. The formula for the non-relativistic Doppler shift is:\n        λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v_r / c)\n        where v_r is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light.\n    *   **Applying the Doppler Shift:**\n        -   For Star_1, v_r1 = 0 km/s. So, λ_obs,1 = λ_emit,1 * (1 + 0/c) = λ_emit,1.\n        -   For Star_2, v_r2 = 700 km/s (moving away, so the wavelength is redshifted). So, λ_obs,2 = λ_emit,2 * (1 + 700/c).\n    *   **Using the Observed Wavelength Data:** The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.\n        Therefore, we can set the two expressions equal:\n        λ_emit,1 = λ_emit,2 * (1 + 700/c)\n    *   **Finalizing the Temperature Ratio:** Now we can find the ratio λ_emit,2 / λ_emit,1 that we need for our temperature ratio calculation. By rearranging the equation above, we get:\n        λ_emit,2 / λ_emit,1 = 1 / (1 + 700/c)\n        Since T1/T2 = λ_emit,2 / λ_emit,1, we have:\n        T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + 700/c)\n\n6.  **Combine All Parts and Calculate:**\n    Now substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into our main luminosity ratio equation:\n    L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)⁴\n    L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + 700/c)]⁴\n    L1 / L2 = 2.25 / (1 + 700/c)⁴\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Using the speed of light c ≈ 299,792.458 km/s, we can compute the final value. The Python code execution provides the precise result.\n\n    The code calculated: `luminosity_ratio = 2.25 / ((1 + 700 / 299792.458)**4)`\n    The output was `2.2291075611484996`.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) ~2.23\n    B) ~2.32\n    C) ~2.35\n    D) ~2.25\n\n    The value 2.229 is closest to 2.23. The information about the mass of the stars was not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nTo solve this problem, we need to compare the luminosities of the two stars. The luminosity of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law.\n\n**1. Stefan-Boltzmann Law:**\nThe luminosity (L) of a star is related to its radius (R) and its surface temperature (T) by the following equation:\nL = 4πR²σT⁴\nwhere σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n**2. Luminosity Ratio:**\nTo find the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) is greater than that of Star_2 (L₂), we can set up a ratio:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n\nThe constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, leaving:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂) * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n**3. Radius Ratio:**\nThe problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2:\nR₁ = 1.5 * R₂  =>  R₁/R₂ = 1.5\nTherefore, (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n**4. Temperature Ratio:**\nTo find the temperature ratio, we use the information about the peak emission wavelengths. According to Wien's Displacement Law, the peak wavelength (λ_max) of a black body's emitted radiation is inversely proportional to its temperature (T).\n\nThe problem states that the \"wavelengths at which the stars *appeared* brightest\" are the same. This implies that the observed peak wavelengths are identical. The observed wavelength is affected by the star's radial velocity due to the Doppler effect.\n\n*   **For Star_1:** The radial velocity is 0 km/s, so there is no Doppler shift. The observed peak wavelength (λ_obs,1) is equal to its intrinsic peak wavelength (λ_rest,1).\n*   **For Star_2:** The radial velocity is 700 km/s. This motion causes a redshift, meaning the light waves are stretched to longer wavelengths. The observed wavelength (λ_obs,2) is related to the intrinsic wavelength (λ_rest,2) by the formula for non-relativistic speeds:\n    λ_obs,2 ≈ λ_rest,2 * (1 + v/c)\n    where v = 700 km/s and c is the speed of light (~300,000 km/s).\n\nSince the observed wavelengths are the same (λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2):\nλ_rest,1 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v/c)\n\nFrom Wien's Law (λ_rest = b/T, where b is a constant), we can substitute temperature into the equation:\nb/T₁ = (b/T₂) * (1 + v/c)\n1/T₁ = (1/T₂) * (1 + v/c)\nThis gives us the temperature ratio:\nT₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v/c)\n\n**5. Final Calculation:**\nNow we substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + v/c)]⁴\n\nLet's plug in the values:\nv/c = 700 km/s / 300,000 km/s ≈ 0.002333\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.009366\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23.

For a star moving away (receding), its light is redshifted:\n        λ_obs_max = λ_rest_max * (1 + v/c), where c is the speed of light.\n    *   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same for both stars: λ_obs_max₁ = λ_obs_max₂.\n    *   For **Star_1**: Its radial velocity is 0 km/s. Therefore, its observed wavelength is its rest wavelength: λ_obs_max₁ = λ_rest_max₁. Its temperature is T₁ = b / λ_rest_max₁.\n    *   For **Star_2**: Its radial velocity is v₂ = 700 km/s. Its light is redshifted. The rest wavelength is λ_rest_max₂ = λ_obs_max₂ / (1 + v₂/c). Its temperature is T₂ = b / λ_rest_max₂ = b * (1 + v₂/c) / λ_obs_max₂.\n    *   Since λ_obs_max₁ = λ_obs_max₂, we find the relationship between the temperatures:\n        T₂ = T₁ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of their temperatures is:\n        T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: Now, substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n\n    Using the given values:\n    *   v₂ = 700 km/s\n    *   c (speed of light) ≈ 300,000 km/s\n    *   v₂/c = 700 / 300,000 = 7 / 3000 ≈ 0.002333\n\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 0.002333)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.00936\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23.

The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law states that the wavelength at which a black body is brightest (λ_max) is inversely proportional to its temperature (T). The formula is λ_max = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's constant.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n1.  **Temperature Comparison:** The problem states that the wavelengths at which the two stars appear brightest are the same (λ_max,1 = λ_max,2). According to Wien's Displacement Law, since λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature, if the peak wavelengths are identical, their surface temperatures must also be identical (T1 = T2).\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio:** To find the ratio of the luminosities (L1 / L2), we can set up a ratio using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law for each star.\n    *   L1 = 4π(R1)²σ(T1)⁴\n    *   L2 = 4π(R2)²σ(T2)⁴\n\n    By dividing the first equation by the second, the constants (4, π, and σ) cancel out:\n    L1 / L2 = [(R1)²(T1)⁴] / [(R2)²(T2)⁴]\n\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    L1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)² * (T1 / T2)⁴\n\n3.  **Substituting Known Values:**\n    *   From the problem, we know that the radius of Star 1 is 1.5 times that of Star 2, so R1 / R2 = 1.5.\n    *   From our analysis using Wien's Law, we know the temperatures are equal, so T1 / T2 = 1.\n\n    Substituting these values into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * (1)⁴\n    L1 / L2 = 2.25 * 1\n    L1 / L2 = 2.25\n\nThe information regarding the stars' masses and radial velocities is not relevant to this specific calculation, which is based on the assumption that the stars radiate as black bodies.\n\nThe luminosity of Star 1 is greater than the luminosity of Star 2 by a factor of 2.25.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 (L₁ / L₂).\n\n**1.

Therefore:\n    `R1 / R2 = 1.5`\n\n5.  **Temperature Ratio:** This requires combining Wien's Displacement Law and the Doppler effect.\n    *   **Wien's Law:** A star's temperature is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength it *emits* (`λ_emitted`): `T ∝ 1 / λ_emitted`. This means `T1 / T2 = λ_emitted2 / λ_emitted1`.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The problem states the peak wavelengths *appear* the same (`λ_observed1 = λ_observed2`). The observed wavelength is affected by the star's radial velocity (`v_r`).\n    *   For Star_1, `v_r1 = 0`, so there is no Doppler shift. Its observed wavelength is its emitted wavelength: `λ_observed1 = λ_emitted1`.\n    *   For Star_2, `v_r2 = 700 km/s`. This motion away from us causes a redshift, so `λ_observed2 = λ_emitted2 * (1 + v_r2 / c)`.\n    *   Since `λ_observed1 = λ_observed2`, we have `λ_emitted1 = λ_emitted2 * (1 + v_r2 / c)`.\n    *   Now we can find the temperature ratio: `T1 / T2 = λ_emitted2 / λ_emitted1 = λ_emitted2 / (λ_emitted2 * (1 + v_r2 / c)) = 1 / (1 + v_r2 / c)`.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the radius and temperature ratios into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    `L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * (1 / (1 + v_r2 / c))⁴`\n    Using the provided values (`v_r2 = 700 km/s`) and the speed of light (`c`), we perform the calculation. The code execution provides the precise result.\n\n    The code output `2.229107561148499` is the numerical solution. When we compare this value to the given options:\n    *   A) ~2.23\n    *   B) ~2.25\n    *   C) ~2.35\n    *   D) ~2.32\n\n    The calculated result, `2.229...`, rounds to `2.23`.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nThe problem has been solved. The detailed derivation and calculation have been performed in previous turns. Here is a final summary of the logic.\n\n**Summary of Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio:** The ratio of luminosities for two blackbody stars is given by `L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4`. We are given `R1/R2 = 1.5`, so this becomes `L1 / L2 = 2.25 * (T1/T2)^4`.\n2.  **Temperature Ratio:** The key is to find the ratio of the true surface temperatures (`T1/T2`). We are told the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (`λ_obs1 = λ_obs2`).\n3.  **Doppler Shift:** Star_1 has zero velocity, so its observed peak wavelength is its true emitted wavelength (`λ_obs1 = λ_emit1`). Star_2 is moving away at `v2 = 700 km/s`, so its emitted light is redshifted. Its observed wavelength is `λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c)`.\n4.  **Connecting Wavelengths and Temperatures:** Since `λ_obs1 = λ_obs2`, it follows that `λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c)`. Using Wien's Law (`λ_emit ∝ 1/T`), we find that `1/T1 ∝ (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c)`, which simplifies to `T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)`.\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Substituting the temperature ratio into the luminosity ratio gives `L1 / L2 = 2.25 / (1 + v2/c)^4`. Using `v2 = 700 km/s` and `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`, the calculation yields a value of approximately `2.229`.\n\nThis result corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nThe ratio of the luminosities of two stars radiating as black bodies is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁ / R₂)² * (T₁ / T₂)⁴\n\nWe need to determine the ratios (R₁ / R₂) and (T₁ / T₂).\n\n**1. Radius Ratio**\nThe problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2:\nR₁ = 1.5 * R₂\nTherefore, the ratio of the radii squared is:\n(R₁ / R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n**2. Temperature Ratio**\nThe temperature is related to the peak emission wavelength by Wien's Displacement Law:\nT = b / λ_emitted_max\nwhere 'b' is a constant and λ_emitted_max is the wavelength emitted by the star at its rest frame.\nThe ratio of the temperatures is:\nT₁ / T₂ = (b / λ_emitted_max,₁) / (b / λ_emitted_max,₂) = λ_emitted_max,₂ / λ_emitted_max,₁\n\nThe problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (λ_obs_max,₁ = λ_obs_max,₂). The observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength by the Doppler effect:\nλ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r / c)\nwhere v_r is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light.\n\nFor Star_1: v_r,₁ = 0 km/s.\nλ_obs_max,₁ = λ_emitted_max,₁ * (1 + 0/c) = λ_emitted_max,₁\n\nFor Star_2: v_r,₂ = 700 km/s.\nλ_obs_max,₂ = λ_emitted_max,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂ / c)\n\nSince λ_obs_max,₁ = λ_obs_max,₂:\nλ_emitted_max,₁ = λ_emitted_max,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂ / c)\n\nNow we can find the ratio of emitted wavelengths needed for the temperature ratio:\nλ_emitted_max,₂ / λ_emitted_max,₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂ / c)\n\nTherefore, the temperature ratio is:\nT₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂ / c)\n\n**3.

This relates luminosity to the star's radius (R) and its surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n    *   L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    *   Where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio**: To find the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars (L₁/L₂), we can set up the following equation:\n    *   L₁/L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). Therefore, the ratio of their radii squared is:\n    *   (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio**: To find the temperature ratio, we use the information that the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared brightest* are the same.

This peak wavelength is related to the star's surface temperature by Wien's Displacement Law.\n    *   The information on radial velocities is crucial here. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, so its observed peak wavelength (λ_obs,₁) is the same as its emitted peak wavelength (λ_emit,₁).\n    *   Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, meaning it is moving away from the observer. This causes its emitted light to be redshifted due to the Doppler effect. The observed wavelength is longer than the emitted wavelength. For non-relativistic speeds, the formula is λ_obs ≈ λ_emit * (1 + v/c).\n    *   Since λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂, we can write: λ_emit,₁ = λ_emit,₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n\n5.  **Connecting Temperature and Wavelength**: Wien's Law states that the emitted peak wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature (λ_emit = b/T), where 'b' is Wien's constant.

However, the problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same. This requires us to account for the Doppler effect caused by the stars' radial velocities.\n\n*   We are given that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore, the radius ratio squared is (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n*   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0 km/s. There is no Doppler shift, so its observed peak wavelength (λ_obs,1) is equal to its emitted peak wavelength (λ_emitted,1).\n*   For Star_2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. This motion away from us causes its light to be redshifted, so its observed peak wavelength is longer than its emitted wavelength.

Its observed wavelength is: $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{emitted,2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n\n    Since we are given $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we can write:\n    $\\lambda_{emitted,1} = \\lambda_{emitted,2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n\n    Now we can find the ratio of the temperatures:\n    $T_1/T_2 = (\\lambda_{emitted,2}) / (\\lambda_{emitted,1})$\n    Substituting the expression for $\\lambda_{emitted,1}$:\n    $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{emitted,2} / [\\lambda_{emitted,2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)] = 1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Now we substitute the radius and temperature ratios into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (2.25) \\times [1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)]^4 = 2.25 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)^4$\n\n    Let's plug in the values:\n    *   $v_{r,2} = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 7 \\times 10^5 \\text{ m/s}$\n    *   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$\n    *   $v_{r,2}/c = (7 \\times 10^5) / (3 \\times 10^8) \\approx 0.002333$\n\n    Now, calculate the final ratio:\n    $L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)^4$\n    $L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.25 / (1.002333)^4$\n    $L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.25 / 1.00936$\n    $L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.229$\n\n    This value is closest to 2.23.

Therefore, the ratio of their radii squared is:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio**: To find the temperature ratio (T₁/T₂), we use Wien's Displacement Law and account for the Doppler effect.\n    *   **Wien's Law**: This law relates a star's temperature to the peak wavelength (λ_rest) of its emitted light in its own rest frame: λ_rest = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's constant. This means T = b/λ_rest.\n    *   **Doppler Effect**: The observed wavelength (λ_obs) is shifted due to the star's radial velocity (v). For non-relativistic speeds, the formula is λ_obs ≈ λ_rest(1 + v/c), where 'c' is the speed of light. A positive velocity indicates the star is moving away (redshift).\n\n5.  **Applying the Information**:\n    *   The problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same for both stars: λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0 km/s, so its observed wavelength is the same as its rest wavelength: λ_obs,₁ = λ_rest,₁.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. Its observed wavelength is redshifted: λ_obs,₂ = λ_rest,₂(1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂, we have: λ_rest,₁ = λ_rest,₂(1 + v₂/c).\n\n6.  **Connecting to Temperature**: Now we substitute Wien's Law (λ_rest = b/T) into the equation from the previous step:\n    b/T₁ = (b/T₂)(1 + v₂/c)\n    By simplifying, we can find the ratio of the temperatures:\n    1/T₁ = (1/T₂)(1 + v₂/c)\n    T₂/T₁ = 1 + v₂/c\n    T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n7.  **Calculation**: Now, we plug in the values for the velocity of Star_2 (v₂ = 700 km/s) and the speed of light (c ≈ 300,000 km/s):\n    *   v₂/c = 700 km/s / 300,000 km/s ≈ 0.002333\n    *   T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + 0.002333) ≈ 0.99767\n    *   (T₁/T₂)⁴ ≈ (0.99767)⁴ ≈ 0.9907\n\n8.  **Final Luminosity Ratio Calculation**: Finally, we substitute the ratios for the radii and temperatures back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * 0.9907\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23.

The formula is `L = 4 * π * R² * σ * T⁴`. For a ratio, this simplifies to `L1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)² * (T1 / T2)⁴`.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The surface temperature (T) of a star is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation (`λ_emitted`). So, `T ∝ 1 / λ_emitted`. This means `T1 / T2 = λ_emitted_2 / λ_emitted_1`.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength (`λ_observed`) is different from the *emitted* wavelength (`λ_emitted`) if the star is moving. The formula for redshift (moving away) is `λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c)`, where `v` is the radial velocity and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n3.  **Connect the Information:**\n    *   We are given the radius ratio: `R1 / R2 = 1.5`.\n    *   We are told the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: `λ_observed_1 = λ_observed_2`.\n    *   Star 1 has zero velocity (`v1 = 0`), so its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted wavelength: `λ_observed_1 = λ_emitted_1`.\n    *   Star 2 is moving away (`v2 = 700 km/s`), so its observed wavelength is redshifted: `λ_observed_2 = λ_emitted_2 * (1 + v2/c)`.\n    *   By combining these, we find the relationship between the emitted wavelengths: `λ_emitted_1 = λ_emitted_2 * (1 + v2/c)`.\n    *   Now, we can find the temperature ratio: `T1 / T2 = λ_emitted_2 / λ_emitted_1 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:**\n    *   Substitute the radius and temperature ratios into the luminosity ratio formula: `L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * (1 / (1 + v2/c))⁴`.\n    *   I will perform this calculation using Python to get a precise result and compare it to the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given values and constants.\n# The ratio of the radii of Star_1 to Star_2.\nradius_ratio = 1.5\n# The radial velocity of Star_2 in km/s.

The key physical laws are:\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law relates a star's luminosity (L) to its radius (R) and surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a star's surface temperature (T) to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (its peak wavelength, λ_max). This law applies to the radiation as it is emitted by the star (in its rest frame). The formula is:\n    λ_max_rest * T = b\n    where 'b' is Wien's displacement constant.\n3.  **Doppler Effect for Light:** This effect describes the change in the observed wavelength of light due to the relative motion between the source and the observer. For a source moving with a radial velocity 'v' (positive if moving away, negative if moving towards), the observed wavelength (λ_obs) is related to the rest-frame emitted wavelength (λ_rest) by:\n    λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c)\n    (This is the non-relativistic approximation, which is valid here since 700 km/s is much less than the speed of light, c).\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the luminosity ratio**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) to that of Star_2 (L₂).\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\nL₁ = 4πR₁²σT₁⁴\nL₂ = 4πR₂²σT₂⁴\n\nThe ratio is:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\nThe constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, leaving:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n**Step 3: Determine the radius ratio (R₁/R₂)**\n\nThe problem explicitly states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2.\nR₁ = 1.5 * R₂\nTherefore, the radius ratio is:\nR₁ / R₂ = 1.5\n\n**Step 4: Determine the temperature ratio (T₁/T₂)**\n\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. We need to relate the temperatures using the information about their peak wavelengths and velocities.\n*   The problem states that \"the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest... are the same.\" This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs). So, λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.\n*   We use the Doppler formula to relate the observed wavelength to the rest-frame wavelength for each star.\n    *   For Star_1: v₁ = 0 km/s. So, λ_obs1 = λ_rest1 * (1 + 0/c) = λ_rest1.\n    *   For Star_2: v₂ = 700 km/s. So, λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n*   Since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, we can set the two expressions equal:\n    λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v₂/c)\n*   Now, we use Wien's Law, which connects temperature to the *rest-frame* wavelength:\n    T₁ = b / λ_rest1\n    T₂ = b / λ_rest2\n*   The ratio of the temperatures is therefore:\n    T₁ / T₂ = (b / λ_rest1) / (b / λ_rest2) = λ_rest2 / λ_rest1\n*   Substitute the relationship we found from the Doppler effect:\n    T₁ / T₂ = λ_rest2 / [λ_rest2 * (1 + v₂/c)] = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The mass information (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is extraneous and not needed for this calculation, which is based on black body radiation principles.\n*   It is crucial to distinguish between the *observed* peak wavelength and the *rest-frame* peak wavelength. Wien's Law applies to the rest-frame wavelength, while the observation is of the Doppler-shifted wavelength. The radial velocity information is essential to connect the two.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final luminosity ratio**\n\nNow we substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into our luminosity ratio formula:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n\nLet's plug in the values:\n*   (1.5)² = 2.25\n*   v₂ = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s\n*   c (speed of light) ≈ 299,792,458 m/s\n\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 700,000 / 299,792,458)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 0.00233495)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / 1.00233495]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (0.9976706)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * 0.99072\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.22912\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.

The luminosity (L) of a star is given by the formula:\n\nL = 4πR²σT⁴\n\nWhere:\n*   **R** is the radius of the star.\n*   **σ** (sigma) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **T** is the effective surface temperature of the star.\n\nWe can set up a ratio of the luminosities of the two stars:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n\nThe constants (4, π, and σ) cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have the following information:\n*   The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂), so R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n*   The wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same.\n*   The radial velocity of Star_1 is 0 km/s, and for Star_2 it is 700 km/s.\n\nThe fact that the stars \"appeared\" brightest at the same wavelength implies that their *observed* peak wavelengths are identical. This observation is affected by the Doppler effect due to the stars' radial velocities. The light from Star_2, which is moving away from us, is redshifted, meaning its observed wavelength is longer than its intrinsic (source) wavelength.\n\nThe relationship between the observed peak wavelength (λ_obs) and the source peak wavelength (λ_source) is given by the Doppler shift formula. For non-relativistic speeds (as 700 km/s is much less than the speed of light), this is:\n\nλ_obs = λ_source * (1 + v/c)\n\nWhere **v** is the radial velocity and **c** is the speed of light.\n\nFor our stars:\n*   Star_1: v₁ = 0, so λ_obs,₁ = λ_source,₁\n*   Star_2: v₂ = 700 km/s, so λ_obs,₂ = λ_source,₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n\nSince λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂, we have:\nλ_source,₁ = λ_source,₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n\nNext, we use Wien's Displacement Law, which relates a star's surface temperature to its intrinsic peak emission wavelength: λ_source = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's constant. This means that the temperature is inversely proportional to the source wavelength (T = b/λ_source).\n\nThe ratio of the temperatures of the two stars is therefore:\nT₁ / T₂ = (b/λ_source,₁) / (b/λ_source,₂) = λ_source,₂ / λ_source,₁\n\nFrom our Doppler-derived relation, we can find this wavelength ratio:\nλ_source,₂ / λ_source,₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\nSo, the temperature ratio is:\nT₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\nNow we can substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into our luminosity ratio equation:\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\nFinally, we calculate the numerical value:\n*   v₂ = 700 km/s\n*   c ≈ 300,000 km/s\n*   v₂/c = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333\n\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.009365\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23.

This velocity causes a Doppler shift in the observed wavelength. The problem also states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (λ_obs_max₁ = λ_obs_max₂).\n        The relationship between the observed wavelength (λ_obs) and the rest-frame wavelength (λ_rest) for a velocity much smaller than the speed of light (c) is:\n        λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v/c)\n\n    *   For Star_1 (v₁ = 0): λ_obs_max₁ = λ_rest_max₁\n    *   For Star_2 (v₂ = 700 km/s): λ_obs_max₂ = λ_rest_max₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n\n    *   Since λ_obs_max₁ = λ_obs_max₂, we have:\n        λ_rest_max₁ = λ_rest_max₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n\n    *   Now we can find the ratio of the rest-frame wavelengths:\n        λ_rest_max₂ / λ_rest_max₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: Now substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n\n    Let's plug in the values:\n    *   v₂ = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s\n    *   c (speed of light) ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   v₂/c = 700,000 / 300,000,000 ≈ 0.002333\n\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 0.002333)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.00937\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23.

The solution involves applying the Stefan-Boltzmann law and accounting for the Doppler effect on the observed wavelengths.\n\n### Key Principles:\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is related to its radius (R) and surface temperature (T). The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law**: This law states that the peak emission wavelength (λ_max) of a black body is inversely proportional to its absolute temperature (T). This relationship pertains to the wavelength emitted by the star in its own rest frame.\n3.  **Doppler Effect**: The wavelength of light observed from a moving source is shifted. For a source moving with a radial velocity (v_r) relative to an observer, the observed wavelength (λ_obs) is related to the emitted wavelength (λ_emitted) by the non-relativistic formula λ_obs ≈ λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c), where c is the speed of light. A positive velocity indicates the source is receding.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio**: From the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴.\n\n2.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). Therefore, the ratio of their radii squared is:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n3.  **Temperature Ratio**: The temperature ratio is determined using Wien's Law, which connects temperature to the *emitted* peak wavelength. The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same for both stars (λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂). We must use the Doppler effect to relate these observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths.\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0 km/s, so there is no Doppler shift. The observed wavelength is equal to the emitted wavelength: λ_emitted₁ = λ_obs₁.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. The observed wavelength is Doppler-shifted: λ_obs₂ = λ_emitted₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂, we can write: λ_emitted₁ = λ_emitted₂ * (1 + 700 km/s / 300,000 km/s) = λ_emitted₂ * (1 + 7/3000).\n\n4.  **Connecting to Temperature**: According to Wien's Law, temperature is inversely proportional to the emitted peak wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_emitted). The ratio of the temperatures is therefore:\n    T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted₂ / λ_emitted₁ = λ_emitted₂ / [λ_emitted₂ * (1 + 7/3000)] = 1 / (1 + 7/3000) = 3000/3007.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: Now, substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * (3000/3007)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 * (0.99767)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 * 0.99073\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis result is approximately 2.23. The information about the masses of the stars is not needed for this calculation and serves as a distractor.\n\nThe luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to determine the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 (`L1 / L2`).\n\n**2. Identify Key Physical Principles**\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law relates a star's luminosity (L) to its radius (R) and surface temperature (T). The formula is `L = 4πR²σT⁴`, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law connects the surface temperature (T) of a black body to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (`λ_emitted`). The formula is `λ_emitted * T = b`, where b is Wien's constant. This implies that `T` is inversely proportional to `λ_emitted`.\n*   **Relativistic Doppler Effect:** This effect describes how the observed wavelength of light (`λ_obs`) changes due to the relative motion between the source and the observer. For an object moving with a radial velocity `v`, the observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength (`λ_emitted`) by the formula: `λ_obs = λ_emitted * sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))`, where `c` is the speed of light. A positive `v` indicates the object is moving away (redshift).\n\n**3. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law for both stars:\n`L1 = 4π(R1)²σ(T1)⁴`\n`L2 = 4π(R2)²σ(T2)⁴`\n\nThe ratio `L1 / L2` is:\n`L1 / L2 = (4π(R1)²σ(T1)⁴) / (4π(R2)²σ(T2)⁴)`\n\nThe constants `4π` and `σ` cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n`L1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)² * (T1 / T2)⁴`\n\n**4. Determine the Radius and Temperature Ratios**\n\n*   **Radius Ratio (`R1 / R2`):**\n    The problem states that `R1 = 1.5 * R2`. Therefore, `R1 / R2 = 1.5`.\n\n*   **Temperature Ratio (`T1 / T2`):**\n    From Wien's Law, temperature is inversely proportional to the emitted peak wavelength (`T ∝ 1/λ_emitted`). So, the temperature ratio is `T1 / T2 = λ_emitted_2 / λ_emitted_1`.\n    We need to find the ratio of the *emitted* wavelengths. We are given that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: `λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2`.\n\n    *   **For Star_1:** The radial velocity `v1 = 0`. With no velocity, there is no Doppler shift. Thus, `λ_obs_1 = λ_emitted_1`.\n    *   **For Star_2:** The radial velocity `v2 = 700 km/s`. This star is moving, so its light is Doppler shifted.\n        `λ_obs_2 = λ_emitted_2 * sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c))`\n\n    Since `λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2`, we can set the expressions equal:\n    `λ_emitted_1 = λ_emitted_2 * sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c))`\n\n    Now, we can find the ratio of emitted wavelengths needed for our temperature calculation:\n    `λ_emitted_2 / λ_emitted_1 = 1 / sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c)) = sqrt((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))`\n\n    Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n    `T1 / T2 = sqrt((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))`\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio**\nSubstitute the expressions for the radius and temperature ratios back into our main equation:\n`L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * [sqrt((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))]⁴`\n\nThe square root and the power of 4 simplify:\n`L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * ((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))²`\n\nNow, we plug in the numerical values:\n*   `R1 / R2 = 1.5`\n*   `v2 = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s`\n*   `c ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s`\n\nThe calculation performed by the Python script was:\n`L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * ((1 - 700000/299792458) / (1 + 700000/299792458))²`\n`L1 / L2 ≈ 2.25 * (0.9907)`\n`L1 / L2 ≈ 2.2291`\n\nRounding this result to two decimal places gives **2.23**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe code output provided is `2.2291075611484996`.\n\nThis result is obtained from the derived formula for the luminosity ratio:\n$L_1 / L_2 = (R_1 / R_2)^2 * (1 + v_{r2} / c)^{-4}$\n\nPlugging in the values:\n*   $R_1 / R_2 = 1.5$\n*   $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s\n*   $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s (speed of light)\n\n$L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 * (1 + 700 / 300000)^{-4}$\n$L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * (1.002333...)^{-4}$\n$L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.25 * 0.99071447$\n$L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.229107...$\n\nThis calculated value, `2.2291...`, is closest to the option B) ~2.23.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to the luminosity of Star_2, which can be written as $L_1 / L_2$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is determined by its radius (R) and surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n        $L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n        where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates the surface temperature (T) of a black body to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation ($\\lambda_{emit}$). The formula is:\n        $\\lambda_{emit} = b / T$\n        where b is Wien's constant. This implies that $T$ is inversely proportional to $\\lambda_{emit}$.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) of light from a moving source is shifted relative to the emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{emit}$). The formula for this shift is:\n        $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emit} (1 + v_r / c)$\n        where $v_r$ is the radial velocity of the source (positive if moving away) and c is the speed of light.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    We can write the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars using the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4)$\n    The constants ($4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$) cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1 / R_2)^2 \\times (T_1 / T_2)^4$\n\n4.  **Incorporate the Given Information:**\n    *   **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2$, so the ratio $R_1 / R_2 = 1.5$.\n    *   **Temperature Ratio:** This is the most complex part. We need to find the ratio $T_1 / T_2$. We can do this by relating temperature to the peak wavelength. From Wien's Law, $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{emit}$, which means:\n        $T_1 / T_2 = \\lambda_{emit,2} / \\lambda_{emit,1}$\n\n5.  **Relate Emitted and Observed Wavelengths:**\n    We are given that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$. We need to find the *emitted* wavelengths using the Doppler effect.\n    *   For Star_1: $v_{r1} = 0$. So, $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{emit,1} (1 + 0/c) = \\lambda_{emit,1}$.\n    *   For Star_2: $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s. So, $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{emit,2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n\n6.  **Solve for the Temperature Ratio:**\n    Since $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we can set the two expressions equal:\n    $\\lambda_{emit,1} = \\lambda_{emit,2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n    Now, we rearrange this to find the ratio of emitted wavelengths, which we need for the temperature ratio:\n    $\\lambda_{emit,2} / \\lambda_{emit,1} = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n    Since $T_1 / T_2 = \\lambda_{emit,2} / \\lambda_{emit,1}$, we have:\n    $T_1 / T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:**\n    Now we substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into our luminosity ratio equation from step 3:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 \\times [1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)]^4$\n    $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)^4$\n\n8.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation:**\n    We need to plug in the values for $v_{r2}$ and $c$.\n    *   $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s = $700,000$ m/s\n    *   $c$ (speed of light) = $299,792,458$ m/s\n    The calculation is best done with a script to maintain precision.\n\n```python\n# Define the given values and constants\nR_ratio = 1.5  # R1/R2\nvr2 = 700 * 1000  # Radial velocity of Star 2 in m/s\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# From the Doppler shift and Wien's Law, we derived the temperature ratio:\n# T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + vr2/c)\nT_ratio = 1 / (1 + vr2 / c)\n\n# The luminosity ratio is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n# L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\nL_ratio = (R_ratio**2) * (T_ratio**4)\n\nprint(L_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n2.229200280092933\n</execute_result>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 2.2292.

This law relates temperature to the *intrinsic* peak wavelength.\n-   **Doppler Effect**: The observed wavelength of a source is shifted depending on its radial velocity relative to the observer. A positive radial velocity (moving away) causes a redshift (increase in wavelength). The non-relativistic formula is v/c = Δλ/λ_rest or λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c).\n\nThe key to the problem remains the interpretation of \"the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest... are the same.\" As reasoned before, \"appeared\" refers to the observed wavelength (λ_obs). The inclusion of the specific radial velocity for Star 2 (700 km/s) and a zero velocity for Star 1 strongly suggests this information is intended to be used to correct the observed peak wavelength to the intrinsic peak wavelength, which is then used in Wien's Law to find the temperature.\n\nThe calculation I performed seems correct.\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio**: L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n2.  **Given Radius Ratio**: R₁/R₂ = 1.5, so (R₁/R₂)² = 2.25.\n3.  **Temperature Ratio from Wien's Law**: T₁/T₂ = λ_rest₂ / λ_rest₁\n4.  **Wavelengths from Doppler Effect**:\n    *   λ_obs₁ = λ_rest₁ (since v₁ = 0)\n    *   λ_obs₂ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v₂/c) (assuming redshift for positive velocity)\n5.  **Equating Observed Wavelengths**: λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂ => λ_rest₁ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n6.  **Finding Wavelength Ratio**: λ_rest₂ / λ_rest₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n7.  **Substituting into Temperature Ratio**: T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n8.  **Final Calculation**:\n    *   v₂/c = 700 km/s / 300,000 km/s ≈ 0.002333\n    *   L₁/L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 0.002333)]⁴\n    *   L₁/L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936 ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23.

Option D (2.25) would be the answer if the Doppler shift were ignored. The small difference between C and D is the key, and the provided radial velocity data allows for this distinction.\n\nThe luminosity of a star is determined by its radius and surface temperature, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The ratio of the luminosities of two stars is therefore dependent on the ratio of their radii and the ratio of their surface temperatures.\n\nThe key steps to solving this problem are:\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star radiating as a black body is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio**: For Star 1 and Star 2, the ratio of their luminosities is L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)²(T₁/T₂)⁴.\n3.  **Radius Information**: We are given that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂, so (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n4.  **Wien's Displacement Law**: This law relates the star's surface temperature to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (its peak wavelength, λ_max). Specifically, T is inversely proportional to the *intrinsic* (or rest-frame) peak wavelength (λ_rest). Therefore, the ratio of the temperatures is T₁/T₂ = λ_rest₂/λ_rest₁.\n5.  **Doppler Effect**: The problem states that the stars *appeared* brightest at the same wavelength. This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs), which is affected by the star's motion relative to the observer. The relationship between the observed and rest wavelength is given by the Doppler shift formula. For non-relativistic speeds, λ_obs = λ_rest(1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity (positive for motion away from the observer).\n6.  **Applying the Data**:\n    *   For Star 1, the radial velocity is 0, so its observed peak wavelength is equal to its rest peak wavelength: λ_obs₁ = λ_rest₁.\n    *   For Star 2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. Its observed peak wavelength is λ_obs₂ = λ_rest₂(1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂, we have λ_rest₁ = λ_rest₂(1 + v₂/c).\n7.  **Calculating the Temperature Ratio**: From the relationship in the previous step, we find the ratio of the rest wavelengths: λ_rest₂/λ_rest₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c). This means T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n8.  **Final Calculation**: We can now substitute all the values into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    *   L₁/L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + (700 km/s) / (300,000 km/s))]⁴\n    *   L₁/L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 0.002333)]⁴\n    *   L₁/L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    *   L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936\n    *   L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23. The information about the mass of the stars is not needed for this calculation and serves as a distractor.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe solution to this problem relies on two fundamental laws of stellar astrophysics: the Stefan-Boltzmann Law and Wien's Displacement Law.\n\nFirst, the luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law. This law relates luminosity to the star's radius (R) and its surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n\nL = 4πR²σT⁴\n\nHere, σ (sigma) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nTo find the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 (L₁) and Star_2 (L₂), we can set up the following equation:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n\nThe constants 4, π, and σ cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\nThe problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, so we know that R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n\nNext, we need to determine the ratio of the temperatures (T₁/T₂). The problem provides a crucial piece of information: \"Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same.\" This refers to the peak wavelength (λ_max) of the star's emission.\n\nWien's Displacement Law states that the peak emission wavelength of a black body is inversely proportional to its absolute temperature (T). The formula is:\n\nλ_max = b / T\n\nwhere 'b' is Wien's displacement constant.\n\nSince the astronomers determined that the peak wavelengths (λ_max) are the same for both stars, it implies that their intrinsic surface temperatures are also the same. The mention of \"spectroscopy\" is key; this analytical method allows astronomers to determine a star's intrinsic properties by accounting for factors like the Doppler effect. Therefore, we can conclude that T₁ = T₂, which means T₁/T₂ = 1.\n\nThe information about the masses and radial velocities of the stars is extraneous to this specific calculation. The radial velocity would be used to correct for Doppler shift to find the intrinsic peak wavelength, but the problem implies this has already been done.\n\nNow, we can substitute the known ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (1)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * 1\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25\n\nThus, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe problem requires calculating the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, based on a set of given astronomical data. The solution involves applying the principles of black body radiation and the Doppler effect.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio**: To find the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 (L₁) and Star_2 (L₂), we can set up the following equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Information**: The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). Therefore, the ratio of their radii squared is (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n4.  **Temperature Information from Wavelength**: According to Wien's Displacement Law, the wavelength at which a black body's radiation is most intense (λ_max) is inversely proportional to its temperature (T). The problem states that the wavelength at which the stars *appeared* brightest was the same. This implies the *observed* peak wavelengths are equal, which are affected by the stars' motion relative to the observer.\n\n5.  **Doppler Effect**: The radial velocity of a star causes a shift in the observed wavelength of its light. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, so its observed peak wavelength (λ_obs,₁) is the same as its emitted peak wavelength (λ_em,₁). Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, causing its light to be redshifted (shifted to a longer wavelength). The observed wavelength is given by the formula λ_obs ≈ λ_em * (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light.\n    *   For Star_1: λ_obs,₁ = λ_em,₁\n    *   For Star_2: λ_obs,₂ = λ_em,₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n\n6.  **Temperature Ratio Calculation**: Since the observed peak wavelengths are the same (λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂), we have:\n    λ_em,₁ = λ_em,₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n    Using Wien's Law (λ_em = b/T, where b is a constant), we can substitute for the emitted wavelengths:\n    b/T₁ = (b/T₂) * (1 + v₂/c)\n    This simplifies to T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n7.  **Final Calculation**: Now, we substitute the ratios for the radii and temperatures back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n    Using v₂ = 700 km/s (or 700,000 m/s) and c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s:\n    v₂/c ≈ 700,000 / (3 x 10⁸) ≈ 0.002333\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThe computed luminosity ratio is approximately 2.23. The information about the stars' masses is not needed for this calculation, as the problem specifies the stars should be treated as black bodies.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n1.  **Luminosity Formula:**\n    The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L = A \\cdot \\sigma \\cdot T^4$\n    Where A is the surface area ($4\\pi R^2$), R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    The formula can be written as:\n    $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n\n2.  **Ratio of Luminosities:**\n    We need to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 ($L_1$) to that of Star_2 ($L_2$):\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4)$\n    Simplifying, we get:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\cdot (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n3.  **Ratio of Radii:**\n    The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 ($R_1 = 1.5 \\cdot R_2$).\n    So, the ratio of the radii squared is:\n    $(R_1/R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$\n\n4.  **Ratio of Temperatures:**\n    To find the temperature ratio, we use the information about the peak emission wavelength. Wien's Displacement Law relates a star's temperature to its *emitted* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{emit}$):\n    $T = b / \\lambda_{emit}$ (where b is Wien's constant)\n    Therefore, the ratio of temperatures is inversely proportional to the ratio of their emitted peak wavelengths:\n    $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{emit,2} / \\lambda_{emit,1}$\n\n5.  **Relating Emitted and Observed Wavelengths:**\n    The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{obs}$) are the same for both stars. The observed wavelength is affected by the Doppler effect due to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$):\n    $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emit} (1 + v_r/c)$\n    where c is the speed of light (~$3 \\times 10^5$ km/s).\n\n    For Star_1: $v_{r1} = 0$ km/s. So, $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{emit,1}(1+0) = \\lambda_{emit,1}$.\n    For Star_2: $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s. So, $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{emit,2}(1 + 700/c)$.\n\n    Since $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we have:\n    $\\lambda_{emit,1} = \\lambda_{emit,2}(1 + 700/c)$\n\n6.  **Calculating the Temperature Ratio:**\n    From the relationship above, we can find the ratio of emitted wavelengths:\n    $\\lambda_{emit,2} / \\lambda_{emit,1} = 1 / (1 + 700/c)$\n    Since $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{emit,2} / \\lambda_{emit,1}$, we have:\n    $T_1/T_2 = 1 / (1 + 700/c)$\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Now we substitute the ratios for radius and temperature back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (2.25) \\cdot [1 / (1 + 700/c)]^4$\n    Let's plug in the value for c ($3 \\times 10^5$ km/s):\n    $v_{r2}/c = 700 / 300000 = 7/3000 \\approx 0.002333$\n    $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / (1 + 7/3000)^4$\n    $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / (1.002333...)^4$\n    $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / 1.009355$\n    $L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.229$\n\n    This value is closest to 2.23.

Therefore, the ratio of their radii is:\n    R₁ / R₂ = 1.5\n    Squaring this gives:\n    (R₁ / R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio (Wien's Law and Doppler Effect):**\n    *   Wien's Displacement Law states that the intrinsic peak emission wavelength (λ_emitted) of a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature: λ_emitted = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's constant.\n    *   The problem states that the stars *appeared* brightest at the same wavelength. This refers to the *observed* wavelength (λ_obs), which is affected by the Doppler effect due to the star's radial velocity (v_r). The relationship is λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c), where 'c' is the speed of light.\n    *   For Star 1 (v_r₁ = 0 km/s): λ_obs₁ = λ_emitted₁ * (1 + 0/c) = λ_emitted₁ = b/T₁\n    *   For Star 2 (v_r₂ = 700 km/s): λ_obs₂ = λ_emitted₂ * (1 + v_r₂/c) = (b/T₂) * (1 + v_r₂/c)\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are the same (λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂), we can equate the two expressions:\n        b/T₁ = (b/T₂) * (1 + v_r₂/c)\n    *   This simplifies to the ratio of the temperatures:\n        T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r₂/c)\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Now, we substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v_r₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v_r₂/c)⁴\n\n    Let's plug in the values:\n    *   v_r₂ = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s\n    *   c (speed of light) ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   v_r₂/c = 700,000 / 300,000,000 = 7/3000 ≈ 0.002333\n\n    Now, calculate the denominator:\n    *   (1 + 0.002333)⁴ ≈ (1.002333)⁴ ≈ 1.00936\n\n    Finally, compute the luminosity ratio:\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936 ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23. The information about the masses of the stars is not needed for this calculation.\n\nTherefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Laws:** The luminosity of a star radiating as a black body is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: `L = 4 * π * R² * σ * T⁴`, where `L` is luminosity, `R` is the radius, `T` is the surface temperature, and `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The peak emission wavelength (`λ_max`) is related to temperature by Wien's Displacement Law: `λ_max = b / T`, where `b` is Wien's constant.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** We need to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L1) to Star_2 (L2).\n    `L1 / L2 = (4 * π * R1² * σ * T1⁴) / (4 * π * R2² * σ * T2⁴)`\n    Simplifying this gives:\n    `L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)⁴`\n\n3.  **Determine the Radius Ratio:** The problem states that `R1 = 1.5 * R2`, so the ratio `R1/R2` is 1.5.\n\n4.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio:**\n    *   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths (`λ_obs`) are the same for both stars.\n    *   The observed wavelength is affected by the star's radial velocity (`v`) due to the Doppler effect. The non-relativistic approximation is `λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c)`, where `λ_rest` is the wavelength in the star's own reference frame and `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   For Star_1, `v1 = 0`, so `λ_obs_1 = λ_rest_1`.\n    *   For Star_2, `v2 = 700 km/s`, so `λ_obs_2 = λ_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c)`.\n    *   Since `λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2`, we can say `λ_rest_1 = λ_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c)`.\n    *   According to Wien's Law, temperature is inversely proportional to the rest-frame peak wavelength (`T = b / λ_rest`). Therefore, the temperature ratio is `T1/T2 = λ_rest_2 / λ_rest_1`.\n    *   Substituting our finding, we get `T1/T2 = λ_rest_2 / (λ_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c))`, which simplifies to `T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:** Substitute the radius ratio and the temperature ratio into the luminosity ratio equation and compute the final value.

Due to the Doppler effect from Star_2's velocity (`v₂ = 700 km/s`), its emitted wavelength is different from its observed wavelength. The fact that their *observed* peak wavelengths are the same means their temperatures are not. The final relationship for the temperature ratio is `(T₁/T₂)⁴ = ((1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c))²`.\n4.  **Final Calculation:** Combining these parts gives `L₁/L₂ = 2.25 * ((1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c))²`. The code executed this calculation:\n    *   `v₂ = 700,000 m/s`\n    *   `c = 299,792,458 m/s`\n    *   `L₁/L₂ = 2.25 * ((1 - 700000/299792458) / (1 + 700000/299792458))² ≈ 2.229`\n\nRounding the result `2.229` to two decimal places gives `2.23`. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nTo determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we can use the principles of black-body radiation. The key formulas are the Stefan-Boltzmann law and Wien's displacement law.\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: This law states that the total energy radiated per unit surface area of a black body is directly proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature (T). The total luminosity (L) of a spherical star with radius (R) is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law**: This law relates the temperature of a black body to the wavelength (λ_max) at which it emits the most radiation. The relationship is inverse: λ_max = b/T, where b is Wien's constant. Therefore, a star's temperature determines its peak emission wavelength.\n\n3.  **Doppler Effect**: The observed wavelength of light from a moving source is shifted. If the source is moving away, its light is redshifted to longer wavelengths; if it is moving closer, it is blueshifted to shorter wavelengths. For speeds much less than the speed of light (c), the observed wavelength (λ_obs) is related to the rest wavelength (λ_rest) by the formula λ_obs ≈ λ_rest(1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity.\n\n**Applying these principles to the problem:**\n\nThe astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest were the same. This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs).\n\n*   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0 km/s, so its observed peak wavelength is equal to its intrinsic (rest) peak wavelength: λ_obs,1 = λ_rest,1.\n*   For Star_2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. This velocity causes a Doppler shift. Its light is redshifted, so the observed peak wavelength is longer than its intrinsic peak wavelength: λ_obs,2 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n\nSince λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2, we have:\nλ_rest,1 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v₂/c)\n\nAccording to Wien's Law, the temperature (T) is inversely proportional to the rest wavelength (T = b/λ_rest). So, the ratio of the temperatures is:\nT₁/T₂ = λ_rest,2 / λ_rest,1 = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the luminosities using the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\nWe are given that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Substituting the known ratios:\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n\nNow, we plug in the values:\n*   v₂ = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s\n*   c (speed of light) ≈ 300,000,000 m/s\n*   v₂/c = 700,000 / 300,000,000 = 7/3000 ≈ 0.002333\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + 0.002333)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.009364\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23. The information about the stars' masses is not needed for this calculation.\n\nTherefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nThe search results confirm the fundamental principles needed to solve this problem.\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star is proportional to its radius (R) squared and its surface temperature (T) to the fourth power.

The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates the peak emission wavelength (λ_max) of a black body to its absolute temperature (T). The formula is λ_max = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's constant. This means that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature.\n3.  **Doppler Effect for Light:** The observed wavelength of light from a moving source is shifted depending on its velocity relative to the observer. For a source moving away, the observed wavelength (λ_obs) is longer than the rest-frame wavelength (λ_rest). For non-relativistic speeds, the relationship is approximately λ_obs / λ_rest = 1 + (v/c), where 'v' is the radial velocity and 'c' is the speed of light.\n\n### Calculation Steps\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio:** We can set up a ratio of the luminosities of the two stars using the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    *   L1 / L2 = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    *   Simplifying by canceling the constants (4, π, σ), we get:\n        L1 / L2 = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n2.  **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2.\n    *   R₁ = 1.5 * R₂\n    *   Therefore, the ratio R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n\n3.  **Temperature Ratio:** This requires combining Wien's Law and the Doppler effect.\n    *   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (λ_obs1 = λ_obs2).\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0 km/s, so its observed wavelength is its true, rest-frame wavelength: λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. We must account for the Doppler shift to find its rest-frame wavelength. Since it's moving, its light is redshifted. The formula connects the observed and rest wavelengths: λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, we have: λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Now, we apply Wien's Law (λ_rest = b/T) to each star:\n        b/T₁ = (b/T₂) * (1 + v₂/c)\n    *   This simplifies to: 1/T₁ = (1/T₂) * (1 + v₂/c), which means T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Using the values v₂ = 700 km/s and c = 300,000 km/s, we get:\n        T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + 700/300000) ≈ 1 / 1.002333\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    *   L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * [1 / (1.002333)]⁴\n    *   L1 / L2 = 2.25 * (1 / 1.00935)\n    *   L1 / L2 ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23.

The formula for luminosity (L) is:\nL = 4πR²σT⁴\nwhere:\n*   **R** is the star's radius.\n*   **σ** is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **T** is the star's effective surface temperature.\n\nTo find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) to Star_2 (L₂), we can set up the following equation:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\nThis simplifies to:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n*   The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂), so R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n*   The mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. This information is a distractor and not needed for this calculation which uses the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n*   The wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same.\n*   The radial velocities are 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2.\n\nThe temperature of a star is related to the peak wavelength (λ_max) of its emitted radiation by Wien's Displacement Law. The law states that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature (λ_max = b/T, where 'b' is a constant).\n\nThe crucial part of the problem is interpreting what \"the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest\" means. This could refer to the observed wavelength or the intrinsic (rest-frame) wavelength. The inclusion of the non-zero radial velocity for Star_2 suggests that a Doppler shift calculation is intended. A positive radial velocity indicates the star is moving away, causing its light to be redshifted to longer wavelengths.\n\nLet's assume the \"appeared brightest\" wavelength refers to the **observed** peak wavelength (λ_obs), which is the same for both stars.\n\n1.  **For Star_1**, with a radial velocity of 0, the observed peak wavelength is the same as its emitted peak wavelength (λ_em₁ = λ_obs).\n\n2.  **For Star_2**, moving away at v₂ = 700 km/s, its emitted light is redshifted. The observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength (λ_em₂) by the Doppler shift formula: λ_obs ≈ λ_em₂ * (1 + v₂/c), where 'c' is the speed of light (approximately 300,000 km/s).\n\n3.  Since the observed peak wavelengths are equal (λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂), we can say:\n    λ_em₁ = λ_em₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n\n4.  From Wien's Law, temperature is inversely proportional to the emitted peak wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_em). Therefore, the ratio of the temperatures is:\n    T₁/T₂ = λ_em₂ / λ_em₁\n\n5.  Substituting the relationship from the Doppler shift:\n    T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n6.  Now, we can substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700/300000)⁴\n\n7.  Calculating the value:\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333...)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333...)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009375\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 ($L_1/L_2$).\n\n**2. Identify Key Physical Principles**\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The total power radiated (luminosity, L) by a black body is proportional to its surface area (A) and the fourth power of its surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n    $L = A \\sigma T^4 = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where R is the star's radius and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The wavelength at which a black body emits the most radiation ($\\lambda_{max, emitted}$) is inversely proportional to its surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n    $\\lambda_{max, emitted} = b/T$\n    where b is Wien's constant.\n\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength of light from a moving source is shifted. For a source moving with a radial velocity $v_r$ (positive if receding), the observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) is related to the emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{emitted}$) by:\n    $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emitted}(1 + v_r/c)$\n    where c is the speed of light ($c \\approx 3 \\times 10^5$ km/s).\n\n**3. Set up the Luminosity Ratio**\n\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities is:\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$\n\n**4. Use the Given Information**\n\n*   **Radius Ratio:** We are given $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2$, so $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$.\n    Substituting this into the equation:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4 = 2.25 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$\n\n*   **Mass Information:** The mass information ($M_1 = 1.5 M_2$) is not directly used in the black-body radiation laws and is likely included as a distractor.\n\n*   **Temperature Ratio:** To find the temperature ratio ($\\frac{T_1}{T_2}$), we must use the information about the peak emission wavelengths. The problem states that the \"wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest... are the same.\" This refers to the **observed** peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{max, obs}$).\n    So, $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2}$.\n\n**5. Relate Temperature to Observed Wavelength**\n\nWe need to connect the observed peak wavelength to the star's intrinsic temperature using the Doppler effect and Wien's Law.\n\n*   **For Star_1:**\n    The radial velocity is $v_{r,1} = 0$ km/s. There is no Doppler shift.\n    $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, emitted, 1}$\n    From Wien's Law, $T_1 = b / \\lambda_{max, emitted, 1}$. So, $T_1 = b / \\lambda_{max, obs, 1}$.\n\n*   **For Star_2:**\n    The radial velocity is $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s. The light is redshifted.\n    $\\lambda_{max, obs, 2} = \\lambda_{max, emitted, 2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n    From Wien's Law, $T_2 = b / \\lambda_{max, emitted, 2}$. So, $\\lambda_{max, emitted, 2} = b / T_2$.\n    Substituting this into the Doppler equation:\n    $\\lambda_{max, obs, 2} = (\\frac{b}{T_2}) (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n\n*   **Find the Temperature Ratio:**\n    Since $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2}$:\n    $\\frac{b}{T_1} = (\\frac{b}{T_2}) (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n    $\\frac{1}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{T_2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n    Rearranging to find the temperature ratio $\\frac{T_1}{T_2}$:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2}/c}$\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio**\n\nNow substitute the expression for the temperature ratio back into our luminosity ratio equation:\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4 = 2.25 \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2}/c} \\right)^4$\n\nPlug in the values for $v_{r,2}$ and c:\n*   $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s\n*   $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s\n\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{700}{300000}} \\right)^4$\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{7}{3000}} \\right)^4$\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left( \\frac{3000}{3007} \\right)^4$\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx 2.25 \\times (0.997672)^4$\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx 2.25 \\times 0.99072$\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx 2.22912$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the factor is approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) to the luminosity of Star_2 (L₂).\n\n2.  **Recall the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The formula is:\n    *   L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    *   Where:\n        *   L is the luminosity (total power radiated).\n        *   R is the star's radius.\n        *   σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n        *   T is the star's surface temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Analyze the given information on radius:** We are given that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2.\n    *   R₁ = 1.5 * R₂\n\n4.  **Analyze the information on wavelength:** The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared brightest* are the same.

We are also given the radial velocities:\n    *   v₁ = 0 km/s\n    *   v₂ = 700 km/s (receding)\n\n5.  **Consider the Doppler Effect:** Because Star_2 is moving, the light we observe from it is subject to a Doppler shift. The observed wavelength (λ_obs) is related to the intrinsic, or rest, wavelength (λ_rest) by the formula for non-relativistic speeds:\n    *   λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c)\n    *   Where 'v' is the radial velocity and 'c' is the speed of light.\n\n6.  **Relate observed wavelengths to rest wavelengths:**\n    *   For Star_1 (v₁ = 0), the observed peak wavelength is the same as its rest peak wavelength: λ_obs₁ = λ_rest₁.\n    *   For Star_2 (v₂ = 700 km/s), its light is redshifted. The observed peak wavelength is: λ_obs₂ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since the problem states λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂, we have: λ_rest₁ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n\n7.  **Apply Wien's Displacement Law:** Wien's law states that the intrinsic peak wavelength of a black body's emission is inversely proportional to its temperature (λ_rest = b/T), where 'b' is Wien's displacement constant. Therefore, T is inversely proportional to λ_rest.\n    *   T ∝ 1/λ_rest\n\n8.  **Determine the temperature ratio:** From Wien's Law, the ratio of the temperatures of the two stars is:\n    *   T₁ / T₂ = λ_rest₂ / λ_rest₁\n    *   Substituting the relationship from the Doppler effect (step 6): T₁ / T₂ = λ_rest₂ / [λ_rest₂ * (1 + v₂/c)]\n    *   T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n9.  **Calculate the luminosity ratio:** Now, we set up the ratio of the luminosities using the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n    *   L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    *   The constants (4, π, σ) cancel out: L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n10. **Substitute the known ratios and values:**\n    *   We know R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n    *   We found T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   The velocity of Star_2 is v₂ = 700 km/s = 7 x 10⁵ m/s.\n    *   The speed of light is c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s.\n    *   L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + (7x10⁵ / 3x10⁸))]⁴\n    *   L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 7/3000)]⁴\n    *   L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333...)⁴\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\n11. **Final Answer:** The calculated factor is approximately 2.229, which rounds to 2.23.

The ratio of luminosities for the two stars is therefore `L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴`.\n\n2.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that `R₁ = 1.5 * R₂`, so the ratio `R₁/R₂` is 1.5.\n\n3.  **Temperature Ratio**: The temperature of a black body is related to its peak emission wavelength (`λ_max`) by Wien's Displacement Law: `T ∝ 1/λ_max_rest`, where `λ_max_rest` is the peak wavelength in the star's own rest frame. We are told the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same. We must use the Doppler effect to relate the observed wavelength to the rest-frame wavelength. The formula is `λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + vᵣ/c)`, where `vᵣ` is the radial velocity.\n    *   For Star 1, `vᵣ₁ = 0`, so `λ_obs₁ = λ_rest₁`.\n    *   For Star 2, `vᵣ₂ = 700 km/s`, so `λ_obs₂ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + vᵣ₂/c)`.\n    *   Since `λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂`, we have `λ_rest₁ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + vᵣ₂/c)`.\n    *   The temperature ratio `T₁/T₂` is `λ_rest₂/λ_rest₁`, which simplifies to `1 / (1 + vᵣ₂/c)`.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**: I will substitute the radius ratio and the calculated temperature ratio into the luminosity ratio formula to find the final numerical answer.

(This is likely extra information not needed for the direct calculation, which is a common trick in physics problems).\n*   **Observed Wavelength:** The observed wavelengths of peak brightness ($\\lambda_{obs}$) are the same for both stars.\n    *   $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n*   **Radial Velocities:**\n    *   Radial velocity of Star_1, $v_{r,1} = 0 \\text{ km/s}$.\n    *   Radial velocity of Star_2, $v_{r,2} = 700 \\text{ km/s}$.\n*   **Physical Model:** The stars are assumed to radiate as black bodies.\n*   **Goal:** Find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to the luminosity of Star_2 ($\\frac{L_1}{L_2}$).\n\n**2. Identify Relevant Physical Principles**\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law describes the total power (luminosity, $L$) radiated by a black body. It is proportional to the surface area ($A$) and the fourth power of the surface temperature ($T$).\n    *   $L = \\sigma A T^4$\n    *   Since a star is a sphere, its surface area is $A = 4\\pi R^2$.\n    *   So, $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$, where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates the temperature of a black body to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation ($\\lambda_{em}$, the *emitted* peak wavelength).\n    *   $\\lambda_{em} \\times T = b$, where $b$ is Wien's constant.\n*   **Doppler Effect for Light:** This effect describes the change in observed wavelength due to the relative motion between the source and the observer.

Step-by-Step Analysis and Calculation**\n\n**Step 1: Set up the Luminosity Ratio**\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law, we can write the luminosities for Star_1 and Star_2:\n*   $L_1 = 4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4$\n*   $L_2 = 4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4$\n\nNow, we find the ratio $\\frac{L_1}{L_2}$:\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4}$\nThe constants $4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ cancel out, leaving:\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Radius Ratio Term**\nWe are given that $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$.\nSo, the first part of our equation is:\n$(\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$)**\nThis is the most complex part and requires combining Wien's Law and the Doppler effect.\n*   **Careful Point:** Wien's Law applies to the wavelength *emitted* by the star in its own rest frame ($\\lambda_{em}$), not the wavelength *observed* on Earth ($\\lambda_{obs}$). We must relate the observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths first.\n\nFrom the Doppler effect formula, we can write the emitted wavelength as: $\\lambda_{em} = \\frac{\\lambda_{obs}}{1 + v_r/c}$.\n\nLet's find the emitted peak wavelengths for each star:\n*   For Star_1: $v_{r,1} = 0$.

Therefore, (R₁/R₂) = 1.5.\n    Substituting this into the equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴ = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n5.  **Temperature Ratio:** The temperature ratio needs to be determined from the information about the peak wavelengths.\n    *   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.\n    *   According to Wien's Displacement Law, the emitted peak wavelength (λ_emitted) is inversely proportional to the temperature: λ_emitted = b / T.\n    *   The observed wavelength is affected by the Doppler shift due to the star's radial velocity (v). The relativistic Doppler formula is:\n        λ_obs = λ_emitted * √((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))\n\n6.  **Applying Doppler Shift:**\n    *   For Star_1, v₁ = 0, so there is no Doppler shift. Thus, λ_obs,1 = λ_emitted,1.\n    *   For Star_2, v₂ = 700 km/s. The light from Star_2 is redshifted. Its observed wavelength is λ_obs,2 = λ_emitted,2 * √((1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c)).\n    *   Since λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2:\n        λ_emitted,1 = λ_emitted,2 * √((1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c))\n\n7.  **Connecting Wavelengths and Temperatures:**\n    *   Using Wien's Law (T = b / λ_emitted):\n        b / T₁ = (b / T₂) * √((1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c))\n    *   Simplifying to find the temperature ratio T₁ / T₂:\n        T₂ / T₁ = √((1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c))\n        T₁ / T₂ = √((1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c))\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Substitute the expression for the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n        L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (T₁ / T₂)⁴ = 2.25 * (√((1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c)))⁴\n        L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * ((1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c))²\n\n9.  **Code Output Analysis:**\n    *   The provided Python code implements this final formula.\n    *   The code calculated the value using v₂ = 700,000 m/s and c = 299,792,458 m/s.\n    *   The output of the code is `2.22908325509156`.\n    *   This value rounds to `2.23`.\n\n10. **Conclusion:**\n    The computed luminosity ratio is approximately 2.23. This matches option D. The information about the stars' masses was not needed for the calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the correct factor.\n\n### 1. The Stefan-Boltzmann Law\nThe luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is determined by its radius (R) and its surface temperature (T). The relationship is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n*L = 4πR²σT⁴*\nwhere σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n### 2. Luminosity Ratio\nTo find how many times greater the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) is than that of Star_2 (L₂), we can set up a ratio:\n*L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)*\n\nThe constants cancel out, leaving:\n*L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴*\n\nWe are given that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, so R₁/R₂ = 1.5. Plugging this in gives:\n*L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴ = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)⁴*\n\n### 3. Temperature Ratio via Wien's Law and Doppler Shift\nThe problem states that the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength (λ_max). This observed peak wavelength is related to the star's surface temperature by Wien's Displacement Law (λ_emitted = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's constant). However, we must account for the relativistic Doppler effect, as Star_2 is moving at a significant radial velocity.\n\n*   **For Star_1:** With a radial velocity of 0 km/s, the observed wavelength is the same as the emitted wavelength.\n    *λ_obs₁ = λ_emitted₁ = b/T₁*\n\n*   **For Star_2:** With a radial velocity (v) of 700 km/s, its light is redshifted. The observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength by the relativistic Doppler shift formula.\n    *λ_obs₂ = λ_emitted₂ * √[(1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c)]*\n    Substituting Wien's law:\n    *λ_obs₂ = (b/T₂) * √[(1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c)]*\n\nSince the observed wavelengths are the same (λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂):\n*b/T₁ = (b/T₂) * √[(1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c)]*\n\nSolving for the temperature ratio (T₁/T₂):\n*T₁/T₂ = √[(1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c)]*\n\n### 4. Calculation\nNow we can calculate the numerical values. The velocity of Star_2 is v = 700 km/s, and the speed of light is c ≈ 300,000 km/s.\n*   β = v/c = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333\n\nSubstitute this value back into the temperature ratio equation:\n*(T₁/T₂)⁴ = (√[(1 - β) / (1 + β)])⁴ = [(1 - β) / (1 + β)]²*\n\nFinally, substitute this into our luminosity ratio equation:\n*L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [(1 - 0.002333) / (1 + 0.002333)]²*\n*L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [0.997667 / 1.002333]²*\n*L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (0.995345)²*\n*L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * 0.99071*\n*L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.2291*\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23. The information about the stars' masses is not needed for this calculation and serves as a distractor.\n\nThe luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nTo determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star 1 is greater than that of Star 2, we can use the principles of black-body radiation.\n\n### Key Principles:\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law states that the total energy radiated per unit surface area of a black body is directly proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature (T). The total luminosity (L) of a spherical star is given by the formula L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates the temperature of a black body to the wavelength (λ_max) at which it emits the most light. The law states that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature (λ_max ∝ 1/T). This means that if two stars have the same peak emission wavelength, they must have the same surface temperature.\n\n### Applying the Principles:\nThe problem provides the following information:\n*   The radius of Star 1 is 1.5 times that of Star 2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂).\n*   The wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same (λ_max,₁ = λ_max,₂).\n\nFrom Wien's Displacement Law, since the peak wavelengths are identical, the surface temperatures of the two stars must also be the same (T₁ = T₂).\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of their luminosities (L₁/L₂) using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n\nThe constants 4, π, and σ cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁²/R₂²) * (T₁⁴/T₂⁴)\n\nSince we established that T₁ = T₂, the temperature term (T₁⁴/T₂⁴) becomes 1. The equation further simplifies to:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = R₁² / R₂² = (R₁/R₂)²\n\nGiven that R₁/R₂ = 1.5, we can calculate the luminosity ratio:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n### Extraneous Information:\nThe information about the stars' masses and their radial velocities is not needed for this calculation. Luminosity is an intrinsic property of a star, determined by its radius and temperature. Radial velocity describes a star's motion toward or away from an observer and is related to the Doppler effect, but it does not affect the star's total energy output or luminosity.\n\nTherefore, the luminosity of Star 1 is greater than the luminosity of Star 2 by a factor of 2.25.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star radiating as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio:** We need to find the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 (L₁) and Star_2 (L₂).\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2.\n    R₁ = 1.5 * R₂  =>  R₁/R₂ = 1.5\n    Therefore, (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n4.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a star's surface temperature (T) to the peak wavelength (λ_max) of its emitted spectrum in its rest frame.\n    λ_max * T = b (where b is Wien's displacement constant)\n    This means T = b / λ_max, or T is inversely proportional to the rest-frame peak wavelength.\n    So, the temperature ratio is:\n    T₁/T₂ = λ_max,rest₂ / λ_max,rest₁\n\n5.  **Doppler Effect on Wavelength:** The problem states that astronomers measured the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared* brightest and found them to be the same. This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_max,obs), which is affected by the star's radial velocity (v) due to the Doppler effect. The relationship between the observed wavelength and the rest-frame wavelength (λ_max,rest) is:\n    λ_max,obs = λ_max,rest * (1 + v/c)\n    where c is the speed of light. A positive velocity indicates the star is moving away (redshift).\n\n6.  **Calculating Rest-Frame Wavelengths:**\n    *   **For Star_1:** The radial velocity is v₁ = 0 km/s.\n        λ_max,obs₁ = λ_max,rest₁ * (1 + 0/c) = λ_max,rest₁\n    *   **For Star_2:** The radial velocity is v₂ = 700 km/s = 7 x 10⁵ m/s.\n        λ_max,obs₂ = λ_max,rest₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n        So, λ_max,rest₂ = λ_max,obs₂ / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n7.  **Calculating Temperature Ratio:** We are given that the observed peak wavelengths are the same: λ_max,obs₁ = λ_max,obs₂.\n    Let's substitute the expressions for the rest-frame wavelengths into the temperature ratio equation from step 4:\n    T₁/T₂ = λ_max,rest₂ / λ_max,rest₁\n    T₁/T₂ = [λ_max,obs₂ / (1 + v₂/c)] / λ_max,obs₁\n    Since λ_max,obs₁ = λ_max,obs₂, they cancel out:\n    T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:** Now we substitute the radius ratio and the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio formula from step 2.\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\n    Now, let's plug in the values for v₂ and c (c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s):\n    v₂/c = (7 x 10⁵ m/s) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s) ≈ 0.002333\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.00937\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\n    This value is closest to 2.23.

Radius Ratio (R1 / R2):**\nThe problem states that \"Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2\".\nSo, R1 = 1.5 * R2, which means (R1 / R2) = 1.5.\n\n**2. Temperature Ratio (T1 / T2):**\nThe temperature of a star is related to the peak wavelength (λ_peak) of its emitted radiation by Wien's Displacement Law:\nT = b / λ_peak, where b is Wien's constant.\nThis means T is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength emitted by the star in its own rest frame (λ_rest).\nSo, T1 / T2 = (b / λ_rest,1) / (b / λ_rest,2) = λ_rest,2 / λ_rest,1.\n\nThe problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same for both stars: λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.\nWe must account for the Doppler effect, which relates the observed wavelength to the rest-frame wavelength:\nλ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light.\n\nFor Star_1: v_r1 = 0 km/s. There is no Doppler shift.\nλ_obs,1 = λ_rest,1 * (1 + 0/c) = λ_rest,1\n\nFor Star_2: v_r2 = 700 km/s. The light is redshifted.\nλ_obs,2 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v_r2 / c) = λ_rest,2 * (1 + 700/c)\n\nSince λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2, we can set the expressions equal:\nλ_rest,1 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + 700/c)\n\nNow we can find the ratio of the rest-frame wavelengths:\nλ_rest,2 / λ_rest,1 = 1 / (1 + 700/c)\n\nThis gives us the temperature ratio:\nT1 / T2 = λ_rest,2 / λ_rest,1 = 1 / (1 + 700/c)\n\n**3.

Therefore, the radius component of the ratio is:\n    `(R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25`\n\n4.  **Temperature Component:** This is the more complex part, involving Wien's Law and the Doppler effect.\n    *   **Wien's Law:** A star's temperature is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* light (λ_emitted): T ∝ 1/λ_emitted. Thus, `T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁`.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** Astronomers measure the *observed* wavelength (λ_obs), which is shifted due to the star's radial velocity (v).\n    *   **Star_1:** Has v₁ = 0, so its light is not shifted. Therefore, `λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁`.\n    *   **Star_2:** Has v₂ = 700 km/s. Its light is redshifted due to its recession. The relativistic Doppler shift formula is `λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * √[(1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c)]`.\n    *   **Connecting the two:** We are told the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (`λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂`).\n        `λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * √[(1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c)]`\n    *   **Finding the Temperature Ratio:** We can rearrange the equation above to find the ratio of emitted wavelengths, which gives us the temperature ratio:\n        `T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = √[(1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c)]`\n    *   We need this term to the fourth power for the luminosity calculation:\n        `(T₁/T₂)⁴ = (√[(1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c)])⁴ = [(1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c)]²`\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Now we combine the radius and temperature components.\n    `L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [(1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c)]²`\n    The python code you executed calculated this exact expression:\n    *   `v₂ = 700,000 m/s`\n    *   `c = 299,792,458 m/s`\n    *   The calculation yielded `2.22908325509156`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229. Rounding this to two decimal places gives 2.23.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nThe searches have confirmed the physical laws I intended to use:\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius and T is the surface temperature.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The peak emission wavelength (λ_max) of a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature (T).\n*   **Doppler Effect:** An object's motion towards or away from an observer shifts the wavelengths of its emitted light. The radial velocity can be calculated from this shift.\n\nThe core of the problem remains the interpretation of the phrase \"wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest.\"\n\n*   **Interpretation 1:** This refers to the intrinsic peak emission wavelength in the star's rest frame. In this case, since the wavelengths are the same, the temperatures are the same (T1 = T2). The velocity information is extraneous.\n*   **Interpretation 2:** This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength from Earth. In this case, the Doppler effect from Star 2's radial velocity must be accounted for.\n\nThe phrasing \"appeared brightest\" strongly suggests the observed property. Furthermore, the inclusion of the radial velocity data and a corresponding answer choice (C) makes it highly probable that this is the intended solution path. Problems in physics exams are often designed to test the application of multiple concepts, and Interpretation 2 does exactly that. Interpretation 1 ignores a key piece of information provided.\n\nTherefore, I will proceed with the more detailed calculation that incorporates the Doppler shift.\n\n**Calculation Steps:**\n\n1.  **Start with the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the ratio of luminosities:**\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n2.  **Use the given radius information:**\n    R₁ = 1.5 * R₂  =>  R₁/R₂ = 1.5\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n3.  **Determine the temperature ratio (T₁/T₂) using Wien's Law and the Doppler effect.**\n    *   Wien's Law states that temperature is inversely proportional to the rest-frame peak wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_rest). So, T₁/T₂ = λ_rest,₂ / λ_rest,₁.\n    *   The problem states the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n    *   For Star 1, radial velocity v₁ = 0, so there is no Doppler shift. Thus, λ_obs,₁ = λ_rest,₁.\n    *   For Star 2, radial velocity v₂ = 700 km/s. This causes a Doppler redshift. The observed wavelength is related to the rest wavelength by: λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c).\n    *   Therefore, λ_obs,₂ = λ_rest,₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Combining these facts: λ_rest,₁ = λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂ = λ_rest,₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   This gives us the ratio of the rest wavelengths: λ_rest,₂ / λ_rest,₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n4.  **Substitute the wavelength ratio into the temperature ratio:**\n    T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n5.  **Calculate the value of v₂/c:**\n    v₂ = 700 km/s\n    c = 300,000 km/s\n    v₂/c = 700 / 300,000 = 7/3000 ≈ 0.002333\n\n6.  **Substitute all values back into the luminosity ratio equation:**\n    L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + 7/3000)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 7/3000)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00935\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\n7.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    The calculated value of ~2.229 is closest to 2.23.\n\nThe information regarding the masses of the stars appears to be extraneous, as it is not needed for the calculation based on black body radiation laws.\n\nFinal conclusion is that the velocity information is crucial and leads to answer C.\n\nBased on a detailed analysis of the problem, the solution is derived by combining the Stefan-Boltzmann law, Wien's displacement law, and the formula for the Doppler effect.\n\nThe ratio of the luminosities (L) of the two stars is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n*   The radius of Star 1 is 1.5 times that of Star 2 (R₁/R₂ = 1.5).\n*   The radial velocity of Star 1 is 0 km/s, and for Star 2 it is 700 km/s.\n*   The stars are black bodies and the wavelengths at which they *appear* brightest are identical.\n\nThe key is to determine the ratio of the true surface temperatures (T₁/T₂) of the stars. The phrase \"appeared brightest\" refers to the observed peak wavelength (λ_obs). Since these are the same for both stars (λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂), we must account for the Doppler effect caused by Star 2's radial velocity.\n\n1.  **For Star 1 (v₁ = 0):** There is no Doppler shift, so its observed peak wavelength is the same as its rest-frame peak wavelength (λ_obs,₁ = λ_rest,₁).\n2.  **For Star 2 (v₂ = 700 km/s):** Its motion away from the observer causes a redshift. Its observed peak wavelength is related to its rest-frame wavelength by the Doppler shift formula: λ_obs,₂ = λ_rest,₂ * (1 + v₂/c), where c is the speed of light (≈ 300,000 km/s).\n\nSince λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂, we have:\nλ_rest,₁ = λ_rest,₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n\nAccording to Wien's Displacement Law, a star's temperature is inversely proportional to its rest-frame peak wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_rest). Therefore, the ratio of the temperatures is:\nT₁/T₂ = λ_rest,₂ / λ_rest,₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\nNow, we can substitute the known values into the luminosity ratio equation:\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + (700 km/s) / (300,000 km/s))]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 7/3000)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333...)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.00935...\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value rounds to 2.23. The information about the stars' masses is not needed for this calculation.\n\nTherefore, the luminosity of Star 1 is greater than that of Star 2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nTo determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we will use the fundamental laws of black-body radiation.\n\n### Key Principles\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: This law states that the luminosity (L) of a star, which is the total energy it radiates per second, is proportional to the square of its radius (R) and the fourth power of its surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n    *   L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    *   where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law**: This law relates the temperature of a black body to the wavelength (λ_max) at which it emits the most radiation. It states that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature.\n    *   λ_max * T = b\n    *   where b is Wien's constant.\n\n### Analysis of the Problem\n\nWe are given the following information:\n*   The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂).\n*   The mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times the mass of Star_2 (this information is not needed for this calculation).\n*   The wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same.\n*   The radial velocities are 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**1. Set up the Luminosity Ratio:**\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n**2. Use the Given Radius Ratio:**\nWe are given that R₁/R₂ = 1.5. Squaring this gives:\n(R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\nSo the equation becomes:\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n**3. Determine the Temperature Ratio:**\nThe problem states that \"astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same.\" In astronomical terms, \"determining\" a physical property like a star's peak emission wavelength implies that observational effects, such as the Doppler shift from radial velocity, have been corrected for. This means the intrinsic, or rest-frame, peak wavelengths (λ_max) of the two stars are equal.\n\nAccording to Wien's Law (λ_max * T = constant), if the peak wavelengths are the same (λ_max,₁ = λ_max,₂), then their surface temperatures must also be the same (T₁ = T₂).\n\nTherefore, the ratio of their temperatures is:\nT₁/T₂ = 1\n\nThe provided radial velocities are considered distractor information, as the phrasing implies that they have already been accounted for in the determination of the peak wavelength.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:**\nSubstitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (1)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25\n\nThus, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nThe provided information has been analyzed, and the initial calculation appears to be correct based on fundamental physics principles. The search results confirm the validity of the Stefan-Boltzmann law, Wien's Displacement Law, and the Doppler effect for light, which are the core concepts needed to solve this problem.\n\n**1. Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star is proportional to the square of its radius (R) and the fourth power of its surface temperature (T). The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴. This leads to the luminosity ratio:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n**2. Wien's Displacement Law:** This law connects a star's surface temperature (T) to the peak wavelength (λ_max) of its emitted light, where T is inversely proportional to λ_max. Importantly, this temperature is determined by the star's *rest* wavelength, not the wavelength observed from Earth if the star is in motion.\n\n**3. Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength of light from a star is affected by its radial velocity (its motion towards or away from us). For a star moving away, its light is \"redshifted,\" meaning the observed wavelength is longer than its rest wavelength. For a star with no radial velocity, the observed and rest wavelengths are the same.\n\nBased on the problem statement:\n*   The ratio of the radii (R₁/R₂) is 1.5.\n*   The *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂).\n*   Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, so its observed peak wavelength is equal to its rest peak wavelength (λ_obs₁ = λ_rest₁).\n*   Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s away from us, so its light is redshifted. The observed peak wavelength is longer than its rest wavelength: λ_obs₂ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v/c).\n\nFrom this, we deduce that the stars have different rest peak wavelengths and therefore different temperatures.\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n*   L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴ = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n*   From Wien's Law, T₁/T₂ = λ_rest₂ / λ_rest₁.\n*   We know λ_rest₁ = λ_obs₁ and since λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂, we have λ_rest₁ = λ_obs₂.\n*   We also have λ_obs₂ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v/c).\n*   Substituting λ_rest₁ for λ_obs₂ gives λ_rest₁ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v/c).\n*   This gives the ratio of rest wavelengths: λ_rest₂ / λ_rest₁ = 1 / (1 + v/c).\n*   Therefore, the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v/c).\n*   The luminosity ratio becomes L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + v/c)]⁴.\n*   Plugging in the values: L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / [1 + (700 km/s) / (300,000 km/s)]⁴\n*   L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 7/3000)⁴ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936 ≈ 2.229\n\nThis result is closest to 2.23. The mass information is extraneous to this calculation.\n\nThe luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to the luminosity of Star_2, which can be written as $L_1 / L_2$.\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Physical Laws**\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law relates a star's luminosity (L), radius (R), and surface temperature (T). Assuming the star is a spherical black body, the formula is:\n    $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a star's surface temperature (T) to the wavelength at which it emits the most light (its peak emitted wavelength, $\\lambda_{\\text{em,max}}$):\n    $\\lambda_{\\text{em,max}} * T = b$\n    where 'b' is Wien's displacement constant. This can be rearranged to $T = b / \\lambda_{\\text{em,max}}$.\n\n*   **Doppler Effect:** This effect describes how the observed wavelength of light changes due to the relative motion between the source and the observer. For speeds much less than the speed of light (c), the formula for the observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) is:\n    $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{em}}(1 + v_r/c)$\n    where $\\lambda_{\\text{em}}$ is the emitted wavelength and $v_r$ is the radial velocity (positive for motion away from the observer, negative for motion towards).\n\n**3. Set up the Luminosity Ratio**\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law for both stars:\n$L_1 = 4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4$\n$L_2 = 4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4$\n\nThe ratio is:\n$L_1 / L_2 = (4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4) = (R_1/R_2)^2 * (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n**4. Use the Given Information**\n*   **Radius Ratio:** We are given $R_1 = 1.5 * R_2$. So, $(R_1/R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\n*   **Peak Wavelengths:** We are told the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared* brightest are the same. This means their *observed* peak wavelengths are equal: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs,max,1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs,max,2}}$.\n*   **Radial Velocities:** $v_{r,1} = 0$ km/s and $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s. A positive velocity indicates the star is moving away from us (receding).\n*   **Mass information ($M_1 = 1.5 * M_2$):** This information is not needed for the black body calculation and is a distractor.\n\n**5. Determine the Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$)**\nThe temperature is related to the *emitted* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{em,max}}$) by Wien's Law. So, we first need to find the relationship between the emitted peak wavelengths of the two stars.\n\n*   For Star_1 ($v_{r,1} = 0$): Since it has no radial velocity, there is no Doppler shift.\n    $\\lambda_{\\text{obs,max,1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{em,max,1}}$\n\n*   For Star_2 ($v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s): Its light is redshifted because it is moving away.\n    $\\lambda_{\\text{obs,max,2}} = \\lambda_{\\text{em,max,2}} * (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n\nSince we know $\\lambda_{\\text{obs,max,1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs,max,2}}$, we can set the expressions for them to be equal:\n$\\lambda_{\\text{em,max,1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{em,max,2}} * (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n\nNow, from Wien's law, we know that $T_1 = b / \\lambda_{\\text{em,max,1}}$ and $T_2 = b / \\lambda_{\\text{em,max,2}}$. The ratio of their temperatures is:\n$T_1/T_2 = (b / \\lambda_{\\text{em,max,1}}) / (b / \\lambda_{\\text{em,max,2}}) = \\lambda_{\\text{em,max,2}} / \\lambda_{\\text{em,max,1}}$\n\nFrom our previous step, we can find this ratio:\n$\\lambda_{\\text{em,max,2}} / \\lambda_{\\text{em,max,1}} = 1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\nSo, $T_1/T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n\nThis shows that $T_1$ is slightly less than $T_2$.\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio**\nSubstitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n$L_1 / L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 * (T_1/T_2)^4$\n$L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 * [1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)]^4$\n$L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)^4$\n\nNow, plug in the values:\n*   $v_{r,2} = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 7 \\times 10^5 \\text{ m/s}$\n*   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$\n\n$v_{r,2}/c = (7 \\times 10^5) / (3 \\times 10^8) = 7/3000 \\approx 0.002333$\n\n$L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)^4$\n$L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / (1.002333)^4$\n$L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.25 / 1.00937$\n$L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.229$\n\nThis value rounds to 2.23.\n\n**Logical Check**\nSince Star_2 is moving away, its light is redshifted. For its observed peak wavelength to be the same as Star_1's, its emitted peak wavelength must be shorter. A shorter peak wavelength means a higher temperature (Wien's Law). So, $T_2 > T_1$. This means the factor $(T_1/T_2)^4$ is less than 1. Therefore, the final ratio $L_1/L_2$ must be less than $(R_1/R_2)^2 = 2.25$. Out of the given options, only 2.23 is less than 2.25.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nTo determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we can use the principles of black-body radiation. The crucial laws are the Stefan-Boltzmann Law and Wien's Displacement Law.\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: This law states that the total energy radiated per unit surface area of a black body is directly proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature (T). The total luminosity (L) of a star, which is assumed to be a spherical black body, also depends on its surface area (A = 4πR²). Therefore, the luminosity is given by the formula:\n    *   L = σ * A * T⁴ = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, R is the star's radius, and T is its surface temperature.\n\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law**: This law relates the temperature of a black body to the wavelength (λ_max) at which it emits the most radiation. The law states that λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature (T):\n    *   λ_max = b / T\n    where 'b' is Wien's displacement constant. This implies that objects with the same peak emission wavelength have the same surface temperature.\n\n**Applying the Concepts to the Stars**\n\nWe are given the following information:\n*   The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂).\n*   The wavelength of maximum brightness (λ_max) is the same for both stars.\n\nFrom Wien's Displacement Law, since both stars have the same λ_max, their surface temperatures must be equal (T₁ = T₂).\n\nNow, let's find the ratio of their luminosities (L₁ / L₂) using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n*   L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n\nSince the constants 4, π, and σ are the same for both, they cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n*   L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\nWe can now substitute the known ratios:\n*   The ratio of the radii is R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n*   The ratio of the temperatures is T₁/T₂ = 1.\n\nPlugging these values into the luminosity ratio equation:\n*   L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (1)⁴\n*   L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * 1\n*   L₁ / L₂ = 2.25\n\nThe information regarding the stars' masses and radial velocities is not needed for this calculation, as the luminosity of a black body is determined by its radius and surface temperature.\n\nTherefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the relationship between peak wavelength and temperature:** The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. According to Wien's Displacement Law for black bodies (λ_max = b/T, where λ_max is the peak wavelength, b is a constant, and T is the surface temperature), if the peak wavelengths are equal, their surface temperatures (T1 and T2) must also be equal.\n\n2.  **Analyze the relationship between luminosity, radius, and temperature:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it's a black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4 * π * R² * σ * T⁴, where R is the radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the surface temperature.\n\n3.  **Calculate the ratio of luminosities:** We need to find the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, which is the ratio L1 / L2.\n    *   L1 = 4 * π * R1² * σ * T1⁴\n    *   L2 = 4 * π * R2² * σ * T2⁴\n    *   The ratio is (4 * π * R1² * σ * T1⁴) / (4 * π * R2² * σ * T2⁴).\n\n4.  **Simplify the ratio:** Since the constants (4, π, σ) cancel out and we've established that T1 = T2, the temperature terms (T1⁴ and T2⁴) also cancel out. The equation simplifies to:\n    *   L1 / L2 = R1² / R2² = (R1 / R2)²\n\n5.  **Substitute the given values:** We are given that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2, so R1 / R2 = 1.5.\n\n6.  **Compute the final result:** Calculate (1.5)², which will give the luminosity ratio.

The key principles involved are:\n1.  The Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which relates a star's luminosity (L) to its radius (R) and surface temperature (T).\n2.  Wien's Displacement Law, which relates the surface temperature (T) of a star to the peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{max,em}$) at which it emits the most radiation.\n3.  The Doppler effect, which relates the observed wavelength of light ($\\lambda_{obs}$) to the emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{em}$) and the radial velocity ($v_r$) of the source.\n\n**Step 2: List the given information and identify any potential distractors.**\n*   Radius relation: $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2$\n*   Mass relation: $M_1 = 1.5 \\times M_2$ (This is a distractor. While mass, radius, and luminosity are related, the Stefan-Boltzmann law gives a more direct way to solve the problem with the given information).\n*   Observed peak wavelength: $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2}$. The phrase \"appeared brightest\" refers to the light as observed from Earth.\n*   Radial velocities: $v_{r,1} = 0$ km/s and $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s.\n*   Assumption: Stars radiate as black bodies.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the luminosity ratio using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law.**\nThe luminosity of a spherical black body is given by $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$, where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\nThe ratio of the luminosities is:\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$\n\n**Step 4: Substitute the known radius ratio.**\nWe are given $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$.\nSo, $(\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\nThe luminosity ratio becomes: $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$\n\n**Step 5: Determine the temperature ratio ($T_1/T_2$) by considering the observed peak wavelengths.**\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. Temperature is related to the *emitted* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{max,em}$) by Wien's Law: $T = b/\\lambda_{max,em}$, where $b$ is a constant. Therefore, $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{max,em,2}}{\\lambda_{max,em,1}}$.\n\nWe need to find the relationship between the emitted wavelengths using the given information about the *observed* wavelengths. The observed wavelength is affected by the Doppler shift: $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{em}(1 + \\frac{v_r}{c})$, where c is the speed of light.\n\n*   For Star_1: $v_{r,1} = 0$, so its observed peak wavelength is the same as its emitted one: $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, em, 1}$.\n*   For Star_2: $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s, so its observed peak wavelength is $\\lambda_{max, obs, 2} = \\lambda_{max, em, 2}(1 + \\frac{v_{r,2}}{c})$.\n\nThe problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2}$.\nTherefore, $\\lambda_{max, em, 1} = \\lambda_{max, em, 2}(1 + \\frac{v_{r,2}}{c})$.\n\nNow we can find the ratio of the emitted wavelengths: $\\frac{\\lambda_{max,em,2}}{\\lambda_{max,em,1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2}/c}$.\n\nSince $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{max,em,2}}{\\lambda_{max,em,1}}$, we have:\n$\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2}/c}$\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the numerical value of the temperature ratio.**\n*   $v_{r,2} = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 7 \\times 10^5 \\text{ m/s}$\n*   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$\n*   $\\frac{v_{r,2}}{c} = \\frac{7 \\times 10^5}{3 \\times 10^8} = \\frac{7}{3000}$\n*   $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + 7/3000} = \\frac{3000}{3007}$\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the final luminosity ratio.**\nSubstitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the equation from Step 4:\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4 = 2.25 \\times (\\frac{3000}{3007})^4$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$(\\frac{3000}{3007}) \\approx 0.997672$\n$(\\frac{3000}{3007})^4 \\approx (0.997672)^4 \\approx 0.99072$\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx 2.25 \\times 0.99072 \\approx 2.2291$\n\n**Step 8: Match the result to the given options.**\nThe calculated ratio is ~2.229, which rounds to 2.23. This matches option B.\n\n**Careful Point Summary:**\n*   Ignoring the Doppler effect would incorrectly assume $T_1 = T_2$, leading to an answer of 2.25 (Option C). This is a common trap.\n*   The mass information is irrelevant for this specific calculation method, which is based on fundamental radiation laws.\n*   The term \"appeared brightest\" must be interpreted as the observed property, not the intrinsic emitted property.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{700 \\text{ km/s}}{300000 \\text{ km/s}}}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1.002333...}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{1.009355...} \\approx 2.229$\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L1) to the luminosity of Star_2 (L2), which is L1 / L2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star that radiates as a perfect black body is determined by its surface area (A) and its surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n    L = σ * A * T⁴\n    where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Assuming the stars are spherical, their surface area is A = 4πR², where R is the radius.\n    So, the formula becomes:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n\n3.  **Set up the Luminosity Ratio:** We can write the expression for the luminosity of each star:\n    L1 = 4π(R1)²σ(T1)⁴\n    L2 = 4π(R2)²σ(T2)⁴\n    To find the ratio L1 / L2, we divide the first equation by the second. The constants 4, π, and σ cancel out:\n    L1 / L2 = [4π(R1)²σ(T1)⁴] / [4π(R2)²σ(T2)⁴] = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)⁴\n\n4.  **Incorporate the Given Information:**\n    *   **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that R1 = 1.5 * R2. Therefore, the ratio R1/R2 = 1.5. Squaring this gives (R1/R2)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n    *   **Temperature Ratio:** This requires more steps. We must relate the temperature to the given spectroscopic data (peak wavelength and radial velocity).\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio (T1/T2):**\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** For a black body, the temperature is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation (λ_emit). The law is T = b / λ_emit, where b is Wien's constant. From this, we can establish the temperature ratio:\n        T1 / T2 = (b / λ_emit,1) / (b / λ_emit,2) = λ_emit,2 / λ_emit,1\n    *   **Doppler Shift:** The wavelength we observe from Earth (λ_obs) can be different from the wavelength the star emits (λ_emit) if the star is moving towards or away from us. This is the Doppler effect. The formula for the non-relativistic Doppler shift is:\n        λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v_r / c)\n        where v_r is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light.\n    *   **Applying the Doppler Shift:**\n        -   For Star_1, v_r1 = 0 km/s. So, λ_obs,1 = λ_emit,1 * (1 + 0/c) = λ_emit,1.\n        -   For Star_2, v_r2 = 700 km/s (moving away, so the wavelength is redshifted). So, λ_obs,2 = λ_emit,2 * (1 + 700/c).\n    *   **Using the Observed Wavelength Data:** The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.\n        Therefore, we can set the two expressions equal:\n        λ_emit,1 = λ_emit,2 * (1 + 700/c)\n    *   **Finalizing the Temperature Ratio:** Now we can find the ratio λ_emit,2 / λ_emit,1 that we need for our temperature ratio calculation. By rearranging the equation above, we get:\n        λ_emit,2 / λ_emit,1 = 1 / (1 + 700/c)\n        Since T1/T2 = λ_emit,2 / λ_emit,1, we have:\n        T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + 700/c)\n\n6.  **Combine All Parts and Calculate:**\n    Now substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into our main luminosity ratio equation:\n    L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)⁴\n    L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + 700/c)]⁴\n    L1 / L2 = 2.25 / (1 + 700/c)⁴\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Using the speed of light c ≈ 299,792.458 km/s, we can compute the final value. The Python code execution provides the precise result.\n\n    The code calculated: `luminosity_ratio = 2.25 / ((1 + 700 / 299792.458)**4)`\n    The output was `2.2291075611484996`.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) ~2.23\n    B) ~2.32\n    C) ~2.35\n    D) ~2.25\n\n    The value 2.229 is closest to 2.23. The information about the mass of the stars was not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nTo solve this problem, we need to compare the luminosities of the two stars. The luminosity of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law.\n\n**1. Stefan-Boltzmann Law:**\nThe luminosity (L) of a star is related to its radius (R) and its surface temperature (T) by the following equation:\nL = 4πR²σT⁴\nwhere σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n**2. Luminosity Ratio:**\nTo find the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) is greater than that of Star_2 (L₂), we can set up a ratio:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n\nThe constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, leaving:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂) * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n**3. Radius Ratio:**\nThe problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2:\nR₁ = 1.5 * R₂  =>  R₁/R₂ = 1.5\nTherefore, (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n**4. Temperature Ratio:**\nTo find the temperature ratio, we use the information about the peak emission wavelengths. According to Wien's Displacement Law, the peak wavelength (λ_max) of a black body's emitted radiation is inversely proportional to its temperature (T).\n\nThe problem states that the \"wavelengths at which the stars *appeared* brightest\" are the same. This implies that the observed peak wavelengths are identical. The observed wavelength is affected by the star's radial velocity due to the Doppler effect.\n\n*   **For Star_1:** The radial velocity is 0 km/s, so there is no Doppler shift. The observed peak wavelength (λ_obs,1) is equal to its intrinsic peak wavelength (λ_rest,1).\n*   **For Star_2:** The radial velocity is 700 km/s. This motion causes a redshift, meaning the light waves are stretched to longer wavelengths. The observed wavelength (λ_obs,2) is related to the intrinsic wavelength (λ_rest,2) by the formula for non-relativistic speeds:\n    λ_obs,2 ≈ λ_rest,2 * (1 + v/c)\n    where v = 700 km/s and c is the speed of light (~300,000 km/s).\n\nSince the observed wavelengths are the same (λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2):\nλ_rest,1 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v/c)\n\nFrom Wien's Law (λ_rest = b/T, where b is a constant), we can substitute temperature into the equation:\nb/T₁ = (b/T₂) * (1 + v/c)\n1/T₁ = (1/T₂) * (1 + v/c)\nThis gives us the temperature ratio:\nT₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v/c)\n\n**5. Final Calculation:**\nNow we substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + v/c)]⁴\n\nLet's plug in the values:\nv/c = 700 km/s / 300,000 km/s ≈ 0.002333\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.009366\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23.

For a star moving away (receding), its light is redshifted:\n        λ_obs_max = λ_rest_max * (1 + v/c), where c is the speed of light.\n    *   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same for both stars: λ_obs_max₁ = λ_obs_max₂.\n    *   For **Star_1**: Its radial velocity is 0 km/s. Therefore, its observed wavelength is its rest wavelength: λ_obs_max₁ = λ_rest_max₁. Its temperature is T₁ = b / λ_rest_max₁.\n    *   For **Star_2**: Its radial velocity is v₂ = 700 km/s. Its light is redshifted. The rest wavelength is λ_rest_max₂ = λ_obs_max₂ / (1 + v₂/c). Its temperature is T₂ = b / λ_rest_max₂ = b * (1 + v₂/c) / λ_obs_max₂.\n    *   Since λ_obs_max₁ = λ_obs_max₂, we find the relationship between the temperatures:\n        T₂ = T₁ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of their temperatures is:\n        T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: Now, substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n\n    Using the given values:\n    *   v₂ = 700 km/s\n    *   c (speed of light) ≈ 300,000 km/s\n    *   v₂/c = 700 / 300,000 = 7 / 3000 ≈ 0.002333\n\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 0.002333)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.00936\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23.

The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law states that the wavelength at which a black body is brightest (λ_max) is inversely proportional to its temperature (T). The formula is λ_max = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's constant.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n1.  **Temperature Comparison:** The problem states that the wavelengths at which the two stars appear brightest are the same (λ_max,1 = λ_max,2). According to Wien's Displacement Law, since λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature, if the peak wavelengths are identical, their surface temperatures must also be identical (T1 = T2).\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio:** To find the ratio of the luminosities (L1 / L2), we can set up a ratio using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law for each star.\n    *   L1 = 4π(R1)²σ(T1)⁴\n    *   L2 = 4π(R2)²σ(T2)⁴\n\n    By dividing the first equation by the second, the constants (4, π, and σ) cancel out:\n    L1 / L2 = [(R1)²(T1)⁴] / [(R2)²(T2)⁴]\n\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    L1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)² * (T1 / T2)⁴\n\n3.  **Substituting Known Values:**\n    *   From the problem, we know that the radius of Star 1 is 1.5 times that of Star 2, so R1 / R2 = 1.5.\n    *   From our analysis using Wien's Law, we know the temperatures are equal, so T1 / T2 = 1.\n\n    Substituting these values into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * (1)⁴\n    L1 / L2 = 2.25 * 1\n    L1 / L2 = 2.25\n\nThe information regarding the stars' masses and radial velocities is not relevant to this specific calculation, which is based on the assumption that the stars radiate as black bodies.\n\nThe luminosity of Star 1 is greater than the luminosity of Star 2 by a factor of 2.25.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 (L₁ / L₂).\n\n**1.

Final Calculation:**\nNow we substitute the ratios for radius and temperature back into the luminosity ratio equation:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v_r₂/c)]⁴\n\nUsing the given values:\n*   v_r₂ = 700,000 m/s\n*   c (speed of light) ≈ 299,792,458 m/s\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + 700,000 / 299,792,458)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 0.00233496)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / 1.00233496]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (0.9976706)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * 0.99072027\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.2291\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23. The information about the stars' masses is extraneous and not needed for the calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning used to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 (`L1 / L2`).\n\n2.  **Luminosity Formula:** The luminosity (`L`) of a star radiating as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    `L = 4πR²σT⁴`\n    where `R` is the star's radius and `T` is its effective surface temperature.\n\n3.  **Luminosity Ratio:** By dividing the luminosity equation for Star_1 by that for Star_2, the constants (`4`, `π`, `σ`) cancel out, giving us the ratio:\n    `L1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)² * (T1 / T2)⁴`\n\n4.  **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (`R1 = 1.5 * R2`). Therefore:\n    `R1 / R2 = 1.5`\n\n5.  **Temperature Ratio:** This requires combining Wien's Displacement Law and the Doppler effect.\n    *   **Wien's Law:** A star's temperature is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength it *emits* (`λ_emitted`): `T ∝ 1 / λ_emitted`. This means `T1 / T2 = λ_emitted2 / λ_emitted1`.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The problem states the peak wavelengths *appear* the same (`λ_observed1 = λ_observed2`). The observed wavelength is affected by the star's radial velocity (`v_r`).\n    *   For Star_1, `v_r1 = 0`, so there is no Doppler shift. Its observed wavelength is its emitted wavelength: `λ_observed1 = λ_emitted1`.\n    *   For Star_2, `v_r2 = 700 km/s`. This motion away from us causes a redshift, so `λ_observed2 = λ_emitted2 * (1 + v_r2 / c)`.\n    *   Since `λ_observed1 = λ_observed2`, we have `λ_emitted1 = λ_emitted2 * (1 + v_r2 / c)`.\n    *   Now we can find the temperature ratio: `T1 / T2 = λ_emitted2 / λ_emitted1 = λ_emitted2 / (λ_emitted2 * (1 + v_r2 / c)) = 1 / (1 + v_r2 / c)`.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the radius and temperature ratios into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    `L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * (1 / (1 + v_r2 / c))⁴`\n    Using the provided values (`v_r2 = 700 km/s`) and the speed of light (`c`), we perform the calculation. The code execution provides the precise result.\n\n    The code output `2.229107561148499` is the numerical solution. When we compare this value to the given options:\n    *   A) ~2.23\n    *   B) ~2.25\n    *   C) ~2.35\n    *   D) ~2.32\n\n    The calculated result, `2.229...`, rounds to `2.23`.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nThe problem has been solved. The detailed derivation and calculation have been performed in previous turns. Here is a final summary of the logic.\n\n**Summary of Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio:** The ratio of luminosities for two blackbody stars is given by `L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4`. We are given `R1/R2 = 1.5`, so this becomes `L1 / L2 = 2.25 * (T1/T2)^4`.\n2.  **Temperature Ratio:** The key is to find the ratio of the true surface temperatures (`T1/T2`). We are told the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (`λ_obs1 = λ_obs2`).\n3.  **Doppler Shift:** Star_1 has zero velocity, so its observed peak wavelength is its true emitted wavelength (`λ_obs1 = λ_emit1`). Star_2 is moving away at `v2 = 700 km/s`, so its emitted light is redshifted. Its observed wavelength is `λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c)`.\n4.  **Connecting Wavelengths and Temperatures:** Since `λ_obs1 = λ_obs2`, it follows that `λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c)`. Using Wien's Law (`λ_emit ∝ 1/T`), we find that `1/T1 ∝ (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c)`, which simplifies to `T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)`.\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Substituting the temperature ratio into the luminosity ratio gives `L1 / L2 = 2.25 / (1 + v2/c)^4`. Using `v2 = 700 km/s` and `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`, the calculation yields a value of approximately `2.229`.\n\nThis result corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nThe ratio of the luminosities of two stars radiating as black bodies is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁ / R₂)² * (T₁ / T₂)⁴\n\nWe need to determine the ratios (R₁ / R₂) and (T₁ / T₂).\n\n**1. Radius Ratio**\nThe problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2:\nR₁ = 1.5 * R₂\nTherefore, the ratio of the radii squared is:\n(R₁ / R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n**2. Temperature Ratio**\nThe temperature is related to the peak emission wavelength by Wien's Displacement Law:\nT = b / λ_emitted_max\nwhere 'b' is a constant and λ_emitted_max is the wavelength emitted by the star at its rest frame.\nThe ratio of the temperatures is:\nT₁ / T₂ = (b / λ_emitted_max,₁) / (b / λ_emitted_max,₂) = λ_emitted_max,₂ / λ_emitted_max,₁\n\nThe problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (λ_obs_max,₁ = λ_obs_max,₂). The observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength by the Doppler effect:\nλ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r / c)\nwhere v_r is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light.\n\nFor Star_1: v_r,₁ = 0 km/s.\nλ_obs_max,₁ = λ_emitted_max,₁ * (1 + 0/c) = λ_emitted_max,₁\n\nFor Star_2: v_r,₂ = 700 km/s.\nλ_obs_max,₂ = λ_emitted_max,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂ / c)\n\nSince λ_obs_max,₁ = λ_obs_max,₂:\nλ_emitted_max,₁ = λ_emitted_max,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂ / c)\n\nNow we can find the ratio of emitted wavelengths needed for the temperature ratio:\nλ_emitted_max,₂ / λ_emitted_max,₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂ / c)\n\nTherefore, the temperature ratio is:\nT₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂ / c)\n\n**3.

This relates luminosity to the star's radius (R) and its surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n    *   L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    *   Where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio**: To find the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars (L₁/L₂), we can set up the following equation:\n    *   L₁/L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). Therefore, the ratio of their radii squared is:\n    *   (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio**: To find the temperature ratio, we use the information that the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared brightest* are the same.

This peak wavelength is related to the star's surface temperature by Wien's Displacement Law.\n    *   The information on radial velocities is crucial here. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, so its observed peak wavelength (λ_obs,₁) is the same as its emitted peak wavelength (λ_emit,₁).\n    *   Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, meaning it is moving away from the observer. This causes its emitted light to be redshifted due to the Doppler effect. The observed wavelength is longer than the emitted wavelength. For non-relativistic speeds, the formula is λ_obs ≈ λ_emit * (1 + v/c).\n    *   Since λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂, we can write: λ_emit,₁ = λ_emit,₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n\n5.  **Connecting Temperature and Wavelength**: Wien's Law states that the emitted peak wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature (λ_emit = b/T), where 'b' is Wien's constant.
