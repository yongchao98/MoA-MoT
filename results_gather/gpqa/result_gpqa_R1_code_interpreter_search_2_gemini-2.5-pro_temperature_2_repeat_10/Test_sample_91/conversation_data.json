    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to calculate the enthalpy of formation of the given compound.\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Molar Mass**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the chemical formula of the compound `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`.\n\n*   Count Carbon (C) atoms:\n    *   `(CH3)2C=`: 1 C + 2 C from two CH3 groups = 3 C\n    *   `=CH-`: 1 C\n    *   `-CH2-`: 1 C\n    *   `-CH(CH3)-`: 1 C in the chain + 1 C in the methyl group = 2 C\n    *   `-CH2-`: 1 C\n    *   `-CH=`: 1 C\n    *   `=C(CH3)2`: 1 C + 2 C from two CH3 groups = 3 C\n    *   Total Carbon atoms = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 C\n\n*   Count Hydrogen (H) atoms:\n    *   `(CH3)2C=`: 2 * 3 H = 6 H\n    *   `=CH-`: 1 H\n    *   `-CH2-`: 2 H\n    *   `-CH(CH3)-`: 1 H in the chain + 3 H in the methyl group = 4 H\n    *   `-CH2-`: 2 H\n    *   `-CH=`: 1 H\n    *   `=C(CH3)2`: 2 * 3 H = 6 H\n    *   Total Hydrogen atoms = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 H\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n*   Calculate the molar mass (M) of C12H22 (using atomic masses C ≈ 12 g/mol, H ≈ 1 g/mol):\n    *   M = (12 * 12) + (22 * 1) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\n**2. Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\nWe need to count the single carbon-carbon (C-C), double carbon-carbon (C=C), and carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds.\n\n*   **C-H bonds**: The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C bonds**: The structure `(CH3)2C=CH-...-CH=C(CH3)2` clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds**: For an acyclic (non-cyclic) molecule, the total number of bonds is the total number of atoms minus 1.\n    *   Total atoms = 12 (C) + 22 (H) = 34\n    *   Total bonds = 34 - 1 = 33\n    *   Total bonds = (Number of C-C) + (Number of C=C) + (Number of C-H)\n    *   33 = (Number of C-C) + 2 + 22\n    *   Number of C-C bonds = 33 - 24 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization of the compound is the energy required to break all of its bonds. It's the sum of the bond energies of all bonds in one mole of the molecule.\nΔH_atomization(compound) = (9 × BE(C-C)) + (2 × BE(C=C)) + (22 × BE(C-H))\nUsing the given values:\n*   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atomization(compound) = (9 × 200) + (2 × 300) + (22 × 400)\nΔH_atomization(compound) = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Enthalpy of Atomization of the Constituent Elements**\n\nThis is the enthalpy change for converting the elements in their standard states to gaseous atoms.\nThe reaction is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)\n\n*   **For Carbon**: The enthalpy of atomization of carbon is given as ΔH_a(C) = 1000 kJ/mol.\n    *   For 12 moles of C: 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ.\n*   **For Hydrogen**: The bond energy of H-H is given as 100 kJ/mol. This is the energy to break one mole of H2 molecules into two moles of H atoms (H2 → 2H).\n    *   The enthalpy of atomization of hydrogen is the energy to form one mole of H atoms from H2, which is (1/2)H2 → H.\n    *   ΔH_a(H) = (BE(H-H)) / 2 = 100 kJ/mol / 2 = 50 kJ/mol.\n    *   For 22 moles of H: 22 mol × 50 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ.\n\n*   Total enthalpy of atomization of elements = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f) of the Compound**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is calculated using the following formula:\nΔH_f = (Total enthalpy of atomization of elements) - (Enthalpy of atomization of compound)\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n**6. Convert the Enthalpy of Formation to kJ/g**\n\nThe question provides options in different units. We calculated ΔH_f in kJ/mol. Let's convert it to kJ/g using the molar mass (166 g/mol).\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**.\n\n**7. Compare with the Options**\n\n*   A) 11.44 kJ/g\n*   B) 67.4 kJ/mol\n*   C) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, not formation)\n*   D) 1900 kJ/g (The numerical value matches our result in kJ/mol, but the unit is incorrect)\n\nOur calculated value of 11.45 kJ/g matches option A almost exactly.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nH_atom_C = 1000  # kJ/mol, Enthalpy of atomization of carbon\nBE_HH = 100  # kJ/mol, Bond energy of H-H\nBE_CC_single = 200  # kJ/mol\nBE_CC_double = 300  # kJ/mol\nBE_CH = 400  # kJ/mol\n\n# Molecular formula derived from the name: C12H22\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\n\n# Molar Mass (approximate)\nmolar_mass_C = 12  # g/mol\nmolar_mass_H = 1  # g/mol\ntotal_molar_mass = num_C * molar_mass_C + num_H * molar_mass_H\n\n# Number of bonds\n# For an acyclic molecule, total bonds = num_atoms - 1\ntotal_atoms = num_C + num_H\ntotal_bonds = total_atoms - 1\n# From the structure (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\nnum_CH_bonds = 22\nnum_CC_double_bonds = 2\nnum_CC_single_bonds = total_bonds - num_CH_bonds - num_CC_double_bonds\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate enthalpy of atomization of the compound ---\n# This is the sum of all bond energies in the molecule\n# Formula: C12H22(g) -> 12C(g) + 22H(g)\nH_atom_compound = (num_CC_single_bonds * BE_CC_single) + \\\n                  (num_CC_double_bonds * BE_CC_double) + \\\n                  (num_CH_bonds * BE_CH)\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate enthalpy of atomization of the elements ---\n# Energy to convert elements in standard state to gaseous atoms\n# Formula: 12C(s) + 11H2(g) -> 12C(g) + 22H(g)\n# Enthalpy of atomization of H is half the H-H bond energy\nH_atom_H = BE_HH / 2\nH_atom_elements = (num_C * H_atom_C) + (num_H * H_atom_H)\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate the enthalpy of formation of the compound ---\n# ΔH_f = Σ(ΔH_atomization_elements) - Σ(ΔH_atomization_compound)\nH_formation_mol = H_atom_elements - H_atom_compound\n\n# --- Step 4: Convert enthalpy of formation to kJ/g ---\nH_formation_gram = H_formation_mol / total_molar_mass\n\nprint(f\"Number of C-C single bonds: {num_CC_single_bonds}\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of atomization of compound: {H_atom_compound} kJ/mol\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of atomization of elements: {H_atom_elements} kJ/mol\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation: {H_formation_mol} kJ/mol\")\nprint(f\"Molar Mass: {total_molar_mass} g/mol\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation: {H_formation_gram} kJ/g\")\n```\n>>>\nNumber of C-C single bonds: 9\nEnthalpy of atomization of compound: 11200 kJ/mol\nEnthalpy of atomization of elements: 13100.0 kJ/mol\nEnthalpy of formation: 1900.0 kJ/mol\nMolar Mass: 166 g/mol\nEnthalpy of formation: 11.44578313253012 kJ/g\n<<<A>>>",
