    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Functional Groups and Core Structure from the given data:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring (C6) with two substituents attached. The base for the aromatic portion is C6H4. This part of the molecule contributes 4 hydrogens (aromatic-H). The presence of the ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (DBE).\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group, which means there are 2 oxygen atoms in the molecule. All the given formula options have O2, which is consistent. The carbonyl group (C=O) in the ester adds 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **1H NMR - No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a key piece of information. It eliminates any ethyl, propyl, or other groups containing a methylene (-CH2-) unit.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR signals to identify the substituents:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** In a di-substituted benzene ring, a 1,4- (para) substitution pattern often results in two distinct signals (an AA'BB' system, which appears as two doublets), corresponding to the 4 aromatic protons. This fits the description.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets) and one of the –CH3 signals:** This specific splitting pattern is highly indicative of a propenyl group, specifically `-CH=CH-CH3`, attached to the aromatic ring.\n        *   Let's label the protons: `Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3(c)`.\n        *   The vinyl proton `H(a)` is adjacent to `H(b)`, so it will be split into a **doublet**.\n        *   The vinyl proton `H(b)` is adjacent to `H(a)` (a doublet) and the three `H(c)` protons (a quartet). This results in a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   The methyl protons `H(c)` are adjacent to `H(b)`, so they would appear as a doublet. This accounts for one of the two `-CH3` signals.\n        *   This propenyl group substituent (`-C3H5`) has one C=C double bond, which adds 1 degree of unsaturation. It contributes 2 vinyl-H and 3 methyl-H to the total hydrogen count.\n    *   **The second –CH3 signal:** We still need to account for one more `-CH3` group and the ester functional group. The simplest way to combine these without introducing a `-CH2-` group is to have a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate group (`-O-CO-CH3`). In either case, this fragment adds a `-CH3` group (which would be a singlet in the NMR) and the ester's core atoms (C and O).\n\n3.  **Assemble the pieces and calculate the molecular formula:**\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** C6H4\n    *   **Substituent 1 (Propenyl group):** -C3H5 (`-CH=CH-CH3`)\n    *   **Substituent 2 (Ester part):** We have the `-COO-` from the ester and the second `-CH3` group. This forms a `-COOCH3` or `-OCOCH3` group, which can be represented as C2H3O2 in terms of atoms being added to the ring.\n\n    Let's sum the atoms from these fragments:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = **11 Carbons**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from C2H3O2) = **12 Hydrogens**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2 Oxygens**\n\n    The calculated molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify with Degrees of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    *   DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   The proposed structure contains a benzene ring (DBE=4), one C=C double bond (DBE=1), and one C=O double bond (DBE=1).\n    *   Total DBE from structure = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    *   The calculated DBE from the formula matches the expected DBE from the structure, confirming our assignment.\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) C12H12O2\n    *   B) C12H14O2 (Contains a -CH2- group compared to our structure, which is ruled out)\n    *   C) C11H12O2 (Matches our derived formula)\n    *   D) C11H14O2 (This would have a DBE of 5, inconsistent with the structure)\n\nThe only formula that perfectly fits all the provided spectroscopic data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
