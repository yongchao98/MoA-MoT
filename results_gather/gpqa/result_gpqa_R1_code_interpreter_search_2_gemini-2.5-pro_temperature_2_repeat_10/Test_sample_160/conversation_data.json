    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the definition of Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula for the mean free path is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"area\" that one particle presents to another for a collision to occur.\n\n2.  **Analyze the first scenario (λ1): Gas-Gas Collisions**\n    *   In this case, we are considering the mean free path of gas molecules colliding with other gas molecules.\n    *   The moving particles are gas molecules.\n    *   The target particles are also gas molecules.\n    *   Let's call the collision cross-section for this interaction σ1 (or σ_gas-gas). This is the *kinetic cross-section*, determined primarily by the physical size of the molecules and the short-range forces between them (like van der Waals forces).\n    *   The number density of the gas molecules is `n`.\n    *   So, λ1 = 1 / (n * σ1).\n\n3.  **Analyze the second scenario (λ2): Electron-Gas Collisions**\n    *   In this case, we are considering the mean free path of electrons (from the beam) scattering off the residual gas molecules.\n    *   The moving particles are electrons.\n    *   The target particles are the gas molecules.\n    *   Let's call the collision cross-section for this interaction σ2 (or σ_electron-gas). This is the *electron scattering cross-section*.\n    *   The number density of the target gas molecules, `n`, is the **same** as in the first scenario because the temperature and pressure in the sample compartment have not changed.\n    *   So, λ2 = 1 / (n * σ2).\n\n4.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ1 vs. σ2)**\n    *   The key to comparing λ1 and λ2 is to compare σ1 and σ2.\n    *   **σ1 (Gas-Gas):** This interaction is between two neutral molecules. A \"collision\" happens when they get very close to each other, essentially bumping into each other. The interaction force (van der Waals) is very short-ranged. The cross-section is related to the physical radius of the molecules.\n    *   **σ2 (Electron-Gas):** This interaction is between a charged particle (the electron) and a neutral atom/molecule. The gas molecule, while overall neutral, consists of a positively charged nucleus and a cloud of negatively charged electrons. The incoming electron interacts with this charge distribution via the long-range electromagnetic (Coulomb) force. An electron can be significantly deflected (i.e., \"scattered\" or \"collided with\") without getting physically close to the nucleus. It is affected by the atom's electric field from a much larger distance.\n    *   Because the Coulomb force is long-range, the effective target area an atom presents to an electron (σ2) is significantly **larger** than the physical area it presents to another neutral atom (σ1).\n    *   Therefore, we can conclude: **σ2 > σ1**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Relationship between λ1 and λ2**\n    *   We have the equations:\n        *   λ1 = 1 / (n * σ1)\n        *   λ2 = 1 / (n * σ2)\n    *   Since `n` is the same for both, and we have established that σ2 > σ1, we can see the relationship by looking at the inverse proportionality.\n    *   If the denominator (n * σ) is larger, the resulting mean free path (λ) will be smaller.\n    *   Since (n * σ2) > (n * σ1), it follows that **λ2 < λ1**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    The mean free path of electrons scattering off gas molecules (λ2) is shorter than the mean free path of gas molecules colliding with each other (λ1). This is because the electron-gas scattering cross-section is larger than the gas-gas kinetic cross-section. Mike's observation is consistent with physical principles.\n\n<<<D>>>"
