    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of strong acid required to dissolve the iron(III) hydroxide and to maintain the resulting solution at a pH low enough to prevent re-precipitation. The process involves stoichiometry and equilibrium calculations.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n**Step 1: Write down the chemical reaction.**\nIron(III) hydroxide, a solid base, reacts with a strong acid (represented by H+) in a neutralization reaction:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃.**\nFirst, we need the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃.\nMolar Mass (Fe) = 55.845 g/mol\nMolar Mass (O) = 15.999 g/mol\nMolar Mass (H) = 1.008 g/mol\nMolar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the moles of Fe(OH)₃ from the given mass:\nMoles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol = 0.00093576 mol\n\n**Step 3: Determine the concentration of Fe³⁺ ions in the final solution.**\nWhen 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ is completely dissolved, it produces 0.00093576 moles of Fe³⁺ ions. The final volume of the solution is given as 100 cm³, which is equal to 0.1 L.\nConcentration of Fe³⁺, [Fe³⁺] = Moles / Volume = 0.00093576 mol / 0.1 L = 0.0093576 M\n\n**Step 4: Determine the total amount of H⁺ required.**\nThe total moles of H⁺ ions needed from the strong acid serve two purposes:\n1.  **To react with Fe(OH)₃:** Based on the stoichiometry of the reaction (1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺), the moles of H⁺ required for the reaction are:\n    Moles H⁺ (reaction) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.00093576 mol = 0.00280728 mol.\n\n2.  **To remain in the solution to keep the pH acidic:** The problem states that the Fe(OH)₃ is dissolved. This means the solution is at or below saturation. The condition for dissolution is defined by the solubility product constant, Kₛₚ, for Fe(OH)₃:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    Kₛₚ = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n\n    To find the pH of the final solution, we would need the Kₛₚ value. However, the options provide pairs of (pH, Volume). We can use this to our advantage. For a given pH, we can calculate the moles of H⁺ remaining in the solution and then determine the total volume of acid needed. The correct option will have a self-consistent set of values.\n\n    The moles of H⁺ remaining in the final 100 cm³ solution are:\n    Moles H⁺ (remaining) = [H⁺]final × Final Volume = (10⁻ᵖᴴ) × 0.1 L\n\nThe total moles of H⁺ to be added are the sum of the moles used in the reaction and the moles remaining in solution:\nTotal Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reaction) + Moles H⁺ (remaining)\nTotal Moles H⁺ = 0.00280728 + (10⁻ᵖᴴ × 0.1)\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the required volume of the strong acid.**\nThe volume of the 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed can be calculated as:\nVolume of acid (L) = Total Moles H⁺ / Concentration of acid = (0.00280728 + (10⁻ᵖᴴ × 0.1)) / 0.1 M\nVolume of acid (cm³) = Volume of acid (L) × 1000\n\n**Step 6: Test the given options.**\nLet's substitute the pH from each option into our formula for the volume and see if it matches the volume given in the same option.\n\n**For Option D: pH = 2.04; V = 28.05 cm³**\n*   [H⁺]final = 10⁻².⁰⁴ M ≈ 0.00912 M\n*   Moles H⁺ (remaining) = 0.00912 M × 0.1 L = 0.000912 mol\n*   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.00280728 + 0.000912 = 0.00371928 mol\n*   Calculated Volume of acid (cm³) = (0.00371928 mol / 0.1 M) × 1000 = 37.19 cm³\n\nThe calculated volume (37.19 cm³) does not match the given volume (28.05 cm³). This suggests there is another factor to consider: the added acid volume contributes to the final solution volume. The final volume is fixed at 100 cm³, but this is composed of the acid we add (V_acid) and some initial water (V_water).\n\nLet V_a be the required volume of acid in cm³. The total volume is V_T = 100 cm³.\nLet's refine the calculation with the following relationship, which expresses the concentration of remaining H+ ions in the final mixture.\nFinal [H⁺] = (Initial moles of H⁺ - Moles of H⁺ reacted) / Final Volume\n[H⁺] = ( (V_a/1000) * 0.1 M - 0.00280728) / 0.1 L\n\nNow, let's re-test the options with this more accurate relationship.\n\n**For Option B: pH = 2.69; V = 30.09 cm³**\n*   Given V_a = 30.09 cm³\n*   Calculate the expected final [H⁺]:\n    [H⁺] = ( (30.09/1000) * 0.1 - 0.00280728) / 0.1\n    [H⁺] = (0.003009 - 0.00280728) / 0.1\n    [H⁺] = 0.00020172 / 0.1 = 0.0020172 M\n*   Calculate the expected pH from this concentration:\n    pH = -log₁₀(0.0020172) ≈ 2.695\n\nThis calculated pH (2.695) is extremely close to the pH given in option B (2.69). Let's verify with another option for completeness.\n\n**For Option D: pH = 2.04; V = 28.05 cm³**\n*   Given V_a = 28.05 cm³\n*   Calculate the expected final [H⁺]:\n    [H⁺] = ( (28.05/1000) * 0.1 - 0.00280728) / 0.1\n    [H⁺] = (0.002805 - 0.00280728) / 0.1\n    [H⁺] = -0.00000228 / 0.1 = -0.0000228 M\nA negative concentration is impossible. This indicates that 28.05 cm³ of acid is not even enough to neutralize the Fe(OH)₃, let alone result in a pH of 2.04.\n\nBased on the consistent calculation, option B provides the correct pair of pH and volume.\n\n<<<B>>>"
