    "This question asks for the set of assumptions that collectively define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. The core idea of this approximation is to simplify a complex many-body interaction (e.g., a projectile hitting a nucleus) into a much simpler one-body interaction, treating the target nucleon as if it were a free particle.\n\nLet's analyze each of the four statements:\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"**\n    *   This is a foundational tenet of the impulse approximation. It assumes that the projectile (like an electron or a neutrino) interacts with a single nucleon inside the nucleus at a time. It neglects more complex possibilities, such as the current interacting with the particles that carry the nuclear force (mesons) or with correlated clusters of nucleons. This simplifies the many-body interaction vertex to a one-body vertex. This statement is **correct**.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"**\n    *   This refers to the journey of the projectile before the interaction and the journey of the ejected particles after the interaction. It assumes that the projectile's path is not deflected by the other nucleons on its way to the target nucleon (no initial-state interactions) and that the ejected particles fly out without scattering off the remaining nucleons (no final-state interactions). This is a crucial simplifying assumption, often referred to as the \"plane-wave\" aspect of the approximation (as in Plane Wave Impulse Approximation, or PWIA). This statement is **correct**.\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"**\n    *   This statement concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself, not its behavior within the nuclear environment during an interaction. The impulse approximation operates at the level of nucleons, treating them as the fundamental interacting particles (though their internal structure can be described by a form factor). The validity of the impulse approximation does not depend on whether the quarks inside the nucleon are relativistic or not. Therefore, this statement is **not** a defining assumption of the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"**\n    *   This is the essence of the \"impulse\" concept. The approximation assumes that the interaction happens over such an extremely short time scale that the binding forces holding the nucleon within the nucleus are negligible *during* the collision. The momentum transferred is considered to be delivered in a sharp \"impulse,\" so the nucleon recoils as if it were a free particle, only remembering its initial momentum state within the nucleus. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe three assumptions that jointly define the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4. These assumptions allow physicists to treat a nucleon inside a nucleus as a \"quasi-free\" particle for the purpose of calculating an interaction. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
