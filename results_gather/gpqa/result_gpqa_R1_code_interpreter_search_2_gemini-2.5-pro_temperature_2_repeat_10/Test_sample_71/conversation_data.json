    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, 4, and count its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactant 1:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. This is a norbornadiene derivative. Norbornadienes are excellent dienophiles in Diels-Alder reactions.\n*   **Reactant 2:** 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and Sodium Iodide (NaI). The structure `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` is a precursor to a highly reactive intermediate. Treatment with NaI causes debromination to form o-quinodimethane (also known as 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene). This o-quinodimethane is an excellent diene for Diels-Alder reactions.\n*   **Reaction:** The in-situ generated o-quinodimethane acts as the diene, and the norbornadiene derivative acts as the dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction. The two double bonds of the norbornadiene system are equivalent. The o-quinodimethane will react with one of them. Due to steric hindrance from the bulky tert-butoxy group at the C7 position, the cycloaddition will occur from the *exo* face of the norbornadiene system, away from the tert-butoxy group.\n\n    The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition. The four carbons of the o-quinodimethane diene system react with two carbons from one of the double bonds of the norbornadiene dienophile. The resulting product, **1**, has a complex polycyclic skeleton with the tert-butoxy group pointing away from the newly formed six-membered ring.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product **1** is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard condition for the acidic deprotection of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group is cleaved, leaving a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Product 2:** The structure of **2** is identical to **1**, but the tert-butoxy group is replaced by a hydroxyl group.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product **2** is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO. This reagent system (SO₃•py complex in DMSO) is known for the Parikh-Doering oxidation. This is a mild oxidation method that converts primary and secondary alcohols into aldehydes and ketones, respectively, without over-oxidation.\n*   **Product 3:** The secondary alcohol in product **2** is oxidized to a ketone. The hydroxyl group becomes a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product **3** is heated to 150 °C. Product **3** is a Diels-Alder adduct of benzene and a dienophile (the original norbornadiene double bond). Diels-Alder reactions are often reversible. At elevated temperatures, a retro-Diels-Alder reaction can occur.\n*   **Product 4:** The molecule undergoes a retro-Diels-Alder reaction, breaking apart into two stable molecules. The cycloadduct cleaves to regenerate benzene and a bicyclic ketone. The structure of the final product, **4**, is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-2-one.\n\n**Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to analyze the symmetry of bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-2-one (product 4) to determine the number of unique hydrogen environments.\n\nThe structure of bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-2-one is:\n```\n      H(c)   H(d)\n      /       \\\n  C(7)---------C(1)-C(2)=O\n /   \\         /\nH(e)-C(6)=C(5)-H(e')\n \\   /\n  C(4)\n  / \\\nH(a) H(b)\n```\nLet's assign hydrogens:\n*   **C1:** Bridgehead carbon, bonded to C2(=O), C6, and C7. It has one hydrogen, **H(a)**.\n*   **C3:** This carbon is adjacent to the carbonyl group. It has two hydrogens. They are diastereotopic: one is *exo* (**H(b)**) and one is *endo* (**H(c)**). They are in different chemical environments relative to the rest of the molecule.\n*   **C4:** The other bridgehead carbon, bonded to C3, C5, and C7. It has one hydrogen, **H(d)**.\n*   **C5:** Vinylic carbon, has one hydrogen **H(e)**.\n*   **C6:** The other vinylic carbon, has one hydrogen **H(f)**.\n*   **C7:** Bridge carbon, has two hydrogens. These two hydrogens are diastereotopic. The one pointing towards the double bond (*syn*) is **H(g)**, and the one pointing away (*anti*) is **H(h)**.\n\nThe molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion that would make pairs of these hydrogens equivalent. Therefore, all eight labeled hydrogens are chemically distinct.\n\nLet's list the unique protons:\n1.  H(a) on C1\n2.  H(b) on C3 (*exo*)\n3.  H(c) on C3 (*endo*)\n4.  H(d) on C4\n5.  H(e) on C5\n6.  H(f) on C6\n7.  H(g) on C7 (*syn*)\n8.  H(h) on C7 (*anti*)\n\nThere are a total of **8** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<C>>>"
