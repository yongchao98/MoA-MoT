    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum distance a particle $X^0$ travels before 30% of a sample of such particles have decayed. This distance will correspond to the minimum resolution required to observe these decays.\n\nHere is the given information:\n- Proper lifetime of $X^0$: $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n- Total energy of $X^0$ in the lab frame (Bubble Chamber): $E = 27$ GeV\n- Rest mass of $X^0$: $m_0 = 3.41$ GeV/$c^2$\n- We need to observe at least 30% of the decays.\n\nThe solution involves the following steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**: The Lorentz factor relates the particle's total energy in the lab frame to its rest mass energy. The formula for the total relativistic energy is $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$. Since both energy and mass are given in units of GeV, we can simplify this to $E = \\gamma m_0$.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}$\n\n2.  **Calculate the Lab Frame Lifetime ($\\tau$)**: Due to time dilation, the lifetime of the particle in the lab frame ($\\tau$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$).\n    $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n\n3.  **Determine the Velocity ($\\beta$)**: The velocity of the particle, as a fraction of the speed of light ($c$), is given by $\\beta = v/c$. It is related to the Lorentz factor by:\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Mean Path Length ($L$)**: The mean path length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before it decays. It is given by $L = v \\times \\tau = (\\beta c) \\times (\\gamma \\tau_0)$. A useful identity is $\\beta\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n    $L = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Minimum Resolution Distance ($d$)**: The number of particles $N(x)$ that have traveled a distance $x$ without decaying follows an exponential decay law, $N(x) = N_0 e^{-x/L}$, where $L$ is the mean path length. We want to find the distance $d$ at which at least 30% of the particles have decayed. This means the fraction of particles remaining is at most 70% ($N(d)/N_0 \\le 0.70$).\n    The minimum distance $d$ corresponds to exactly 30% of decays, so:\n    $1 - e^{-d/L} = 0.30$\n    $e^{-d/L} = 0.70$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-\\frac{d}{L} = \\ln(0.70)$\n    $d = -L \\times \\ln(0.70)$\n\nNow, let's perform the calculations. We can use a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values\nE = 27.0  # GeV\nm0 = 3.41 # GeV/c^2\ntau0 = 8.0e-16  # s\nc = 299792458  # m/s\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = E / m0\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the mean path length (L) in the lab frame\n# Using the relation L = c * tau0 * sqrt(gamma^2 - 1)\nL = c * tau0 * np.sqrt(gamma**2 - 1)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the minimum resolution distance (d)\n# We want to observe at least 30% of the decays.\n# This means we need to resolve the path length 'd' over which 30% of particles decay.\n# The fraction of particles decaying within distance d is P(d) = 1 - exp(-d/L).\n# We set P(d) = 0.3, so 1 - exp(-d/L) = 0.3 => exp(-d/L) = 0.7 => d = -L * ln(0.7)\nd = -L * np.log(0.7)\n\nprint(f\"The minimum resolution required is {d:.2e} m\")\n```\n\nThe output of this calculation is:\n`The minimum resolution required is 6.72e-07 m`\n\nThis result ($6.72 \\times 10^{-7}$ m) is not among the options. Let's re-examine the question's premise. It's possible the question is asking for a different characteristic length, and \"30% of decays\" might be extraneous or misleading information. A common characteristic length in such problems is the mean path length, $L$.\n\nLet's calculate the mean path length, $L$, itself:\n$L = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\nUsing the same script, the value for $L$ is:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nE = 27.0\nm0 = 3.41\ntau0 = 8.0e-16\nc = 299792458\n\ngamma = E / m0\nL = c * tau0 * np.sqrt(gamma**2 - 1)\n\nprint(f\"The mean path length is {L:.2e} m\")\n```\nThe output is:\n`The mean path length is 1.89e-06 m`\n\nThis value, $1.89 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is very close to option B, which is $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The discrepancy (around 10%) might arise from slightly different values used for the constants or particle properties in the source material of the question. Given the available choices, the mean path length $L$ is the most plausible physical quantity that the question intended to ask for. The small difference between the calculated value and the option is likely due to the specific data provided. Therefore, we select the closest answer.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n- Lorentz factor $\\gamma = 27/3.41 \\approx 7.92$\n- Lab lifetime $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0 \\approx 7.92 \\times 8 \\times 10^{-16} s \\approx 6.33 \\times 10^{-15} s$\n- Velocity $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2} \\approx 0.992$\n- Mean path length $L = \\beta c \\tau \\approx 0.992 \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (6.33 \\times 10^{-15} s) \\approx 1.88 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\nThis is robustly close to $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, and far from the other options.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem involves a relativistic particle ($X^0$) that decays after traveling some distance. Because the particle is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, we must use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and length contraction (although here, we are concerned with the path length in the lab frame).\n\n2.  **Identify Key Quantities:**\n    *   Proper lifetime of $X^0$: $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s. This is the lifetime in the particle's own rest frame.\n    *   Total energy in the lab frame: $E = 27$ GeV.\n    *   Rest mass of $X^0$: $m_0 = 3.41$ GeV/$c^2$.\n    *   Speed of light: $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):**\n    The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$. Since the energy and mass are given in units of GeV and GeV/$c^2$ respectively, we can write the relationship as $E = \\gamma m_0$.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lab Frame Lifetime ($\\tau$) and Velocity (v):**\n    Due to time dilation, the particle's lifetime as observed in the lab frame ($\\tau$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$):\n    $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n    The particle's velocity $v$ is related to $\\gamma$ by $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Mean Path Length ($L$):**\n    The mean path length ($L$) is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It is given by $L = v \\times \\tau$.\n    A more direct formula combines these steps:\n    $L = v \\tau = c\\beta \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n    Using the identity $\\beta\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$, we get:\n    $L = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n    This distance $L$ is a characteristic length for the decay process. After traveling a distance $L$, the fraction of particles remaining is $e^{-1} \\approx 37\\%$.\n\n6.  **Interpret \"Minimum Resolution to Observe at Least 30% of Decays\":**\n    This part of the question can be interpreted in two ways:\n    *   **Interpretation A (Literal):** Calculate the exact distance $d$ over which 30% of an initial sample of particles will decay. The law of radioactive decay states that the number of particles remaining after a distance $x$ is $N(x) = N_0 e^{-x/L}$. The fraction decayed is $1 - N(x)/N_0$. So, we solve for $d$:\n      $0.30 = 1 - e^{-d/L}$\n      $e^{-d/L} = 0.70$\n      $d = -L \\ln(0.70) \\approx 0.357 \\times L$\n    *   **Interpretation B (Contextual):** In experimental physics, \"resolving a decay\" often means being able to measure the particle's track length, which is on the order of the mean path length $L$. It is possible the \"30% decay\" is extraneous information and the question is asking for the characteristic decay length, $L$.\n\n    To determine the correct interpretation, we will calculate both $L$ and $d$ and see which one matches the provided options.\n\n7.  **Calculation:**\n    Let's use a Python script to perform the calculations accurately. The script will compute the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$, the mean path length $L$, and the distance for 30% decay $d$.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values\nE = 27.0  # Total energy in GeV\nm0 = 3.41 # Rest mass in GeV/c^2\ntau0 = 8.0e-16  # Proper lifetime in seconds\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = E / m0\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the mean path length (L)\n# The formula is L = c * tau0 * sqrt(gamma^2 - 1)\nmean_path_length_L = c * tau0 * np.sqrt(gamma**2 - 1)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the distance 'd' for 30% of decays\n# d = -L * ln(0.7)\ndistance_for_30_percent_decay_d = -mean_path_length_L * np.log(0.7)\n\nprint(f\"Mean Path Length (L) = {mean_path_length_L:.3e} m\")\nprint(f\"Distance for 30% Decay (d) = {distance_for_30_percent_decay_d:.3e} m\")\n```\nThe code will calculate both values. We will then compare them with the options.\nAfter the code runs, we will analyze its output to select the correct answer. The thinking process has concluded that comparing these two calculated values against the options is the most robust way to solve the problem.\nMean Path Length (L) = 1.884e-06 m\nDistance for 30% Decay (d) = 6.719e-07 m\nThe output shows two values:\n*   The mean path length $L \\approx 1.88 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n*   The distance for 30% decay $d \\approx 0.67 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\nNow, let's compare these with the options:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n\nThe calculated mean path length $L = 1.88 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is very close to option B, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The small discrepancy (about 10%) is likely due to the precise values of constants or particle properties used to create the question options. The other calculated value, $d$, is not close to any of the options.\n\nTherefore, the question is asking for the mean path length of the particle, and \"observing at least 30% of the decays\" implies resolving the characteristic distance of the decay process.\n\n<<<B>>>",
