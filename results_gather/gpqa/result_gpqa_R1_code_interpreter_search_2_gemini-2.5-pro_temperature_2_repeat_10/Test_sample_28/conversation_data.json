    "This problem requires an understanding of how genetic mutations affect protein synthesis and function. The goal is to find the mutation that is most likely to produce a non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. A functional protein is synthesized by transcribing a gene's DNA into messenger RNA (mRNA) and then translating the mRNA into a sequence of amino acids. This translation process reads the mRNA in three-nucleotide units called codons.\n\nLet's analyze the impact of each mutation:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence:**\n    The gene starts with `ATG`, which is the universal start codon and codes for the amino acid Methionine. The process of translation will begin here. We can break down the initial part of the intact gene into codons:\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ... -3’`\n    *   Amino Acid Sequence: `Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly ...`\n\n2.  **Analyze Mutant 1:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ... -3’`\n    *   Comparison with Intact: The third codon `CTC` has been changed to `TAC`.\n    *   Codon `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu).\n    *   Codon `TAC` codes for Tyrosine (Tyr).\n    *   Resulting Amino Acid Sequence: `Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly ...`\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **missense mutation**, where one amino acid (Leucine) is replaced by another (Tyrosine). While this change could potentially disrupt the protein's function, it is not guaranteed. The protein might still be partially or even fully functional.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mutant 2:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ... -3’`\n    *   Comparison with Intact: The third codon `CTC` has been changed to `TAA`.\n    *   Codon `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu).\n    *   Codon `TAA` is a **STOP codon**.\n    *   Resulting Amino Acid Sequence: `Met - Phe - STOP`\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. It introduces a premature stop codon early in the gene sequence. This causes the ribosome to terminate translation, producing a severely truncated protein (only two amino acids long). A protein this short is virtually certain to be non-functional. This is the most effective way to eliminate the protein's activity.\n\n4.  **Analyze Mutant 3:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ... -3’`\n    *   Comparison with Intact: There are two changes. The third codon `CTC` is changed to `TAC` (Leu -> Tyr), and the sixth codon `ACT` is changed to `GTC` (Thr -> Val).\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **double missense mutation**. It changes two amino acids in the protein chain. While this is more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still does not guarantee a complete loss of function.\n\n5.  **Analyze Mutant 4:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT ... -3’`\n    *   Comparison with Intact: There is a missense mutation in the third codon (`CTC` to `TAC`, changing Leu to Tyr) and a deletion of the fifth codon `GGT`.\n    *   **Effect:** This is a combination of a missense mutation and an **in-frame deletion** (a deletion of 3 nucleotides). This results in a protein that has one amino acid changed and is missing another (Glycine). This is a significant alteration, but because the reading frame is maintained, the rest of the protein is translated correctly. There's a chance the protein could still retain some function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nComparing the outcomes, the nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most drastic and has the highest probability of completely knocking out the gene's function. By introducing a STOP codon near the beginning of the sequence, it ensures that no functional protein is produced. The other mutations (missense and in-frame deletion) only alter the protein and may or may not eliminate its function. Therefore, Mutant 2 is the most likely candidate to solve the problem of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
