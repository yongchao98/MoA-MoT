    "*   **Step-by-step derivation:**\n\n    1.  **Analyze Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n        *   **Reactants:** Butan-2-one is a ketone (CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH3). NaCN provides the cyanide ion (CN-), a nucleophile.\n        *   **Product:** 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile is a cyanohydrin. It has a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a nitrile group (-CN) attached to the same carbon atom that was originally the carbonyl carbon.\n        *   **Reaction Mechanism:** This is a classic example of nucleophilic addition to a carbonyl group, specifically, cyanohydrin formation.\n            *   The nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN-) attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n            *   This breaks the C=O pi bond and forms an alkoxide intermediate: CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3.\n            *   This intermediate is a base and needs to be protonated to form the final stable hydroxyl group (-OH).\n        *   **Identifying Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H+) to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. A common way to achieve this is to use an acidic medium. The notation H3O⁺ represents a generic strong acid in an aqueous solution (e.g., dilute HCl or H2SO4). NaHSO3 is used for bisulfite addition reactions, which form a different type of product, so it is incorrect here. Therefore, A should be H3O⁺.\n\n    2.  **Analyze Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n        *   **Reactants:** The starting material is a cyanohydrin, which contains a nitrile functional group (-C≡N). The reaction is performed with water (H2O).\n        *   **Product:** The product is a carboxylic acid. The nitrile group (-C≡N) has been converted to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n        *   **Reaction Mechanism:** This transformation is the hydrolysis of a nitrile. Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either strong acid or strong base.\n            *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** In the presence of a strong acid (like HCl or H2SO4) and water, the nitrile is converted first to an amide intermediate and then to a carboxylic acid and an ammonium salt.\n            *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** In the presence of a strong base (like NaOH), the nitrile is converted to a carboxylate salt, which is then protonated in a separate acidic workup step to yield the carboxylic acid.\n        *   **Identifying Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis. Looking at the options for B:\n            *   HCl (Hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and is a standard, effective catalyst for nitrile hydrolysis.\n            *   CH3COOH (Acetic acid) is a weak acid. While it could theoretically catalyze the reaction, it is much less effective and not the typical reagent for this purpose. A strong acid is required to drive the reaction to completion efficiently.\n        *   Therefore, B is most suitably HCl.\n\n    3.  **Conclusion:**\n        *   For the first reaction, A = H3O⁺ is the correct choice.\n        *   For the second reaction, B = HCl is the most appropriate choice.\n        *   Combining these, the correct option is A = H3O⁺ and B = HCl. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
