    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Express the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nThe problem provides the potential in 2D polar coordinates (r, θ):\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n\nTo simplify the problem, we should convert this potential into Cartesian coordinates (x, y). The transformation equations are:\nx = r cos(θ)\ny = r sin(θ)\nr^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\nSubstitute these into the potential expression:\n*   The first term is 1/2 kr^2, which becomes 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2).\n*   For the second term, we notice that x = r cos(θ), so x^2 = r^2 cos^2(θ). Thus, 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ) becomes 3/2 kx^2.\n\nNow, add the two terms together in Cartesian coordinates:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 kx^2\nV(x, y) = 1/2 kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2 + 3/2 kx^2\n\nCombine the terms with x^2:\nV(x, y) = (1/2 k + 3/2 k)x^2 + 1/2 ky^2\nV(x, y) = (4/2 k)x^2 + 1/2 ky^2\nV(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\n**2. Analyze the Hamiltonian**\n\nThe potential is now in a separable form, V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y), where:\n*   V_x(x) = 2kx^2\n*   V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2\n\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation in two dimensions is given by:\nHψ = Eψ\nwhere the Hamiltonian H is:\nH = -ħ^2/(2m) (∂^2/∂x^2 + ∂^2/∂y^2) + V(x, y)\n\nSubstituting our potential, we get:\nH = -ħ^2/(2m) (∂^2/∂x^2 + ∂^2/∂y^2) + 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\nH = [-ħ^2/(2m) ∂^2/∂x^2 + 2kx^2] + [-ħ^2/(2m) ∂^2/∂y^2 + 1/2 ky^2]\n\nThis shows that the total Hamiltonian is a sum of two independent one-dimensional Hamiltonians:\nH = H_x + H_y\nThis means the total energy E will be the sum of the energies from the x and y components: E = E_x + E_y.\n\n**3. Solve the 1D Quantum Harmonic Oscillator Problems**\n\nBoth H_x and H_y are Hamiltonians for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO). The standard potential for a QHO is V(q) = 1/2 mω^2 q^2, and its energy eigenvalues are E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω.\n\n*   **For the x-direction:**\n    V_x(x) = 2kx^2. We match this to the standard form 1/2 mω_x^2 x^2.\n    1/2 mω_x^2 = 2k\n    ω_x^2 = 4k/m\n    ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n    The energy eigenvalues for the x-oscillator are:\n    E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\n*   **For the y-direction:**\n    V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2. We match this to the standard form 1/2 mω_y^2 y^2.\n    1/2 mω_y^2 = 1/2 k\n    ω_y^2 = k/m\n    ω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n    The energy eigenvalues for the y-oscillator are:\n    E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of the energies for the two independent oscillators:\nE = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}\nE = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nNow, we factor out the common term ħ * sqrt(k/m):\nE = [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe quantum numbers n_x and n_y can be any non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\n**5. Compare with the Options**\n\nComparing our result with the given choices:\nA) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nB) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nC) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nD) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n\nOur derived energy spectrum E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ*sqrt(k/m) matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
