    "This problem requires a step-by-step calculation of pH at two specific points during the titration of acetic acid with sodium hydroxide.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Dilution**\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid (HA) solution after it has been diluted with water.\nInitial moles of HA = Concentration × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × (20.00 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) = 0.001 mol.\nThe new volume of the solution is 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³.\nThe new concentration of HA is Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / (40.00 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) = 0.025 M.\n\n**Step 2: pH at 25% Titration**\nThe titration reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O.\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the initial acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). This creates a buffer solution.\n*   Moles of CH₃COOH remaining = 75% of initial moles = 0.75 × 0.001 mol = 0.00075 mol.\n*   Moles of CH₃COO⁻ formed = 25% of initial moles = 0.25 × 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol.\n\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of this buffer:\npH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\nWhere [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻) and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (CH₃COOH). The ratio of concentrations is equal to the ratio of moles.\n\npKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵)\npH = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) + log(0.00025 / 0.00075)\npH = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) + log(1/3)\npH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256\n\nSo, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.\n\n**Step 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH.\nMoles of NaOH required = Moles of initial HA = 0.001 mol.\nVolume of NaOH required = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\nTotal volume of solution at equivalence point = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³.\nAt this point, the solution contains 0.001 mol of the salt, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa), in 50.00 cm³ of water.\nConcentration of acetate [A⁻] = 0.001 mol / (50.00 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) = 0.02 M.\n\nThe acetate ion is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water, producing OH⁻ ions:\nCH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\nTo find the pH, we first need to find the pOH. We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for the acetate ion.\nKb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰\n\nWe set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis:\nKb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\nLet x = [OH⁻] = [CH₃COOH] at equilibrium.\n5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\nSince Kb is very small, we can assume x is negligible compared to 0.02 M, so the expression simplifies to:\n5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\nx² = 0.02 × (5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰) = 1.081 × 10⁻¹¹\nx = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 × 10⁻⁶ M\n\nNow, we calculate pOH and then pH:\npOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\npH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 = 8.517\n\nSo, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52.\n\nCombining our results, the pH is 4.26 at 25% titration and 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option B.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given values ---\ninitial_vol_acid_cm3 = 20.00\ninitial_conc_acid_M = 0.05\nvol_water_cm3 = 20.00\nconc_naoh_M = 0.1\nKa_acid = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1e-14\n\n# --- Step 1: Dilution Calculation ---\ninitial_moles_acid = initial_conc_acid_M * (initial_vol_acid_cm3 / 1000)\ndiluted_vol_acid_L = (initial_vol_acid_cm3 + vol_water_cm3) / 1000\ndiluted_conc_acid_M = initial_moles_acid / diluted_vol_acid_L\n\n# --- Step 2: pH at 25% Titration (Buffer Region) ---\n# At 25% titration, moles_A_minus = 0.25 * initial_moles_acid\n# moles_HA = 0.75 * initial_moles_acid\n# The ratio [A-]/[HA] is the same as the mole ratio (0.25/0.75 = 1/3)\npKa = -math.log10(Ka_acid)\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(0.25 / 0.75)\n\n# --- Step 3: pH at Equivalence Point ---\n# Moles NaOH needed = initial moles of acid\nvol_naoh_eq_L = initial_moles_acid / conc_naoh_M\n# Total volume at equivalence point\ntotal_vol_eq_L = diluted_vol_acid_L + vol_naoh_eq_L\n# Moles of conjugate base (A-) formed = initial moles of acid\nconc_A_minus_at_eq = initial_moles_acid / total_vol_eq_L\n# Calculate Kb for the conjugate base\nKb_A_minus = Kw / Ka_acid\n# Calculate [OH-] from hydrolysis: Kb = [OH-][HA]/[A-] => Kb = x^2 / (C - x)\n# Assuming C >> x, so Kb = x^2 / C\nconc_OH = math.sqrt(Kb_A_minus * conc_A_minus_at_eq)\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(conc_OH)\npH_eq = 14 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem requires a step-by-step calculation of pH at two specific points during the titration of diluted acetic acid with sodium hydroxide.\n\n**1. Initial Dilution of Acetic Acid**\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid (CH₃COOH or HA) after it's diluted with water.\n*   **Initial Moles of Acetic Acid:**\n    *   Volume = 20.00 cm³ = 0.0200 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.05 M\n    *   Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.0200 L = 0.0010 mol\n\n*   **New Volume after Dilution:**\n    *   Volume = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L\n\n*   **New Concentration of Acetic Acid:**\n    *   This is the starting concentration for the titration.\n    *   Concentration = Moles / New Volume = 0.0010 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M\n\n**2. pH at 25% Titration**\nAt this point, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa or A⁻). This creates a buffer solution containing both the weak acid (HA) and its conjugate base (A⁻).\n\nThe reaction is: CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n\n*   Moles of CH₃COO⁻ (A⁻) formed = 25% of initial moles = 0.25 × 0.0010 mol = 0.00025 mol\n*   Moles of CH₃COOH (HA) remaining = 75% of initial moles = 0.75 × 0.0010 mol = 0.00075 mol\n\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\npH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n\n*   **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   Ka = 1.85 × 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log₁₀(Ka) = -log₁₀(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   The ratio of concentrations [A⁻]/[HA] is equal to the ratio of their moles.\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log₁₀(0.00025 / 0.00075) = 4.733 + log₁₀(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, **pH ≈ 4.26**.\n\n**3. pH at the Equivalence Point**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, and the solution contains only sodium acetate (CH₃COONa) dissolved in water. The acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) is a weak base and will hydrolyze, making the solution basic.\n\n*   **Moles of Acetate (A⁻):**\n    *   At the equivalence point, moles of A⁻ = initial moles of HA = 0.0010 mol\n\n*   **Volume at Equivalence Point:**\n    *   First, find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to neutralize 0.0010 mol of acid.\n    *   Volume NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.0010 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n    *   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH added = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n\n*   **Concentration of Acetate ([A⁻]):**\n    *   [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.0010 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M\n\n*   **Hydrolysis of Acetate:**\n    *   The reaction is: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for the acetate ion.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰\n\n*   **Calculate [OH⁻]:**\n    *   From the equilibrium expression: Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   Let x = [OH⁻]. Then Kb = x² / ([A⁻] - x). Since Kb is very small, we can approximate [A⁻] - x ≈ [A⁻] = 0.02 M.\n    *   5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02\n    *   x² = (5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 = 1.082 × 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 × 10⁻⁶ M\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀[OH⁻] = -log₁₀(3.29 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n    *   So, at the equivalence point, **pH ≈ 8.52**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe calculated pH values are 4.26 at 25% titration and 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
