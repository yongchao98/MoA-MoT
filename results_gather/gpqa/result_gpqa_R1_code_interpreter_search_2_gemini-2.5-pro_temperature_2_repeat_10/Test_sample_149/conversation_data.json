    "**1. Analysis of the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula is DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n    DoU = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4 = 5.\n    A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (3 double bonds + 1 ring). This leaves one additional degree of unsaturation, which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates that it is adjacent to a carbon with two protons (-CH2-). This confirms a -CH2-CHO group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the two protons of the -CH2- group. The splitting pattern, a doublet (d), indicates it is adjacent to a carbon with one proton (-CH-), which is the aldehyde proton. This is consistent with the -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum. Two doublets, each integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a para (1,4)-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons suggests an amine group (-NH2). The broadness is typical for protons on a nitrogen atom.\n\n*   **Structure Determination:**\n    Putting the pieces together, we have a para-disubstituted benzene ring with an amino group (-NH2) and a -CH2-CHO group (acetaldehyde group) as the two substituents. The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 (amine) + C2H3O (side chain) = C8H9NO. This matches the given formula.\n\n    Starting Material:\n     \n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This set of reagents generates nitrous acid (HONO) in situ. It is used for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH2) on the benzene ring is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n\n    Product after Step 1: **4-(diazoniophenyl)acetaldehyde chloride**\n     \n\n*   **Step 2: H2O, Heat**\n    The diazonium salt is then treated with water and heated. This causes **hydrolysis**, where the diazonium group (-N2+) is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH), releasing nitrogen gas (N2).\n\n    Product after Step 2: **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**\n     \n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves a strong base (KOH) and heat. The product from step 2, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is an aldehyde with acidic protons on the carbon alpha (α) to the carbonyl group. These conditions are perfect for an **aldol condensation** reaction.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an α-proton from one molecule to form an enolate ion. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide gives the aldol addition product. The structure of this addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (which corresponds to option C).\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** Because the reaction is heated, the aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). A proton is lost from the α-carbon, and the -OH group is lost from the β-carbon, forming a double bond. This results in an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, which is a more stable, conjugated system.\n\n    The dehydration of the aldol adduct proceeds as follows:\n\n     \n\n    The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**3. Matching with Options**\n\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect structure (no OH groups, wrong double bond position).\n*   B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure (monomer, not dimer).\n*   C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product. Since the reaction is heated, it will not be the final product.\n*   D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This matches the structure of the final aldol condensation product derived from our analysis.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<D>>>"
