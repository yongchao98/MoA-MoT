    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Reactant**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to determine its molecular formula and initial IHD.\n\n*   **Parent Structure:** `cyclohex-3-ene`. This is a six-membered carbon ring with one double bond. A ring itself counts as one degree of unsaturation, and a double bond adds another.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   `carboxylic acid` (-COOH) group at position 1. This group contains a C=O double bond.\n    *   `formyl` (-CHO) group at position 2. This is an aldehyde group and also contains a C=O double bond.\n    *   `vinyl` (-CH=CH₂) group at position 5. This group contains a C=C double bond.\n\nLet's find the molecular formula of the reactant:\n*   The cyclohexane ring has 6 carbons.\n*   The carboxylic acid group adds 1 carbon (-**C**OOH).\n*   The formyl group adds 1 carbon (-**C**HO).\n*   The vinyl group adds 2 carbons (-**C**H=**C**H₂).\n*   Total Carbons (C) = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **10**.\n\nNow, let's count the hydrogens (H). A fully saturated C10 acyclic alkane would be C₁₀H₂₂. We can calculate IHD from the structural features:\n*   1 for the ring structure.\n*   1 for the double bond in the cyclohexene ring (C=C).\n*   1 for the double bond in the carboxylic acid group (C=O).\n*   1 for the double bond in the formyl group (C=O).\n*   1 for the double bond in the vinyl group (C=C).\n*   **Total IHD of reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.**\n\nWe can use the IHD to find the number of hydrogens.\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)  (Ignoring oxygen atoms as they don't affect the calculation)\n5 = 10 + 1 - H/2\n5 = 11 - H/2\nH/2 = 6\nH = 12.\n\nLet's find the number of oxygen atoms (O):\n*   The carboxylic acid (-COOH) has 2 oxygen atoms.\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) has 1 oxygen atom.\n*   Total Oxygens (O) = 2 + 1 = **3**.\n\nSo, the molecular formula of the reactant is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This combination is a very powerful and non-selective reducing agent. Its effects are:\n*   **Reduction of Carbonyls:** It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   **Reduction of Alkenes:** It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   **Removal of Oxygen:** All oxygen atoms from the functional groups are removed.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Product's Structure and Formula**\n\nApplying the effects of Red P + HI to our reactant:\n1.  The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring will be saturated to a `cyclohexane` ring. The C=C bond is reduced. This removes 1 unit of IHD.\n2.  The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) will be saturated to an `ethyl` group (-CH₂CH₃). The C=C bond is reduced. This removes 1 unit of IHD.\n3.  The `formyl` group (-CHO) will be reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH₃). The C=O bond is reduced. This removes 1 unit of IHD.\n4.  The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) will be reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH₃). The C=O bond is reduced. This removes 1 unit of IHD.\n\nThe final product will be a saturated, substituted cyclohexane ring. All pi bonds from the original molecule are gone. The only feature contributing to the index of hydrogen deficiency is the ring itself.\n\n*   The number of carbon atoms remains the same: C = 10.\n*   All oxygen atoms are removed.\n*   The product is a monocyclic saturated hydrocarbon (a substituted cycloalkane). The general formula for such a compound is **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the IHD of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is calculated using the formula:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) - (X/2)\n\nFor the product C₁₀H₂₀:\n*   C = 10\n*   H = 20\n*   N (Nitrogen) = 0\n*   X (Halogen) = 0\n\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\nIHD = 11 - 10\n**IHD = 1**\n\nAlternatively, we can reason from the structure. The final product is a substituted cyclohexane. It contains one ring and no double or triple bonds. Therefore, its index of hydrogen deficiency is 1.\n\nFinal check using the change in IHD:\n*   Initial IHD = 5\n*   Reduction of 4 pi bonds (one in the ring, one in the vinyl group, one in the aldehyde, one in the acid) means IHD decreases by 4.\n*   Final IHD = 5 - 4 = 1.\n\nThe calculations are consistent.\n\n<<<B>>>"
