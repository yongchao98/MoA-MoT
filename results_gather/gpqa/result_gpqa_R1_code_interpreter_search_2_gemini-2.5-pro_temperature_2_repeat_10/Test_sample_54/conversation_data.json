    "This problem requires identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data and a list of possible structures. Let's break down the process step-by-step.\n\n### 1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data\nThe provided 1H NMR data is:\n*   **δ = 7.0 ppm**: Integral = 1H, Multiplicity = doublet (d), Coupling constant J = 16.0 Hz\n*   **δ = 5.5 ppm**: Integral = 1H, Multiplicity = doublet of quartets (dq)\n*   **δ = 2.1 ppm**: Integral = 3H, Multiplicity = singlet (s)\n*   **δ = 1.6 ppm**: Integral = 3H, Multiplicity = doublet (d)\n\nThe total integration is 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8 protons.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the Possible Structures\n\nLet's examine the proton count for each of the options.\n*   **Propenyl acetate** (C5H8O2, Molar Mass: 100.12 g/mol): The formula is CH3-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH3.\n    *   Protons: 3 (on the propenyl methyl) + 1 (on the double bond) + 1 (on the double bond) + 3 (on the acetyl methyl) = **8 protons**. This matches the total integration from the NMR data.\n*   **Butenyl acetate** (C6H10O2, Molar Mass: 114.14 g/mol): A common isomer is but-2-enyl acetate, CH3-CH=CH-CH2-O-C(=O)-CH3.\n    *   Protons: 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = **10 protons**. This does not match the integration from the NMR data. Other butenyl isomers also have 10 protons.\n\nBased on the proton count, we can confidently eliminate both butenyl acetate options (A and B). The unknown compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n### 3. Assign the NMR Signals to Propenyl Acetate\n\nLet's assign the signals to the structure of propenyl acetate: `CH3(a)-CH(b)=CH(c)-O-C(=O)-CH3(d)`\n\n*   **δ = 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**: This signal corresponds to the three protons of the acetyl methyl group, **CH3(d)**. It is a singlet because these protons have no adjacent protons to couple with. The chemical shift of ~2.1 ppm is characteristic for a methyl group of an acetate ester.\n*   **δ = 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**: This signal corresponds to the three protons of the propenyl methyl group, **CH3(a)**. It is a doublet because it is coupled to the adjacent single proton, H(b).\n*   **δ = 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)** and **δ = 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**: These two signals correspond to the two protons on the double bond, **H(b)** and **H(c)**. These are often called vinylic protons.\n    *   The proton **H(c)** is attached to the carbon bonded to the electronegative oxygen atom, which causes a strong deshielding effect, moving its signal downfield. Therefore, the signal at **δ = 7.0 ppm** is assigned to H(c). It is split into a doublet by its coupling to the single adjacent proton, H(b).\n    *   The proton **H(b)** is coupled to two different sets of protons: H(c) and CH3(a). Coupling to the one H(c) splits the signal into a doublet. Coupling to the three protons of CH3(a) splits the signal into a quartet (n+1=3+1=4). The combination results in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. Thus, the signal at **δ = 5.5 ppm** is assigned to H(b).\n\nThe assignments are fully consistent with the structure of propenyl acetate.\n\n### 4. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)\n\nThe final step is to determine whether the double bond has a cis or trans geometry. This is determined by the magnitude of the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinylic protons, H(b) and H(c).\n\n*   **Trans coupling**: The J-coupling constant for two protons in a *trans* configuration on a double bond (on opposite sides) is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n*   **Cis coupling**: The J-coupling constant for two protons in a *cis* configuration (on the same side) is smaller, typically in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nThe problem states that the doublet at 7.0 ppm has a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value falls squarely within the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\nTherefore, the compound must be **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe proton count rules out the butenyl acetate options. The NMR signal assignments (chemical shifts and splitting patterns) fit the propenyl acetate structure. The large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) between the vinylic protons confirms the trans stereochemistry of the double bond.\n\nThe correct identification is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
