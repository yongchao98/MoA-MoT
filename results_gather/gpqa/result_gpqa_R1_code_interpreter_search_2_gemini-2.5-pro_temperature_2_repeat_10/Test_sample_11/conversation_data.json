    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThe decay of a stationary particle into two product particles is governed by two fundamental conservation laws:\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n\n### **2. Set up the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A stationary positive pion ($Pi^+$).\n    *   Since it is stationary, its initial momentum ($p_{initial}$) is 0.\n    *   Its initial total energy ($E_{initial}$) is its rest mass energy, $E_{\\pi^+} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2$.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   Two product particles: a positive muon ($mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($nu$).\n    *   Let their momenta be $p_{\\mu^+}$ and $p_{\\nu}$, and their total energies be $E_{\\mu^+}$ and $E_{\\nu}$.\n\n### **3. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\n$p_{initial} = p_{final}$\n$0 = \\vec{p}_{\\mu^+} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu}$\n\nThis implies that the momentum vectors of the muon and the neutrino are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n$|\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$\n\n### **4. Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n$E_{\\pi^+} = E_{\\mu^+} + E_{\\nu}$\n\nThe total energy of a particle is given by the relativistic formula: $E = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2}$.\n\nSubstituting this into the energy conservation equation:\n$m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = \\sqrt{(p_{\\mu^+}c)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2} + \\sqrt{(p_{\\nu}c)^2 + (m_{\\nu}c^2)^2}$\n\nWe know $|p_{\\mu^+}| = |p_{\\nu}| = p$. Also, the neutrino's mass ($m_{\\nu}$) is extremely small and can be considered 0 for this calculation. Thus, $m_{\\nu}c^2 = 0$.\n\nThe equation becomes:\n$m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2} + \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + 0^2}$\n$m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\n### **5. Solve for the Momentum (p)**\n\nTo find the energies, we first need to solve the equation above for the momentum term, `pc`.\n\n$m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}$\n\nSquare both sides:\n$(m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n$(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n\nThe $(pc)^2$ terms cancel out. Rearrange the equation to solve for `pc`:\n$(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2 = 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc)$\n$pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)}$\n\n### **6. Calculate Kinetic Energies (KE)**\n\nKinetic energy is defined as $KE = E_{total} - m c^2$.\n\n*   **KE of Neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$):**\n    *   Since the neutrino's rest mass is considered zero, its total energy is $E_{\\nu} = pc$.\n    *   Therefore, $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} - m_{\\nu}c^2 = pc - 0 = pc$.\n\n*   **KE of Muon ($KE_{\\mu^+}$):**\n    *   The total energy of the muon is $E_{\\mu^+} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}$.\n    *   We can also find it from energy conservation: $E_{\\mu^+} = E_{\\pi^+} - E_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc$.\n    *   Therefore, $KE_{\\mu^+} = E_{\\mu^+} - m_{\\mu^+}c^2 = (m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc) - m_{\\mu^+}c^2$.\n\nWe can now use a python script to perform the calculations accurately.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_kinetic_energies():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu.\n    The Pi(+) is assumed to be stationary.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Rest mass energies in MeV\n    m_pi_c2 = 139.6\n    m_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n    # Calculate the momentum term 'pc' using the derived formula.\n    # pc = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) / (2 * m_pi)\n    pc = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n    # The kinetic energy of the neutrino is equal to pc (assuming massless neutrino).\n    ke_neutrino = pc\n\n    # The total energy of the muon is found from conservation of energy.\n    # E_muon = E_pion - E_neutrino\n    e_muon = m_pi_c2 - ke_neutrino\n    \n    # The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest mass energy.\n    ke_muon = e_muon - m_mu_c2\n    \n    print(f\"KE of muon: {ke_muon:.2f} MeV\")\n    print(f\"KE of neutrino: {ke_neutrino:.2f} MeV\")\n\ncalculate_kinetic_energies()\n```\n<execute_result>\nKE of muon: 4.12 MeV\nKE of neutrino: 29.78 MeV\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon ($mu^+$) and 29.8 MeV (rounding 29.78) for the neutrino ($nu$).
