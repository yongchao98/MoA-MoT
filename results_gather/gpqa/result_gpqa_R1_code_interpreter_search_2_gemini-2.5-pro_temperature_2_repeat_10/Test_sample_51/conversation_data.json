    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes. This is a comparison of the ratio under two different stellar conditions: one without spots and one with spots. Let's denote the ratio as `R`. We need to find the factor `F = R_nospots / R_spots`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Physics:** The problem deals with the population of atomic energy levels in a stellar photosphere, which is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The distribution of atoms among energy levels in LTE is described by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n3.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio `R` of the populations of two energy levels (level 2, `N₂`, and level 1, `N₁`) is given by:\n    `R = N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    where:\n    *   `g₂` and `g₁` are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   `ΔE = E₂ - E₁` is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the excitation temperature, which we will approximate as the effective temperature of the photosphere (`T_eff`).\n\n4.  **Define the States:**\n    *   **State 1 (No Spots):** The star's surface is uniform. The effective temperature is given as `T_nospots = 6000 K`. The population ratio is `R_nospots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots))`.\n    *   **State 2 (With Spots):** 40% of the surface is covered by dark spots. This changes the total energy output, and the new *overall effective temperature* is `T_spots = 5500 K`. The population ratio corresponding to this overall state is `R_spots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))`.\n\n    The problem states that the ratio \"decreases when the star has spots,\" which means `R_spots < R_nospots`. This is consistent with our formula, as for `E₂ > E₁` (an excitation), the ratio `R` increases with temperature. Since `T_spots < T_nospots`, we expect `R_spots < R_nospots`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Factor:** We need to compute the factor `F = R_nospots / R_spots`.\n    `F = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]`\n    The term `(g₂ / g₁)` cancels out:\n    `F = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))`\n    Using the property `exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b)`:\n    `F = exp[ -ΔE / (k * T_nospots) - (-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]`\n    `F = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1 / T_spots - 1 / T_nospots) ]`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE):** The problem gives the wavelength `λ` of the transition between the two levels as 1448 Å. The energy difference is the energy of a photon with this wavelength.\n    `ΔE = h * c / λ`\n    where `h` is the Planck constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n7.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation:** We will substitute the values into the formula for the factor `F`. It is computationally efficient to calculate the term `(ΔE / k)` first.\n    *   `h ≈ 6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s`\n    *   `c ≈ 3.00 × 10⁸ m/s`\n    *   `k ≈ 1.381 × 10⁻²³ J/K`\n    *   `λ = 1448 Å = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m`\n    *   `T_nospots = 6000 K`\n    *   `T_spots = 5500 K`\n\n    The unused information (stellar radius, mass, and spot coverage percentage) serves to create a physically plausible scenario but is not directly required for the calculation if we assume the effective temperatures are the correct values to use for the Boltzmann equation. This is a standard approach in such problems.\n\n    We can use a Python script for an accurate calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Physical constants\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck's constant in J.s\nc = 299792458      # Speed of light in m/s\nk = 1.380649e-23   # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n# Given astronomical data\nlambda_nm = 144.8    # Wavelength in nanometers\nlambda_m = lambda_nm * 1e-9 # Wavelength in meters\n\nT_nospots = 6000     # Effective temperature without spots in Kelvin\nT_with_spots = 5500  # Effective temperature with spots in Kelvin\n\n# Calculate the energy difference between the two levels\ndelta_E = h * c / lambda_m\n\n# The ratio of populations R is proportional to exp(-delta_E / (k * T))\n# We want to find the factor F = R(T_nospots) / R(T_with_spots)\n# F = exp(-delta_E / (k * T_nospots)) / exp(-delta_E / (k * T_with_spots))\n# F = exp( (delta_E / k) * (1/T_with_spots - 1/T_nospots) )\n\n# Calculate the value of the exponent\nexponent = (delta_E / k) * (1/T_with_spots - 1/T_nospots)\n\n# Calculate the final factor\nfactor = np.exp(exponent)\n\nprint(f\"{factor:.5f}\")\n```\n>>>\n4.51065\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 4.51.

    "The user wants me to solve a problem about the ratio of atomic energy level populations in a star's photosphere under two different temperature conditions.\n\n**1. Understand the Core Question:**\nThe question asks for a factor: `(Ratio of populations at T_nospots) / (Ratio of populations at T_spots)`.\n\n**2. Identify the Governing Physical Principle:**\nThe population of atomic energy levels in a gas in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) is described by the **Boltzmann equation**.\n\nThe ratio `R` of the number of atoms in an upper energy state 2 (`N₂`) to a lower energy state 1 (`N₁`) is given by:\n`R = N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\nwhere:\n*   `g₁` and `g₂` are the statistical weights of the levels (which we don't need, as they will cancel out).\n*   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `T` is the temperature.\n\n**3. Set up the Ratios for the Two Scenarios:**\n*   **Scenario 1: No spots**\n    *   Temperature: `T_nospots = 6000 K`\n    *   Ratio: `R_nospots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots))`\n\n*   **Scenario 2: With spots**\n    *   Temperature: `T_spots = 5500 K`\n    *   Ratio: `R_spots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))`\n\n**4. Calculate the Desired Factor:**\nWe need to find the factor `F = R_nospots / R_spots`.\n`F = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]`\n\nThe `(g₂ / g₁)` terms cancel. Using the property of exponents `exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b)`:\n`F = exp[ (-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]`\n`F = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1 / T_spots - 1 / T_nospots) ]`\n\n**5.

Substitute Values and Compute:**\nI will use a python script to perform the numerical calculation accurately. The script will calculate `ΔE` and then use it in the formula for the factor `F`.

    "The problem asks for the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two specific energy levels changes when a star's surface temperature drops from 6000 K to 5500 K due to spots.\n\nHere is the reasoning process:\n1.  **Identify the governing physical law:** The population of atomic energy levels in a star's photosphere, assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), is governed by the Boltzmann equation.\n2.  **State the Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio `R` of the population of a higher energy level `N₂` to a lower energy level `N₁` is given by:\n    `R = N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    where `g₂` and `g₁` are the statistical weights of the levels, `ΔE` is the energy difference between them, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n3.  **Define the two states:**\n    *   State 1 (No spots): `T₁ = 6000 K`.
