    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine which planet has a higher transit probability.\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to compare the transit probabilities of two exoplanets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, to decide which one is a better target for observation. The planet with the higher transit probability is preferred.\n\n2.  **Recall the Transit Probability Formula:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the geometric probability of it transiting its host star is given by the ratio of the stellar radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`):\n    `p_tr = R_s / a`\n\n3.  **Set up the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 (`p_tr1`) to that of Planet_2 (`p_tr2`).\n    `p_tr1 = R_s1 / a_1`\n    `p_tr2 = R_s2 / a_2`\n\n    The ratio is:\n    `p_tr1 / p_tr2 = (R_s1 / a_1) / (R_s2 / a_2) = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (a_2 / a_1)`\n\n4.  **Incorporate Given Information about Stars:** The problem states that both host stars have the same radii.\n    `R_s1 = R_s2`, which means `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1`.\n    Substituting this into our ratio simplifies the equation to:\n    `p_tr1 / p_tr2 = a_2 / a_1`\n    This means the ratio of the transit probabilities is simply the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n5.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Known Quantities:** To find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`, we use Kepler's Third Law. For a planet orbiting a star, where the planet's mass (`m_p`) is much smaller than the star's mass (`M_s`), the law is:\n    `P^2 ≈ (4 * π^2 / (G * M_s)) * a^3`\n    where `P` is the orbital period and `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for `a`:\n    `a^3 ≈ (G * M_s * P^2) / (4 * π^2)`\n    `a ≈ [ (G * M_s * P^2) / (4 * π^2) ]^(1/3)`\n    Since `G` and `4π^2` are constants, we can see the proportionality:\n    `a ∝ (M_s * P^2)^(1/3)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Now we can express the ratio `a_2 / a_1` in terms of the stellar masses and orbital periods:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * P_2^2) / (M_s1 * P_1^2) ]^(1/3)`\n\n7.  **Substitute the Remaining Given Information:** The problem provides the following relationships:\n    - The mass of Star 1 is twice the mass of Star 2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`\n    - The period of Planet 1 is three times shorter than Planet 2: `P_1 = P_2 / 3` which implies `P_2 = 3 * P_1`.\n\n    Let's substitute these into the equation for `a_2 / a_1`:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * (3 * P_1)^2) / ((2 * M_s2) * P_1^2) ]^(1/3)`\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * 9 * P_1^2) / (2 * M_s2 * P_1^2) ]^(1/3)`\n\n8.  **Simplify and Calculate the Final Ratio:** The terms `M_s2` and `P_1^2` cancel out:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n    To get the numerical value, we can use a calculator.\n```python\n# The ratio of probabilities p_tr1 / p_tr2 is equal to the ratio of semi-major axes a_2 / a_1.\n# This ratio is calculated as (9/2)^(1/3).\nratio = (4.5)**(1/3)\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n1.650963595648839\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation gives a value of approximately 1.651.\n\n9.  **Conclusion:**\n    The ratio of the transit probabilities `p_tr1 / p_tr2` is approximately 1.65. Since this ratio is greater than 1, `p_tr1` is greater than `p_tr2`. Specifically, the probability of Planet_1 transiting is about 1.65 times higher than for Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The transit probability for an exoplanet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\n`p_tr = R_s / a`\nwhere `R_s` is the radius of the host star and `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the transit probabilities for Planet_1 (`p_tr1`) and Planet_2 (`p_tr2`):\n`Ratio = p_tr1 / p_tr2 = (R_s1 / a_1) / (R_s2 / a_2)`\n\nThe problem states that both host stars have the same radii, so `R_s1 = R_s2`. This simplifies the ratio to:\n`Ratio = a_2 / a_1`\n\nTo find the semi-major axes, we use Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion. For a planet with mass much smaller than its star, the law is:\n`P^2 ∝ a^3 / M_s`\nwhere `P` is the orbital period and `M_s` is the mass of the host star.\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\n`a^3 ∝ P^2 * M_s`\n`a ∝ (P^2 * M_s)^(1/3)`\n\nNow we can express the ratio `a_2 / a_1` in terms of the periods and stellar masses:\n`a_2 / a_1 = [(P_2^2 * M_s2) / (P_1^2 * M_s1)]^(1/3)`\n\nWe are given the following information from the problem description:\n1.  The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: `P_1 = P_2 / 3`, or `P_2 = 3 * P_1`.\n2.  The mass of the star hosting Planet_1 is twice that of the host star of Planet_2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`.\n\nSubstitute these relationships into the equation for the ratio:\n`a_2 / a_1 = [((3 * P_1)^2 * M_s2) / (P_1^2 * (2 * M_s2))]^(1/3)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = [(9 * P_1^2 * M_s2) / (2 * P_1^2 * M_s2)]^(1/3)`\n\nThe `P_1^2` and `M_s2` terms cancel out, leaving:\n`a_2 / a_1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\nThe numerical value `(4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65096`.\nThe code output confirms this calculation.\n\nSince the probability ratio `p_tr1 / p_tr2 = a_2 / a_1 ≈ 1.65`, the transit probability for Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred target for observation. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
