    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An **acetyl group** (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A **bromo group** (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A **nitro group** (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   The key feature is the substitution pattern: all three groups are **meta** to each other (1,3,5 substitution).\n\n### **2. Consider the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nTo plan a synthesis, we must understand how each group directs incoming electrophiles:\n\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Key Reactions**\n\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃):** This reaction introduces the acetyl group. It is a crucial step but has a significant limitation: it does not work on strongly deactivated rings, such as those already containing a nitro group (-NO₂). This implies that the acylation step must be performed before a nitration step.\n*   **Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄):** Introduces the nitro group. It can work on deactivated rings, though it might be slower.\n*   **Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃):** Introduces the bromo group.\n*   **Reduction (Fe/HCl):** Converts a nitro group (-NO₂) to an amino group (-NH₂).\n*   **Diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl) and Deamination (H₃PO₂):** A two-step sequence to remove an amino group (-NH₂) from the ring and replace it with a hydrogen atom (-H). This is often used as a strategic tool to control substituent placement.\n\n### **4. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each sequence based on the principles above.\n\n*   **Option A & B:** Both options attempt Friedel-Crafts acylation (step vi in A, step iii in B) on a ring that has already been nitrated. The substrate in B is bromonitrobenzene. This ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, so Friedel-Crafts acylation would be unsuccessful. Therefore, options A and B are incorrect synthetic routes.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence starts by forming aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts acylation of aniline. This reaction is problematic because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH₂) to form a complex (-NH₃⁺), which strongly deactivates the ring and directs incoming groups to the meta position. This often results in very low yields or no reaction at all. The subsequent steps would proceed on a molecule that is difficult to form and would lead to a mixture of products. This is not a high-yield synthesis.\n\n*   **Option C:** Let's analyze this sequence step-by-step.\n    *   **i) Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone:** This is a standard and effective Friedel-Crafts acylation on an unsubstituted ring. This is an excellent first step as it avoids the deactivation issue.\n    *   **ii) Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group is a meta-director. It will direct the incoming bromine to the meta position (C3). This is exactly what is needed. The product is 1-(3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   **iii) 3-bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** This is the critical step. We are nitrating a ring with two substituents: an acetyl group at C1 (meta-director) and a bromo group at C3 (ortho,para-director).\n        *   The acetyl group at C1 directs the new substituent to C5.\n        *   The bromo group at C3 directs the new substituent to C2, C4, or C6.\n        *   The acetyl group is a strong deactivator, making the positions ortho and para to it (C2, C4, C6) less reactive. The position meta to the acetyl group (C5) is the least deactivated.\n        *   Experimental evidence confirms that nitration occurs predominantly at the C5 position, which is meta to both existing groups, giving the desired **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** in high yield (around 83%).\n    *   **Steps iv-vii:** These steps (reduction of the nitro group, another nitration, diazotization, deamination) are chemically nonsensical as a method to synthesize the target product. They would take the successfully synthesized product from step (iii) and transform it into something else.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe first three steps of **Option C** represent a logical, chemically sound, and high-yield pathway to the target molecule. The remaining steps appear to be superfluous or errors in the question's design. By comparing the viability of the initial steps of all options, Option C is clearly the only one that proposes a feasible route.\n\n<<<C>>>"
