    "To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we need to assess two criteria for each star:\n1.  **Visibility from Paranal Observatory:** The star must rise sufficiently high above the horizon to be observed. Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately -24.6 degrees.\n2.  **Brightness:** The star must be bright enough to achieve the required signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). The condition is a S/N of at least 10 in a 1-hour exposure. According to the ESPRESSO documentation, this S/N can be achieved for stars with an apparent V magnitude (m_V) of up to approximately 19.\n\nLet's evaluate each star based on these criteria.\n\n### Star-by-Star Analysis:\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Visibility:** Canopus has a declination of approximately -52° 41'. This is well south of the celestial equator, making it an ideal target for the VLT in the Southern Hemisphere. It is observable.\n*   **Brightness:** Canopus is the second-brightest star in the night sky with an apparent V magnitude of -0.74. This is much brighter than the limiting magnitude of 19.\n*   **Conclusion:** Detectable.\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Visibility:** Polaris has a declination of approximately +89° 15'. As it is very close to the North Celestial Pole, it is a circumpolar star for northern observers but never rises above the horizon at Paranal's southern latitude (-24.6°).\n*   **Conclusion:** Not detectable.\n\n**c) Star with RA=0 deg, DEC=0 deg, Absolute V magnitude (M_V)=15, Distance=10 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** A declination of 0° means the star is on the celestial equator. It is perfectly visible from Paranal, rising high in the sky.\n*   **Brightness:** We calculate the apparent magnitude (m_V) using the distance modulus formula:\n    m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d / 10 pc)\n    Given M_V = 15 and d = 10 pc:\n    m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(10 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(1) = 15 + 0 = 15.\n    An apparent magnitude of 15 is brighter than the limit of 19.\n*   **Conclusion:** Detectable.\n\n**d) Star with RA=0 deg, DEC=0 deg, M_V=15, Distance=200 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** Declination is 0°, so it is visible from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:**\n    m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(200 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(20) ≈ 15 + 5 * 1.301 = 15 + 6.505 = 21.505.\n    An apparent magnitude of ~21.5 is fainter than the limit of 19.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not detectable.\n\n**e) Star with RA=0 deg, DEC=0 deg, M_V=15, Distance=5 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** Declination is 0°, so it is visible from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:**\n    m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(5 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(0.5) ≈ 15 + 5 * (-0.301) = 15 - 1.505 = 13.495.\n    An apparent magnitude of ~13.5 is brighter than the limit of 19.\n*   **Conclusion:** Detectable.\n\n**f) Star with RA=0 deg, DEC=0 deg, M_V=15, Distance=50 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** Declination is 0°, so it is visible from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:**\n    m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(50 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(5) ≈ 15 + 5 * 0.699 = 15 + 3.495 = 18.495.\n    An apparent magnitude of ~18.5 is brighter than the limit of 19.\n*   **Conclusion:** Detectable.\n\n### Summary:\n\n*   Canopus: **Detectable**\n*   Polaris: **Not Detectable**\n*   Star at 10 pc: **Detectable**\n*   Star at 200 pc: **Not Detectable**\n*   Star at 5 pc: **Detectable**\n*   Star at 50 pc: **Detectable**\n\nCounting the detectable stars, we have a total of 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
