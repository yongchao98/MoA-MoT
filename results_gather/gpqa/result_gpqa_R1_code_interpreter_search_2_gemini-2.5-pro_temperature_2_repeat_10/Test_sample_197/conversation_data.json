    "This problem requires us to calculate the mole fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], relative to all cobalt-containing species in the solution. We can then express this fraction as a percentage.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the species in solution:**\n    The cobalt(II) ions (Co²⁺) react with thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻) to form a series of complexes. The total concentration of cobalt-containing species, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co²⁺ ion and all its complexes:\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)]⁺ + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\n2.  **Use the overall stability constants (βn):**\n    The concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration [Co²⁺], the free ligand concentration [SCN⁻], and the overall stability constants (βn).\n    *   [Co(SCN)]⁺ = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]\n    *   [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²\n    *   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³\n    *   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴\n\n3.  **Express the total cobalt concentration:**\n    Substitute the expressions from step 2 into the equation from step 1:\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n    Factor out [Co²⁺]:\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n4.  **Define the mole fraction (αn):**\n    The mole fraction of any specific complex, say [Co(SCN)n]^(2-n), is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration. We are interested in the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)₂], which corresponds to n=2.\n    α₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)\n\n    Substituting the expressions from steps 2 and 3:\n    α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))\n\n    The [Co²⁺] term cancels out:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n5.  **Approximate the free ligand concentration:**\n    The total concentration of the ligand ([SCN⁻] = 0.1 M) is ten times greater than the total concentration of the metal ion (c(Co) = 10⁻² M). Because the ligand is in large excess, the amount that gets complexed with cobalt is relatively small. Therefore, we can approximate the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand [SCN⁻] as being equal to its initial total concentration.\n    [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M\n\n6.  **Calculate the mole fraction α₂:**\n    Now, we can plug the given values into the formula for α₂.\n    *   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n\nLet's perform the calculation.\n```python\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nSCN_conc = 0.1\n\n# Calculate the terms in the denominator\nterm0 = 1\nterm1 = beta1 * SCN_conc\nterm2 = beta2 * (SCN_conc**2)\nterm3 = beta3 * (SCN_conc**3)\nterm4 = beta4 * (SCN_conc**4)\n\n# The numerator for the fraction of [Co(SCN)2] is term2\nnumerator = term2\n\n# The denominator is the sum of all species relative to free Co(II)\ndenominator = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# Calculate the fraction alpha_2\nalpha_2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert to percentage\npercentage = alpha_2 * 100\n\nprint(f'{percentage:.1f}%')\n```\n<<<16.9%\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user wants to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt species in the solution.\n\n**1. Define the species and equilibria:**\nThe cobalt(II) ion (Co²⁺) reacts with the thiocyanate ligand (SCN⁻) to form a series of complexes. The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the free ion and all its complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)]⁺ + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\nThe formation of these complexes is described by the overall stability constants (βn):\n*   `[Co(SCN)]⁺ = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₂] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻ = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n**2. Formulate the mole fraction (α₂):**\nThe mole fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, α₂, is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration:\n`α₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)`\n\nBy substituting the expressions from step 1, we get:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nThe concentration of the free cobalt ion, `[Co²⁺]`, appears in every term and can be cancelled out:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. Approximate the ligand concentration:**\nThe total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is ten times the total cobalt concentration (10⁻² M or 0.01 M). Since the ligand is in large excess, the amount consumed by complexation is relatively small. We can therefore approximate the equilibrium concentration of free SCN⁻ ions as being equal to the initial total concentration.\n`[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`\n\n**4. Calculate the mole fraction:**\nNow, we plug the given values into the formula for α₂:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40 (This is for our target complex)\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nLet's calculate the value of each term in the denominator and the numerator.\n*   Numerator (`β₂ * [SCN⁻]²`): 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   Denominator term 0 (for free Co²⁺): 1\n*   Denominator term 1 (`β₁ * [SCN⁻]`): 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n*   Denominator term 2 (`β₂ * [SCN⁻]²`): 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n*   Denominator term 3 (`β₃ * [SCN⁻]³`): 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   Denominator term 4 (`β₄ * [SCN⁻]⁴`): 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nTotal denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nNow, calculate α₂:\n`α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n**5. Convert to percentage:**\nPercentage = `α₂ * 100% = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis result matches the one obtained from the Python code execution.\n\n<<<C>>>"
