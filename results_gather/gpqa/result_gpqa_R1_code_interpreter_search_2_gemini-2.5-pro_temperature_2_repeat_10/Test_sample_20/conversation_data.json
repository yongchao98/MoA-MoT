    "*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Compound A)**\n\n    *   **Tautomerism**, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, is an equilibrium between a keto form (containing a C=O group) and an enol form (containing a C=C-OH group). This process requires the presence of an **alpha-hydrogen**, which is a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n    *   **Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):** The structure consists of a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two carbonyl groups opposite each other. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are part of carbon-carbon double bonds and have no hydrogen atoms attached. Since there are **no alpha-hydrogens**, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n         ![Structure of 1,4-benzoquinone](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/1%2C4-Benzoquinone.svg/200px-1%2C4-Benzoquinone.svg.png) \n\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbons between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are CH₂ groups. These carbons are alpha-carbons to two carbonyl groups each, and they possess hydrogen atoms. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **has alpha-hydrogens** and can undergo tautomerism to form its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene).\n\n         ![Tautomerism of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Phloroglucinol_keto-enol_tautomerism.svg/400px-Phloroglucinol_keto-enol_tautomerism.svg.png) \n\n    *   Conclusion for A: The compound that **does not** show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Compound B)**\n\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs when a molecule is **chiral**, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to **four different groups**.\n\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. Let's examine the central carbon (C-2):\n        1.  It is bonded to a hydrogen atom (-H).\n        2.  It is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n        3.  It is bonded to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n        4.  It is bonded to a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃).\n        Since this carbon is bonded to **four different groups**, it is a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism (it has a pair of enantiomers).\n\n         ![Structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate showing chiral center](https://www.chem.ucla.edu/~harding/IGOC/M/methyl_lactate01.png)  *(The asterisk indicates the chiral center)*\n\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene with a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃) on each of the double-bonded carbons. The molecule has a plane of symmetry cutting through the C=C double bond. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are **achiral** and do not exhibit optical isomerism. It also lacks any chiral centers.\n\n         ![Structure of dimethyl fumarate](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Dimethyl_fumarate.svg/200px-Dimethyl_fumarate.svg.png) \n\n    *   Conclusion for B: The compound that **will show** optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion**\n\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
