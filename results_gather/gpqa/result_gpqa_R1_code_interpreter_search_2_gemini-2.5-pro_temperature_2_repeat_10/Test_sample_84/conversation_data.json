    "Here's my thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2 ($T_{eq, 1} / T_{eq, 2}$).\n\n2.  **Identify the Formula for Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star and its own properties. The formula is:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} * (1 - A)^{1/4} * \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (the distance from the star for a circular orbit).\n\n3.  **Form the Ratio of Temperatures:** I need to calculate the ratio $T_{eq, 1} / T_{eq, 2}$. Let's write it out using the formula from step 2:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq, 1}}{T_{eq, 2}} = \\frac{T_{star} * (1 - A_1)^{1/4} * \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1}}}{T_{star} * (1 - A_2)^{1/4} * \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2}}}$\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem states several things that allow for simplification:\n    *   Both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both and will cancel out.\n    *   Both planets are assumed to have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$), so the $(1 - A)^{1/4}$ terms will also cancel out.\n    *   The factor of 2 inside the square root also cancels.\n\n    After simplification, the ratio becomes:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq, 1}}{T_{eq, 2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\n    This is a key insight: the ratio of equilibrium temperatures depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their orbital distances.\n\n5.  **Relate Orbital Distance (a) to Observable Quantities:** The problem provides data from the radial velocity (RV) method. I need to find a formula that connects the semi-major axis ($a$) to the quantities measured by RV. The key observable from the RV method is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity ($K_{star}$), which is caused by the planet's gravitational pull.\n\n    *   The relationship between the maximum observed Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) and the velocity semi-amplitude ($K_{star}$) is:\n        $K_{star} = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$, where c is the speed of light.\n\n    *   The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n        $K_{star} = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$\n        where $M_p$ is the planet mass, $M_{star}$ is the star mass, $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $i$ is the orbital inclination. Since the planets were also detected by the transit method, the inclination $i$ must be close to 90°, meaning $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. We can simplify the formula:\n        $K_{star} \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}} = \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{\\sqrt{M_{star} a}}$\n\n6.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** Now, I'll rearrange the formula to solve for $a$:\n    $K_{star}^2 = \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_{star} a}$\n    $a = \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_{star} K_{star}^2}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes ($a_2 / a_1$):** Now I can substitute this expression for `a` back into the simplified temperature ratio from step 4.\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\frac{M_2^2 G}{M_{star} K_{star,2}^2}}{\\frac{M_1^2 G}{M_{star} K_{star,1}^2}}$\n\n    The terms $G$ and $M_{star}$ are the same for both planets, so they cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_2^2}{M_1^2} \\times \\frac{K_{star,1}^2}{K_{star,2}^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{K_{star,1}}{K_{star,2}}\\right)^2$\n\n8.  **Calculate the Ratios of Mass and Velocity:**\n    *   The ratio of masses is given:\n        $\\frac{M_2}{M_1} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n    *   The ratio of velocities ($K_{star}$) is proportional to the ratio of Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda$), since $K_{star} = c (\\Delta\\lambda / \\lambda_0)$ and $c$ and $\\lambda_0$ are constants.\n        $\\frac{K_{star,1}}{K_{star,2}} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n9.  **Substitute Values to Find the Final Answer:**\n    First, find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n    Now, find the temperature ratio using the result from step 4:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq, 1}}{T_{eq, 2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n    Finally, calculate the decimal value: $15 \\div 28 \\approx 0.5357$.\n\n10. **Match to Options:** The calculated value of ~0.5357 is closest to option D.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, I'll use a Python script to perform the calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given planet properties\nM1 = 7.0  # Earth masses\nM2 = 5.0  # Earth masses\n\n# Given Doppler shifts\ndelta_lambda_1 = 0.03  # Angstroms\ndelta_lambda_2 = 0.04  # Angstroms\n\n# The ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes K is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts.\n# K1/K2 = delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2\nK_ratio_1_over_2 = delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2\n\n# The ratio of the masses\nM_ratio_2_over_1 = M2 / M1\n\n# The ratio of the semi-major axes a2/a1 is given by:\n# a2/a1 = (M2/M1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\na_ratio_2_over_1 = (M_ratio_2_over_1**2) * (K_ratio_1_over_2**2)\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures T1/T2 is the square root of a2/a1\nT_ratio_1_over_2 = math.sqrt(a_ratio_2_over_1)\n\nprint(f\"{T_ratio_1_over_2:.4f}\")\n```\n>>>\n0.5357\n<<<\n\nThe calculation confirms the result.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The goal is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which can be expressed as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n### Step 1: Formulate the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}}$\nWhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n*   $A$ is the planet's Bond albedo.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the radius of the star.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe want to find the ratio $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}}$.\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A_1)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1}}}{T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A_2)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2}}}$\n\nGiven that both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constants) and have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$), we can simplify the expression by canceling these terms:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis key simplification shows that the ratio of equilibrium temperatures depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their orbital distances (semi-major axes).\n\n### Step 2: Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity Data\nThe problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method. For a planet in a circular orbit (as stated in the problem), the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K_{star}$) induced by the planet is given by:\n$K_{star} = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}^{2/3}} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3}$\nA more direct formula relating $K_{star}$ to the semi-major axis 'a' is:\n$K_{star} = \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$\n(Assuming the inclination $i \\approx 90°$ since the planets are transiting, so $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$).\n\nWe need to find the ratio $a_2/a_1$. Let's first solve the equation for 'a':\n$K_{star}^2 = \\frac{M_p^2}{M_{star}^2} \\frac{G M_{star}}{a} = \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_{star} a}$\n$a = \\frac{G \\cdot M_p^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K_{star}^2}$\n\nNow we can form the ratio $a_2/a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{ \\frac{G \\cdot M_2^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K_{star,2}^2} }{ \\frac{G \\cdot M_1^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K_{star,1}^2} }$\n\nThe gravitational constant $G$ and the star's mass $M_{star}$ cancel out, leaving:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_2^2}{M_1^2} \\cdot \\frac{K_{star,1}^2}{K_{star,2}^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_{star,1}}{K_{star,2}}\\right)^2$\n\n### Step 3: Use the Doppler Shift Data\nThe star's radial velocity semi-amplitude $K_{star}$ is directly proportional to the maximum observed Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$. The relationship is $K_{star} = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$, where c is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nThe ratio of the velocities is therefore the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n$\\frac{K_{star,1}}{K_{star,2}} = \\frac{c \\cdot \\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\lambda_0}{c \\cdot \\Delta\\lambda_2 / \\lambda_0} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\nGiven values are $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å and $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å.\n$\\frac{K_{star,1}}{K_{star,2}} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Ratio\nNow we can substitute all the pieces back into the equation for the temperature ratio.\nFirst, find the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_{star,1}}{K_{star,2}}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{5 M_{Earth}}{7 M_{Earth}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\cdot \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\nNow, find the temperature ratio:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nFinally, convert this fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53. Comparing this with the options provided:\nA) ~ 1.30\nB) ~ 1.05\nC) ~ 0.98\nD) ~ 0.53\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
