    "*   **Step 1: Identify the reactant and the reaction.**\n    *   The reactant is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Its structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   The carbon atom at position 3 (the one with the methyl group) is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH₃), an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃), and a vinyl group (-CH=CH₂).\n    *   The problem states the reactant is \"racemic,\" which means it is a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers: (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene.\n    *   The reagent is Grubbs catalyst, which is used for olefin metathesis reactions.\n    *   Since the reactant is a terminal alkene (R-CH=CH₂), it will undergo self-metathesis to form a new internal alkene and ethene (CH₂=CH₂). The general reaction is:\n        2 R-CH=CH₂  ⇌  R-CH=CH-R + CH₂=CH₂\n    *   The question asks for the number of possible products excluding ethene. So, we need to focus on the structure R-CH=CH-R.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the structure of the main product.**\n    *   In our case, the 'R' group is the chiral sec-butyl group: -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃. Let's denote the (R)-enantiomer of this group as R' and the (S)-enantiomer as S'.\n    *   The starting materials are (R)-CH₂=CH-R' and (S)-CH₂=CH-S'.\n    *   The product formed is 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene:\n        CH₃CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CH₃\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the stereochemical possibilities.**\n    *   Because the starting material is a racemic mixture of (R) and (S) enantiomers, three different reaction pairings are possible:\n        1.  (R)-enantiomer reacts with another (R)-enantiomer (R + R).\n        2.  (S)-enantiomer reacts with another (S)-enantiomer (S + S).\n        3.  (R)-enantiomer reacts with an (S)-enantiomer (R + S).\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze the products from each reaction pairing.**\n    *   The product, 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene, has two chiral centers (at C3 and C6) and a double bond (at C4) that can have either E (trans) or Z (cis) geometry. We need to consider all these stereochemical features for each reaction pairing.\n\n    *   **1. Reaction of (R) + (R):**\n        *   This pairing forms a product with two (R) chiral centers: (3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n        *   Due to the E/Z isomerism of the double bond, two different products (which are diastereomers) are formed:\n            *   (E)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral)\n            *   (Z)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral)\n        *   This gives us **2 products**.\n\n    *   **2. Reaction of (S) + (S):**\n        *   This pairing forms a product with two (S) chiral centers: (3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n        *   Again, two diastereomers are formed due to E/Z isomerism:\n            *   (E)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral). This is the enantiomer of the (E)-(3R,6R) product.\n            *   (Z)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral). This is the enantiomer of the (Z)-(3R,6R) product.\n        *   Since enantiomers are distinct compounds, this gives us **2 more products**.\n\n    *   **3. Reaction of (R) + (S):**\n        *   This pairing forms a product with one (R) and one (S) chiral center: (3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n        *   We need to check if these molecules have internal symmetry that would make them achiral (meso compounds).\n            *   **(E)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene**: The trans isomer with R and S configuration at the chiral centers possesses a center of inversion. Therefore, it is achiral (a meso compound).\n            *   **(Z)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene**: The cis isomer with R and S configuration possesses a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is also achiral (a meso compound).\n        *   These two meso compounds are diastereomers of each other and of the chiral products from the other pairings. This gives us **2 more products**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Count the total number of unique products.**\n    *   From (R) + (R) coupling: 2 chiral products.\n    *   From (S) + (S) coupling: 2 chiral products (the enantiomers of the first two).\n    *   From (R) + (S) coupling: 2 achiral (meso) products.\n    *   Total number of possible products = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\nThe six distinct stereoisomeric products are:\n1.  (E)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n2.  (Z)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n3.  (E)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n4.  (Z)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n5.  (E)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (meso)\n6.  (Z)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (meso)\n\nTherefore, there are 6 possible products excluding ethene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
