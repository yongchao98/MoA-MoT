    "This problem requires us to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n1.  **System Properties:**\n    *   The particles are spin-1/2, which means they are fermions.\n    *   As identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n    *   For a particle in a 1D box, the quantum state is defined by its principal quantum number `n` and its spin projection quantum number `m_s`.\n    *   `m_s` can take two values: +1/2 (spin up, ↑) and -1/2 (spin down, ↓).\n    *   Therefore, each energy level `n` can hold at most two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n2.  **Energy Levels:**\n    *   The energy of a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L is given by E_n = (n^2 * π² * ħ²) / (2mL²), where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n    *   The problem provides the unit of energy E = (π² * ħ²) / (2mL²).\n    *   So, the single-particle energy levels can be written as E_n = n² * E.\n    *   E₁ = 1²E = 1E\n    *   E₂ = 2²E = 4E\n    *   E₃ = 3²E = 9E\n    *   E₄ = 4²E = 16E\n    *   ...and so on.\n\n3.  **Ground State Energy (E_GS):**\n    *   To find the ground state, we fill the energy levels from the lowest energy up, placing the four particles according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n    *   Level n=1 (E₁ = 1E): Can hold two particles (one spin up, one spin down).\n    *   Level n=2 (E₂ = 4E): Can hold the remaining two particles (one spin up, one spin down).\n    *   The total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\n        E_GS = 2 * E₁ + 2 * E₂ = 2 * (1E) + 2 * (4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n4.  **First Excited State Energy (E_1st):**\n    *   The first excited state is the lowest-energy state above the ground state. It is achieved by moving one particle from an occupied level to an unoccupied level with the minimum possible energy increase.\n    *   The ground state configuration has particles in n=1 and n=2. The lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n    *   To minimize the energy increase, we should excite a particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n    *   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    *   The energy of the first excited state is:\n        E_1st = 2 * E₁ + 1 * E₂ + 1 * E₃ = 2 * (1E) + 1 * (4E) + 1 * (9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n5.  **Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd):**\n    *   The second excited state is the state with the next lowest energy after the first excited state. We must consider all possible low-energy excitations from the ground state.\n    *   Let's consider the possible configurations and their energies:\n        *   **Possibility (a):** Exciting one particle from n=1 to n=3 (leaving n=2 fully occupied).\n            Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.\n            Energy = 1 * E₁ + 2 * E₂ + 1 * E₃ = 1 * (1E) + 2 * (4E) + 1 * (9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n        *   **Possibility (b):** Exciting both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n            Configuration: Two particles in n=1, two in n=3.\n            Energy = 2 * E₁ + 2 * E₃ = 2 * (1E) + 2 * (9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n        *   **Possibility (c):** Exciting one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n            Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.\n            Energy = 2 * E₁ + 1 * E₂ + 1 * E₄ = 2 * (1E) + 1 * (4E) + 1 * (16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n    *   Comparing these energies (18E, 20E, 22E) to the first excited state energy (15E), the next lowest energy is 18E.\n    *   Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is E_2nd = 18E.\n\nTo verify, we can use a python script to systematically generate all possible configurations for the four fermions (respecting Pauli exclusion) and calculate their energies, then sort them to find the lowest three.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef calculate_energy(config):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the energy of a configuration in units of E.\"\"\"\n    energy = 0\n    for n in config:\n        energy += n*n\n    return energy\n\ndef get_all_configurations(num_particles, max_level):\n    \"\"\"Generate all possible configurations for num_particles fermions.\"\"\"\n    levels = list(range(1, max_level + 1))\n    configs = set()\n    # A state is a multiset of occupied energy levels, e.g., (1, 1, 2, 2).\n    # We can think of this as finding partitions of the 4 particles into groups,\n    # where each group is assigned a unique energy level.

    "This question asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n**1. Understand the System**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Being spin-1/2 means they are **fermions**.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state for a particle in a 1D well is defined by its principal quantum number `n` and its spin quantum number `m_s`.\n*   **Energy Levels:** For a 1D infinite potential well of length L, the single-particle energy levels are given by:\n    E_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²) where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n*   **Unit of Energy:** The problem defines E = (π²ħ² / 2mL²). Therefore, the energy levels can be simplified to:\n    E_n = n²E\n    *   E₁ = 1²E = 1E\n    *   E₂ = 2²E = 4E\n    *   E₃ = 3²E = 9E\n    *   E₄ = 4²E = 16E\n    *   and so on.\n*   **State Occupancy:** Each energy level `n` has two possible spin states (spin up, m_s = +1/2, and spin down, m_s = -1/2). Thus, according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, each energy level can hold a maximum of **two** particles.\n\n**2. Calculating the Ground State Energy**\n\nTo find the ground state, we must fill the lowest energy levels with the four particles without violating the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **Level n=1 (E₁ = 1E):** Place the first two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   **Level n=2 (E₂ = 4E):** Place the next two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n\nAll four particles are now placed in the lowest possible energy configuration.\nThe total ground state energy (E_gs) is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_gs = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n**3. Calculating the First Excited State Energy**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (LUMO).\n\n*   In the ground state, the HOMO is n=2 and the LUMO is n=3.\n*   We promote one particle from level n=2 to level n=3.\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state (E_1st) is:\nE_1st = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n**4. Calculating the Second Excited State Energy**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We must consider different ways to excite the system from the ground state and find the one with the lowest energy increase after the first excited state.\n\n*   **Possibility A:** Excite one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n*   **Possibility B:** Excite one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = 1E + (2 × 4E) + 9E = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n*   **Possibility C:** Excite both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = 2E + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n\nComparing the possible excitation energies (22E, 18E, 20E), the lowest one after the first excited state (15E) is 18E. This is the energy of the second excited state.\n\n**Summary of Energies:**\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThese values correspond to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
