    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material, Compound X, from the spectroscopic data.**\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The very broad absorption from **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, which often exists as a hydrogen-bonded dimer.\n    *   The strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, which is typical for a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A very downfield, broad singlet for one proton is the classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). This confirms the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region indicate a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is due to the protons ortho (adjacent) to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is due to the protons ortho to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Analysis of the Alkyl Group Signals:**\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons, coupled to both the -CH- and the terminal -CH₃, indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton, which is significantly deshielded, indicates a methine group (-CH-) directly attached to the aromatic ring (a benzylic proton). It is coupled to the neighboring methyl and methylene groups.\n    *   **Assembling the Structure of Compound X:**\n        *   From the signals, we can construct the alkyl group: a CH (at 2.9 ppm) is bonded to a CH₃ (at 1.4 ppm) and a CH₂ (at 1.7 ppm). The CH₂ is bonded to another CH₃ (at 0.9 ppm). This forms a *sec*-butyl group: -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃.\n        *   Putting everything together, we have a *sec*-butyl group and a carboxylic acid group at the para positions (positions 1 and 4) of a benzene ring.\n        *   Therefore, the structure of **Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option B.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the product of the reaction.**\n\n*   **The Reagents:** The reaction is carried out with **red phosphorus and hydriodic acid (HI)**.\n*   **The Reaction:** This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent. It is known for the complete reduction of carbonyl-containing functional groups, including aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids, down to the corresponding alkane. In this case, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be fully reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). The rest of the molecule, including the stable aromatic ring and the alkyl side chain, remains unchanged under these conditions.\n*   **Predicting the Final Product:**\n    *   Starting Material (Compound X): 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   The -COOH group is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n    *   The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**Step 3: Match the predicted product with the given options.**\n\n*   The predicted final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n*   This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
