    "This question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation\n\n1.  **Starting Point: Retarded Potentials**\n    For a general time-dependent charge distribution $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current distribution $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$, the scalar and vector potentials at a point $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$ are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\n    Here, $t_r = t - \\dfrac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$ is the retarded time. It accounts for the finite time it takes for the electromagnetic field to propagate from the source point $\\vec{r}'$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at the speed of light $c$.\n\n2.  **Applying to a Point Charge**\n    For a single point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities can be expressed using the Dirac delta function:\n    $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt'}$ is the velocity of the charge.\n\n3.  **Substituting into the Potential Integrals**\n    Let's substitute these densities into the potential integrals. The variable of integration is $\\vec{r}'$. The delta function is evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$, which itself depends on $\\vec{r}'$.\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{v}(t_r) \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\n4.  **Evaluating the Integral**\n    The integral involving a delta function with a functional argument `δ(f(x))` is non-trivial. When integrating over the delta function $\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))$, we must account for the fact that $t_r$ depends on $\\vec{r}'$. This introduces a Jacobian-like correction factor in the denominator.\n    The evaluation of the integral (a standard result in E&M textbooks) yields:\n    $\\int \\dfrac{G(\\vec{r}') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r' = \\left[ \\dfrac{G(\\vec{r}')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'| \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}')}{c |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} \\right)} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    The subscript \"ret\" means all quantities inside the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n5.  **Introducing the Problem's Notation**\n    *   The source position at the retarded time is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   The vector from the source position at $t_r$ to the field point $\\vec{r}$ is $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   The magnitude of this vector is $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n    *   The retarded time condition is $d = c(t - t_r)$.\n    *   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$.\n\n    With this notation, the denominator term becomes:\n    $d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c d} \\right) = d - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\n6.  **Final Expressions for V and A**\n    Now we can write the final potentials.\n    For the scalar potential $V$, the function $G(\\vec{r}')$ is just 1.\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{1}{d - (\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d})/c} \\right] = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{c}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} \\right] = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    For the vector potential $\\vec{A}$, the function $G(\\vec{r}')$ is $\\vec{v}(t_r) = \\vec{v}$.\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{d - (\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d})/c} \\right] = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{c\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} \\right] = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n7.  **Comparing with Options**\n    The derived expressions are:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    $\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\n    These expressions match option B exactly.\n\n    It's also useful to note the relationship between $\\vec{A}$ and $V$:\n    $\\vec{A} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v}}{\\epsilon_o} V = (\\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v}) V$\n    Since $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o \\epsilon_o)$, this simplifies to:\n    $\\vec{A} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n    The expressions in option B satisfy this relationship.\n\nFinal check of the other options:\n*   A and C use the static Coulomb potential form, which is incorrect for a moving charge because it neglects retardation effects.\n*   D has an incorrect sign in the denominator (`+` instead of `-`), which would correspond to advanced potentials (unphysical in this scenario).\n\nTherefore, option B provides the correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<B>>>"
