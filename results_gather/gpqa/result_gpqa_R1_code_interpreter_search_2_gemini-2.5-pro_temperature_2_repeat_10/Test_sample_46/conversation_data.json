    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring. The remaining degree of unsaturation (1) suggests a double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2 group). The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is consistent with an ester group that is conjugated to an aromatic ring (Ar-C(=O)OR). Simple alkyl esters absorb at slightly higher frequencies (around 1735-1750 cm-1).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal corresponds to 3 protons, appearing as a triplet. This indicates a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-). This is the characteristic upfield part of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal corresponds to 2 protons, appearing as a quartet. This indicates a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3-). The downfield chemical shift (4.5 ppm) is highly indicative of a methylene group bonded to an electronegative oxygen atom, specifically in an ester functional group (-O-CH2-). Together with the signal at 1.20 ppm, this confirms the presence of an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) as part of an ester.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet corresponds to 2 protons. The broadness is typical for exchangeable protons on a heteroatom, such as an amine (N-H) or alcohol (O-H). Given the IR data indicating a primary amine, this signal is assigned to the two protons of the -NH2 group.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. They integrate to a total of 4 protons. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is the classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n        *   The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is due to protons ortho to the electron-donating amine (-NH2) group.\n        *   The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is due to protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ethyl ester (-COOEt) group.\n\n*   **Putting it all together:**\n    1.  We have a benzene ring substituted at the 1 and 4 positions.\n    2.  One substituent is a primary amine (-NH2).\n    3.  The other substituent is an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    4.  The only structure that fits all these pieces of evidence is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n*   **Let's check the options:**\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches our deduced structure.\n    *   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the two N-H bands in the IR. It would also show a formyl proton (H-C=O) signal around 8-8.5 ppm in the NMR.\n    *   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is a phenyl ester (Ar-O-C=O-R). In the NMR, the ethyl group would be attached to the carbonyl side, so the -CH2- signal would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted (1,3-disubstituted) ring, which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two clean doublets. It is also a primary amide, which typically has a C=O stretch at a lower frequency (around 1680 cm-1) than the observed 1720 cm-1.\n\nThe compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
