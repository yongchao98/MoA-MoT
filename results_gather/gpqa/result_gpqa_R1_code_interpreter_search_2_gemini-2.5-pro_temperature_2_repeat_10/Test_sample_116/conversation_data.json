    "*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism:**\n    A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Common features that lead to chirality include the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (due to restricted rotation, as seen in some biphenyl compounds). Molecules that have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion are achiral and thus not optically active.\n\n*   **1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl molecule. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single bond. The ortho positions (positions 2, 6 on one ring and 2', 6' on the other) are substituted with large groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two methyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   **Chirality:** Due to the large size of these ortho substituents, there is significant steric hindrance that prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation forces the rings into a non-planar arrangement. As a result, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is not superimposable on its mirror image. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism, which is a type of axial chirality.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. It is an ester commonly known as methyl lactate.\n    *   **Chirality:** Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bearing the hydroxyl group). This carbon is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since this carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center (or asymmetric carbon).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus it shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **3. benzophenone:**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is (C6H5)2CO. It has a central carbonyl group (C=O) attached to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule is symmetric. There are no chiral centers. The molecule possesses a C2 axis of rotation passing through the C=O bond. Furthermore, a plane of symmetry can be drawn that contains the C=O group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **4. dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar. It possesses both a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of these symmetry elements means the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Summary:**\n    *   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n    *   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (has a chiral center).\n    *   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n    *   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>"
