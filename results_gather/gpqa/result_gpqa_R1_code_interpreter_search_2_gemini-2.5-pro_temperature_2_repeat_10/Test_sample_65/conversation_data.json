    "*   **Lorentz and Poincare Symmetry:** The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is, by construction, a relativistic quantum field theory. This means that its Lagrangian, including all higher-dimensional operators, must be invariant under the transformations of the Poincare group. The Poincare group includes Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) and spacetime translations. Therefore, both Lorentz symmetry (1) and Poincare symmetry (2) must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT.\n\n*   **CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a cornerstone of quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian will be invariant under the combined action of Charge conjugation (C), Parity inversion (P), and Time reversal (T). Since the SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant theory, all of its operators must respect CPT symmetry (4).\n\n*   **CP Symmetry:** CP symmetry (the combination of Charge conjugation and Parity) is known to be violated in the Standard Model (SM), specifically by the weak interaction as described by the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix. The SMEFT is an extension of the SM, and it can include new operators that provide additional sources of CP violation. Since CP is already violated in the SM and can be further violated by new physics, it is not a symmetry that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. Therefore, (3) is not a required symmetry.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry. This corresponds to options 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
