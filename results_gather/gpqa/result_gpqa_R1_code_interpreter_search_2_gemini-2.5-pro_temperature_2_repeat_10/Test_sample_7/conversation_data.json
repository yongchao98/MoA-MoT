As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct conclusion from the experimental data.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Phenotypes of Single Mutants\n\n*   **Wild-type (Control):** 100% resistance. This is our baseline.\n*   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. This means gene G1 contributes to resistance, and its loss causes a mild (25%) reduction in resistance.\n*   **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. This means gene G2 is absolutely essential for resistance. Its loss leads to a complete loss of the phenotype. This is the most severe phenotype.\n*   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. This means gene G3 also contributes to resistance, and its loss causes a moderate (50%) reduction in resistance.\n\nFrom the single mutant data, G2 appears to be the most critical gene in the pathway. Given the information that one of the genes is a transcription factor (TF) acting upstream, G2 is the strongest candidate for this role. A master TF required to activate the entire resistance pathway would, when knocked out, result in a total loss of resistance.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Phenotypes of Double Mutants to Determine Gene Interactions\n\nThe key to understanding gene pathways is analyzing double mutants to check for epistasis. Epistasis occurs when the phenotype of a double mutant (`genex/geney`) is the same as one of the single mutants (`genex` or `geney`). The gene whose single-mutant phenotype is expressed in the double mutant is called epistatic.\n\n*   **g1g2 double mutant:** 0% resistance.\n    *   Compare this to the single mutants: `g1` is 75% and `g2` is 0%.\n    *   The phenotype of `g1g2` (0%) is identical to the phenotype of `g2` (0%).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The `g2` mutation is epistatic to the `g1` mutation. This means that in the context of a non-functional G2, the status of G1 (whether it's functional or not) is irrelevant. This often implies G2 is downstream of G1, or G2 is an essential component in a parallel pathway. However, given that G2 is the likely upstream TF, this means that G1's function is dependent on G2 being active.\n\n*   **g2g3 double mutant:** 0% resistance.\n    *   Compare this to the single mutants: `g2` is 0% and `g3` is 50%.\n    *   The phenotype of `g2g3` (0%) is identical to the phenotype of `g2` (0%).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The `g2` mutation is epistatic to the `g3` mutation. Similar to the case above, G3's function is irrelevant if G2 is non-functional.\n\n*   **g1g3 double mutant:** 10% resistance.\n    *   Compare this to the single mutants: `g1` is 75% and `g3` is 50%.\n    *   The phenotype of `g1g3` (10%) is different from both the `g1` (75%) and `g3` (50%) phenotypes. In fact, it's much more severe than either, suggesting a synergistic interaction. The loss of both genes is more detrimental than the sum of their individual losses.\n    *   **Conclusion:** There is no epistasis between G1 and G3. They likely function in parallel or in a way that their contributions are partially overlapping (partially redundant).\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Options Based on the Analysis\n\nNow we can check each statement against our conclusions.\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": Plausible, as argued above.\n    *   \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\": **False**. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n\n*   **B) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   \"G1 is a transcription factor\": Unlikely. The `g1` mutant has the mildest phenotype, which is not characteristic of a master TF in this context.\n    *   \"G2 is epistatic towards G1\": **True**. As determined in step 2, the `g1g2` phenotype (0%) matches the `g2` phenotype (0%).\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": Plausible.\n    *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\": **False**. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%).\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": Plausible.\n    *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\": **False**.\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\n\nOnly Option B contains a statement about epistasis that is factually correct based on a standard interpretation of the genetic data provided (`G2 is epistatic towards G1`). Options A, C, and D all make factually incorrect claims about the epistatic relationship between G1 and G3. Although the claim in option B that \"G1 is a transcription factor\" seems unlikely, the claim about epistasis is derived directly and correctly from the numbers. In multiple-choice questions of this nature, you must select the option with the most accurate information. The incorrect description of the G1/G3 interaction in options A, C, and D makes them definitively wrong.\n\n<<<B>>>"
