    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Determine the identity of hydrocarbon Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, with a general formula CnHm.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%. This is equivalent to 14.28/100 ≈ 1/7.\n    *   Let's set up the equation for the mass fraction of hydrogen:\n        Mass Fraction (H) = (m * AtomicMass(H)) / (n * AtomicMass(C) + m * AtomicMass(H))\n        Using integer atomic masses (H=1, C=12):\n        1/7 = m / (12n + m)\n    *   Solving for the relationship between m and n:\n        1 * (12n + m) = 7m\n        12n = 6m\n        m = 2n\n    *   The general formula for Z is C_n H_{2n}. This formula corresponds to either an alkene (with one double bond) or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation under severe conditions and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This means Z is a fully saturated compound. An alkene would react further with hydrogen, so Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem also states that Z is a constituent of mixture Y and is \"widely used as a solvent.\" The most common cycloalkane solvent matching this description is cyclohexane.\n    *   Let's check if cyclohexane, C6H12, fits the formula C_n H_{2n}. Here, n=6 and m=12. Since m = 2n (12 = 2*6), it fits perfectly.\n    *   Therefore, substance Z is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Determine the components of mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   One of the liquids is Z, which we identified as cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic. Cyclohexane is saturated.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   Let the other component of Y be Y2. Hydrogenating the mixture (cyclohexane + Y2) gives only cyclohexane. This means that Y2 must also have a C6 carbon skeleton and can be hydrogenated to form cyclohexane.\n    *   Y2 does not decolorize bromine water, but it can be hydrogenated. This strongly points to an aromatic compound. The aromatic hydrocarbon with a C6 skeleton is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   Benzene does not react with bromine water under normal conditions, and its hydrogenation under severe conditions yields cyclohexane.\n    *   Thus, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the reaction forming Y from X.**\n    *   Mixture X (an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2) is heated with platinum to form mixture Y (an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and benzene).\n    *   The reaction is: X1 + X2 → C6H12 + C6H6.\n    *   This is described as a disproportionation, which is a type of redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In this context, it refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction where one molecule donates hydrogen (gets oxidized) and another accepts it (gets reduced).\n    *   From the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms must be the same on both sides of the reaction.\n    *   Total Carbon atoms in products = 6 (from cyclohexane) + 6 (from benzene) = 12. So, X1 and X2 together must have 12 carbon atoms.\n    *   Total Hydrogen atoms in products = 12 (from cyclohexane) + 6 (from benzene) = 18. So, X1 and X2 together must have 18 hydrogen atoms.\n\n4.  **Determine the components of mixture X and the total number of hydrogen atoms.**\n    *   The problem states that the hydrogenation of mixture X yields only substance Z (cyclohexane, C6H12). This implies that both liquids in mixture X, X1 and X2, must have a six-carbon-atom skeleton that becomes cyclohexane upon adding hydrogen. Thus, X1 is C6Ha and X2 is C6Hb.\n    *   From the atom balance in step 3, we know that the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2 is 18. So, a + b = 18.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning both X1 and X2 are unsaturated (they contain C=C double or C≡C triple bonds). This means they have fewer hydrogen atoms than the corresponding saturated cycloalkane (C6H12). So, a < 12 and b < 12. For stable, neutral hydrocarbons, a and b must be even numbers.\n    *   We need to find two even integers, a and b, both less than 12, that sum to 18. The only possible pair is 10 and 8.\n    *   So, the molecules in mixture X are **C6H10** and **C6H8**.\n    *   Let's check the final condition: \"no conjugated multiple bonds.\"\n        *   C6H10 (with a cyclohexane ring) is cyclohexene. It has one double bond, so no conjugation is possible. This fits.\n        *   C6H8 (with a cyclohexane ring) is a cyclohexadiene. There are two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). Since the problem rules out conjugated bonds, this must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**. This also fits.\n    *   The overall reaction is a hydrogen transfer:\n        C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C6H10 (cyclohexene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane)\n        The 1,4-cyclohexadiene is oxidized to benzene, and the cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane. This is a plausible disproportionation/hydrogen transfer reaction.\n\n5.  **Calculate the final answer.**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   The two liquids are C6H10 and C6H8.\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
