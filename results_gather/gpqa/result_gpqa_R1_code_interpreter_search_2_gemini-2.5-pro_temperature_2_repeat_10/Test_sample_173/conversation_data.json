    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n### 1. Understand and Define the Initial Values\n\n*   **Initial rest-mass energy (M*c²):** 300 GeV. The nucleus is at rest, so its initial kinetic energy is 0 and its initial momentum is 0.\n*   **Fragments' rest-masses:** Let the two fragments have rest-masses m1 and m2. We are given:\n    *   `m1 = 2 * m2` (The more massive fragment is T1's particle).\n    *   The sum of their rest-mass energies is 99% of the initial rest-mass energy: `m1*c² + m2*c² = 0.99 * (M*c²)`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\n\nUsing the given information, we can calculate the individual rest-mass energies.\n*   `m1*c² + m2*c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n*   Since `m1*c² = 2 * (m2*c²)`, we can substitute this into the sum:\n    `2 * (m2*c²) + m2*c² = 297 GeV`\n    `3 * (m2*c²) = 297 GeV`\n    `m2*c² = 99 GeV`\n*   Now, we find the energy of the more massive fragment:\n    `m1*c² = 2 * (m2*c²) = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`\n\nSo, we have:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m1*c²): **198 GeV**\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (m2*c²): **99 GeV**\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final sum of rest-mass energies. This is a direct consequence of the conservation of total energy.\n*   `Q = Initial Energy - Final Rest Energy`\n*   `Q = (M*c²) - (m1*c² + m2*c²)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: `Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Mechanics\n\nIn classical mechanics, we use the conservation of momentum `p = mv`. Since the initial momentum was zero, the final momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n*   `p1 = p2` => `m1 * v1 = m2 * v2`\n\nThe kinetic energies are given by `T = (1/2)mv²`. Let's find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n*   `T1_classical / T2_classical = ( (1/2)m1*v1² ) / ( (1/2)m2*v2² ) = (m1/m2) * (v1/v2)²`\n*   From momentum conservation, `v1/v2 = m2/m1`.\n*   Substituting this into the energy ratio: `T1_classical / T2_classical = (m1/m2) * (m2/m1)² = m2/m1`\n*   `T1_classical / T2_classical = 99 GeV / 198 GeV = 1/2`. So, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nNow we use the total kinetic energy:\n*   `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\nSo, the classical approximation for T1 is **1000 MeV**.\n\n### 5. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, momentum conservation `|p1| = |p2|` still holds. We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`, which can be rearranged to `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`.\nSince `|p1| = |p2|`, we have `(p1c)² = (p2c)²`.\n*   `E1² - (m1c²)² = E2² - (m2c²)²`\nHere `E1 = T1 + m1c²` and `E2 = T2 + m2c²` are the total energies of the fragments.\n\nLet's rearrange the equation to solve for the energies:\n*   `E1² - E2² = (m1c²)² - (m2c²)²`\n*   `(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1c² - m2c²)(m1c² + m2c²)`\n\nFrom conservation of total energy, we know `E1 + E2 = M*c² = 300 GeV`.\n*   `(E1 - E2) * (300 GeV) = (198 GeV - 99 GeV) * (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n*   `(E1 - E2) * 300 = (99) * (297)`\n*   `E1 - E2 = (99 * 297) / 300 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations:\n1.  `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n2.  `E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nAdding the two equations together:\n*   `2 * E1 = 398.01 GeV`\n*   `E1 = 199.005 GeV`\n\nThe kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy `E1` minus the rest-mass energy `m1c²`:\n*   `T1 = E1 - m1c²`\n*   `T1 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\nSo, the correct relativistic value for T1 is **1005 MeV**.\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\n\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = T1 (relativistic) - T1 (classical)\n*   Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV\n\nThe difference is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>"
