    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State (t < 0):**\n    *   The particle is spin-1/2. Its magnetic moment is given by the vector operator `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin vector operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The problem states `mu = gamma*Sz`, which is interpreted as the standard definition of the z-component of the magnetic moment, i.e., `μ_z = γS_z`, and similarly for the other components (`μ_x = γS_x`, `μ_y = γS_y`).\n    *   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B` in the `+z` direction: `B_initial = B k̂`.\n    *   The Hamiltonian for this situation is `H_initial = -μ · B_initial = -γ(S · B_initial) = -γB S_z`.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned\" with the field. This means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`. The eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` (for the spin-up state `|+z>`) and `-ħ/2` (for the spin-down state `|-z>`).\n    *   The corresponding energies are `E = -γB * (eigenvalue of S_z)`.\n    *   Assuming `γ > 0`, the lowest energy corresponds to the largest `S_z` eigenvalue, which is `+ħ/2`. The state is `|+z>`. (Even if `γ < 0`, the standard interpretation of \"aligned\" is that the spin points along the field, so we start in `|+z>`. As we will see, the choice of initial state does not change the oscillation frequency).\n    *   So, at `t=0`, the state of the particle is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Situation for t > 0:**\n    *   At `t=0`, the z-direction field is turned off, and a new field of the same magnitude `B` is turned on along the `+y` direction: `B_new = B ĵ`.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system is `H_new = -μ · B_new = -γ(S · B_new) = -γB S_y`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Time Evolution of the State:**\n    *   The state `|ψ(t)>` evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, with the solution given by `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * H_new * t / ħ) |ψ(0)>`.\n    *   Substituting `H_new` and `|ψ(0)>`, we get: `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * (-γB S_y) * t / ħ) |+z> = exp(i * (γBt/ħ) * S_y) |+z>`.\n    *   This operator represents a rotation of the spin state around the y-axis.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-Component of Spin:**\n    *   We are interested in the oscillation of the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z> = <γS_z> = γ<S_z>`. So, we need to calculate `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`.\n    *   There are multiple ways to proceed. A robust method is using the Heisenberg picture or the Ehrenfest theorem, which gives the equation of motion for the expectation value of an operator.\n\n    **Method: Ehrenfest's Theorem**\n    The time evolution of the expectation value of the spin operator `<S>` is given by:\n    `d<S>/dt = (1/iħ) <[S, H_new]>`\n    where `[S, H_new]` is the commutator.\n    `H_new = -γB S_y`. So, `d<S>/dt = (1/iħ) <[S, -γB S_y]> = (-γB/iħ) <[S, S_y]>`.\n\n    Let's evaluate this for each component of the spin: `Sx`, `Sy`, `Sz`.\n    *   **For `<S_x>`:** `d<S_x>/dt = (-γB/iħ) <[S_x, S_y]>`. Using the fundamental commutation relation `[S_x, S_y] = iħS_z`, we get `d<S_x>/dt = (-γB/iħ) (iħ<S_z>) = -γB<S_z>`.\n    *   **For `<S_y>`:** `d<S_y>/dt = (-γB/iħ) <[S_y, S_y]>`. Since `[S_y, S_y] = 0`, we have `d<S_y>/dt = 0`.\n    *   **For `<S_z>`:** `d<S_z>/dt = (-γB/iħ) <[S_z, S_y]>`. Using `[S_z, S_y] = -iħS_x`, we get `d<S_z>/dt = (-γB/iħ) (-iħ<S_x>) = +γB<S_x>`.\n\n    We have a system of coupled differential equations for the expectation values:\n    1.  `d<S_x>/dt = -γB<S_z>`\n    2.  `d<S_z>/dt = +γB<S_x>`\n\n    To find the oscillation of `<S_z>`, we can differentiate the second equation with respect to time:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = γB (d<S_x>/dt)`\n\n    Now substitute the first equation into this one:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = γB (-γB<S_z>) = -(γB)²<S_z>`\n\n5.  **Identify the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   The equation `d²<S_z>/dt² = -(γB)²<S_z>` is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator: `d²x/dt² = -ω²x`.\n    *   The solution for `x(t)` is a sinusoidal oscillation, like `A*cos(ωt + φ)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is `ω`.\n    *   By comparing our equation for `<S_z>` with the standard oscillator equation, we can identify the angular frequency of oscillation `ω_osc` as:\n        `ω_osc = γB`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The average of the z-component of the particle's moment, `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t)`, will oscillate with the same frequency as `<S_z>(t)`. This frequency, known as the Larmor frequency, is `γB`.\n\nThe oscillation is a direct consequence of the precession of the spin vector around the new magnetic field axis (the y-axis).\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\nLet's use a Python code snippet to confirm the double-angle frequency relationship found during the reasoning (`<Sz>` oscillating at `2*ω_0`).\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import cos, sin, I, pi, Matrix, Symbol, Function\nfrom sympy.physics.quantum import Dagger\n\n# Define symbols\nomega_0 = Symbol('omega_0', real=True)\nt = Symbol('t', real=True)\nhbar = Symbol('hbar', real=True)\n\n# Define the state vector |psi(t)> in the z-basis\n# |psi(t)> = cos(omega_0*t)|+z> - sin(omega_0*t)|-z>\npsi = Matrix([cos(omega_0*t), -sin(omega_0*t)])\n\n# Define the Sz operator in the z-basis\nSz = (hbar/2) * Matrix([[1, 0], [0, -1]])\n\n# Calculate the expectation value <Sz>(t) = <psi|Sz|psi>\nSz_exp_val = Dagger(psi) * Sz * psi\n\n# Simplify the result\nsimplified_exp_val = sympy.simplify(Sz_exp_val[0])\n\n# Print the result\nprint(simplified_exp_val)\n\n```\nThe python code calculates `<ψ|Sz|ψ>` for the state `|ψ(t)> = cos(ω₀t)|+z> - sin(ω₀t)|-z>`. The calculation shows that the result is `(ħ/2)cos(2ω₀t)`. This confirms that if the state vector components oscillate with frequency `ω₀`, the expectation value of `Sz` oscillates with frequency `2ω₀`. In our physical system, `ω₀ = γB/2`, so the oscillation frequency of `<Sz>` is `2ω₀ = γB`.\n\nThe code interpreter returned:\n`hbar*cos(2*omega_0*t)/2`\nThis confirms that the expectation value `<Sz>` oscillates with angular frequency `2*omega_0`. As established in the reasoning, `omega_0` is `γB/2`. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of `<Sz>` and `<μz>` is `2 * (γB/2) = γB`.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Initial State (t < 0):**\n    *   A spin-1/2 particle has its magnetic moment `μ` aligned with a magnetic field `B` in the `+z` direction. The Hamiltonian is `H = -μ · B = -γS_z B`.\n    *   The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n    *   \"Aligned\" with the field means the particle is in the lowest energy state. Assuming the gyromagnetic ratio `γ` is positive, the energy `E = -γB S_z` is minimized when `S_z` is maximized.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is the spin-up state along the z-axis:\n        `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian (t ≥ 0):**\n    *   The magnetic field is suddenly switched to the `+y` direction with the same magnitude `B`.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system is `H' = -μ · B' = -γ(S · B ĵ) = -γB S_y`.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution of the State:**\n    *   The state `|ψ(t)>` evolves according to the Schrödinger equation, `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)>`, where the time evolution operator is `U(t) = exp(-iH't / ħ)`.\n    *   Substituting `H'`, we get:\n        `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t / ħ) |+z> = exp(i(γBt/ħ)S_y) |+z>`\n    *   This operator represents a rotation of the spin state about the y-axis by an angle `θ(t) = γBt`. However, for a spin-1/2 particle, the rotation is given by `exp(-i θ/2 σ_n)`, where `σ_n` is the Pauli matrix. A more precise formulation is using `S_y = ħ/2 * σ_y`.\n        `|ψ(t)> = exp(i(γBt/ħ) * (ħ/2 * σ_y)) |+z> = exp(i(γBt/2)σ_y) |+z>`\n        where `σ_y` is the Pauli Y matrix.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value `<μ_z>(t)`:**\n    *   The problem asks for the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z>(t) = <γS_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t)`. We need to calculate `<S_z>(t)`.\n    *   `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)> = <ψ(0)| U†(t) S_z U(t) |ψ(0)>`.\n\n5.  **Heisenberg Picture / Ehrenfest Theorem (A more direct approach):**\n    *   The equation of motion for the expectation value of an operator `Â` is given by the Ehrenfest theorem: `d<Â>/dt = (1/iħ)<[Â, H]>`.\n    *   Let's find the equations for `<S_x>`, `<S_y>`, and `<S_z>` with `H' = -γB S_y`.\n        `d<S_k>/dt = (1/iħ)<[S_k, -γB S_y]> = (iγB/ħ)<[S_k, S_y]>`\n    *   Using the spin commutation relations `[S_i, S_j] = iħε_ijk S_k`:\n        *   `d<S_x>/dt = (iγB/ħ)<[S_x, S_y]> = (iγB/ħ)(iħS_z) = -γB<S_z>`\n        *   `d<S_y>/dt = (iγB/ħ)<[S_y, S_y]> = 0` (as expected, the spin component along the field is conserved)\n        *   `d<S_z>/dt = (iγB/ħ)<[S_z, S_y]> = (iγB/ħ)(-iħS_x) = γB<S_x>`\n\n6.  **Solve the Differential Equations:**\n    *   We have a system of coupled linear differential equations for `<S_z>` and `<S_x>`:\n        1.  `d<S_z>/dt = γB <S_x>`\n        2.  `d<S_x>/dt = -γB <S_z>`\n    *   Differentiate the first equation with respect to time:\n        `d²<S_z>/dt² = γB (d<S_x>/dt)`\n    *   Substitute the second equation into this:\n        `d²<S_z>/dt² = γB (-γB <S_z>) = -(γB)² <S_z>`\n    *   This is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, `d²x/dt² = -ω²x`, where `x(t) = <S_z>(t)` and the angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The expectation value `<S_z>(t)` (and thus `<μ_z>(t)`) oscillates sinusoidally. The angular frequency of this oscillation is `ω = γB`. This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The spin vector precesses around the new magnetic field direction (`y`-axis) with the Larmor frequency `ω_L = γB`. The z-component of the spin therefore oscillates at this frequency.\n\nThe initial state determines the amplitude and phase of the oscillation (`<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`), but not its frequency.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
