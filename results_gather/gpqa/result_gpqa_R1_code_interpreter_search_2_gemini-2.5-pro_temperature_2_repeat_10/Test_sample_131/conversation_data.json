    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Initial Clues**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14. All four options (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene) conform to this formula.\n*   **Aliphatic Signals:** The problem states there are signals around 2.2 ppm which are \"all singlets\". This chemical shift is characteristic of methyl groups attached to a benzene ring (Ar-CH3). The ethyl groups (-CH2CH3) in 1,4-diethylbenzene would produce a quartet and a triplet due to spin-spin coupling, not singlets.\n*   **Conclusion:** Based on the aliphatic signals being singlets, we can rule out **1,4-diethylbenzene**. This eliminates option C.\n\n**2. Analyze the Aromatic Signals**\n\n*   **Aromatic Signals:** The spectrum shows \"two signals (two singlets)\". A singlet in the aromatic region means the corresponding proton has no adjacent protons (no ortho-coupling).\n*   Let's analyze the aromatic protons for the remaining compounds:\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:** This molecule has two protons at positions 5 and 6. These protons are adjacent to each other. They would couple and produce a signal that is a doublet (or a more complex AX or AB system), not a singlet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** We can rule out **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This eliminates options A and D.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Remaining Option**\n\n*   By elimination, the only remaining option is **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n*   Let's verify if a 1:1 mixture of these two compounds is consistent with all the NMR data.\n\n**Compound 1: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n*   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n*   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons. They will produce **one singlet** with an integral of **2H**.\n*   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** with an integral of **12H**.\n\n**Compound 2: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n*   **Symmetry:** This molecule is less symmetrical.\n*   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two protons (at C4 and C6). Their chemical environments are different, and neither has an adjacent proton. In principle, this should give two separate 1H singlets. However, for the final mixture to have only two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 ratio, it is necessary that these two protons are accidentally degenerate (have the same chemical shift). This is a common feature in such problems. If they are degenerate, they produce **one singlet** with a total integral of **2H**.\n*   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are four methyl groups in unique positions. Based on their environments, it is plausible that they are accidentally degenerate in pairs. Specifically, the two methyls ortho to a single methyl group and a proton (at C1 and C3) form one group, and the other two (at C2 and C5) form another. This would result in **two singlets**, each with an integral of **6H**.\n\n**4. Analyze the 1:1 Mixture Spectrum**\n\nNow, let's combine the spectra of the two compounds in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   Durene contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene contributes one 2H singlet (assuming the accidental degeneracy discussed above).\n    *   These two singlets are from different molecules, so they will appear at different chemical shifts.\n    *   The result is **two singlets**. Since they both correspond to 2 protons and the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, the integrals will be equal, giving a **1:1 ratio**. This matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   Durene contributes **one singlet** with an integral of **12H**.\n    *   Isodurene contributes **two singlets**, each with an integral of **6H**.\n    *   Assuming these three singlets are all at different chemical shifts, the combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrals of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n    *   The ratio of these integrals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe only pair of compounds that satisfies all the conditions of the 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
