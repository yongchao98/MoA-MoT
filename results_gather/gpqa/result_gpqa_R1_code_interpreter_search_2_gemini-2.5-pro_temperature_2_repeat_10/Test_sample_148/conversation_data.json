    "This is a classic problem in chemical analysis, particularly for molecules with multiple stereocenters, like peptides. Let's break down the evidence and evaluate the possible explanations.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the NMR Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** Two peaks for the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals summing to 1H.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This means the alpha-proton exists in two distinct chemical environments. Since the sample contains what should be a single molecular structure, this implies there are two different, but very similar, species of that molecule present in an approximate 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **What this rules out:**\n        *   **Spin-spin coupling:** The problem explicitly states to rule this out.\n        *   **A single, pure compound:** A single, pure compound in a defined conformation would show only one peak for this proton.\n    *   **What this suggests:** The presence of isomers. The question is, which kind?\n\n2.  **Analyze the LC-MS Data:**\n    *   **Observation 1:** Two clearly defined peaks in the liquid chromatogram (LC) of equal intensities.\n    *   **Interpretation 1:** This confirms the presence of two distinct chemical species that can be separated based on their different physical properties (in this case, their interaction with the LC column's stationary phase). The equal intensities confirm the ~1:1 ratio seen in the NMR.\n    *   **Observation 2:** Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, and this mass is consistent with the expected molecule.\n    *   **Interpretation 2:** This is the most critical piece of information. The two species are not impurities with different chemical formulas (like a precursor or a side product from \"double coupling\"), because they have the same mass as the target molecule. They must be **isomers**.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Isomer Possibilities (The Options):**\n\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular formula and therefore a different mass. The MS data directly contradicts this.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.\n        *   In a standard, achiral NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable and produce identical NMR spectra. You would see only **one** set of peaks, not two.\n        *   Similarly, enantiomers cannot be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. You would see only **one** peak in the LC.\n        *   Therefore, this explanation is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. This happens when a molecule has two or more chiral centers, and the configuration is different at one or more, but not all, of them (e.g., comparing an (R,S) molecule to an (R,R) molecule).\n        *   **Crucially, diastereoisomers have different physical and chemical properties.**\n        *   **NMR:** Because they are chemically distinct, diastereoisomers give different NMR spectra. A 1:1 mixture would show two complete sets of peaks, one for each diastereomer. The observation of two alpha-proton peaks is perfectly explained by this.\n        *   **LC:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereoisomers can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. The observation of two peaks in the LC is also perfectly explained.\n        *   **MS:** Since they are isomers, they have the same chemical formula and the same molecular mass. The observation that both LC peaks give the same mass spectrum (consistent with the expected molecule) is the final piece of the puzzle.\n        *   This scenario perfectly matches all the provided experimental evidence. In peptide synthesis, if one of the amino acid starting materials was not enantiomerically pure (i.e., it was a racemic mixture), or if epimerization occurred at one alpha-carbon during the synthesis, the result would be a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would create a byproduct with a different molecular structure and a significantly different molecular mass. The MS data, which shows a mass consistent with the *expected* molecule for both peaks, rules this out.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe evidence points unequivocally to the presence of a mixture of diastereoisomers. They are isomers (same mass), but they have different physical properties, which makes them separable by LC and distinguishable by NMR.\n\n<<<C>>>"
