    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical principle:** The problem deals with the population of atomic energy levels in a system that is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The relationship between the number of atoms in different energy states is described by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two different energy states (let's call them state 'i' and state 'j') as a function of temperature (T):\n\n    N_i / N_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp[-(E_i - E_j) / (k * T)]\n\n    Where:\n    *   `N_i`, `N_j` are the number of atoms in states i and j.\n    *   `g_i`, `g_j` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the states.\n    *   `E_i`, `E_j` are the energies of the states.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `T` is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Apply the equation to the specific problem:**\n    *   Let state 'i' be the specific excited state and state 'j' be the ground state.\n    *   Let `R = N_i / N_j` be the ratio representing the \"excitation\".\n    *   Let `ΔE = E_i - E_j` be the energy difference between the states.\n    *   The ratio of statistical weights `g_i / g_j` is a constant for this specific transition. Let's call it `C`.\n\n    The equation for a star with temperature `T` becomes:\n    R(T) = C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T)]\n\n4.  **Set up equations for the two stars:**\n    *   For star_1 with temperature `T_1`: R_1 = C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n    *   For star_2 with temperature `T_2`: R_2 = C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n5.  **Use the information given in the problem:** We are told that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. This means:\n    R_1 = 2 * R_2\n\n6.  **Substitute and solve:**\n    C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * (C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n\n    The constant `C` cancels out from both sides:\n    exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n    Take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for ln(2):\n    ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)\n\n    Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\n    Combine the fractions in the parenthesis:\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n7.  **Evaluate the constant term (ΔE / k):**\n    *   The problem gives the energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`.\n    *   The Boltzmann constant is `k ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`.\n\n    The ratio is therefore:\n    ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n\n    Note: The quantity `ΔE / k` has units of temperature (Kelvin) and represents the characteristic temperature of the transition.\n\n8.  **Finalize the equation and compare with options:**\n    Substituting the value `ΔE / k = 1 K` back into our derived equation:\n    ln(2) = (1 K) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n    Now, let's examine the options. The options are presented without any physical constants. This implies a common simplification in physics problems where characteristic constants are treated as a dimensionless value of 1. If we treat `(ΔE / k)` as simply the number `1`, our equation becomes:\n\n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n    This expression exactly matches option A. Although there is a dimensional inconsistency in how the option is written (the right side has units of 1/K while the left side is dimensionless), it is the only option that follows directly from the application of the Boltzmann equation and the information provided.\n\n<<<A>>>"
