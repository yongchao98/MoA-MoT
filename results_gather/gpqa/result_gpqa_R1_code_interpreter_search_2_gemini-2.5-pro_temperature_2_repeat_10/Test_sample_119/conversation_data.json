    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the relationship between parallax and distance.**\n    Parallax (plx) is defined as the inverse of the distance (d) to a star.\n    `plx = 1/d`\n    This means that a smaller parallax corresponds to a larger distance, and vice-versa. From this, we can also write:\n    `d = 1/plx`\n\n2.  **Model the uniform distribution of stars.**\n    The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number density of stars, denoted by `ρ` (the number of stars per unit volume), is constant everywhere in space.\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of stars within a certain distance.**\n    Let's find the total number of stars, `N(d)`, within a sphere of radius `d`.\n    *   The volume of a sphere of radius `d` is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   The number of stars `N(d)` inside this volume is the volume multiplied by the constant star density `ρ`:\n        `N(d) = V * ρ = (4/3)πd³ρ`\n\n4.  **Express the number of stars in terms of parallax.**\n    The question is about parallax, so we need to substitute `d = 1/plx` into our equation for `N`. `N(plx)` will represent the total number of stars with a parallax *greater than or equal to* `plx` (i.e., all stars closer than or equal to distance `d`).\n    `N(plx) = (4/3)π(1/plx)³ρ = (4/3)πρ * (1/plx³)`\n\n5.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax.**\n    We want to find how the number of stars changes for a small change in parallax. This quantity is the derivative of the cumulative number of stars `N(plx)` with respect to `plx`, which is written as `dN/d(plx)`. This derivative gives us the density of stars in \"parallax space\".\n\n    Let's differentiate `N(plx)` with respect to `plx`:\n    `N(plx) = C * plx⁻³` (where `C = (4/3)πρ` is a constant)\n    `dN/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [C * plx⁻³]`\n    `dN/d(plx) = C * (-3 * plx⁻⁴)`\n    `dN/d(plx) = -4πρ * plx⁻⁴`\n\n6.  **Interpret the result.**\n    The number of stars in a small parallax interval `d(plx)` is `dN`. We are interested in the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `|dN/d(plx)|`. The negative sign simply indicates that as parallax increases (distance decreases), the total cumulative count of stars decreases.\n    Taking the magnitude, we have:\n    `|dN/d(plx)| = 4πρ * plx⁻⁴ = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n    Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
