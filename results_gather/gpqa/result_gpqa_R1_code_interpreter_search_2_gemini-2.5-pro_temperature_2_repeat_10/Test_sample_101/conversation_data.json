The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane barrel with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets that create a binding site for the ligand. The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices. You create a bicistronic lox-Cre vector with the ligand ORF at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between the receptor and the eGFP, there is a stop in the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.

Total proteins give a signal proportional to the actin loading. You finally breed a mouse model homozygous for your construct in the wt background.

    "*   **Analysis of the Experimental Design:**\n    *   **The Goal:** The experiment aims to track neural crest cells (and their descendants) that express a specific ligand-receptor pair.\n    *   **The Tool:** A bicistronic construct is designed to express two fusion proteins conditionally, driven by the Cre-Lox system.\n    *   **The Construct:**\n        *   Promoter: CBA (a strong, generally ubiquitous promoter).\n        *   mRNA Structure: `[CBA Promoter] -> [Ligand] -> [loxP-stop-loxP] -> [mCherry] -> [IRES] -> [Receptor] -> [lox2272-stop-lox2272] -> [eGFP]`\n    *   **The Switch:** `SOX10-Cre` mouse. SOX10 is a transcription factor that marks the neural crest lineage. When crossed, the offspring will express Cre recombinase specifically in SOX10-positive cells (neural crest cells).\n    *   **The Expected Outcome (in SOX10+ cells):**\n        1.  Cre recombinase recognizes the two `loxP` sites and excises the \"stop\" sequence between the ligand and mCherry. This should lead to the translation of a Ligand-mCherry fusion protein, which would be visible as a red signal.\n        2.  Cre recombinase recognizes the two `lox2272` sites and excises the \"stop\" sequence between the receptor and eGFP. This should lead to the translation of a Receptor-eGFP fusion protein, which would be visible as a green signal.\n    *   **The Observed Outcome:** No green signal is observed.\n\n*   **Evaluation of the Potential Reasons (the answer choices):**\n    *   **A) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi:** If the fusion protein was made correctly but mis-localized or trapped in the Golgi, a fluorescent signal would still be present. Confocal microscopy could resolve this signal, which would appear as puncta within the cell's cytoplasm corresponding to the Golgi apparatus. A complete *absence* of signal is not the most likely result of trafficking defects.\n    *   **B) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame:** This is a crucial technical point in Cre-Lox system design. When Cre recombinase acts on two `lox` sites (in this case, `lox2272`), it excises the intervening DNA and leaves a single `lox` site behind. A standard `lox` site (both loxP and lox2272) is 34 base pairs long. Since 34 is not divisible by 3 (34 = 11 * 3 + 1), the remaining 34 bp scar sequence will cause a frameshift mutation. The ribosome will read the receptor protein's sequence correctly, hit the 34 bp lox2272 scar, shift its reading frame, and then translate the eGFP sequence out of frame. This results in a non-sense peptide instead of a functional, fluorescent eGFP protein. This perfectly explains a complete lack of green signal despite the successful excision of the stop cassette.\n    *   **C) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing:** The construct uses the CBA promoter, which is known to be strong. Furthermore, the Western blot experiment confirms that the construct *is* capable of expressing the proteins when transfected into cells (astrocytes). While expression levels might vary between cell types and in vivo vs. in vitro, the fundamental ability of the promoter to drive expression is confirmed. Therefore, it's highly unlikely that a missing enhancer would lead to a complete and total absence of expression specifically in the target cells.\n    *   **D) ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship:** This describes the biological mode of action (cell-to-cell signaling), not the molecular mechanics of protein expression. Whether the signaling is autocrine (the cell signals to itself) or paracrine (the cell signals to its neighbor) has no impact on whether the eGFP protein is correctly translated and becomes fluorescent within the cell. This option is irrelevant to the question of why the fluorescent reporter is not visible.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The most technically sound and direct explanation for the lack of a green signal is the frameshift mutation introduced by the residual 34 bp `lox2272` site after Cre-mediated recombination.\n\n<<<B>>>"
