    "The problem asks to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling energy, also known as the Zeeman energy splitting, with the energy of a specific atomic transition in Hydrogen.\n\n**1. Paramagnetic Coupling Energy ($ \\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle $)**\n\nThe energy of the interaction between an atom's orbital magnetic moment and an external magnetic field is given by the formula for the Zeeman effect:\n$ \\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = \\mu_B m B $\nwhere:\n*   $ \\mu_B $ is the Bohr magneton, $ \\mu_B \\approx 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J/T} $.\n*   $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number. The problem states to use a small value for $m$, so we can choose $m=1$ for this order-of-magnitude calculation.\n*   $B$ is the magnetic field strength, given as $ B = 1 \\, \\text{T} $.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n$ \\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = (9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J/T}) \\times (1) \\times (1 \\, \\text{T}) $\n$ \\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\approx 9.27 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J} $\n\n**2. Transition Energy ($ \\Delta E $)**\n\nThe energy of a photon involved in an atomic transition is related to its wavelength by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$ \\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} $\nwhere:\n*   $h$ is Planck's constant, $ h \\approx 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J} \\cdot \\text{s} $.\n*   $c$ is the speed of light, $ c \\approx 3.00 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s} $.\n*   $ \\lambda $ is the wavelength of the transition, given as $ \\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m} $.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n$ \\Delta E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J} \\cdot \\text{s}) \\times (3.00 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s})}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}} $\n$ \\Delta E \\approx \\frac{19.878 \\times 10^{-26} \\, \\text{J} \\cdot \\text{m}}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}} $\n$ \\Delta E \\approx 4.09 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J} $\n(Note: The wavelength $0.4861 \\mu$m or 486.1 nm corresponds to the n=4 to n=2 transition in the Hydrogen atom, which is part of the Balmer series.)\n\n**3. Comparison**\n\nNow we compare the orders of magnitude of the two energies:\n*   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $ \\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\sim 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J} $\n*   Transition energy: $ \\Delta E \\sim 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J} $\n\nThe transition energy is about four to five orders of magnitude ($ 10^4 $ to $ 10^5 $) larger than the paramagnetic coupling energy for a 1 Tesla field.\nLet's compute the ratio:\n$ \\frac{\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{9.27 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J}}{4.09 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5} $\n\nSince the ratio is extremely small, we can conclude that the paramagnetic coupling energy is much, much smaller than the transition energy. This is a general result: for typical laboratory magnetic fields, the Zeeman splitting is a very small perturbation compared to the energy differences between principal atomic energy levels.\n\nThe correct relationship is therefore $ \\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E $.\n\n<<<C>>>"
