    "This is a common phrase used in organic chemistry labs. Let's break down the context to understand its meaning.\n\n1.  **The Context:** Synthetic organic chemists spend a great deal of time purifying their products. After running a reaction, the mixture usually contains the desired product, unreacted starting materials, and various byproducts. The primary method for both analyzing the composition of this mixture and for separating its components is **chromatography**, most commonly Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) for analysis and Column Chromatography for purification.\n\n2.  **How Chromatography Works:** In the most common form (normal-phase chromatography), a mixture of compounds is applied to a stationary phase, like silica gel, which is highly polar. A less polar solvent (the mobile phase) is then passed over the stationary phase.\n    *   Non-polar compounds have little affinity for the polar silica gel and are swept along easily with the solvent, moving quickly.\n    *   Polar compounds interact strongly with the polar silica gel and move much more slowly.\n    *   This difference in movement based on **polarity** is what separates the compounds.\n\n3.  **\"On Top of Each Other\":** On a TLC plate, this separation is visualized as distinct spots at different heights. If two compounds have very **similar polarities**, they will interact with the silica gel and the solvent in a nearly identical manner. As a result, they will travel at the same rate, and their spots on the TLC plate will appear at the same height, or \"on top of each other.\" This is a problem because it indicates that separating them using standard column chromatography will be very difficult, if not impossible. The chemist's comment, \"Not well - my compounds are on top of each other,\" is a classic expression of frustration at this poor separation.\n\n4.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) Non-covalent interactions are the basis for polarity differences, but the problem isn't that the molecules are sticking to *each other*, but that they are sticking to the chromatography medium (like silica gel) with similar strength.\n    *   B) As explained above, similar polarities are the direct reason for compounds failing to separate during chromatography, leading to them being \"on top of each other\" on a TLC plate. This is the most likely meaning.\n    *   C) Optical rotation is a property measured by a polarimeter and relates to a molecule's chirality. While separating compounds with similar optical rotations (like enantiomers) is difficult, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is specifically descriptive of a chromatographic result, not a polarimetry measurement.\n    *   D) Similar boiling points would be a problem for separation by distillation. While this is a valid purification problem, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is far more commonly used to describe the visual output of a TLC plate than a result from distillation.\n\nTherefore, the chemist is almost certainly referring to a failed separation by chromatography due to the similar polarities of the compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>"
