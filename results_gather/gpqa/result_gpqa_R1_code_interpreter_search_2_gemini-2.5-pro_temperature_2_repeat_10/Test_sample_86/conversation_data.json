    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n**1. Deducing the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This identifies the core as a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents.\n*   **Total Carbon Atoms:** The compound has a total of 8 carbon atoms. Since the benzene ring itself contains 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a combined total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   A \"carbonyl group\" (C=O) is present.\n    *   An \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (Ar-X) is present. This tells us that one of the two substituents is a halogen atom (e.g., -F, -Cl, -Br, -I) directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n*   **Identifying the Substituents:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X). A halogen atom has zero carbon atoms.\n    *   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    *   The most common and stable chemical group that fits the formula of \"2 carbons and a carbonyl\" is an **acetyl group** (-COCH3).\n*   **Assembling the Structure:** The compound is a haloacetophenone. It consists of a benzene ring substituted with one halogen atom and one acetyl group. The molecular formula is C8H7XO.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Positional Isomers and Predicting the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nA di-substituted benzene ring can exist as *ortho* (1,2), *meta* (1,3), or *para* (1,4) isomers. The 1H NMR spectrum is highly dependent on this substitution pattern.\n\n*   ***Ortho*-isomer:** Would show four distinct signals in the aromatic region (for the four non-equivalent aromatic protons), each integrating to 1H, with complex splitting patterns.\n*   ***Meta*-isomer:** Would also show four distinct signals in the aromatic region, although one proton might appear as a singlet-like peak.\n*   ***Para*-isomer (1,4-disubstitution):** This isomer is highly symmetrical. There is a plane of symmetry along the axis passing through the two substituents. This symmetry makes the protons at positions 2 and 6 equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** This leads to a simplified aromatic spectrum with only two signals. The protons at positions 2 and 6 form one signal (integrating to 2H), and the protons at positions 3 and 5 form another signal (integrating to 2H). Each set of protons is coupled only to the other set (ortho-coupling), so they appear as two distinct **doublets**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** The acetyl group (-COCH3) has a methyl group. Its three protons are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with, so they will appear as a **singlet** integrating to 3H. The carbonyl group is deshielding, so this signal will appear in the range of 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n**Predicted Spectrum for *para*-haloacetophenone:**\n*   A doublet in the aromatic region (~7.5-8.0 ppm) for 2H.\n*   A second doublet in the aromatic region (~7.5-8.0 ppm) for 2H.\n*   A singlet in the aliphatic region (~2.1-2.6 ppm) for 3H.\n\n**3. Comparing the Prediction with the Given Options**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This is the classic \"doublet of doublets\" pattern for a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring, with correct integrations (2H each).\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet for 3 protons at a chemical shift perfectly matching a methyl group next to a carbonyl (an acetyl group).\n    *   **This option perfectly matches our predicted spectrum for *para*-haloacetophenone.**\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   The chemical shifts are in the 4-5 ppm range, which is far too low for aromatic protons (typically >6.5 ppm). This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The peak at `9.9 (1H, s)` is characteristic of an aldehyde (-CHO), not a ketone.\n    *   The peak at `3.7 (2H, s)` corresponds to a CH2 group, not the CH3 group of an acetyl moiety.\n    *   This spectrum does not match the deduced structure of haloacetophenone. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signals at 4.6 and 4.8 ppm are not in the aromatic region. The overall pattern is not consistent with a di-substituted aromatic ring. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only option that matches the logically deduced structure of a *para*-haloacetophenone is A. The chemical shifts, integrations (number of protons), and multiplicities (splitting pattern) all align with this structure.\n\n<<<A>>>"
