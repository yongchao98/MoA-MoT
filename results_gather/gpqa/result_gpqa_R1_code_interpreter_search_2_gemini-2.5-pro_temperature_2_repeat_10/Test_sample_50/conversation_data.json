    "This is a classic problem in electrostatics that is typically solved using the method of images.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process:\n\n1.  **Problem Setup:**\n    *   We have a conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is maintained at V = 0.\n    *   A point charge `q` is placed at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere (where `d > R`).\n    *   We need to find the net potential energy `U` of this system.\n\n2.  **Method of Images:**\n    *   The electric field and potential outside the sphere can be accurately described by replacing the grounded sphere with a single \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location `b` inside the sphere.\n    *   The values of `q'` and `b` are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the original sphere (at a radius `R` from the center) is zero, matching the grounded condition.\n\n3.  **Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b):**\n    *   Through standard derivation (which involves setting the sum of potentials from `q` and `q'` to zero on the sphere's surface), the image charge `q'` and its position `b` from the center are found to be:\n        *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n        *   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n    *   Note that the image charge is located along the same line as the original charge `q` and the sphere's center. It is of opposite sign to `q`, which makes physical sense as the charge `q` will attract opposite charges within the conductor to the side nearest to it.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Potential Energy:**\n    *   The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at `d`, in the presence of the grounded sphere.\n    *   An easier way to calculate this energy is to use the formula for the energy of a charge distribution: `U = (1/2) ∫ ρV dτ`. For a system of a point charge and a conductor, this simplifies.\n    *   The total energy `U` is given by `(1/2) * q * V_other`, where `V_other` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by all *other* charges (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere).\n    *   The potential created by the induced charges on the sphere at the location of `q` is, by the method of images, equal to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same location.\n    *   Let's calculate this potential, `V_image_at_q`:\n        *   The location of `q` is at distance `d` from the center.\n        *   The location of `q'` is at distance `b = R^2/d` from the center.\n        *   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n        *   The potential at `q` due to `q'` is `V_image_at_q = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`.\n        *   Substituting the values for `q'` and the distance:\n            `V_image_at_q = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2) / d)`\n            `V_image_at_q = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Final Energy Calculation:**\n    *   Now, we use the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_image_at_q`:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Comparing with the Options:**\n    *   The calculated expression is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n    *   This matches option A.\n\n    *   (Alternative Check) The interaction energy between the point charge `q` and its image `q'` would be `U_interaction = kqq' / (d-b) = -kq^2R / (d^2-R^2)`. The potential energy of the charge and *grounded* sphere system is exactly half of this interaction energy, because the sphere is a conductor held at zero potential, not a separate point charge. This again confirms the factor of 1/2.\n\nFinal Answer matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
