    "*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is another peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32%. The ratio of the intensities of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1. This isotopic pattern is a characteristic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom (the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75.8% and ³⁷Cl is ~24.2%, giving a ratio of roughly 3:1).\n    *   Thus, the molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (using ³⁵Cl) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad peak spanning from 3500 cm⁻¹ down to 2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) that is participating in hydrogen bonding (dimerization).\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. This specific frequency is typical for a carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The combination of these two peaks is strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** This signal is in a very deshielded region (downfield). A chemical shift greater than 10 ppm is almost exclusively due to the proton of a carboxylic acid. The integration of 1H confirms one such proton, and it's a singlet because it doesn't typically couple with other protons. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm).\n        *   There are a total of 4 protons on the aromatic ring (2H + 2H).\n        *   The splitting pattern, two doublets, is classic for a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to each other, and the two protons on the other side equivalent to each other. They split each other into two distinct doublets.\n        *   Both substituents (-Cl and -COOH) are electron-withdrawing, which shifts the aromatic protons downfield, consistent with the observed chemical shifts.\n\n*   **Structure Determination:**\n    *   From MS and IR/NMR, we know the compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), a chlorine atom (-Cl), and an aromatic ring.\n    *   The NMR pattern specifically points to a para- (1,4-) substitution on the benzene ring.\n    *   Therefore, the structure is a benzene ring with a -COOH group and a -Cl atom in para positions. This is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** Matches all spectral data (MW 156, contains Cl, is a carboxylic acid, has a para-substituted ring).\n    *   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** Is not a carboxylic acid (fails IR and NMR test for -COOH proton).\n    *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** Ortho-substitution would lead to a more complex ¹H NMR splitting pattern for the 4 aromatic protons, not two simple doublets.\n    *   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR would show an aldehyde proton (9-10 ppm) and only 3 aromatic protons, which contradicts the data.\n\nThe only structure that is fully consistent with all the provided spectral data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>"
