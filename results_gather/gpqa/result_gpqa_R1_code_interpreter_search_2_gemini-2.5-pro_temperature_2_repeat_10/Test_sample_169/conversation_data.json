    "The user wants to find the expectation value of the spin component in the y-direction, denoted as $S_y$, for an electron in a given spin state.\n\n**1. Understand the components:**\n\n*   **Spin state:** The electron's spin state is given as a column vector (a \"ket\" in Dirac notation):\n    $|\\chi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   **Spin operator:** The spin operator for the y-direction is defined in terms of the Pauli Y-matrix ($\\sigma_y$) and the reduced Planck constant ($\\hbar$):\n    $S_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_y$\n*   **Pauli Y-matrix:** The problem provides the matrix for $\\sigma_y$:\n    $\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**2. Formula for Expectation Value:**\n\nThe expectation value of an operator (like $S_y$) for a given quantum state (like $|\\chi\\rangle$) is calculated using the formula:\n$\\langle S_y \\rangle = \\frac{\\langle\\chi|S_y|\\chi\\rangle}{\\langle\\chi|\\chi\\rangle}$\n\nThis formula requires us to calculate two main parts:\n*   The denominator $\\langle\\chi|\\chi\\rangle$, which is the inner product of the state with itself. This is used for normalization.\n*   The numerator $\\langle\\chi|S_y|\\chi\\rangle$, which is the matrix element of the operator $S_y$ in the state $|\\chi\\rangle$.\n\n**3. Calculation Steps:**\n\n**Step 3.1: Find the bra vector $\\langle\\chi|$**\n\nThe \"bra\" vector $\\langle\\chi|$ is the conjugate transpose (also called the Hermitian conjugate, denoted by $\\dagger$) of the \"ket\" vector $|\\chi\\rangle$.\n\n$|\\chi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\langle\\chi| = (|\\chi\\rangle)^\\dagger = \\begin{pmatrix} (3i)^* & 4^* \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \\end{pmatrix}$\n(where * denotes the complex conjugate).\n\n**Step 3.2: Calculate the denominator $\\langle\\chi|\\chi\\rangle$**\n\n$\\langle\\chi|\\chi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$= (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4)$\n$= -9i^2 + 16$\nSince $i^2 = -1$, this becomes:\n$= -9(-1) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25$\n\nSo, the denominator is 25.\n\n**Step 3.3: Calculate the numerator $\\langle\\chi|S_y|\\chi\\rangle$**\n\nThis can be calculated as $\\langle\\chi|(S_y|\\chi\\rangle)$. First, let's find the result of applying the operator $S_y$ to the state $|\\chi\\rangle$:\n\n$S_y|\\chi\\rangle = \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) \\\\ (i)(3i) + (0)(4) \\end{pmatrix}$\n$= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} -4i \\\\ 3i^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} -4i \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, multiply this result by the bra vector $\\langle\\chi|$:\n\n$\\langle\\chi|S_y|\\chi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} -4i \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}\\right)$\n$= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} [(-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3)]$\n$= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} [12i^2 - 12]$\n$= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} [-12 - 12]$\n$= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} [-24] = -12\\hbar$\n\nSo, the numerator is $-12\\hbar$.\n\n**Step 3.4: Compute the final expectation value**\n\nNow, we divide the numerator by the denominator:\n\n$\\langle S_y \\rangle = \\frac{-12\\hbar}{25}$\n\nThis can be written as $-12\\hbar/25$.\n\n**4. Compare with the options:**\n\nA) 25*hbar/2\nB) 12*hbar/25\nC) -25*hbar/2\nD) -12*hbar/25\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
