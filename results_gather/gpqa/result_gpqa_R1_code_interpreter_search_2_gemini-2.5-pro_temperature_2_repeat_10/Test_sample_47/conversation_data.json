    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and count its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of cyclohexanone with bromine (forming product 1)**\n\nCyclohexanone is a ketone. In the presence of bromine, it undergoes alpha-halogenation at the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group. This reaction typically occurs under acidic or basic conditions. The product is 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone\n*   **Reagent:** Br₂\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n\n```\n  O                O\n //               // Br\n/  \\             /  \\ |\n|  | --(Br₂)--> |  |-CH\n\\  /             \\  / |\n --               -- C H₂ ...\n```\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of product 1 with sodium hydroxide (forming product 2)**\n\nProduct 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) is heated with a strong base, sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This set of reactants and conditions leads to a classic reaction called the **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n\nThe mechanism involves:\n1.  A hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes an acidic proton from the other alpha-carbon (C6).\n2.  The resulting enolate performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 attack, displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this strained intermediate.\n4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, and the three-membered ring opens to form a more stable carbanion. The ring opening occurs to form a five-membered ring (cyclopentane derivative) because the resulting carbanion is stabilized by the adjacent carboxyl group.\n5.  After an acidic workup (which is implied to get a neutral organic molecule), the carboxylate is protonated to form a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Reactant:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n*   **Reagent:** NaOH, heat\n*   **Reaction Type:** Favorskii Rearrangement\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n```\n  O                           O\n // Br                        //\n/  \\ |   --(1. NaOH, Δ)-->   /--\\\n|  |-CH   --(2. H₃O⁺)-->    |  |--C--OH\n\\  / |                       \\--/\n -- C...\n```\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of product 2 with thionyl chloride and pyridine (forming product 3)**\n\nProduct 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂). This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Pyridine is added to neutralize the HCl gas that is formed as a byproduct.\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n*   **Reagents:** SOCl₂, pyridine\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n```\n  O                           O\n //                          //\n/--\\                        /--\\\n|  |--C--OH  --(SOCl₂)-->   |  |--C--Cl\n\\--/                        \\--/\n```\n\n**Step 4: Reaction of product 3 with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (forming product 4)**\n\nProduct 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃). This is a sterically hindered and mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes without continuing the reduction to the corresponding alcohol.\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n*   **Reagent:** LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n```\n  O                           O\n //                          // H\n/--\\                        /--\\  |\n|  |--C--Cl --(LiAlH(OtBu)₃)--> |  |--C\n\\--/                        \\--/\n```\n\n**Step 5: Counting the chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nNow we must determine the number of unique proton environments in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde, which would correspond to the number of signals in a proton NMR spectrum.\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde is a five-membered ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n```\n         (a)H-C=O\n             |\n          H(b)-C1\n             /  \\\n      H(d,e)-C2--C5-H(d,e)\n           |    |\n      H(f,g)-C3--C4-H(f,g)\n```\n\nAlthough the cyclopentane ring is not planar and is constantly puckering (pseudorotation), on the NMR timescale at room temperature, the signals are averaged. We can analyze the symmetry of the time-averaged structure. This structure has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (C-H and C=O bonds), the C1 carbon and its attached hydrogen, and bisects the C3-C4 bond.\n\nDue to this plane of symmetry:\n*   C2 is chemically equivalent to C5.\n*   C3 is chemically equivalent to C4.\n\nLet's count the distinct proton environments:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (Hₐ):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 signal)\n2.  **The proton on C1 (Hᵦ):** This proton is attached to the carbon bearing the aldehyde group. It is also unique. (1 signal)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** Because of the plane of symmetry, C2 and C5 are equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 (a methylene group) are **diastereotopic**. One is *cis* to the aldehyde group, and the other is *trans*. They are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation and are in different chemical environments. The same is true for the protons on C5. The 'cis' proton on C2 is equivalent to the 'cis' proton on C5, and the 'trans' proton on C2 is equivalent to the 'trans' proton on C5.\n    *   This gives one signal for the two 'cis' protons. (1 signal)\n    *   This gives a second signal for the two 'trans' protons. (1 signal)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, C3 and C4 are equivalent. The two methylene protons on C3 are also diastereotopic, as are the two on C4.\n    *   This gives one signal for the two 'cis-side' protons. (1 signal)\n    *   This gives a second signal for the two 'trans-side' protons. (1 signal)\n\nIn total, we have:\n1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1 H) + 1 (C2/C5 cis-H) + 1 (C2/C5 trans-H) + 1 (C3/C4 cis-side H) + 1 (C3/C4 trans-side H) = **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>"
