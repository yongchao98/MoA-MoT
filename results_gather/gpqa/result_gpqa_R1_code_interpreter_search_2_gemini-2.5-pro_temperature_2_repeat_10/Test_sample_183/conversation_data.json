    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   It is a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   At position C1: -OEt (ethoxy group), a strong activator, and ortho, para-director.\n*   At position C2: -tBu (tert-butyl group), a weak activator, and ortho, para-director.\n*   At position C3: -NO2 (nitro group), a strong deactivator, and meta-director.\n\nThe substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3 (vicinal) pattern.\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\nSynthesizing such a sterically crowded 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern, especially when it contradicts some directing effects, often requires a carefully planned multi-step synthesis, frequently involving blocking groups.\n\n**2. Retrosynthesis Strategy**\n\nThe final step is likely the formation of the ether from a corresponding phenol.\n*   **Final Step (Etherification):** The -OEt group can be formed from a hydroxyl (-OH) group via Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr`). The precursor would be **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n*   **Step before (Phenol Formation):** The phenol (-OH) group is often introduced by hydrolyzing a diazonium salt (`-N2+`). This is done using `H3O+ / Heat`.\n*   **Step before (Diazotization):** The diazonium salt is formed from a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) using `NaNO2/HCl`. The precursor would be **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\nSo, the core of the problem is to synthesize **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. Let's analyze its structure: -NH2 (C1), -tBu (C2), -NO2 (C3).\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Options**\n\nLet's trace the reaction sequence for each option to see if it can produce the required intermediate and final product.\n\n*   **Option A & B:** These sequences run into problems early on.\n    *   Option A starts by making p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (major product), which leads to the wrong isomer (`1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene`). The final steps (viii, ix) are also nonsensical as they sulfonate and then immediately desulfonate the product, having no net effect.\n    *   Option B involves a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (step iii). This reaction is notoriously problematic because the amine's lone pair coordinates with the AlCl3 catalyst, deactivating the ring, and N-alkylation occurs as a side reaction. This is not a viable high-yield route.\n\n*   **Option D:** This option has a clear flaw.\n    *   Step (iv) `NaNO2/HCl` is a diazotization reaction that requires a primary amine (-NH2) group. The product from step (iii), `2-nitro-1-tert-butyl-4-sulfonic acid benzene`, does not have an amine group. Thus, this sequence is chemically impossible as written.\n\n*   **Option C:** This sequence is the most complex, but let's trace it carefully, as it employs a blocking group strategy which is often necessary for such syntheses.\n\n    **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`:** Benzene -> **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n    **ii) `SO3/H2SO4`:** Sulfonation. The t-butyl group is an o,p-director, but bulky. Sulfonation occurs predominantly at the para position to minimize steric hindrance. Product: **4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This step installs a sulfonic acid (-SO3H) group as a *blocking group* at the para position.\n    **iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`:** Nitration. Now the directors are -tBu (o,p) and -SO3H (m).\n        *   -tBu (at C1) directs to the ortho positions (C2, C6), as para (C4) is blocked.\n        *   -SO3H (at C4) directs to the meta positions (C2, C6).\n        *   Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the ortho position (C2 or C6). Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    **iv) `Fe/HCl`:** Reduction. This reduces the nitro group to an amino group. Product: **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    **v) `NaNO2/HCl`:** Diazotization. The primary amine is converted to a diazonium salt. Product: **2-diazonium-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid salt**.\n    **vi) `HNO3/H2SO4`:** Nitration. Now we nitrate this complex intermediate. The directing groups are: -[N2]+ (strong deactivator, m-director), -tBu (activator, o,p-director), and -SO3H (deactivator, m-director).\n        *   Substituents are at C1(-tBu), C2(-[N2]+), and C4(-SO3H).\n        *   -tBu directs to C6.\n        *   -[N2]+ directs to C6.\n        *   -SO3H directs to C6.\n        *   All groups strongly direct the incoming nitro group to the C6 position. Product: **2-diazonium-4-tert-butyl-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid salt**.\n    **vii) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`:** Hydrolysis. The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group. Product: **2-hydroxy-4-tert-butyl-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    **viii) `dilute H2SO4`:** Desulfonation. Heating with dilute acid removes the sulfonic acid blocking group. Product: **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**. (Numbering based on phenol as the parent compound).\n    **ix) `NaOH/EtBr`:** Williamson Ether Synthesis. The phenol is converted to an ethoxy ether. Product: **1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-6-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe sequence in Option C is a chemically coherent and logical synthesis. However, it produces **1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-6-nitrobenzene**, which is the 1,2,6-isomer, not the desired 1,2,3-isomer stated in the question (`2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`).\n\nUpon reviewing all options:\n*   A, B, and D contain fatal chemical flaws (impossible reactions, nonsensical steps, or pathways leading to the wrong product).\n*   C describes a completely plausible, albeit complex, synthetic route. It is the only option that represents a valid multi-step synthesis from start to finish.\n\nThis suggests a high probability of an error in the question, where the name of the target molecule is incorrect and should have been the product of sequence C. In the context of a multiple-choice question where one option must be correct, the choice should be the one that describes a valid chemical transformation. Option C is the only one that fits this criterion.\n\n<<<C>>>"
