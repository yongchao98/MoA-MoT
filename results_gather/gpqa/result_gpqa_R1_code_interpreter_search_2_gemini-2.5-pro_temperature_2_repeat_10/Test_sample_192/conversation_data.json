    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are given the relationship between the number of stars and parallax (`plx`). Specifically, the number of stars *per unit range of parallax* varies as `1/plx^5`.\n    *   This can be expressed mathematically as a differential relationship. Let `N` be the number of stars. The number of stars per unit parallax is `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   So, the given information is: `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find how the number of stars changes with distance (`r`).\n    *   Specifically, we want the number of stars *per unit range of distance*, which is `dN/dr`.\n    *   The goal is to find what `dN/dr` is proportional to in terms of `r`.\n\n3.  **Find the Connecting Relationship:**\n    *   The fundamental relationship between stellar parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`) is an inverse one.\n    *   `plx = 1/r`.\n    *   Here, parallax is typically measured in arcseconds and distance in parsecs, but the units don't affect the proportionality.\n\n4.  **Apply the Chain Rule of Calculus:**\n    *   We have `dN/d(plx)` and we want to find `dN/dr`. We can connect these two derivatives using the chain rule.\n    *   The formula for the chain rule in this context is: `dN/dr = dN/d(plx) * d(plx)/dr`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the necessary derivative:**\n    *   We need to find `d(plx)/dr`.\n    *   Since `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`, we can differentiate it with respect to `r`.\n    *   `d(plx)/dr = d(r⁻¹)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`.\n\n6.  **Substitute and Simplify:**\n    *   Now we substitute the known proportionalities and the derivative back into the chain rule equation.\n    *   `dN/dr = dN/d(plx) * d(plx)/dr`\n    *   `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * (-1/r²) `\n    *   The current expression has both `plx` and `r`. We need to express everything in terms of `r`. Substitute `plx = 1/r` into the expression.\n    *   `1/plx^5 = 1 / (1/r)^5 = 1 / (1/r^5) = r^5`.\n    *   Now, substitute this back:\n    *   `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (-1/r²)`.\n    *   `dN/dr ∝ -r^(5-2)`.\n    *   `dN/dr ∝ -r^3`.\n\n7.  **Interpret the Result:**\n    *   The result `dN/dr ∝ -r^3` means that the number of stars per unit distance range is proportional to the cube of the distance (`r^3`).\n    *   The negative sign simply indicates that as distance `r` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. When considering the number of stars in a given interval, which must be positive, we are interested in the magnitude of the relationship. Therefore, the number density scales as `r^3`.\n    *   Comparing this with the given options:\n        *   A) ~ r^4\n        *   B) ~ r^2\n        *   C) ~ r^3\n        *   D) ~ r^5\n\n    *   The result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
