    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical equilibrium:** The problem involves the Ca-EDTA complex, which exists in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻. The formation of the complex is represented by the following reaction:\n    Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻\n\n2.  **Write the equilibrium constant expression:** The equilibrium constant for this formation reaction is given as K_f (also called the stability constant). The expression for K_f is:\n    K_f = [[Ca(EDTA)]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])\n    We are given K_f = 5 x 10¹⁰.\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:** We need to find the concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions when the complex dissociates. Let's consider the dissociation reaction, which is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n    We start with a stoichiometric solution of 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates at equilibrium. According to the stoichiometry, this will produce 'x' concentration of Ca²⁺ and 'x' concentration of EDTA⁴⁻.\n\n    *   **Initial:**\n        *   [[Ca(EDTA)]²⁻] = 0.02 M\n        *   [Ca²⁺] = 0 M\n        *   [EDTA⁴⁻] = 0 M\n    *   **Change:**\n        *   [[Ca(EDTA)]²⁻] = -x\n        *   [Ca²⁺] = +x\n        *   [EDTA⁴⁻] = +x\n    *   **Equilibrium:**\n        *   [[Ca(EDTA)]²⁻] = 0.02 - x\n        *   [Ca²⁺] = x\n        *   [EDTA⁴⁻] = x\n\n4.  **Solve the equilibrium expression:** Now substitute the equilibrium concentrations back into the formation constant (K_f) expression:\n    K_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n    5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\n5.  **Apply an approximation:** Since the formation constant K_f is very large (5 x 10¹⁰), the equilibrium lies far to the right (favoring the complex). This means that very little of the complex will dissociate, so 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. Therefore, we can make the simplifying approximation:\n    (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02\n\n    The expression becomes:\n    5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\n6.  **Calculate 'x':** Rearrange the equation to solve for x, which represents the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions.\n    x² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n\n    To calculate x, take the square root of both sides. This can be done with a calculator.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants\nK_f = 5e10\ninitial_complex_concentration = 0.02\n\n# The simplified equilibrium expression is K_f = initial_complex_concentration / x^2\n# Rearranging to solve for x^2:\nx_squared = initial_complex_concentration / K_f\n\n# Solving for x (which is the concentration of Ca2+ ions)\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x}\")\n```\nEXECUTE\n```\n6.324555320336758e-07\n```\nThe calculation shows that x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is x, which is approximately 6.3x10⁻⁷ M.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 1.0x10⁻² M\nB) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\nC) 2.0x10⁻² M\nD) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The equilibrium reaction for the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is:\n\n[Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nThe formation constant, K_f (or K_Ca-EDTA), is for the reverse reaction:\n\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻\n\nK_f = [[Ca(EDTA)]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nWe are given the initial stoichiometric concentration of the complex, [[Ca(EDTA)]²⁻] = 0.02 M.\n\nLet's set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table for the dissociation reaction:\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------------- |\n| [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻        | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x          |\n| Ca²⁺                | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n| EDTA⁴⁻              | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n\nNow, we substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n\nK_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\nSince the formation constant (K_f) is very large, the equilibrium lies far to the right, meaning the complex is very stable and the amount that dissociates (x) will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of the complex. We can therefore make the simplification:\n\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\n5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nNow we solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺ ions:\n\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This value matches the one calculated by the Python script.\n\nComparing this result to the provided options:\nA) 1.0x10⁻² M\nB) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\nC) 2.0x10⁻² M\nD) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n\nThe calculated concentration matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
