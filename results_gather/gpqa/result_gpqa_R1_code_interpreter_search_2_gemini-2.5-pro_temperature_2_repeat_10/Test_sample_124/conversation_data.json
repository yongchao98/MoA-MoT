    "The user wants to find the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state for a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential.\n\n**1. Understand the System and its Energy Levels**\nThe potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The problem can be treated as three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators, one for each Cartesian coordinate (x, y, z).\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a 1D harmonic oscillator are $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$.\n\nFor a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the three independent oscillators:\n$E = E_x + E_y + E_z = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nWe define the principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n=0, 1, 2, 3, ...$.\nThe energy formula simplifies to:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n**2. Identify the States and Calculate the Energy**\n- **Ground State:** This corresponds to the lowest possible energy, which is for $n=0$.\n  $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$. This is the ground state energy.\n\n- **First Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=1$.\n  $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n- **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$.\n  $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n- **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=3$.\n  $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n**3. Determine the Degeneracy**\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same value of $n$. We need to find how many combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ satisfy the equation $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.\n\nLet's list the possible combinations:\n1.  One quantum number is 3:\n    - (3, 0, 0)\n    - (0, 3, 0)\n    - (0, 0, 3)\n    (3 combinations)\n2.  One quantum number is 2 and another is 1:\n    - (2, 1, 0)\n    - (2, 0, 1)\n    - (1, 2, 0)\n    - (0, 2, 1)\n    - (1, 0, 2)\n    - (0, 1, 2)\n    (6 combinations)\n3.  All three quantum numbers are 1:\n    - (1, 1, 1)\n    (1 combination)\n\nTotal number of combinations (degeneracy) = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for the degeneracy $g_n$ of the n-th level for a d-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n$g_n = \\binom{n+d-1}{d-1} = \\frac{(n+d-1)!}{n!(d-1)!}$\nIn this case, $d=3$ (3 dimensions) and we are looking at the third excited state, so $n=3$.\n$g_3 = \\binom{3+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5!}{2!3!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10$.\n\nThus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the energy eigenvalue of the third excited state.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10. This corresponds to option A.\nLet's check the given options:\nA) (9/2) ħω , 10 - Matches our result.\nB) 11 π² ħ² / (2m r²), 3 - Incorrect energy formula and degeneracy. This energy looks like it's from a particle in a box or a rigid rotor.\nC) (9/2) ħω, 3 - Correct energy, but incorrect degeneracy.\nD) 11 π² ħ² / (2m r²), 10 - Incorrect energy formula.\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
