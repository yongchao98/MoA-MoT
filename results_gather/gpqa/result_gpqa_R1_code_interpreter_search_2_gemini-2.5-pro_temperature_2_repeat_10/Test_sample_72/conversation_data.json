    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Understand the Concepts**\n\n*   **Relativistic Velocity:** When objects move at speeds close to the speed of light (c), their velocities do not simply add or subtract. We must use the Lorentz transformation for velocities.\n*   **Relativistic Energy:** The total energy of a moving object is the sum of its rest energy (E₀ = m₀c²) and its kinetic energy. The formula for the total energy is E = γm₀c², where γ (the Lorentz factor) is 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n\n### **2. Given Information**\n\n*   Mass of the first astronaut (m₁): `2m`\n*   Velocity of the first astronaut (v₁): `0.6c` in the positive x-direction.\n*   Mass of the second astronaut (m₂): `3m`\n*   Velocity of the second astronaut (v₂): `0.5c` in the positive x-direction.\n\n### **3. Calculation of Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nTo find the speed of one astronaut relative to the other, we use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula:\nv_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁v₂ / c²))\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n*   v₁ = 0.6c\n*   v₂ = 0.5c\n\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3c² / c²)\nv_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7\nv_rel ≈ 0.142857c\n\nSo, the relative speed `v_rel` is approximately `0.14c`.\n\n### **4. Calculation of Total Energy (E)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts (E = E₁ + E₂).\n\n**Energy of the first astronaut (E₁):**\nE₁ = γ₁ * m₁ * c²\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor γ₁ for the first astronaut:\nγ₁ = 1 / √(1 - v₁²/c²)\nγ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²)\nγ₁ = 1 / √(1 - 0.36)\nγ₁ = 1 / √0.64\nγ₁ = 1 / 0.8\nγ₁ = 1.25\n\nNow, calculate E₁:\nE₁ = 1.25 * (2m) * c²\nE₁ = 2.5 mc²\n\n**Energy of the second astronaut (E₂):**\nE₂ = γ₂ * m₂ * c²\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor γ₂ for the second astronaut:\nγ₂ = 1 / √(1 - v₂²/c²)\nγ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²)\nγ₂ = 1 / √(1 - 0.25)\nγ₂ = 1 / √0.75\nγ₂ ≈ 1 / 0.866\nγ₂ ≈ 1.1547\n\nNow, calculate E₂:\nE₂ = 1.1547 * (3m) * c²\nE₂ ≈ 3.4641 mc²\n\n**Total Energy (E):**\nE = E₁ + E₂\nE = 2.5 mc² + 3.4641 mc²\nE ≈ 5.9641 mc²\n\nSo, the total energy `E` is approximately `5.96 mc²`.\n\nTo be more precise without rounding `γ₂`:\nγ₂ = 1 / √0.75 = 1 / (√3 / 2) = 2 / √3\nE₂ = (2 / √3) * 3mc² = 6mc² / √3 = 2√3 mc²\nE = 2.5mc² + 2√3 mc² = (2.5 + 2*1.732)mc² = (2.5 + 3.464)mc² = 5.964mc²\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Relative speed `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`\n*   Total energy `E ≈ 5.96 mc²`\n\nThese values correspond to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
