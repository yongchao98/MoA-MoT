    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify Compound X:\n\n**1. Analyze the Product from the NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must determine the structure of the product formed in the reaction. We are given its `1H-NMR` and `13C-NMR` spectra.\n\n*   **Product's Molecular Formula:** The starting material X is C11H12O. The reaction with DABCO at high temperature is likely an isomerization or rearrangement, meaning the product has the same molecular formula, C11H12O. Let's verify this with the NMR data.\n\n*   **`1H-NMR` Analysis:**\n    *   `δ 7.71 (2H, d)` and `δ 7.08 (2H, d)`: This pattern is highly characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, represent the two pairs of equivalent aromatic protons.\n    *   `δ 2.31 (3H, s)`: A singlet for 3 protons, likely a methyl group attached to a quaternary carbon. Its chemical shift (~2.3 ppm) is typical for a methyl group attached to an aromatic ring (a tolyl group). Combining this with the para-substituted pattern, we can identify a **p-tolyl group (CH3-C6H4-)**.\n    *   `δ 2.28 (3H, s)`: Another methyl singlet for 3 protons. A chemical shift around 2.3 ppm is also characteristic of a methyl group adjacent to a carbonyl group (an acetyl group).\n    *   `δ 7.68 (1H, d)` and `δ 6.75 (1H, d)`: These two doublets, each for one proton, in the vinylic region suggest a `CH=CH` group. The fact they are both doublets indicates they are coupled only to each other, typical for a `trans` disubstituted double bond. The large difference in chemical shifts suggests one is alpha and the other is beta to an electron-withdrawing group.\n    *   **Proton Count:** 3 (Me) + 3 (Me) + 2 (Ar-H) + 2 (Ar-H) + 1 (Vinyl-H) + 1 (Vinyl-H) = 12 H. This matches the H count in C11H12O.\n\n*   **`13C-NMR` Analysis:**\n    *   `δ 197.7 (1C, s)`: This chemical shift is definitive for a **carbonyl carbon (C=O)**, specifically in a ketone or aldehyde.\n    *   `δ 21.3 (1C, s)`: A methyl carbon, consistent with a tolyl methyl group.\n    *   `δ 28.4 (1C, s)`: Another methyl carbon, consistent with an acetyl methyl group.\n    *   `δ 126.9 (2C), 127.1 (1C), 129.1 (2C), 130.3 (1C), 141.5 (1C), 144.1 (1C)`: These 8 carbons are in the aromatic/vinylic region. This matches the carbons from the p-tolyl group (6 carbons) and the `C=C` double bond (2 carbons).\n    *   **Carbon Count:** 1 (C=O) + 1 (Me) + 1 (Me) + 8 (Ar/Vinyl) = 11 C. This matches the C count in C11H12O.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    We have the following fragments:\n    *   A p-tolyl group: `CH3-C6H4-`\n    *   An acetyl group: `-C(=O)-CH3`\n    *   A trans double bond: `-CH=CH-`\n\n    Connecting these pieces logically gives the structure of an α,β-unsaturated ketone: `(E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one`.\n    `CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3`\n    This structure is fully consistent with all the NMR data.\n\n**2. Identify Compound X by Correlating with the Product**\n\nNow we know the structure of the product. Since the reaction is an isomerization, the starting material (Compound X) must have the same atoms and a skeleton that can rearrange to the product. A crucial feature of the product is the **p-tolyl group**. Chemical reactions of the type described (base-catalyzed rearrangement) do not typically create a `p-tolyl` group from a simple `phenyl` group by adding a methyl group to the ring. Therefore, the starting material, Compound X, must already contain a p-tolyl group.\n\nLet's examine the given options for Compound X:\n\n*   **A) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** A \"styryl\" group is `phenyl-ethenyl`. This compound contains a phenyl group (`C6H5-`), not a p-tolyl group. This cannot be X.\n*   **B) 2-styrylepoxide:** This also contains a phenyl group. Furthermore, its molecular formula is C10H10O, not C11H12O. This cannot be X.\n*   **C) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** This compound contains a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. This cannot be X.\n*   **D) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** A \"4-methylstyryl\" group is `(4-methylphenyl)ethenyl`, which is another name for `p-tolyl-ethenyl`. This compound **contains the required p-tolyl group**. Its molecular formula is C11H12O, matching the requirements.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nOnly option D has the correct molecular formula and the necessary p-tolyl structural unit that is found in the product. The reaction is an epoxide-ketone rearrangement, where the `2-(p-tolyl-ethenyl)oxirane` (D) isomerizes to `4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one` (the product).\n\nThe transformation is:\n`p-Tolyl-CH=CH-[CH-O-CH2]` (Compound X, option D)  → `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3` (Product)\n\nThis rearrangement of a terminal epoxide to a methyl ketone is chemically plausible under the given conditions (base, heat, long reaction time), especially as it leads to a thermodynamically more stable conjugated system.\n\nTherefore, Compound X must be 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<D>>>"
