    "To solve this problem, we need to determine which solar neutrino sources contribute to the specified energy bands and compare their fluxes under the hypothetical scenario.\n\n### 1. The Scenario\n*   **Hypothesis:** The pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain suddenly stopped ~8.5 minutes ago.\n*   **Implication:** Neutrinos from the pp-III branch, which are the Boron-8 (⁸B) neutrinos, have just stopped arriving at Earth (since neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, and the Sun-Earth travel time is about 8.5 minutes). Therefore, the flux of ⁸B neutrinos is zero.\n*   **Other reactions:** All other neutrino-producing reactions are unaffected. This includes the pp-I and pp-II branches of the pp-chain, and the CNO cycle.\n\n### 2. Identifying Neutrino Sources for Each Energy Band\nLet's analyze the energy bands and the main neutrino sources that could contribute to them, keeping in mind that ⁸B neutrinos are absent.\n\n*   **Band 1: 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV)**\n    *   **pp neutrinos:** No. Their energy is continuous up to only 420 keV.\n    *   **pep neutrinos:** No. They are mono-energetic at 1.44 MeV.\n    *   **⁷Be neutrinos (from pp-II):** No. They are mono-energetic at 384 keV and 861 keV, neither of which is in this band.\n    *   **⁸B neutrinos (from pp-III):** No. Their flux is zero in our scenario.\n    *   **CNO neutrinos:** Yes. The neutrinos from ¹³N decay (continuous spectrum up to 1.20 MeV) and ¹⁵O decay (continuous spectrum up to 1.73 MeV) contribute flux in this energy range.\n    *   **Conclusion for Band 1:** The only source of neutrinos is the CNO cycle.\n\n*   **Band 2: 800-900 keV (0.8-0.9 MeV)**\n    *   **pp neutrinos:** No.\n    *   **pep neutrinos:** No.\n    *   **⁷Be neutrinos (from pp-II):** **Yes.** This is the crucial point. There is a very strong, mono-energetic line of ⁷Be neutrinos at **861 keV**, which falls directly inside this band. This reaction is part of the pp-II branch and is unaffected by the pp-III branch stopping.\n    *   **⁸B neutrinos (from pp-III):** No.\n    *   **CNO neutrinos:** Yes. Their continuous spectra also contribute a small background flux in this range.\n    *   **Conclusion for Band 2:** The flux is overwhelmingly dominated by the intense ⁷Be neutrino line, with a very small additional contribution from the CNO cycle.\n\n### 3. Comparing the Fluxes\nWe need to calculate the ratio: Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2).\n\n*   **Flux(Band 2):** This is dominated by the ⁷Be line. From the Standard Solar Model (SSM), the total flux of these 861 keV neutrinos is approximately **5.0 x 10⁹ neutrinos/cm²/s**. The CNO background is negligible in comparison. So, `Flux(Band 2) ≈ 5.0 x 10⁹`.\n\n*   **Flux(Band 1):** This comes entirely from CNO neutrinos. The total flux from all CNO reactions is about ten times smaller than the ⁷Be flux. The total flux of the relevant CNO sources are:\n    *   ¹³N: ~3.0 x 10⁸ neutrinos/cm²/s (total, spread up to 1.2 MeV)\n    *   ¹⁵O: ~2.2 x 10⁸ neutrinos/cm²/s (total, spread up to 1.73 MeV)\n    The combined total CNO flux is ~5.2 x 10⁸ neutrinos/cm²/s. Flux(Band 1) is the portion of this total flux that falls within the narrow 100 keV window between 700 and 800 keV.\n\n### 4. Order-of-Magnitude Estimation\n1.  Flux in Band 2 is dominated by the ⁷Be line: `Flux(Band 2) ≈ Flux(⁷Be) ≈ 5 x 10⁹`.\n2.  Flux in Band 1 is only a fraction of the total CNO flux. The total CNO flux (`~5 x 10⁸`) is already about 10 times smaller than the ⁷Be flux.\n3.  We need the fraction of CNO flux in a 100 keV band. Since the energy spectra are spread over more than 1000 keV, this fraction will be roughly 10% or less.\n4.  So, `Flux(Band 1) ≈ (fraction) * Flux(CNO_total) ≈ 0.1 * (5 x 10⁸) = 5 x 10⁷`.\n5.  Now, we calculate the ratio:\n    `Ratio = Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2) ≈ (5 x 10⁷) / (5 x 10⁹) = 10⁻² = 0.01`.\n\nThis rough estimation already points strongly to option A. For a more precise calculation, one would integrate the known spectral shapes of the CNO neutrinos over the respective energy bands, but the result remains consistent. A precise calculation gives a ratio of approximately 0.0116.\n\nThe flux in Band 2 is about 100 times larger than the flux in Band 1. Therefore, the ratio of Flux(Band 1) to Flux(Band 2) is approximately 0.01.\n\n<<<A>>>"
