    "**1. Analyze the Reactants and Products**\n\n*   **Product:** The product for both reactions is a derivative of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a delta-lactone, which is a six-membered cyclic ester. It has a single chiral center at the 4th position (C4), which bears an ethyl group.\n    *   Reaction 1 yields the (R)-enantiomer.\n    *   Reaction 2 yields the (S)-enantiomer.\n    A lactone like this is typically formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options suggest the starting material is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid, specifically the mono-isobutyl ester. The structure is:\n    HOOC–CH₂–CH(Et)–CH₂–COO-iBu (where iBu = isobutyl, -CH₂CH(CH₃)₂)\n    This molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-iBu). It also has a single chiral center at C3, which carries the ethyl group. The reactions start with either the (R) or (S) enantiomer of this compound.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reagents:** A + LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride), followed by H⁺ workup.\n*   **Mechanism:** To solve this, we need to know the chemoselectivity of LiBH₄. Lithium borohydride is a moderately strong reducing agent. It is known to reduce esters to primary alcohols, but it reduces carboxylic acids much more slowly. Therefore, LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the ester group in our starting material, leaving the carboxylic acid group intact.\n    1.  **Reduction:** The ester group (–COO-iBu) is reduced to a primary alcohol (–CH₂OH).\n        `HOOC–CH₂–CH(Et)–CH₂–COO-iBu  ---(LiBH₄)--> HOOC–CH₂–CH(Et)–CH₂–CH₂OH`\n        The product of this step is (R/S)-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid.\n    2.  **Lactonization:** The resulting molecule is a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid. In the presence of acid (H⁺ workup), it undergoes intramolecular esterification (lactonization). The hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid at C1 to form the stable six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions (reduction and cyclization) occur at the functional groups (C1 and C5) and do not involve the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is preserved in the product. The chiral C3 of the acid becomes the chiral C4 of the lactone.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** Since the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **A** must have the (R) configuration. So, A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reagents:** B + BH₃ (Borane), followed by H⁺ workup.\n*   **Mechanism:** We must now consider the chemoselectivity of borane (BH₃). Borane is a unique reducing agent that shows high selectivity for reducing carboxylic acids over esters. This is the opposite selectivity of LiBH₄.\n    1.  **Reduction:** The carboxylic acid group (–COOH) is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol (–CH₂OH), leaving the ester group untouched.\n        `HOOC–CH₂–CH(Et)–CH₂–COO-iBu  ---(BH₃)--> HO–CH₂–CH₂–CH(Et)–CH₂–COO-iBu`\n        The product is isobutyl (R/S)-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate.\n    2.  **Lactonization:** This molecule is a 5-hydroxy ester. Under acidic workup (H⁺), it undergoes intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group at one end of the chain attacks the ester carbonyl at the other end, displacing isobutanol (HO-iBu) and forming the same six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the transformations happen away from the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry is retained. The C3 of the starting material becomes C4 of the lactone.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** Since the product is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **B** must have the (S) configuration. So, B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
