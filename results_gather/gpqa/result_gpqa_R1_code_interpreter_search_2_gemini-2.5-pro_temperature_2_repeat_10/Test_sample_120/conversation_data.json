    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n### 1. Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type\n*   **Reactant (Epoxide):** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   The core is a `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`, which is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across two adjacent carbons, C1 and C6.\n    *   It has methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The stereochemistry is given as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S). The `(1R, 6S)` designation indicates a *cis*-fusion of the epoxide ring to the cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), also known as a Gilman reagent.\n    *   This reagent acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, which can be thought of as a methyl anion equivalent (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n\n### 2. Apply the Rules of the Reaction\nThe problem provides two crucial rules for the reaction of organocuprates with saturated epoxides:\n1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile (the alkyl group from the cuprate) attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon atom where the nucleophile attacks. This is characteristic of an SN2 mechanism.\n\n### 3. Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack (Regioselectivity)\n*   The epoxide ring is formed by the oxygen atom (O-7) and carbons C1 and C6.\n*   We need to compare the steric hindrance at C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1** is substituted with a methyl group in addition to being part of the bicyclic system. It is a **tertiary** carbon center.\n*   **Carbon C6** is not substituted with any group other than the ring carbons and hydrogen atoms. It is a **secondary** carbon center.\n*   Comparing a tertiary carbon (C1) and a secondary carbon (C6), **C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon**.\n*   Therefore, the methyl nucleophile from Me₂CuLi will attack C6.\n\n*Consequence:* The nucleophilic attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and, after an acidic workup (which is implicit in these reactions), becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n\n### 4. Determine the Product's Connectivity and IUPAC Name\n*   The attack adds a methyl group to C6. The epoxide opens to form an alcohol at C1.\n*   The resulting product is a cyclohexanol ring with the following substituents based on the original numbering:\n    *   -OH group at C1.\n    *   -CH₃ group at C1 (original).\n    *   -CH₃ group at C3 (original).\n    *   -CH₃ group at C4 (original).\n    *   -CH₃ group at C6 (newly added).\n*   Now, we must re-number the ring according to IUPAC rules for the product. The hydroxyl group has the highest priority, so the carbon it is attached to (original C1) becomes the **new C1**.\n*   We number the ring to give the other substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   Scheme 1: Numbering towards the original C6. The methyl groups would be at C1, C2 (orig. C6), C4 (orig. C4), and C5 (orig. C3). The locants are 1,2,4,5.\n    *   Scheme 2: Numbering away from the original C6. The methyl groups would be at C1, C4 (orig. C4), C5 (orig. C3), and C6 (orig. C6). The locants are 1,4,5,6.\n*   Comparing the locant sets {1,2,4,5} and {1,4,5,6}, the first set is lower.\n*   Thus, the product name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and B, which have an incorrect `2,2,4,5` pattern, resulting from attack at the more hindered C1.\n\n### 5. Determine the Product's Stereochemistry\nWe now determine the absolute configuration (R/S) of each stereocenter in the product.\n*   **Center C1 (new):** This is the original C1. Its C-O bond does not break during the reaction. Therefore, its stereochemistry is **retained**. Original configuration was **1R**, so the product is **R** at this position.\n*   **Center C2 (new):** This is the original C6, the site of nucleophilic attack. The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration**. The original configuration was **6S**. Inversion of (S) configuration results in an **(R)** configuration. So, the product is **R** at new C2.\n*   **Center C4 (new):** This is the original C4. It is not involved in the reaction, so its configuration is **retained**. Original configuration was **4R**, so the product is **R** at new C4.\n*   **Center C5 (new):** This is the original C3. It is not involved in the reaction, so its configuration is **retained**. Original configuration was **3R**, so the product is **R** at new C5.\n\nPutting it all together, the stereochemistry of the product is **(1R, 2R, 4R, 5R)**.\n\n### 6. Final Conclusion\nThe full IUPAC name of the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect connectivity and stereochemistry.\n*   B) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect connectivity and stereochemistry.\n*   C) **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol** - **Matches our derived product exactly.**\n*   D) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2 (implies retention, not inversion).\n\n<<<C>>>"
