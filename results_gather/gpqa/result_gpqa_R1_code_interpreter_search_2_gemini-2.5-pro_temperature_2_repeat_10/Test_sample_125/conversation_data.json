    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   Let's identify the key features of this molecule. The \"-hexan-3-one\" indicates a six-carbon chain with a ketone at position C3. The \"5-methoxy\" indicates a methoxy group (-OCH3) at position C5. The \"(S)\" prefix indicates that the stereocenter at C5 has the S configuration.\n    *   The structure is: CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.\n    *   This starting material is a single, specific enantiomer, so it is chiral and optically active.\n\n*   **Reaction Conditions:** The molecule is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup (e.g., H3O+).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. The ketone at C3 will be reduced to a secondary alcohol, -CH(OH)-.\n\n*   **Products and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Carbon C3 in the starting material is prochiral because it is bonded to two different groups (an ethyl group and a 3-methoxybutyl group).\n    *   The attack of the hydride ion (H-) from LAH can occur from either the front face or the back face of the planar carbonyl group.\n    *   Since there is already a chiral center at C5, the two faces of the carbonyl are diastereotopic. This means that attack from the two sides is not equally probable, leading to the formation of two diastereomers in unequal amounts.\n    *   The existing stereocenter is (5S). The new stereocenter can be (3R) or (3S).\n    - **Product 1:** (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    - **Product 2:** (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products are diastereomers of each other. Diastereomers have different physical properties.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   The structure is: CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.\n    *   This molecule is achiral, as it has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH2 group.\n\n*   **Reaction Conditions:** The molecule is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4), followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH4 is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. The \"excess\" keyword ensures that both ketone groups are reduced.\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.\n\n*   **Products and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The reduction creates two new stereocenters, at C2 and C4. We need to determine all the possible stereoisomers.\n    *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of enantiomers. Since the reaction starts with an achiral molecule and uses achiral reagents, any chiral products must be formed as a racemic mixture (a 1:1 ratio of enantiomers). So we get a racemic mixture of (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   **(2R, 4S):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)). Therefore, it is a meso compound and is achiral.\n    *   **The products of Reaction II are therefore a set of three stereoisomers:**\n        - **Product 3:** (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        - **Product 4:** (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (the enantiomer of Product 3)\n        - **Product 5:** meso-(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (a diastereomer of Products 3 and 4)\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   **Key Principle:** It separates diastereomers and constitutional isomers but does **not** separate enantiomers. Enantiomers have identical properties in an achiral environment and will co-elute (appear as a single peak).\n*   Let's analyze the five products from both reactions:\n    1.  **(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Product 1)**\n    2.  **(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Product 2)**: This is a diastereomer of Product 1. Diastereomers have different polarities and will be separated. This gives **two peaks**.\n    3.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Product 3)** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Product 4)**: These are enantiomers. They will not be separated and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n    4.  **meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Product 5)**: This is a diastereomer of Products 3 and 4. It will have a different polarity and will be separated, giving its own **single peak**.\n*   The products of Reaction I (C7H16O2) are constitutionally different from the products of Reaction II (C5H12O2). They have different molecular weights, chain lengths, and functional groups (ether vs. diol). Their polarities will be significantly different, so there will be no accidental co-elution between the two sets of products.\n*   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   An HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate enantiomers. It also separates diastereomers.\n*   **Key Principle:** A chiral column can distinguish between all different stereoisomers. Each unique stereoisomer will give a separate peak.\n*   Let's list our five unique stereoisomers again:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (a unique chiral molecule) -> **Peak 1**\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (a diastereomer of the first) -> **Peak 2**\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (a unique chiral molecule) -> **Peak 3**\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (the enantiomer of the third, will be separated) -> **Peak 4**\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (an achiral molecule, diastereomeric to all others) -> **Peak 5**\n*   Since all five compounds in the mixture are stereochemically distinct (some are diastereomers, some are enantiomers) and structurally distinct (comparing products of Rxn I vs. Rxn II), an ideal chiral column will resolve them all.\n*   Total peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: 4 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 5 peaks\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
