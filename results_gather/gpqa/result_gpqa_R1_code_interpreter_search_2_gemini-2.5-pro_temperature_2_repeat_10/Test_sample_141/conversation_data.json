    "To determine the geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space (also known as the Bloch sphere), we need to find its corresponding Bloch vector `r = (rx, ry, rz)`.\n\n**1. Understand the Density Matrix**\n\nThe given density matrix is:\nρ = (1/2) * (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)\n\nFirst, let's write this in matrix form. The standard basis vectors are:\n|0⟩ = `[[1], [0]]`\n|1⟩ = `[[0], [1]]`\n\nThe outer products are:\n|0⟩⟨0| = `[[1], [0]]` * `[1, 0]` = `[[1, 0], [0, 0]]`\n|1⟩⟨1| = `[[0], [1]]` * `[0, 1]` = `[[0, 0], [0, 1]]`\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for ρ:\nρ = (1/2) * (`[[1, 0], [0, 0]]` + `[[0, 0], [0, 1]]`)\nρ = (1/2) * `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`\nρ = `[[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]`\n\nThis is the identity matrix (I) divided by 2. This state is known as the maximally mixed state.\n\n**2. Relate the Density Matrix to the Bloch Vector**\n\nAny single-qubit density matrix can be written in terms of the identity matrix (I) and the Pauli matrices (σx, σy, σz) using the Bloch vector `r = (rx, ry, rz)`:\nρ = (1/2) * (I + r ⋅ σ) = (1/2) * (I + rx*σx + ry*σy + rz*σz)\n\nThe Pauli matrices are:\nσx = `[[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\nσy = `[[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\nσz = `[[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n\nLet's expand the general form:\nρ = (1/2) * (`[[1, 0], [0, 1]]` + rx*`[[0, 1], [1, 0]]` + ry*`[[0, -i], [i, 0]]` + rz*`[[1, 0], [0, -1]]`)\nρ = (1/2) * `[[1 + rz, rx - i*ry], [rx + i*ry, 1 - rz]]`\n\n**3. Solve for the Bloch Vector Components (rx, ry, rz)**\n\nNow, we equate our given density matrix with the general form:\n`[[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]` = (1/2) * `[[1 + rz, rx - i*ry], [rx + i*ry, 1 - rz]]`\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2:\n`[[1, 0], [0, 1]]` = `[[1 + rz, rx - i*ry], [rx + i*ry, 1 - rz]]`\n\nBy comparing the matrix elements, we get a system of equations:\n\n*   From the top-right element: `rx - i*ry = 0`\n*   From the bottom-left element: `rx + i*ry = 0`\n*   From the top-left element: `1 + rz = 1`  => `rz = 0`\n*   From the bottom-right element: `1 - rz = 1` => `rz = 0`\n\nFrom `rx - i*ry = 0` and `rx + i*ry = 0`, adding the two equations gives `2*rx = 0`, so `rx = 0`. Substituting this back gives `ry = 0`.\n\nTherefore, the Bloch vector is `r = (rx, ry, rz) = (0, 0, 0)`.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe geometrical position `r=(0,0,0)` corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere. This point represents the maximally mixed state, where there is an equal probability of measuring the qubit in any state, and no phase information.\n\nComparing our result with the options provided:\nA) r=(1,1,1)\nB) r=(1,1,0)\nC) r=(0,0,0)\nD) r=(0,0,1)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
