    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\nThis is a cyclohexanone molecule with three functional groups:\n1.  A ketone (C=O) at position C1.\n2.  A hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) at position C3.\n3.  An isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) at position C5.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).**\n\n*   **Reagent 1: Sodium hydride (NaH)** is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the starting material. The alcohol proton (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-21). Therefore, NaH will deprotonate the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    *   R-CH₂OH + NaH → R-CH₂O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n*   **Reagent 2: Benzyl bromide (BnBr)** is an electrophilic alkylating agent. The newly formed alkoxide is a strong nucleophile and will attack the benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis.\n    *   R-CH₂O⁻Na⁺ + PhCH₂Br → R-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph (a benzyl ether) + NaBr\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted to a benzyl ether. The ketone and the isopropenyl group remain unchanged.\n    *   **Structure of Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of catalytic HCl.**\n\n*   **Reagents:** This is the standard procedure for forming a tosylhydrazone from a ketone. The p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide condenses with the ketone. The acid catalyst (HCl) facilitates the reaction by protonating the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbon more electrophilic. A molecule of water is eliminated.\n*   **Reaction:** R₂C=O + H₂N-NHTs → R₂C=N-NHTs + H₂O\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group at C1 is converted into a tosylhydrazone.\n    *   **Structure of Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Treatment with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is characteristic of the **Shapiro reaction**. The tosylhydrazone (Product 2) is treated with a strong base (n-BuLi), which results in the elimination of the entire tosylhydrazone functionality and the formation of a carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Mechanism outline:**\n    1.  n-BuLi (a very strong base) removes two protons: one from the -NH- group and one from a carbon α to the C=N bond.\n    2.  This dianion intermediate collapses, eliminating sodium p-toluenesulfinate and stable nitrogen gas (N₂).\n    3.  A vinyllithium intermediate is formed.\n    4.  The aqueous workup with ammonium chloride (a mild proton source) quenches the vinyllithium to give the final alkene product.\n*   **Outcome:** The ketone at C1 is effectively removed and replaced with a C=C double bond. The double bond typically forms at the less substituted α-position (kinetic control). However, regardless of whether the double bond forms between C1-C2 or C1-C6, the subsequent hydrogenation step will lead to the same final saturated ring.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene ring with the benzyl ether and isopropenyl groups intact.\n    *   **Structure of Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene (or its regioisomer, which is inconsequential for the final product).\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) is a powerful catalyst for this process.\n*   **Transformations:**\n    1.  **Reduction of Alkenes:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds in Product 3 will be reduced to single bonds. The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring, and the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n        *   -C(CH₃)=CH₂ + H₂ → -CH(CH₃)₂\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** Catalytic hydrogenation with H₂/Pd-C is also a standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers (a deprotection reaction). The C-O bond of the ether is cleaved, and the oxygen is protonated, regenerating the original alcohol. The benzyl group becomes toluene.\n        *   R-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph + H₂ → R-CH₂-OH + Ph-CH₃\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group. These substituents retain their original 1,3-relationship on the ring skeleton.\n    *   **Structure of Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nLet's compare our deduced structure with the given options:\n\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone group is eliminated in the Shapiro reaction.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. The benzyl ether is cleaved by H₂/Pd-C.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: **Correct**. This structure matches our derived final product.\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This would result from n-BuLi acting as a nucleophile on the ketone, which is not the reaction pathway here.\n\nThe correct final product is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>"
