    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules:**\n    The problem describes a decay from the hydrogen atom state $|n, l, m\\rangle = |3, 0, 0\\rangle$ to the ground state $|1, 0, 0\\rangle$. This decay occurs via two successive electric dipole (E1) transitions. The selection rules for E1 transitions are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer, but for decay (emission), $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State:**\n    The process involves two steps, so there must be an intermediate state, let's call it $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n    *   **First Transition:** From $|3, 0, 0\\rangle$ to $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n        *   Applying the selection rule for $l$: $l_i = 0$, so $l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ cannot be negative, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n        *   Applying the selection rule for $m$: $m_i = 0$, so $m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. Thus, the possible values for $m'$ are $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n        *   For the principal quantum number $n$, we need $n' < 3$. The options provided suggest that the intermediate state has $n'=2$. This is a reasonable physical assumption as transitions between adjacent $n$ levels are generally the strongest.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$, $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, and $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second Transition:** From an intermediate state $|2, 1, m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1, 0, 0\\rangle$.\n        *   Let's check if this is an allowed transition: $l' = 1$ and $l_{final} = 0$, so $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n        *   The change in $m$ depends on the specific intermediate state:\n            *   For $|2, 1, 0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1, 0, 0\\rangle$, $\\Delta m = 0 - 0 = 0$ (Allowed).\n            *   For $|2, 1, 1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1, 0, 0\\rangle$, $\\Delta m = 0 - 1 = -1$ (Allowed).\n            *   For $|2, 1, -1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1, 0, 0\\rangle$, $\\Delta m = 0 - (-1) = +1$ (Allowed).\n        *   All three potential intermediate states can indeed decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This confirms the validity of the proposed decay cascades.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probabilities (Branching Ratios):**\n    We need to find the probability of the atom taking a specific route. The total probability of the cascade is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n    *   **Probability of the First Step:** The atom starts in the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state and can decay into one of three possible states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (since $l=0$). In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the magnetic sublevels ($m'$) of the destination $l'=1$ state.\n        Since there are three possible final states for the first step, and they are equally probable, the probability (or branching ratio) for the transition into any single one of them is:\n        $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$ for each of $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\n    *   **Probability of the Second Step:** Once the atom is in one of the intermediate states, say $|2, 1, m'\\rangle$, it must decay further. The only available state with lower energy is the ground state $|1, 0, 0\\rangle$. A transition to this state is allowed by the E1 selection rules. Since this is the only possible decay channel for the $|2, 1, m'\\rangle$ states, the probability of this second transition occurring is 1 (or 100%).\n        $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Probability for a Specific Route:**\n    The overall probability for a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of its constituent steps. Let's consider the route proposed in option A:\n    *   **Route:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   **Probability:** $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2})$\n        $P(\\text{route}) = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n        $P(\\text{route}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: This matches our calculation.\n    *   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability should be $\\frac{1}{3}$, not $\\frac{1}{4}$. So this is incorrect.\n    *   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: The route is valid, but the probability should be $\\frac{1}{3}$, not $\\frac{2}{3}$. So this is incorrect.\n    *   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability should be $\\frac{1}{3}$, not $\\frac{1}{4}$. So this is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
