    "Here's a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues to Identify the Substances**\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope.** This is a major hint. In chemistry, the most common isotopic substitution involves replacing Hydrogen (H, protium) with its heavier isotope, Deuterium (D, ²H).\n    *   **Clue 5: The melting point of B is very close to 277 K.** 277 Kelvin is 3.85 °C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K). However, heavy water (D₂O) has a melting point of 3.82 °C (~277 K). This strongly suggests **B is D₂O**.\n    *   **Clue 4: A precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B (D₂O).** This implies G is a compound that dehydrates (or \"de-deuterates\") upon heating, such as a metal hydroxide (or in this case, a metal deuteroxide). For example, a metal deuteroxide M(OD)x would decompose into a metal oxide and D₂O upon heating.\n    *   **Clues 2 & 3: Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.**\n        *   Since B is D₂O, it's highly likely that Deuterium is involved throughout the reaction. Let's hypothesize that the liquid **Y is D₂O**.\n        *   Let's check potential gas molecules (W) for the \"equal protons and neutrons\" rule:\n            *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. The D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. **This fits.**\n            *   HF (Hydrogen fluoride): H (1p, 0n) + F (9p, 10n) = 10 protons, 10 neutrons. **This fits.**\n            *   N₂ (Nitrogen gas): Each N (7p, 7n) = 14 protons, 14 neutrons. **This fits.**\n            *   Other deuterated gases like CD₄ (10p, 10n) and ND₃ (10p, 10n) also fit.\n        *   However, a violent reaction of a substance X with D₂O to produce D₂ gas is a classic reaction of a metal deuteride (the deuterated version of a metal hydride). `Metal-D + D₂O → Metal-OD + D₂`.\n    *   **Let's propose a candidate for X.** Powerful reducing agents used in organic chemistry fit this description. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a famous one. Its deuterated analog is **Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   **Verify with the proposed reaction:** Let's assume **X = LiAlD₄** and **Y = D₂O**.\n        *   Reaction: `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂`\n        *   Is it violent? Yes, LiAlH₄ reacts violently with water, so LiAlD₄ would react violently with D₂O.\n        *   Is gas W (D₂) released? Yes. Does it have equal protons/neutrons? Yes (2p, 2n).\n        *   Is a precipitate G formed? Yes, `Al(OD)₃` (aluminum deuteroxide) is a gelatinous precipitate, analogous to Al(OH)₃.\n        *   Does G (Al(OD)₃) release B (D₂O) on heating? Yes, the decomposition is `2 Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O`.\n    *   **Final Check with Organic Chemistry Clues:**\n        *   **Clue 7:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid has the structure R-C(=O)-R'-COOH, which contains **3** oxygen atoms. A strong reducing agent like LiAlD₄ reduces both the ketone (C=O) and the carboxylic acid (-COOH) to alcohols (-CHOD). The final product is a diol, R-CH(OD)-R'-CH₂(OD), which contains **2** oxygen atoms. This is a perfect match. A weaker reagent, like NaBD₄, would only reduce the ketone, leaving the carboxylic acid, resulting in a product with 3 oxygens, so this clue points specifically to a strong reducing agent.\n        *   **Clue 8:** \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" The analog of LiAlD₄ is LiAlH₄, which is an extremely common and important reducing agent in organic synthesis. This fits perfectly.\n\n    All clues consistently point to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses**\n\n    *   The formula for Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   First, identify the lightest and heaviest elements by atomic number (Z):\n        *   Hydrogen (Z=1) -> **Lightest element**\n        *   Lithium (Z=3)\n        *   Aluminum (Z=13) -> **Heaviest element**\n    *   Next, interpret the calculation instruction: \"Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n        *   This means we need to sum the total mass of all atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen) and the total mass of all atoms of the heaviest element (Aluminum) found in one formula unit of X.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The formula LiAlD₄ contains four atoms of the hydrogen isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass from lightest element = 4 × (mass of D) ≈ 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The formula contains one atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of the stable isotope of Aluminum is 27.\n        *   Total mass from heaviest element = 1 × (mass of Al) ≈ 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:** Sum the two values.\n        *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35 amu.\n\n3.  **Final Answer Selection**\n\n    The calculated cumulative mass is 35, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
