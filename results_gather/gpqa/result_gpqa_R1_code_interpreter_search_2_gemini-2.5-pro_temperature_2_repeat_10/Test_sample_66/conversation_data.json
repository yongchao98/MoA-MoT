    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the System's State:**\n    The system consists of two electrons in a p-orbital. This means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$. The system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l=2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n    *   $m=-1$ is the magnetic quantum number for the total orbital angular momentum. This represents the projection of the total orbital angular momentum onto the z-axis.\n\n2.  **Understand the Measurement:**\n    We are performing a joint measurement of the z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron, denoted by the operators $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    The question asks for the probability of getting the specific eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for *both* $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n\n3.  **Relate Eigenvalues to Quantum Numbers:**\n    The eigenvalues of the $L_z$ operators are given by $m_l \\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\n4.  **Represent the Measurement Outcome:**\n    The state corresponding to the desired measurement outcome is represented in the uncoupled basis $|l_1, l_2, m_{l1}, m_{l2}\\rangle$. Since $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$ are known, we can simplify this to $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}\\rangle$.\n    The state for the outcome ($m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1$) is $|\\text{outcome}\\rangle = |-1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    In quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a specific outcome is the square of the magnitude of the inner product (or projection) of the system's state vector onto the state vector of the outcome.\n    Probability $P = |\\langle \\text{outcome} | \\text{system} \\rangle|^2$.\n    $P = |\\langle -1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$.\n\n6.  **Apply Conservation of Angular Momentum (Method 1 - Conceptual):**\n    The total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual components: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    The system state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total z-angular momentum operator $L_z$. When $L_z$ acts on this state, the result is always the eigenvalue $m\\hbar$.\n    $L_z |2, -1\\rangle = -1\\hbar |2, -1\\rangle$.\n    This means that any measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum must yield the value $-\\hbar$.\n\n    The measurement of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ constitutes a measurement of $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. The eigenvalue of $L_z$ will be the sum of the eigenvalues of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    The desired outcome is $m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$. For this outcome, the total magnetic quantum number would be $m' = m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$. The corresponding eigenvalue for $L_z$ would be $-2\\hbar$.\n\n    Since the initial state has a definite total z-angular momentum eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$, it is impossible to measure a different value like $-2\\hbar$. The probability of any measurement outcome that does not conserve the total z-component of angular momentum is zero.\n\n    Because the outcome state $|-1, -1\\rangle$ has a total magnetic quantum number $m' = -2$, while the system state $|2, -1\\rangle$ has $m = -1$, the states are orthogonal.\n    $\\langle -1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$.\n    Therefore, the probability is $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n7.  **Use Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients (Method 2 - Calculation):**\n    To find the probability, we can express the initial coupled state $|2, -1\\rangle$ in the uncoupled basis $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}\\rangle$. The transformation is done using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n    $|l, m\\rangle = \\sum_{m_{l1}, m_{l2}} \\langle m_{l1}, m_{l2} | l, m \\rangle |m_{l1}, m_{l2}\\rangle$\n    The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle m_{l1}, m_{l2} | l, m \\rangle$ is non-zero only if $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = m$.\n\n    For our state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$:\n    We need to find combinations of $m_{l1}$ and $m_{l2}$ (where $m_{l1}, m_{l2} \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$) that sum to $m=-1$. The possible pairs are:\n    *   $(m_{l1}, m_{l2}) = (-1, 0)$\n    *   $(m_{l1}, m_{l2}) = (0, -1)$\n\n    The expansion of the state $|2, -1\\rangle$ is therefore a linear combination of the states $|-1, 0\\rangle$ and $|0, -1\\rangle$.\n    Using the standard Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for coupling two spin-1 particles, the expansion is:\n    $|2, -1\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} |-1, 0\\rangle + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} |0, -1\\rangle$\n\n    The probability of finding the system in the state $|-1, -1\\rangle$ is the squared modulus of the coefficient of $|-1, -1\\rangle$ in this expansion. Since the state $|-1, -1\\rangle$ is not a component of the expansion of $|2, -1\\rangle$, its coefficient is 0.\n    Thus, the probability is $0^2 = 0$.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the probability is zero.\n\n<<<A>>>"
