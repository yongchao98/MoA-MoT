    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base that will deprotonate the ketone at the α-carbon to form an enolate. The enolate then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate), which is a Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation:**\n    *   The ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon, substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group. It has **no** α-hydrogens, so no enolate can form at this position.\n    *   C6 has a methyl group and one α-hydrogen. Deprotonation will occur at C6.\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, removes the proton from C6, forming a C6-enolate.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the CH₂ group of the ethyl acrylate moiety.\n    *   After the addition and protonation (during workup), the product is a ketone with a propanoate side chain attached at C6. The new side chain is -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt.\n\n4.  **Product Structure and Naming (Product A):**\n    *   The product has the original cyclohexanone ring, but now C6 is a quaternary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and the new ethyl propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the product, we can treat the complex cyclohexyl group as a substituent on the ethyl propanoate chain. The main chain is `ethyl 3-(...)propanoate`.\n    *   Let's name the cyclohexyl substituent. According to IUPAC rules, the point of attachment to the main chain is numbered as C1 of the substituent.\n        *   The original C6 becomes **C1** of the substituent ring. This carbon also has a methyl group attached (`1-methyl...`).\n        *   The carbonyl group (C=O), which was at C1 of the starting material, is adjacent to the attachment point. Thus, it is at position **C2** (`...2-oxo...`).\n        *   The ethyl and methyl groups, which were at C2 of the starting material, are now at position **C3** (`...3-ethyl-3-methyl...`).\n    *   Combining these parts, the name of the substituent is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of Product A is: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition reaction. KOH is a strong base that deprotonates the carbon α to the electron-withdrawing nitro group. The resulting carbanion (nitronate) is the nucleophile. (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile) is the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation:**\n    *   The base (KOH) removes a proton from the C1 of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂C**H₂**-NO₂).\n    *   The nucleophile is the carbanion [CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon of the deprotonated 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-C**H**=CH-CN).\n    *   A new C-C bond is formed between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile.\n\n4.  **Product Structure and Naming (Product B):**\n    *   The resulting structure is:\n        ```\n             NO₂\n             |\n        CH₃-CH₂-CH - CH(CH₃) - CH₂-CN\n        ```\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the nitrile group is C1.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes C1. The chain is 6 carbons long, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n        `C(6)H₃ - C(5)H₂ - C(4)H(NO₂) - C(3)H(CH₃) - C(2)H₂ - C(1)N`\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon (C1).\n    *   There is a methyl group at **C3** (`3-methyl...`).\n    *   There is a nitro group at **C4** (`...4-nitro...`).\n    *   Therefore, the full name of Product B is: **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile -> Name of A is incorrect.\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile -> Both names are correct.\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile -> Name of B is incorrect.\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile -> Both names are incorrect.\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
