    "*   **Physical Model:** The problem describes an oscillating charge distribution confined to a spheroid shape with a symmetry axis (z-axis). This setup is the canonical source of electric dipole radiation. An oscillating charge creates an oscillating current, which in turn creates oscillating electric and magnetic fields that propagate outwards as electromagnetic waves. For a charge distribution oscillating along the z-axis, we can model this as an oscillating electric dipole with its moment `p(t)` aligned with the z-axis.\n\n*   **Radiated Power Formula:** According to classical electrodynamics, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) by an oscillating electric dipole is given by:\n    \n    `dP/dΩ = (c k⁴ |p₀|²) / (32 π² ε₀) * sin²(θ)`\n    \n    where:\n    *   `p₀` is the amplitude of the dipole moment.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   `ε₀` is the permittivity of free space.\n    *   `k` is the wavenumber, `k = 2π / λ`, where `λ` is the wavelength.\n    *   `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of the dipole (the z-axis).\n\n*   **Dependence on Wavelength (λ):**\n    We can substitute `k = 2π / λ` into the formula to see the dependence on wavelength `λ`:\n    \n    `dP/dΩ ∝ k⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n    \n    The radiated power per unit solid angle is proportional to `λ⁻⁴`. This is a characteristic feature of electric dipole radiation and is also the reason for Rayleigh scattering's blue sky effect. This matches the `λ⁻⁴` dependence in options A and C.\n\n*   **Dependence on Angle (θ):**\n    The power distribution is also a function of the angle `θ`. From the formula, we see:\n    \n    `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)`\n    \n    This means the radiation is zero along the axis of oscillation (`θ = 0°` and `θ = 180°`) and maximum in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation (`θ = 90°`).\n\n*   **Calculating the Fraction of Maximum Power:**\n    The problem states that `f` is the radiated power per unit solid angle and `A` is the maximum power thus radiated.\n    \n    `f(\\lambda, θ) = C * (sin²(θ) / λ⁴)` where `C` is a constant combining all the other factors.\n    \n    The maximum power `A` occurs when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which happens at `θ = 90°`.\n    \n    `A = f(\\lambda, 90°) = C * (sin²(90°) / λ⁴) = C / λ⁴`\n    \n    We need to find the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`.\n    \n    `f(\\lambda, 30°) = C * (sin²(30°) / λ⁴)`\n    \n    The fraction of the maximum power `A` is the ratio `f(\\lambda, 30°) / A`.\n    \n    Fraction = `[C * (sin²(30°) / λ⁴)] / [C / λ⁴]`\n    \n    Fraction = `sin²(30°)`\n    \n    We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    \n    Fraction = `(1/2)² = 1/4`\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is `1/4`, and a possible form for the function `f`'s dependence on wavelength is `λ⁻⁴`.\n    \n    This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
