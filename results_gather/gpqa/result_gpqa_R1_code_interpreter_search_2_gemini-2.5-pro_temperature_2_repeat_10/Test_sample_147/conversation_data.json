    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of A2.**\n    The problem states that substance A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine. The mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in A2 is 31.96%.\n    Let's assume A2 is a simple binary fluoride with the formula YF_n.\n    The formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    Where M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol) and M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n    Rearranging the formula to solve for M(Y):\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * n * 19.00 = n * 19.00\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 19.00 * (1 - 0.3196)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 12.9276\n    M(Y) = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * n ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    We need to find an element Y and an integer n (oxidation state) that satisfy this relationship. Let's test some integer values for n:\n    *   n = 1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (similar to Ca, but its fluoride chemistry doesn't fit).\n    *   n = 2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (similar to Br, but it doesn't form five binary fluorides).\n    *   n = 3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the molar mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   n = 4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (no common element fits).\n    *   n = 5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (in the region of Pt, Au, Bi).\n\n    Let's calculate the theoretical mass percentage of fluorine in SbF3 to confirm.\n    M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    ɷF(SbF3) = (3 * 19.00) / 178.76 * 100% = 57 / 178.76 * 100% ≈ 31.88%.\n    This value is extremely close to the given 31.96%, with a difference of only 0.08%, which is likely due to experimental error or rounding.\n    Therefore, it is highly probable that **Y = Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 = Antimony trifluoride (SbF3)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the other clues based on Y = Sb.**\n    *   **A1**: \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (SbF3) and fluorine. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\" This description does not match any known binary antimony fluoride. SbF5, the highest fluoride, is a colorless liquid and a powerful oxidizer, but not as strong as implied, and not red. This part of the problem statement is likely flawed or refers to an extremely exotic compound, so we should rely on other, more consistent clues.\n    *   **A3**: \"A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine. A3 can also interact with xenon.\" Fluorination of antimony (Sb) can produce SbF3 and SbF5. SbF5 is a very strong Lewis acid and is known to react with xenon fluorides (e.g., XeF2 + SbF5 → [XeF][SbF6]). Thus, **A3 is likely SbF5**.\n    *   **A4 and A5**: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" This describes the reaction:\n        A4 + Y(Sb) → A5 (with moles of A4 : moles of Sb = 1:1)\n\n3.  **Identify A4 and its molecular weight.**\n    We need to identify the substance A4. Let's test the possibility that A4 is one of the known antimony fluorides.\n    *   If A4 = SbF5: The reaction would be SbF5 + Sb → product. The stable comproportionation product is SbF3. The balanced equation is SbF5 + 2Sb → 3SbF3. The molar ratio of reactants is 1:2, not 1:1. So, A4 is not SbF5.\n    *   If A4 = SbF3: The reaction would be SbF3 + Sb → A5 (1:1 ratio). This would be a reaction between Sb(III) and Sb(0) to form a product with an average oxidation state of +1.5. Such compounds (sub-halides, e.g., Sb2F3) are known to exist, although they are not common. Let's see if this fits the other clues for A4.\n        *   \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\": SbF3 is a white/colorless solid. It is soluble in solvents like HF, and its solutions are colorless. This fits the description perfectly.\n        *   Let's check the final clue for A5: \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\" If A5 is a sub-fluoride like Sb2F3, it would be expected to disproportionate in water, for example into Sb metal (Sb(0)) and an Sb(III) compound like Sb2O3. This produces two different substances containing antimony. This is also consistent.\n\n4.  **Calculate the molecular weight of A4.**\n    Based on the analysis, the most consistent candidate for A4 is SbF3.\n    Molecular Weight (M) of A4 = M(SbF3)\n    M(SbF3) = M(Sb) + 3 * M(F) = 121.76 g/mol + 3 * 19.00 g/mol = 178.76 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Match the molecular weight to the given ranges.**\n    The calculated molecular weight is 178.76 g/mol. Let's check the options:\n    A) 220-240\n    B) 160-180\n    C) 140-160\n    D) 110-130\n\n    The value 178.76 falls squarely within the range of **160-180**.\n\nFinal check: Although the description of compound A1 doesn't fit with antimony chemistry, all other clues strongly and consistently point towards Y being Antimony (Sb) and A4 being Antimony Trifluoride (SbF3). This makes option B the most logical answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
