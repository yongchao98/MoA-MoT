    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the product(s) of Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. The structure is symmetric about the double bond.\n2.  **First Reagent:** mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid). This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n3.  **Stereochemistry of Epoxidation:** A *syn*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a racemic mixture of enantiomeric products. Therefore, the epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene produces a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n4.  **Second Reagent:** Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This reagent performs an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves the attack of a water molecule on one of the protonated epoxide's carbons, which occurs from the side opposite to the epoxide ring (an Sₙ2-like backside attack). This process results in an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation of the original alkene.\n5.  **Stereochemistry of Ring Opening:** Let's consider the ring-opening of one of the enantiomeric epoxides, for example, (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   Backside attack by water at C4 leads to inversion at C4, giving (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Backside attack by water at C5 leads to inversion at C5, giving (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The molecules (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol are the same compound. This compound possesses an internal plane of symmetry and is therefore a *meso* compound.\n6.  **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The reaction of (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the product(s) of Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. The structure is symmetric.\n2.  **First Reagent:** mCPBA (*syn*-addition).\n3.  **Stereochemistry of Epoxidation:** A *syn*-addition to a *cis*-alkene results in a *meso* product. Therefore, the epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene produces meso-4,5-epoxyoctane (also known as cis-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n4.  **Second Reagent:** Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) (*anti*-addition of water).\n5.  **Stereochemistry of Ring Opening:** We start with the single meso-epoxide.\n    *   Backside attack by water at C4 and C5 are equally probable due to the molecule's symmetry.\n    *   Attack at one carbon (e.g., C4) will produce one enantiomer, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon (C5) will produce the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n6.  **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The reaction produces a **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **Meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between these isomers:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso isomer is a **diastereomer** to both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC chromatograms**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This type of chromatography separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by an achiral column. The racemic pair of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diol will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated. The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different retention time.\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **two peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the unresolved racemic mixture.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   Since the column is chiral, it can distinguish between the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol. They will separate and appear as two distinct peaks.\n    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer to the other two, will also be separated from them and appear as its own peak.\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **three peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R) enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S) enantiomer.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **2 peaks** in standard (achiral) HPLC.\n*   **3 peaks** in chiral HPLC.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
