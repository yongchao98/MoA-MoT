    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are asked to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f`.\n*   **Vector Field `f`**: The field has a magnitude `|f| = 1/r^2` and is directed radially outwards from the origin. In spherical coordinates, this can be written as `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`, where `r̂` is the radial unit vector.\n*   **Volume `V`**: The volume is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n*   **Integral**: We need to evaluate `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n**2. Analyze the Vector Field**\n\nThe vector field `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂` has a singularity at the origin (`r = 0`), where its magnitude becomes infinite. This is a crucial point.\n\n**3. Method 1: Using the Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem)**\n\nThe Divergence Theorem states that for a suitably well-behaved vector field, the volume integral of its divergence is equal to the flux of the field through the closed surface enclosing the volume:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nHere, `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n*   **Vector field on the surface**: On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n*   **Differential surface element `dS`**: For a sphere, the differential area element in spherical coordinates is `dS = R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ * r̂`. The direction `r̂` is outwards, which is the correct orientation for the Divergence Theorem.\n*   **The dot product `f ⋅ dS`**:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r̂] ⋅ [R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ * r̂]`\n    Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the dot product simplifies to:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ = sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`\n*   **Integrate over the surface**: We need to integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for the angles are `0 ≤ θ ≤ π` and `0 ≤ φ ≤ 2π`.\n\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_φ=0^(2π) ∫_θ=0^π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n    Let's perform the integration:\n    1.  Inner integral (with respect to `θ`):\n        `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n    2.  Outer integral (with respect to `φ`):\n        `∫_0^(2π) 2 dφ = 2 * [φ]_0^(2π) = 2 * (2π - 0) = 4π`\n\nSo, the result from the Divergence Theorem is `4π`.\n\n**4. Method 2: Direct Calculation of the Divergence**\n\nLet's calculate the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` directly using the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (r^2 * f_r)` (since `f_θ` and `f_φ` are zero)\n\nHere, `f_r = 1/r^2`.\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (r^2 * (1/r^2)) = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (1)`\n\nThe derivative of a constant (1) is 0.\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * 0 = 0`\n\n**5. Reconciling the Two Methods**\n\nWe have two different results: `4π` and `0`. Why?\n\nThe direct calculation `∇ ⋅ f = 0` is only valid for `r ≠ 0`. At the origin (`r = 0`), the vector field `f` is singular, and the standard divergence formula doesn't apply. The divergence at the origin is not zero.\n\nIn the language of distributions, the divergence of this specific field is a Dirac delta function:\n`∇ ⋅ (r̂ / r^2) = 4π * δ^3(r)`\n\nThe Dirac delta function `δ^3(r)` is zero everywhere except at the origin, and its integral over any volume containing the origin is 1.\n\nSo, the volume integral is:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∫_V 4π * δ^3(r) dV`\n`= 4π * ∫_V δ^3(r) dV`\n\nSince our volume (the sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin) contains the origin, the integral `∫_V δ^3(r) dV = 1`.\nTherefore, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π * 1 = 4π`.\n\nThis confirms the result from the Divergence Theorem. The theorem works because the surface integral correctly accounts for the \"source\" (the singularity) enclosed within the volume, even though the field itself is not well-behaved at that single point.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe value of the integral `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV` is `4π`. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 4/3 π R\nB) 4 π\nC) 1\nD) 0\n\nThe most appropriate answer is `4π`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
