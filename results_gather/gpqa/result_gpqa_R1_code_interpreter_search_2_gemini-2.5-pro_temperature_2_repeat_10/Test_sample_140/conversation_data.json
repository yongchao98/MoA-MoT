    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of possible organic products:\n\n### 1. Identify the Reaction\nThe reaction involves an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) and a very strong base (NaNH2, sodium amide) in liquid ammonia. This set of reagents is characteristic of an **elimination-addition reaction**, which proceeds through a **benzyne intermediate**.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate (Elimination Step)\nThe mechanism begins with the abstraction of a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine). The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d:\n\n```\n      Br\n     / \\\n(D)C2---C1\n  ||   ||\n C3---C6 (H)\n  \\ /\n   C4\n```\n\nThere are two ortho positions to the bromine at C1:\n*   **Position C6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2**, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) can abstract either the proton from C6 or the deuteron from C2. These two possibilities lead to different reaction pathways.\n\n**Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n1.  The amide ion removes the proton (H⁺) from C6. This is generally faster than removing a deuteron (D⁺) due to the **kinetic isotope effect** (the C-H bond is weaker and breaks more easily than the C-D bond).\n2.  A carbanion is formed at C6.\n3.  The bromide ion (Br⁻) is eliminated, and a triple bond forms between C1 and C6.\n4.  The deuterium atom at C2 remains in the molecule. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n```\n    (H)    H          (-)    H                 D\n      \\  /              \\  /                   |\n       C6--C5             C6--C5               C2 === C3\n      //  \\\\   -H+      //  \\\\   -Br-         ||    |\n(D)-C2----C1-(Br)  --->(D)-C2----C1-(Br)  --->   C1 === C6\n     \\   /                \\   /                 |    //\n      C3--C4               C3--C4                C4 === C5\n       |  /                 |  /\n       H                    H\nStarting Material   Carbanion Intermediate    3-Deuterobenzyne\n```\n\n**Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n1.  The amide ion removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. This is the slower of the two elimination pathways.\n2.  A carbanion is formed at C2.\n3.  The bromide ion (Br⁻) is eliminated, and a triple bond forms between C1 and C2.\n4.  In this process, the deuterium atom is lost from the molecule. The resulting intermediate is the standard, unlabeled **benzyne**.\n\n```\n      Br                     Br                  H    H\n     /  \\                   /  \\                  \\  /\n(D)-C2---C1-(H)          (-)C2---C1-(H)             C2 === C1\n   //   //    -D+        //   //    -Br-         |    //\n  C3---C6     --->     C3---C6        --->       C3 -- C4\n   \\  /                  \\  /                    ||   |\n    C4=C5                 C4=C5                    C5=== C6\n     |                      |                       |\n     H                      H                       H\nStarting Material    Carbanion Intermediate       Benzyne\n```\nSince the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider the products from both benzyne intermediates.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates (Addition Step)\nThe nucleophile, the amide ion (NH₂⁻), attacks one of the carbons of the benzyne triple bond. A new carbanion is formed, which is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH₃), to give the final product.\n\n**Products from 3-Deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A)**\nThe 3-deuterobenzyne intermediate is unsymmetrical. The NH₂⁻ ion can attack either C1 or C6.\n*   **Attack at C1**: The NH₂ group attaches to C1, and a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation (with H from NH₃) at C6 yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n*   **Attack at C6**: The NH₂ group attaches to C6, and a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation at C1 yields **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\nSo, Pathway A leads to two distinct products:\n1.  **2-Deuteroaniline**\n2.  **3-Deuteroaniline**\n\n**Products from Benzyne (from Pathway B)**\nThe standard benzyne intermediate is symmetrical. Attack of NH₂⁻ can occur at either carbon of the triple bond, but since the rest of the molecule is just hydrogen and the proton source is NH₃, both attacks lead to the same single product.\n*   **Attack on benzyne**: The addition of NH₂⁻ and H⁺ (from NH₃) results in unlabeled **aniline**.\n\nSo, Pathway B leads to one product:\n3.  **Aniline**\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nBy considering both possible initial deprotonation/deuteronation steps, we generate two different benzyne intermediates. These intermediates react further to produce a total of three unique organic products.\n\nThe possible products are:\n1.  Aniline (from benzyne)\n2.  2-Deuteroaniline (from 3-deuterobenzyne)\n3.  3-Deuteroaniline (from 3-deuterobenzyne)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
