    "This problem involves the concept of radioactive decay, which is governed by an exponential probability distribution. A key feature of this process is that it is \"memoryless\".\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Decay Law:** Radioactive decay follows the formula P(t) = e^(-λt), where P(t) is the probability that an atom has *not* decayed by time t, and λ is the decay constant. The probability that an atom *has* decayed by time t is 1 - P(t).\n\n2.  **Using the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant (λ):**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   Probability of decay in 100 minutes = 1 - P(100) = 0.32\n    *   This means the probability of survival for 100 minutes is P(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n    *   Using the formula: e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68.\n    We can solve for λ, but it's often easier to work with the value of e^(-100λ) directly.\n\n3.  **Applying the Memoryless Property:**\n    Radioactive decay is a memoryless process. This means the probability of the atom decaying in a future time interval does not depend on how long it has already survived.\n    The question asks for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, *given that it has already survived for 50 minutes*. Because of the memoryless property, this is exactly the same as the probability that a brand-new atom would decay within 150 minutes.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Required Probability:**\n    We need to calculate the probability of decay within a 150-minute interval. Let's call this P_decay(150).\n    *   P_decay(150) = 1 - P_survival(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).\n    *   We can rewrite e^(-λ * 150) using the information from Step 2:\n        e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5\n    *   Since we know e^(-100λ) = 0.68, we can substitute this value in:\n        e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    To find the final probability, we'll compute the value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We are given that the probability of survival for 100 minutes is 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n# Let P(t) be the survival probability. P(100) = 0.68.\n# In the exponential decay model, P(t) = exp(-lambda * t).\n# So, exp(-lambda * 100) = 0.68.\n\n# We need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes.\n# Due to the memoryless property, this is the same as the probability of decay\n# for a fresh atom over a 150-minute period.\n# P_decay(150) = 1 - P_survival(150) = 1 - exp(-lambda * 150).\n\n# We can express exp(-lambda * 150) in terms of what we know:\n# exp(-lambda * 150) = exp(-lambda * 100 * 1.5) = (exp(-lambda * 100))**1.5\n# P_survival(150) = (0.68)**1.5\n\n# Calculate the survival probability for 150 minutes.\np_survival_150 = 0.68 ** 1.5\n\n# The probability of decay is 1 minus the survival probability.\np_decay_150 = 1 - p_survival_150\n\n# Print the result as a percentage.\nprint(p_decay_150 * 100)\n```\n\n**Execution Output:**\n```\n43.9272332865922\n```\n\nThe calculated probability is approximately 43.93%.
