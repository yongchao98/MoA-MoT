    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration. The significant broadness is characteristic of the O-H group in a carboxylic acid, where hydrogen bonding occurs.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. The position around 1700 cm⁻¹ is typical for the carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH), so the FTIR data is consistent with all possibilities but does not differentiate between them.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C-H). All four given structures are saturated alkanoic acids, so this information is consistent with all options.\n*   **Key Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**: For a proton's signal to be split into a `dtq`, it must be magnetically coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1) to cause the **doublet** (n+1=2).\n    *   A set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2) to cause the **triplet** (n+1=3).\n    *   A set of three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3) to cause the **quartet** (n+1=4).\n    In summary, the proton producing a `dtq` signal must have neighbors of 1H, 2H, and 3H.\n*   **Key Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**: For a proton's signal to be split into a `dtt`, it must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1) to cause the **doublet** (n+1=2).\n    *   A set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2) to cause a **triplet** (n+1=3).\n    *   Another, different set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2) to cause another **triplet** (n+1=3).\n    In summary, the proton producing a `dtt` signal must have neighbors of 1H, 2H, and 2H.\n\nThe problem states that two *different* signals have these multiplicities, so we are looking for a single molecule that has protons in two distinct chemical environments that satisfy both of these conditions. The most likely protons to exhibit such complex splitting are the methine (CH) protons on the carbon backbone.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Each Proposed Structure**\n\nLet's examine the proton environments for each candidate molecule. We'll denote an ethyl group as Et and a methyl group as Me.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(Me)C(H)(Me)COOH:**\n    *   `...CH₂-CH(Me)-...`: The methine proton on this carbon is coupled to the CH₂ (2H), the adjacent CH (1H), and the attached Me (3H). Its neighbors are (2H, 1H, 3H), which would produce a **dtq**.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule has neighbors of (1H, 2H, 2H) required to produce a `dtt`. Therefore, A is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(Et)C(H)(Et)COOH:**\n    *   `...CH₂-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-...`: The methine proton at position 3 is coupled to the CH₂ of the main chain (2H), the adjacent CH (1H), and the CH₂ of its attached Et group (2H). Its neighbors are (2H, 1H, 2H), which would produce a **dtt**.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule has neighbors of (1H, 2H, 3H) required to produce a `dtq`. Therefore, B is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(Me)C(H)(Me)CH₂COOH:**\n    *   `...CH(Me)-CH(Me)-CH₂...`: The methine proton closer to the COOH group is coupled to the adjacent CH (1H), the CH₂ group (2H), and its attached Me group (3H). Its neighbors are (1H, 2H, 3H), which would produce a **dtq**.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule has neighbors of (1H, 2H, 2H) required to produce a `dtt`. Therefore, C is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(Et)C(H)(Et)CH₂COOH:**\n    Let's analyze the two methine protons on the main chain. Let's label them `H_a` and `H_b`:\n    `CH₃-CHₐ(Et)-CHₑ(Et)-CH₂-COOH`\n\n    *   **Proton `Hₐ`**: `CH₃-CHₐ(Et)-CHₑ...`\n        *   It is coupled to the neighboring `CH₃` group (3H) → **quartet**.\n        *   It is coupled to the neighboring methine proton `Hₑ` (1H) → **doublet**.\n        *   It is coupled to the `CH₂` of its attached ethyl group (2H) → **triplet**.\n        *   This proton has neighbors of (3H, 1H, 2H). This environment will produce a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal.\n\n    *   **Proton `Hₑ`**: `...CHₐ-CHₑ(Et)-CH₂...`\n        *   It is coupled to the neighboring methine proton `Hₐ` (1H) → **doublet**.\n        *   It is coupled to the neighboring `CH₂` group next to the COOH (2H) → **triplet**.\n        *   It is coupled to the `CH₂` of its attached ethyl group (2H) → **triplet**.\n        *   This proton has neighbors of (1H, 2H, 2H). This environment will produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal.\n\n**Conclusion:** Molecule D is the only structure that contains a proton that would produce a `dtq` signal AND a different proton that would produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n<<<D>>>"
