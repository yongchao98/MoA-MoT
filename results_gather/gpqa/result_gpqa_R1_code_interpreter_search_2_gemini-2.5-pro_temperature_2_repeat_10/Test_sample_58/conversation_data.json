    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants and classify them:**\n    *   CH3COOH (Acetic Acid): A weak acid.\n    *   HCl (Hydrochloric Acid): A strong acid.\n    *   Ba(OH)2 (Barium Hydroxide): A strong base.\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial moles of each substance:**\n    *   The formula for moles is: Moles = Molarity (mol/L) × Volume (L).\n    *   **Moles of CH3COOH:**\n        *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n        *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n        *   Moles = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol CH3COOH\n\n    *   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl:**\n        *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n        *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n        *   HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely (HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻).\n        *   Moles of H⁺ = Moles of HCl = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol H⁺\n\n    *   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)2:**\n        *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n        *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n        *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that releases two OH⁻ ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n        *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol Ba(OH)₂\n        *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol OH⁻\n\n3.  **Perform the neutralization reactions:** The key principle is that strong acids and strong bases react with each other first, completely.\n    *   **Step 3a: Reaction between strong acid (H⁺) and strong base (OH⁻).**\n        *   Reaction: H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n        *   Moles of H⁺ (from HCl) = 0.080 mol\n        *   Moles of OH⁻ (from Ba(OH)₂) = 0.180 mol\n        *   H⁺ is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n        *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = Initial OH⁻ - Reacted OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol OH⁻\n\n    *   **Step 3b: Reaction between remaining strong base (OH⁻) and the weak acid (CH3COOH).**\n        *   Reaction: CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n        *   Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.050 mol\n        *   Moles of OH⁻ available (from Step 3a) = 0.100 mol\n        *   CH₃COOH is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n        *   Moles of excess OH⁻ remaining = Available OH⁻ - Reacted OH⁻ = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol OH⁻\n\n4.  **Calculate the pH of the final solution:**\n    *   The final solution contains an excess of a strong base (OH⁻). The presence of the weak conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻) is negligible for pH calculation when a strong base is in excess.\n    *   **First, find the total volume of the mixture:**\n        *   Total Volume = 500 mL (CH3COOH) + 400 mL (HCl) + 300 mL (Ba(OH)2) = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n    *   **Next, calculate the final concentration of the excess OH⁻ ions:**\n        *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n        *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n    *   **Then, calculate the pOH:**\n        *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n        *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n    *   **Finally, calculate the pH:**\n        *   The relationship between pH and pOH at 25°C is: pH + pOH = 14\n        *   pH = 14 - pOH\n        *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The final pH of the solution is 12.62. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
