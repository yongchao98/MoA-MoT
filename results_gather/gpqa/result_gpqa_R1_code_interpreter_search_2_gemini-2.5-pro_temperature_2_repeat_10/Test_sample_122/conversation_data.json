    "This problem requires applying the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning and calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **The Galaxy's reference frame:** This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we want to measure the distance traveled. Let's call it frame S.\n    *   **The supernova ejecta's reference frame:** This is the \"moving\" frame. Time measured in this frame is the proper time. Let's call it frame S'.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Values:**\n    *   Relative velocity between the frames, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   Time elapsed in the moving frame (proper time), `Δt_proper = 50 s`.\n    *   The speed of light, `c`, is approximately `300,000 km/s`. The problem uses nice round numbers, suggesting we should use this value for `c`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Concept of Time Dilation:**\n    An observer in the stationary frame S (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly in the moving frame S' (the ejecta). The time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt_galaxy`) is related to the proper time in the ejecta's frame (`Δt_proper`) by the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt_galaxy = γ * Δt_proper`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    The Lorentz factor `γ` depends on the relative velocity `v`. The formula is:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n    First, calculate the ratio `v/c`:\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    Now, substitute this into the Lorentz factor formula:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame:**\n    Now we can find the time that passes in the Galaxy's frame corresponding to 50 seconds on the ejecta's clock:\n    `Δt_galaxy = γ * Δt_proper = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame:**\n    The distance the ejecta travels, as measured from the Galaxy, is its velocity (in the Galaxy's frame) multiplied by the time elapsed (in the Galaxy's frame).\n    `Distance = v * Δt_galaxy`\n    `Distance = 60,000 km/s * [ (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s ]`\n    `Distance = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    `Distance = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    To get the final numerical answer, we need to compute `3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96)`.\n\nLet's use Python to get an accurate value.\n```python\nimport math\n\nv = 60000  # km/s\nc = 300000  # km/s\ndt_proper = 50  # s\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\nbeta_sq = (v/c)**2\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta_sq)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame\ndt_galaxy = gamma * dt_proper\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame\ndistance_galaxy = v * dt_galaxy\n\nprint(f\"{distance_galaxy=}\")\nprint(f\"Distance in Galaxy frame = {distance_galaxy:.0f} km\")\n```\n>>>\ndistance_galaxy=3061862.1784786724\nDistance in Galaxy frame = 3061862 km\n>>>\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km. This value is very close to 3,060,000 km. The small difference is likely due to rounding in the option choices. Comparing the result with the given options, 3,060,000 km is the best fit.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem involves the concept of time dilation from the theory of special relativity. We need to calculate the distance traveled by the supernova ejecta as measured by an observer in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Frame S (The Galaxy):** This is considered the \"stationary\" reference frame. We want to find the distance traveled in this frame.\n    *   **Frame S' (The Ejecta):** This is the \"moving\" reference frame. The time given (50 seconds) is measured in this frame.\n\n2.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame, `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the *proper time*, `Δt_proper`, because it's measured by a clock in the moving frame.\n    *   The speed of light, `c`, which is approximately `300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Relate the Quantities using Special Relativity:**\n    *   To find the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (S), we use the formula: `distance = velocity × time`.\n    *   The velocity `v` is known. The time we need is the time that has passed in the Galaxy's frame (S), which we'll call `Δt`.\n    *   According to the principle of time dilation, the time measured in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is related to the proper time (`Δt_proper`) by the Lorentz factor, `γ`.\n    *   The time dilation formula is: `Δt = γ * Δt_proper`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor is defined as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   First, let's find the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, we calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    *   Now we can use the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt_proper = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame:**\n    *   The distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v * Δt`.\n    *   `d = 60,000 km/s * [ (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s ]`\n    *   `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    *   `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n7.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    To get the precise numerical answer, we can compute the value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # km/s, velocity of the ejecta relative to the galaxy\nc = 300000  # km/s, speed of light\ndt_proper = 50  # s, time elapsed in the ejecta's frame\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\nbeta_squared = (v / c)**2\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta_squared)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the galaxy's frame (time dilation)\ndt_galaxy = gamma * dt_proper\n\n# Calculate the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame\ndistance_in_galaxy_frame = v * dt_galaxy\n\nprint(f\"The calculated distance is: {distance_in_galaxy_frame:.0f} km\")\n```\n>>>\nThe calculated distance is: 3061862 km\n>>>\nThe calculation shows that the distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 3,060,000 km\nB) 2,940,000 km\nC) 3,000,000 km\nD) 2,880,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of 3,061,862 km is extremely close to option A. The minor difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's options. Option C (3,000,000 km) represents the incorrect non-relativistic calculation (`60,000 km/s * 50 s`). Because of time dilation, the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame is longer than 50 seconds, so the distance must be greater than 3,000,000 km, which further supports option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Based on the provided information and the principles of special relativity, the following steps were taken to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Problem Setup:** The problem involves two inertial frames of reference: the Galaxy's frame (let's call it S) and the supernova ejecta's frame (S'). The time of 50 seconds is measured in the ejecta's frame, which is moving relative to the Galaxy. This time is known as the \"proper time\" (`Δt_proper`).\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** According to special relativity, an observer in the stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) than the proper time measured in the moving frame. This effect is called time dilation and is described by the formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt_proper`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Lorentz Factor Calculation:** The Lorentz factor depends on the relative velocity `v` between the frames and the speed of light `c`. The formula is:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n    Given:\n    *   `v = 60,000 km/s`\n    *   `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`\n    First, we find the ratio `v/c`:\n    `v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`\n    Now, we calculate `γ`:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n4.  **Time in Galaxy Frame:** We can now calculate the time that has passed in the Galaxy's reference frame:\n    `Δt = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n5.  **Distance Calculation:** The distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's frame is its velocity (in that frame) multiplied by the time elapsed (in that frame).\n    `Distance = v * Δt`\n    `Distance = 60,000 km/s * [ (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s ]`\n    `Distance = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96)`\n    `Distance = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n6.  **Numerical Result:** The Python code executed in the previous step calculated this value precisely:\n    `Distance ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** Comparing the calculated distance with the given options:\n    *   A) 3,060,000 km\n    *   B) 2,940,000 km\n    *   C) 3,000,000 km\n    *   D) 2,880,000 km\n\n    The calculated value of 3,061,862 km is closest to option A, 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<A>>>"
