    "This problem can be solved using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n*   **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle can be known simultaneously. For energy (E) and time (t), the relationship is:\n    ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, Δt is the uncertainty in time, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n*   **Lifetime and Energy Uncertainty:** The lifetime of an excited state (τ) can be considered as the uncertainty in time (Δt) for which the particle exists in that state. Therefore, the energy level of that state is not perfectly sharp but has a natural \"width\" or uncertainty (ΔE) given by:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n*   **Resolving Energy Levels:** To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two different energy levels, the difference in their mean energies (|E1 - E2|) must be greater than the uncertainty, or width, of the levels. When considering two levels, each with its own width (ΔE1 and ΔE2), the total uncertainty is the sum of their individual uncertainties (ΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2). A conservative condition for the levels to be clearly resolvable is:\n    |E1 - E2| > ΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2\n\n    The dominant factor in this sum will be the larger of the two uncertainties, which corresponds to the state with the *shorter* lifetime.\n\n*   **Calculations:**\n    1.  We need the value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) in units that are convenient for this problem, typically electron-volts-seconds (eV·s).\n        ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n    2.  Calculate the energy uncertainty for the first state (ΔE1):\n        τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n        ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1\n\n    3.  Calculate the energy uncertainty for the second state (ΔE2):\n        τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n        ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2\n\n    4.  Calculate the total uncertainty (ΔE_total):\n        ΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2\n\n    5.  The required energy difference |E1 - E2| must be greater than ΔE_total. We then compare this minimum required difference with the given options.\n\n*   **Using Code for Calculation:** Let's use Python to perform the calculations accurately.\n\n```python\n# Value of the reduced Planck constant in eV.s\nhbar_eV_s = 6.582e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (Delta_E = hbar / tau)\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eV_s / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eV_s / tau2\n\n# The total energy uncertainty is the sum of the individual uncertainties.\n# To resolve the two levels, their energy difference must be greater than this total uncertainty.\ntotal_delta_E = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty of state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty of state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Total energy uncertainty to resolve the levels (ΔE1 + ΔE2): {total_delta_E:.4e} eV\")\n\n# The required energy difference |E1 - E2| must be greater than total_delta_E.\nprint(f\"Therefore, the energy difference must be > {total_delta_E:.4e} eV\")\n\n# Let's compare this with the given options.\noptions = {'A': 1e-4, 'B': 1e-9, 'C': 1e-11, 'D': 1e-8}\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing with options:\")\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > total_delta_E:\n        print(f\"Option {option}: {value:.1e} eV is > {total_delta_E:.4e} eV.

This is not resolvable.\")\n\n```\nExecution Output:\n```\nEnergy uncertainty of state 1 (ΔE1): 6.5820e-07 eV\nEnergy uncertainty of state 2 (ΔE2): 6.5820e-08 eV\nTotal energy uncertainty to resolve the levels (ΔE1 + ΔE2): 7.2402e-07 eV\nTherefore, the energy difference must be > 7.2402e-07 eV\n\nComparing with options:\nOption A: 1.0e-04 eV is > 7.2402e-07 eV.

Final Answer**\n\nThe calculation shows that to clearly resolve the two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than the total energy uncertainty, which is approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA) 10⁻⁴ eV = 1000 x 10⁻⁷ eV. This is much larger than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\nB) 10⁻⁹ eV. This is smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\nC) 10⁻¹¹ eV. This is much smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\nD) 10⁻⁸ eV = 0.1 x 10⁻⁷ eV. This is smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option A provides an energy separation large enough to clearly distinguish the two states.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The core of this problem is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as it relates to energy and time.\n\n**1. Understand the Principle:**\nThe time-energy uncertainty principle is given by the relation:\nΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n*   Δt is the uncertainty in time.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h / 2π), approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n**2. Relate Lifetime to Uncertainty:**\nThe lifetime (τ) of an unstable quantum state can be considered as the uncertainty in time (Δt) during which the system exists in that state. Consequently, the energy level of that state is not perfectly sharp but has a natural \"width\" or uncertainty, ΔE. For calculation purposes, we can approximate the relationship as:\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy Width for Each State:**\nWe need to find the energy uncertainty for both states.\n\n*   **For State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₁ = ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **For State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₂ = ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**4. Determine the Condition for Resolution:**\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, their energy separation must be larger than the combined uncertainty or \"blurriness\" of the levels. The total effective width is the sum of the individual widths:\nΔE_total = ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n\nTherefore, the condition for the levels to be resolved is:\n|E₁ - E₂| > ΔE_total\n\nLet's calculate the total uncertainty:\nΔE_total ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\nΔE_total ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\nΔE_total ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nSo, the energy difference between the two levels, |E₁ - E₂|, must be greater than approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**5. Compare with the Given Options:**\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁴ eV = 1,000 x 10⁻⁷ eV. This is greater than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   B) 10⁻⁹ eV = 0.01 x 10⁻⁷ eV. This is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV = 0.0001 x 10⁻⁷ eV. This is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   D) 10⁻⁸ eV = 0.1 x 10⁻⁷ eV. This is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option A provides an energy difference large enough to resolve the two states, given their lifetimes.\n\n<<<A>>>"
