    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to calculate the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 ($L_1$) to the luminosity of Star_2 ($L_2$), which is $L_1/L_2$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Principle:** The luminosity of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L = \\sigma A T^4$\n    where:\n    *   $L$ is the luminosity.\n    *   $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   $A$ is the star's surface area, which for a sphere is $A = 4\\pi R^2$.\n    *   $T$ is the star's surface temperature.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, we can write the luminosities for the two stars:\n    *   $L_1 = \\sigma (4\\pi R_1^2) T_1^4$\n    *   $L_2 = \\sigma (4\\pi R_2^2) T_2^4$\n\n    Now, we can find the ratio $L_1/L_2$:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{\\sigma (4\\pi R_1^2) T_1^4}{\\sigma (4\\pi R_2^2) T_2^4} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$\n\n4.  **Use the Given Radius Information:** The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2.\n    *   $R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \\implies \\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$\n    *   Therefore, $(\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio:** This is the most complex part. We need to relate the temperatures using the information about their spectra.\n    *   The problem states that the *observed* wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest ($\\lambda_{obs}$) are the same: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n    *   This observed peak wavelength is related to the intrinsic emitted peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{emit}$) by the Doppler effect formula for light. For speeds much less than the speed of light ($v \\ll c$), the formula is: $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emit}(1 + \\frac{v_r}{c})$, where $v_r$ is the radial velocity and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   The intrinsic emitted peak wavelength is determined by the star's temperature according to Wien's displacement law: $\\lambda_{emit} = b/T$, where $b$ is Wien's constant.\n\n6.  **Apply Doppler and Wien's Laws to Both Stars:**\n    *   **For Star_1:** The radial velocity is $v_{r1} = 0$. So there is no Doppler shift.\n        $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{emit,1}(1 + 0/c) = \\lambda_{emit,1}$.\n        Using Wien's law: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = b/T_1$.\n    *   **For Star_2:** The radial velocity is $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s. This star is moving away from us, causing its light to be redshifted.\n        $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{emit,2}(1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c})$.\n        Using Wien's law: $\\lambda_{obs,2} = (b/T_2)(1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c})$.\n\n7.  **Solve for the Temperature Ratio:** Since we are given that $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we can set the two expressions equal:\n    $\\frac{b}{T_1} = \\frac{b}{T_2}(1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c})$\n    Canceling the constant $b$ from both sides gives:\n    $\\frac{1}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{T_2}(1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c})$\n    Rearranging to find the ratio $T_1/T_2$:\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = 1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c} \\implies \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c}$\n\n8.  **Combine Everything to Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:** Substitute the expressions for the radius ratio and the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\cdot (\\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c})^4$\n\n9.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation:** Now, we plug in the values:\n    *   $v_{r2} = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 700,000 \\text{ m/s}$\n    *   $c$ (speed of light) $\\approx 299,792,458 \\text{ m/s}$\n    We can use a Python script for an accurate calculation.\n\n```python\n# Given values from the problem\nradius_ratio_sq = 1.5**2\nv_r2 = 700 * 1000  # Radial velocity of Star_2 in m/s\nc = 299792458    # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Calculate the temperature ratio term: (T1/T2)^4\n# T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v_r2 / c)\ntemp_ratio_term = (1 / (1 + v_r2 / c))**4\n\n# Calculate the final luminosity ratio: L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\nluminosity_ratio = radius_ratio_sq * temp_ratio_term\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n2.2291079313217436\n</execute_code>\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 2.229. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~2.23\nB) ~2.35\nC) ~2.25\nD) ~2.32\n\nThe calculated value of ~2.229 is closest to 2.23. The information about the masses of the stars is extra information not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Primary Goal:** The objective is to determine the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to the luminosity of Star_2, denoted as $L_1/L_2$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physical Laws:**\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity ($L$) of a star radiating as a black body is given by the equation $L = \\sigma A T^4$, where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $A$ is the star's surface area, and $T$ is its surface temperature. Since a star is a sphere, its surface area is $A = 4\\pi R^2$, where R is the radius.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates the temperature ($T$) of a black body to the peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{emit}$) at which it emits the most radiation: $\\lambda_{emit} = b/T$, where $b$ is Wien's constant.\n    *   **Doppler Effect for Light:** The observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) of light from a moving source is shifted relative to the emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{emit}$). The relationship is given by $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emit} (1 + v_r/c)$, where $v_r$ is the radial velocity (positive if moving away) and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n3.  **Set up the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for both stars, we can write the ratio of their luminosities:\n    $ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{\\sigma (4\\pi R_1^2) T_1^4}{\\sigma (4\\pi R_2^2) T_2^4} $\n    The constants $\\sigma$ and $4\\pi$ cancel out, leaving:\n    $ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $\n\n4.  **Incorporate the Given Information:**\n    *   **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, so $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$.\n    *   **Wavelength Information:** The *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n    *   **Radial Velocities:** $v_{r1} = 0$ km/s and $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s.\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$):**\n    We need to relate the temperatures using the wavelength information. Let's find expressions for the observed peak wavelength for each star.\n    *   **Star_1:**\n        $v_{r1} = 0$, so there is no Doppler shift. $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{emit,1}$.\n        Using Wien's Law: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = b/T_1$.\n    *   **Star_2:**\n        $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s. The light is redshifted.\n        $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{emit,2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n        Using Wien's Law: $\\lambda_{obs,2} = (b/T_2) (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n\n    Now, since we know $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we can equate the two expressions:\n    $ \\frac{b}{T_1} = \\frac{b}{T_2} \\left(1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c}\\right) $\n\n    Cancel Wien's constant $b$ and rearrange to solve for the temperature ratio $T_1/T_2$:\n    $ \\frac{1}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{T_2} \\left(1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c}\\right) \\implies \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = 1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c} $\n    $ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c} $\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:**\n    Substitute the radius ratio and the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    $ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c}\\right)^4 $\n\n7.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation:**\n    The problem has now been reduced to a numerical computation. We were previously given that the calculation results in approximately 2.229.\n    Let's confirm:\n    *   $R_1/R_2 = 1.5 \\implies (R_1/R_2)^2 = 2.25$.\n    *   $v_{r2} = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 7 \\times 10^5 \\text{ m/s}$.\n    *   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$.\n    *   $ \\frac{v_{r2}}{c} = \\frac{7 \\times 10^5}{3 \\times 10^8} \\approx 0.002333 $.\n    *   $\\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + 0.002333}\\right)^4 \\approx (0.99767)^4 \\approx 0.9907$.\n    *   $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx 2.25 \\times 0.9907 \\approx 2.229$.\n\n    The executed Python code `print((1.5**2) * (1 / (1 + (700 * 1000) / 299792458))**4)` gave a precise value of **2.229107...**\n\n8.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:**\n    The calculated value ~2.23 matches option A. Note that the information about the mass of the stars was extraneous and not needed for the calculation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
