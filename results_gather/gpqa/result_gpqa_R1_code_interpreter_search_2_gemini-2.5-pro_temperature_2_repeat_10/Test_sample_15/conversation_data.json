    "A molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. We need to examine each compound to determine if it is chiral.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`. A double bond is present, and we can draw the (Z) isomer. The molecule contains a plane of symmetry, which is the plane of the double bond and the atoms attached to it. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral. Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: This is a complex molecule, but the IUPAC name gives us crucial information. The name specifies a single, well-defined stereoisomer using stereodescriptors (3aR, 7aS, E). The presence of `R` and `S` descriptors indicates the presence of chiral centers. A specific combination of these, such as `(3aR, 7aS)`, describes one diastereomer. While a molecule with `R` and `S` centers can sometimes be a meso compound (achiral), this is unlikely for such a complex, unsymmetrically substituted structure. The descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` denote a specific configuration, which is the enantiomer of the `(3aS,7aR)` configuration. Unless the molecule possesses specific symmetry elements that make `(3aR,7aS)` superimposable on `(3aS,7aR)`, it is chiral. Given the complexity and the substituent, it's virtually certain that this specific enantiomer is chiral. A single enantiomer is always optically active. Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers, at C2 and C3. The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (-H, -CH3, -COOH). When two such identical chiral centers in a molecule have opposite configurations (one R, one S), the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (in its eclipsed conformation) or a center of inversion (in its staggered conformation) and is achiral. Such a compound is called a meso compound. The `(2R,3S)` diastereomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is the meso form. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound described above. It has two chiral centers, C2 and C3, both with the `R` configuration. This molecule does not have any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` compound, and it is not superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, this compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The structure is a six-membered ring containing a double bond and an alcohol group. The carbon atom C1, which bears the -OH group, is a chiral center. It is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH2-CH=, and =CH-CH2-. The name explicitly designates it as the `(R)` enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is by definition optically active. Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the stereoisomer where the three hydroxyl groups are all on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). This can be visualized with all three -OH groups as wedges in a planar drawing, or as all-axial (in one chair conformation) or all-equatorial (in the other chair conformation). This molecule possesses three planes of symmetry, each passing through one carbon with an -OH group and the opposite CH2 group on the ring. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral. Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(c-C5H9)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. To check for chirality, we look for chiral centers or other elements of chirality. There are no chiral centers in this molecule. The CH carbon in the `isobutyl` part is bonded to two identical methyl groups. The carbons in the `cyclopentyl` ring are also not chiral centers, as the path around the ring from the point of attachment is symmetrical in both directions. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that can pass through the C=O group and the `-CH2-CH` chain, bisecting the two methyl groups and the cyclopentyl ring. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\nSummary:\n- Compound 1: Inactive\n- Compound 2: Active\n- Compound 3: Inactive\n- Compound 4: Active\n- Compound 5: Active\n- Compound 6: Inactive\n- Compound 7: Inactive\n\nCounting the number of optically active compounds, we find there are 3.\n\n<<<A>>>"
