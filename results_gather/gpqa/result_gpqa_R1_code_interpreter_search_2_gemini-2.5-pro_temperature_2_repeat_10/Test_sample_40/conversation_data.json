    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Frame S (Laboratory Frame):** This is the observer's frame of reference, which is considered stationary. We want to find the speed of light (`u`) in this frame.\n    *   **Frame S' (Glass Frame):** This is the frame of reference moving along with the glass. It moves at a constant velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame S.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   **`v`**: The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S). The problem states it's moving in the same direction as the light beam.\n    *   **`u'`**: The velocity of the light beam relative to the moving glass (frame S'). This is the speed of light *within the medium*. By definition, the speed of light in a medium with a refractive index `n` is `c/n`. Since the problem specifies that the speed of light in a vacuum `c=1`, the speed of light in the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   **`u`**: The velocity of the light beam relative to the laboratory (frame S). This is the quantity we need to calculate.\n\n3.  **Choose the Correct Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    This problem involves velocities that can be close to the speed of light, so we cannot use the simple Galilean velocity addition (`u = u' + v`). We must use the Einstein (relativistic) velocity addition formula. For motion along a single axis, the formula is:\n\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula:**\n    We have the following values to substitute into the formula:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    Substituting these gives:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Algebraic Expression:**\n    First, simplify the denominator:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n    To eliminate the fractions within the main fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * ( (1/n) + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n    Distribute `n` in both the numerator and the denominator:\n    `u = ( n*(1/n) + n*v ) / ( n*1 + n*(v/n) )`\n\n    This simplifies to:\n    `u = ( 1 + n*v ) / ( n + v )`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    Let's check the options provided:\n    A) 1\n    B) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    C) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n    D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\n    Our result, `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`, exactly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
