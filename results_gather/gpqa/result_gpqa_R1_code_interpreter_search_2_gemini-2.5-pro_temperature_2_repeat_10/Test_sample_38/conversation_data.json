The Normalization Condition:**\nThe probability density is given by the squared modulus of the wave function, |ψ(x)|².\nThe normalization condition is: ∫ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1, where the integration is performed over the entire space where the particle can be found.\n\n**3.

    "The problem requires us to find the value of the normalization constant \"a\" for a given wave function ψ(x).\n\n**1. The Principle of Normalization**\nIn quantum mechanics, the wave function ψ(x) contains all the information about a particle. The probability of finding the particle in a certain region of space is given by the integral of the squared modulus of the wave function, |ψ(x)|², over that region. The total probability of finding the particle somewhere in the entire space where it can exist must be equal to 1. This is the normalization condition:\n\n∫ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\n**2. Define the Wave Function and its Modulus**\nThe given wave function is a complex number:\nψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nA complex number has the form z = Real + i * Imaginary. The squared modulus of a complex number is |z|² = (Real)² + (Imaginary)².\nFor our wave function:\n-   Real part: Re(ψ) = a / sqrt(1 + x)\n-   Imaginary part: Im(ψ) = -0.5\n\nSo, the squared modulus is:\n|ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)²\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n**3. Set up the Normalization Integral**\nThe problem states that the particles are only found in the interval between x=1 and x=3.

    "The problem is to find the value of the normalization constant `a` for the wave function ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, given that the particle is only found in the region 1 ≤ x ≤ 3.\n\n**1. Normalization Principle in Quantum Mechanics**\nThe fundamental principle of normalization states that the total probability of finding a particle in all possible locations must be equal to 1. The probability density of finding the particle at a position x is given by the squared modulus of the wave function, |ψ(x)|². Therefore, the normalization condition is expressed as an integral over the entire space where the particle can exist:\n∫ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\n**2. Calculating the Probability Density |ψ(x)|²**\nThe wave function ψ(x) is a complex number. A complex number `z = R + iI` has a squared modulus of `|z|² = R² + I²`, where R is the real part and I is the imaginary part.\n\nFor the given wave function, ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i:\n*   The real part is R(x) = a / sqrt(1 + x)\n*   The imaginary part is I(x) = -0.5\n\nThe squared modulus is therefore:\n|ψ(x)|² = [R(x)]² + [I(x)]²\n|ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)²\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n**3. Setting up the Normalization Integral**\nThe problem states that the particle is confined to the region between x=1 and x=3. Thus, we integrate the probability density over this interval and set the result to 1.\n\n∫[from x=1 to x=3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\n**4. Solving the Integral**\nWe can solve this integral by separating it into two parts:\n\n∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫[from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = 1\n\n*   **Part 1: The 'a' term**\n    ∫ (a² / (1 + x)) dx = a² ∫ (1 / (1 + x)) dx\n    The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x).\n    Evaluating this from 1 to 3:\n    a² * [ln(1+3) - ln(1+1)] = a² * [ln(4) - ln(2)]\n    Using the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\n    a² * ln(4/2) = a² * ln(2)\n\n*   **Part 2: The constant term**\n    ∫ 0.25 dx = 0.25x\n    Evaluating this from 1 to 3:\n    0.25 * (3 - 1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5\n\n**5. Solving for the constant 'a'**\nNow, substitute the results of the integrations back into the main equation:\n\n(a² * ln(2)) + 0.5 = 1\n\nIsolate the term with `a`:\na² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\na = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))\n\n**6. Numerical Calculation**\nWe use the known value of the natural logarithm of 2, which is ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.\n\na ≈ sqrt(0.5 / 0.6931)\na ≈ sqrt(0.7214)\na ≈ 0.8493\n\nThe provided Python code output `0.8493218002880191` confirms this calculation precisely.\n\n**7. Conclusion**\nThe calculated value for `a` is approximately 0.8493. Comparing this to the multiple-choice options:\nA) 0.35\nB) 1.1\nC) 0.6\nD) 0.85\n\nThe value 0.85 is the closest match to our calculated value.\n\n<<<D>>>"
