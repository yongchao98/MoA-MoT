    "This problem asks to identify which of the four given molecules has C3h symmetry. This means we need to determine the point group of each molecule and find the one that corresponds to C3h.\n\nThe C3h point group is characterized by the presence of a C3 axis of rotation and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to it. It does not have any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis, nor does it have any vertical mirror planes (σv). The full set of symmetry operations for C3h is {E, C3, C3^2, σh, S3, S3^5}.\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry of each molecule:\n\n1.  **Quinuclidine (B)**:\n    *   **Structure**: Quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) has a cage-like structure. It consists of a nitrogen atom and a CH group at the two bridgehead positions, connected by three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n    *   **Symmetry elements**: There is a C3 axis of rotation that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom. Rotating the molecule by 120° about this axis leaves it unchanged. There are also three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain this C3 axis and one of the three ethylene bridges.\n    *   **Point Group**: The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes defines the **C3v** point group. It lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n2.  **benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (A)**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is the systematic name for mellitic trianhydride. It is composed of a central benzene ring to which three five-membered anhydride rings are fused on alternating sides.\n    *   **Symmetry elements**: This molecule is completely planar.\n        *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n        *   It has a horizontal mirror plane (σh), which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n        *   It also possesses three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane, passing through the midpoints of opposite C-C bonds of the central benzene ring.\n    *   **Point Group**: The presence of a C3 axis, three perpendicular C2 axes, and a σh plane means the molecule belongs to the **D3h** point group. While D3h symmetry includes all the elements of C3h, the molecule has higher symmetry. Typically, such questions ask for the molecule whose highest-symmetry point group is the one specified. Therefore, this option is likely incorrect.\n\n3.  **triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (D)**:\n    *   **Structure**: This molecule is analogous to mellitic trianhydride but is built upon a larger triphenylene core instead of a benzene core. Triphenylene is a planar molecule made of four fused benzene rings. The three anhydride groups are fused symmetrically to the outer rings.\n    *   **Symmetry elements**: Like the molecule in (A), this molecule is also planar. It possesses a C3 axis, three perpendicular C2 axes, and a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   **Point Group**: Its point group is also **D3h**. For the same reason as molecule (A), this is not the best answer.\n\n4.  **Triisopropyl borate (C)**:\n    *   **Structure**: Triisopropyl borate has the formula B(O-iPr)3, which is B(O-CH(CH3)2)3. The boron atom is central, bonded to three oxygen atoms, which are each bonded to an isopropyl group.\n    *   **Symmetry elements**:\n        *   The BO3 core is known to be planar or nearly planar. The C3 axis passes through the boron atom, perpendicular to this BO3 plane.\n        *   To minimize steric hindrance, the three bulky isopropyl groups arrange themselves in a propeller-like (or pinwheel-like) fashion. This \"twisted\" arrangement means the molecule lacks perpendicular C2 axes and vertical mirror planes. If it had these elements, it would belong to the D3h group, but the propeller shape breaks this higher symmetry.\n        *   Now, we must check for a horizontal mirror plane (σh). A stable conformation exists where the central B, the three O atoms, and the three alpha-carbon atoms (the 'CH' of the isopropyl groups) lie nearly in the same plane. For each isopropyl group, the alpha-hydrogen also lies in this plane, while the two methyl (-CH3) groups are positioned symmetrically, one above and one below the plane. This arrangement creates a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that coincides with the plane containing the B, O, and Cα atoms.\n    *   **Point Group**: The molecule has a C3 axis and a σh plane, but lacks C2 axes perpendicular to C3 and σv planes. This combination of symmetry elements defines the **C3h** point group.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\n*   Molecule A (mellitic trianhydride) has D3h symmetry.\n*   Molecule B (quinuclidine) has C3v symmetry.\n*   Molecule C (triisopropyl borate) has C3h symmetry.\n*   Molecule D (triphenylene derivative) has D3h symmetry.\n\nTherefore, triisopropyl borate is the molecule with C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<C>>>"
