    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### Reaction A:\n**Reactants:**\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the highly acidic α-carbon (the CH₂ group flanked by two esters) to generate a resonance-stabilized enolate, ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbonyl carbon of the ester is not numbered, Cα is C2 and Cβ is C3. The p-tolyl group is at position 3. Its structure is p-Me-C₆H₄-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃.\n\n**Mechanism:**\n1.  The malonate enolate, ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂, acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n2.  A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the dimethyl malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate. The π electrons of the acceptor's C=C bond shift to the α-carbon, forming another enolate intermediate: p-Me-C₆H₄-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - ⁻CH-COOCH₃.\n3.  This intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) during workup to give the final stable product.\n\n**Product (A) Structure:**\nThe proton adds to the α-carbon, resulting in the following structure:\np-Me-C₆H₄-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃\n\n**Naming Product (A):**\nThe options use the IUPAC nomenclature for polycarboxylic acids where the carboxylate groups are named as substituents on a parent alkane chain.\n1.  Identify the main propane (3-carbon) chain connecting the carbons that bear the carboxylate groups. This chain consists of the α-carbon of malonate (let's call it C1), the β-carbon of the acrylate (C2), and the α-carbon of the acrylate (C3).\n    Chain: C3 - C2 - C1\n2.  Identify the substituents on this chain:\n    *   On C1 (from malonate): Two -COOCH₃ groups. This gives the `propane-1,1-dicarboxylate` part.\n    *   On C2 (original β-carbon): One p-tolyl group. This gives the `2-(p-tolyl)` part.\n    *   On C3 (original α-carbon): One -COOCH₃ group. This gives the `propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate` part.\n3.  Combining these parts gives the full name: **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n**Reactants:**\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are excellent carbon nucleophiles at the α-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring). This is part of a Stork enamine alkylation.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), which is CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN.\n\n**Mechanism:**\n1.  The nucleophilic C2 of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n2.  This forms a C-C bond, resulting in an intermediate that is an iminium salt after an internal charge rearrangement.\n3.  The addition of acid (H₃O⁺) in the workup step hydrolyzes the iminium salt back to a ketone. The piperidine is removed, and a carbonyl group (C=O) is reformed at the C1 position of the cyclohexane ring.\n\n**Product (B) Structure:**\nThe final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2). The substituent is the remnant of the Michael acceptor: -CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN. So, the product is 2-[-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN]cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Naming Product (B):**\nIt is conventional to name this molecule as a derivative of the nitrile, which is the principal functional group according to IUPAC priority.\n1.  The main chain is butanenitrile (4 carbons, with CN as C1).\n2.  The substituent is a (2-oxocyclohexyl) group, attached at position C3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n3.  The full name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major product, not the enol form.\n\n### Reaction C:\n**Analysis:**\nThis problem requires us to identify a reactant (C) given the other reactant and the final product. This is a retrosynthetic problem.\n*   **Known Reactant (Michael Acceptor):** But-3-en-2-one, commonly known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK). Structure: CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃.\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Catalyst:** KOH, H₂O (a base).\n\n**Retrosynthesis:**\n1.  The product is the result of a Michael addition. The bond formed connects the donor nucleophile to the acceptor.\n2.  The Michael acceptor, MVK (CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃), is converted into the `3-oxobutyl` group (-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃) upon reaction. The nucleophile attacks the terminal β-carbon (CH₂).\n3.  The product shows this `3-oxobutyl` group attached to C2 of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring system.\n4.  This implies that the nucleophile was formed from the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` molecule. The C2 carbon is an \"active methylene\" group, as it is located between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. The protons on C2 are acidic (pKa ≈ 11).\n5.  The base (KOH) deprotonates the C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione to form a resonance-stabilized enolate. This enolate is the nucleophile that attacks MVK.\n6.  Therefore, the missing reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nComparing this with the given options, we find that option C matches all three results.\n\n<<<C>>>"
