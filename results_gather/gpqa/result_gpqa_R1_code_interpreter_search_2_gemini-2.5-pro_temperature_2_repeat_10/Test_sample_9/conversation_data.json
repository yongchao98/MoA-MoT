    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the fundamental relationship between mass, radius, and density.**\n    Density (ρ) is defined as mass (M) divided by volume (V). For a spherical planet, volume is V = (4/3)πR³, where R is the radius. Therefore, ρ = M / V.\n\n*   **Step 2: Evaluate each option based on this relationship.**\n\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is our reference point. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. Let's denote this as ρ_earth.\n\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly given as ~5.5 g/cm³, which is essentially the same as Earth's density.\n\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** \"Same composition\" implies the planet is made of the same materials (e.g., a similar ratio of iron core to silicate mantle). However, with 5 times the mass, the planet's self-gravity will be much stronger. This immense gravitational force compresses the materials, forcing the atoms closer together. Increased compression leads to a higher density. Therefore, a 5-Earth-mass planet with Earth's composition will be denser than Earth.\n\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Following the same logic as in (c), a planet with less mass will have weaker self-gravity. This leads to less compression of its constituent materials compared to Earth. Consequently, its density will be lower than Earth's density.\n\n*   **Step 3: Compare the densities.**\n    *   Planet (a) density ≈ 5.51 g/cm³.\n    *   Planet (b) density ≈ 5.5 g/cm³.\n    *   Planet (c) density > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to greater gravitational compression).\n    *   Planet (d) density < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to lesser gravitational compression).\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude which planet has the highest density.**\n    By comparing the options, the planet in option (c) is the only one that must have a density significantly higher than Earth's. Planets (a) and (b) have densities very close to Earth's, and planet (d) has a lower density.\n\nTherefore, the planet with 5 Earth masses and the same composition as Earth will have the highest density.\n\n<<<A>>>"
