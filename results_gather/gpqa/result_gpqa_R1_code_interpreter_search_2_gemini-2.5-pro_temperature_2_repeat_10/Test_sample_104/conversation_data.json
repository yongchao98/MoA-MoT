    "This problem requires us to equate the dimming caused by starspots to the dimming caused by a transiting exoplanet.\n\n### 1. Calculate the brightness drop due to starspots\n\nThe brightness (or flux, F) of a star is related to its effective temperature (T) and projected area (A) by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, F ∝ A * T⁴. We are interested in the *relative* change in brightness, so we can ignore the constant of proportionality (Stefan-Boltzmann constant, σ) and the distance factor.\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The entire visible disk has a temperature T_star.\n    *   F_max ∝ A_disk * T_star⁴\n    where A_disk is the area of the star's projected disk (π * R_star²).\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer.\n    *   A fraction `f` (the filling factor) of the disk's area is covered by spots at temperature T_spot.\n    *   The remaining fraction `(1 - f)` is at the star's normal temperature T_star.\n    *   F_min ∝ [A_disk * (1 - f) * T_star⁴] + [A_disk * f * T_spot⁴]\n    *   F_min ∝ A_disk * [(1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴]\n\nThe amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots is the relative flux drop:\nAmplitude_spots = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\nAmplitude_spots = 1 - (F_min / F_max)\n\nSubstituting the expressions for flux:\nAmplitude_spots = 1 - { [A_disk * ((1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴)] / [A_disk * T_star⁴] }\nAmplitude_spots = 1 - [ (1 - f) + f * (T_spot / T_star)⁴ ]\nAmplitude_spots = 1 - 1 + f - f * (T_spot / T_star)⁴\nAmplitude_spots = f * [ 1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴ ]\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   Filling factor, f = 20% = 0.20\n*   Star's effective temperature, T_star = 6000 K\n*   Spot temperature, T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n\nAmplitude_spots = 0.20 * [ 1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴ ]\nAmplitude_spots = 0.20 * [ 1 - (5/6)⁴ ]\nAmplitude_spots = 0.20 * [ 1 - 625 / 1296 ]\nAmplitude_spots = 0.20 * [ (1296 - 625) / 1296 ]\nAmplitude_spots = 0.20 * [ 671 / 1296 ]\nAmplitude_spots ≈ 0.10355\n\n### 2. Calculate the equivalent exoplanet radius\n\nFor a transiting exoplanet, the drop in brightness (the transit depth or amplitude) is equal to the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n\nAmplitude_planet = (Area_planet) / (Area_star)\nAmplitude_planet = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)\nAmplitude_planet = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n### 3. Equate the two amplitudes\n\nWe want the amplitude from the planet to be the same as the amplitude from the spots:\nAmplitude_planet = Amplitude_spots\n(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.10355\n\nNow, solve for the relative radius (R_pl / R_star):\nR_pl / R_star = √0.10355\nR_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\nWe can use the following Python code to confirm the calculation:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Star and spot properties\nT_star = 6000  # K\nT_spot = 5000  # K\nf = 0.20       # Filling factor\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of brightness variation due to spots\n# Amplitude_spots = f * (1 - (T_spot/T_star)^4)\namplitude_spots = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)**4)\n\n# The amplitude for a transiting planet is (R_pl/R_star)^2\n# Set the amplitudes equal and solve for R_pl/R_star\n# (R_pl/R_star)^2 = amplitude_spots\nrelative_radius = math.sqrt(amplitude_spots)\n\nprint(f\"The amplitude due to spots is: {amplitude_spots:.5f}\")\nprint(f\"The required relative planet radius (R_pl/R_star) is: {relative_radius:.5f}\")\n```\n\nThe output confirms our result:\n`The amplitude due to spots is: 0.10355`\n`The required relative planet radius (R_pl/R_star) is: 0.32179`\n\nThe calculated relative radius is ~0.32, which matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning behind the solution:\n\n### 1. Understand the Physics\n\nThe problem asks us to compare two different phenomena that cause a star's brightness to dim:\n*   **Rotational Modulation by Starspots:** A star has cooler, darker spots on its surface. As the star rotates, a hemisphere covered in these spots comes into view, causing the star's total observed brightness to decrease. Then, as the unspotted hemisphere rotates into view, the brightness increases back to its maximum. This creates a periodic dimming and brightening.\n*   **Exoplanet Transit:** An exoplanet passes in front of its star from our point of view, blocking a small portion of the star's light. This causes a temporary, periodic dip in the star's brightness.\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the size of a planet that would block the same amount of light as the starspots do.\n\n### 2. Model the Dimming by Starspots\n\nThe flux (F), or brightness, emitted by a radiating object is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σ * A * T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, A is the emitting area, and T is the effective temperature. Since we are interested in the *relative* change in flux, we can say F ∝ A * T⁴.\n\n*   **F_max (Maximum Flux):** This occurs when we see the unspotted hemisphere. The entire visible disk (area A_star) radiates at the star's temperature (T_star).\n    *   F_max ∝ A_star * T_star⁴\n\n*   **F_min (Minimum Flux):** This occurs when we see the spotted hemisphere. A fraction of the area `f` (the filling factor) is covered by cool spots (T_spot), and the remaining area `(1 - f)` is at the normal stellar temperature (T_star).\n    *   F_min ∝ A_star * [(1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴]\n\n*   **Amplitude of the signal (relative flux drop):**\n    *   Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n    *   Amplitude = 1 - (F_min / F_max)\n    *   Amplitude = 1 - [ (A_star * ((1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴)) / (A_star * T_star⁴) ]\n    *   Amplitude = 1 - [ (1 - f) + f * (T_spot / T_star)⁴ ]\n    *   Amplitude = f * [ 1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴ ]\n\n### 3. Model the Dimming by an Exoplanet\n\nWhen a planet transits a star, the depth of the dip in the light curve (the amplitude) is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n\n*   Amplitude = Area_planet / Area_star\n*   Amplitude = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)\n*   Amplitude = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n### 4. Calculate and Equate the Amplitudes\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amplitude from the starspots using the given values:\n*   Filling factor, f = 20% = 0.20\n*   Star's temperature, T_star = 6000 K\n*   Spot temperature, T_spot = T_star - 1000 K = 5000 K\n\nAmplitude_spots = 0.20 * [ 1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴ ]\nAmplitude_spots = 0.20 * [ 1 - (5/6)⁴ ]\nAmplitude_spots = 0.20 * [ 1 - 0.48225 ]\nAmplitude_spots = 0.20 * 0.51775\nAmplitude_spots ≈ 0.10355\n\nNow, we set this equal to the amplitude caused by the hypothetical exoplanet:\n*   Amplitude_planet = Amplitude_spots\n*   (R_pl / R_star)² = 0.10355\n\nFinally, we solve for the relative radius (R_pl / R_star) by taking the square root:\n*   R_pl / R_star = √0.10355\n*   R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) ~0.39\nB) ~0.32\nC) ~0.07\nD) ~0.11\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.32 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
