    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid, analogous to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The reaction substitutes a bromine atom for one of the hydrogens on the alpha-carbon.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide anion (CN-) acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbon bonded to the bromine, and displaces the bromide ion (Br-), which is a good leaving group.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with *excess* sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a multi-step process involving alkylation of an active methylene compound.\n    1.  **First Deprotonation:** NaH is a strong base that removes one of the acidic alpha-protons from the CH2 group of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt). This forms a stable carbanion (an enolate).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na+[NC-CH-COOEt]- + H2\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]- + Br(CH2)5Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br-\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since *excess* NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining acidic alpha-proton.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → Na+[NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]- + H2\n    4.  **Intramolecular Alkylation:** The newly formed carbanion attacks the carbon at the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromine atom. This is an intramolecular SN2 reaction that closes a ring. The ring is formed from the alpha-carbon and the five carbons of the pentane chain, creating a six-membered ring.\n*   **Final Product 4:** The structure is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonyl-cyclohexane.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonyl-cyclohexane)**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must identify all sets of chemically non-equivalent protons in the molecule.\n\n**Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n1.  **Symmetry:** The two substituents on C1 (-CN and -COOEt) are different. Therefore, the molecule lacks any plane of symmetry. This asymmetry is key to determining the number of signals.\n\n2.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-COOCH2CH3):**\n    *   **-CH3:** The three protons of the terminal methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation around the C-C single bond. This will produce **1 signal**.\n    *   **-OCH2-:** The molecule is chiral (lacks a plane of symmetry), which makes the two protons of the methylene group (-OCH2-) diastereotopic. They are in chemically different environments and are therefore non-equivalent. This will produce **2 signals**.\n\n3.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   There are 10 protons on the ring, arranged as five CH2 groups at positions C2 through C6.\n    *   Because the molecule is asymmetric, the chemical environment on one \"side\" of the C1 carbon (e.g., C2 and C3) is different from the other \"side\" (C6 and C5).\n        *   Therefore, the protons on C2 are not equivalent to the protons on C6.\n        *   The protons on C3 are not equivalent to the protons on C5.\n        *   The protons on C4 are unique.\n    *   This gives us five chemically distinct methylene groups: at C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6.\n    *   A common simplification in interpreting 1H NMR spectra is to consider the two protons of a given ring CH2 group (which are technically diastereotopic: axial and equatorial) to be averaged by rapid chair-flipping, thus giving a single, though complex, signal for that CH2 group.\n    *   Applying this common convention, the five distinct CH2 groups will produce **5 signals**.\n\n**Counting the Signals:**\n*   From the ethyl group: 1 (for CH3) + 2 (for the diastereotopic CH2) = **3 signals**\n*   From the cyclohexane ring: **5 signals** (one for each unique CH2 group: C2, C3, C4, C5, C6)\n*   **Total Signals:** 3 + 5 = 8\n\nThus, there are 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
