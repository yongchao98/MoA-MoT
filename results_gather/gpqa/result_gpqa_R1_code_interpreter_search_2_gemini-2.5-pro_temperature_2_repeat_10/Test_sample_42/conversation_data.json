    "This problem asks for the correct IUPAC name of a complex substituted benzene molecule. To solve this, we will follow the IUPAC nomenclature rules systematically.\n\n### 1. Decipher the Structure\n\nFirst, let's break down the description to determine the structure of the molecule.\n\n*   **Parent structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Main functional groups:** A carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO, which is named as a \"formyl\" substituent), and a cyano group (-CN). These three groups are all *meta* to one another, which means they are in a 1,3,5-relationship on the ring.\n*   **Priority Functional Group:** According to IUPAC rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority among the given functional groups. Therefore, the parent name will be **benzoic acid**, and the carbon attached to the -COOH group is designated as **C1**.\n*   **Placing the groups:**\n    *   -COOH is at C1.\n    *   Since the other two groups are meta to it, they are at C3 and C5. Let's tentatively place -CHO at C3 and -CN at C5 (or vice-versa).\n*   **Other Substituents:**\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid. The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, -OH and -N(CH3)2 occupy positions C2 and C6.\n    *   A methoxy group (-OCH3) is *para* to the carboxylic acid. The para position to C1 is C4. So, -OCH3 is at C4.\n*   **The Final Clue:** \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\" This last piece of information resolves all ambiguities.\n    *   We know methoxy is at C4.\n    *   The nitrile (-CN) must be at C3 or C5.\n    *   The alcohol (-OH) must be at C2 or C6.\n    *   Let's test the two possibilities for the nitrile's position:\n        *   **Case 1: If Nitrile (-CN) is at C3.** The ortho positions to C3 are C2 and C4. The condition says methoxy (at C4) and alcohol (at C2 or C6) must be ortho to the nitrile. Since C4 is ortho to C3, this fits. The alcohol must then be at C2 to also be ortho to C3. This works.\n        *   **Case 2: If Nitrile (-CN) is at C5.** The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6. The condition says methoxy (at C4) and alcohol (at C2 or C6) must be ortho to the nitrile. Since C4 is ortho to C5, this fits. The alcohol must then be at C6 to also be ortho to C5. This also works.\n\n    It seems we have two valid structures. However, these two structures are actually the same molecule, just reflected. Let's pick one (Case 1) and proceed. The naming rules will lead to a unique name regardless of the initial drawing.\n\n    The final deduced structure is:\n    *   C1: -COOH (Carboxylic acid)\n    *   C2: -OH (Hydroxy)\n    *   C3: -CN (Cyano)\n    *   C4: -OCH3 (Methoxy)\n    *   C5: -CHO (Formyl)\n    *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (Dimethylamino)\n\n### 2. IUPAC Numbering\n\n*   **Principle:** We've established C1 is the carbon with the -COOH group. We must number the ring (clockwise or counter-clockwise) to give the set of substituents the lowest possible locants.\n*   **Numbering Clockwise (as per our structure above):** The substituents are at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The set of locants is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n*   **Numbering Counter-Clockwise:** This would place the dimethylamino group at C2, the formyl at C3, etc. The set of locants would still be {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n*   **Tie-Breaker Rule:** When two numbering schemes yield the same lowest locant set, we choose the one that assigns the lowest number to the substituent that comes first alphabetically.\n*   **Alphabetizing the Substituents:**\n    1.  **c**yano (-CN)\n    2.  **d**imethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n    3.  **f**ormyl (-CHO)\n    4.  **h**ydroxy (-OH)\n    5.  **m**ethoxy (-OCH3)\n*   **Applying the Tie-Breaker:** The first substituent in alphabetical order is **cyano**.\n    *   In our clockwise numbering scheme (starting towards the -OH group), the cyano group gets locant **3**.\n    *   In a counter-clockwise scheme (starting towards the -N(CH3)2 group), the cyano group would get locant **5**.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, the clockwise numbering is correct.\n\n### 3. Assembling the Name\n\nThe correct numbering and substituent identities are:\n*   `3-cyano`\n*   `6-dimethylamino`\n*   `5-formyl`\n*   `2-hydroxy`\n*   `4-methoxy`\n\nTo write the final name, we list the substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by its locant number, and followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n1.  **3-cyano-**\n2.  **6-(dimethylamino)-** (parentheses are used for complex substituents like dimethylamino)\n3.  **5-formyl-**\n4.  **2-hydroxy-**\n5.  **4-methoxy**\n6.  **benzoic acid**\n\nPutting it all together, the correct IUPAC name is:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 4. Comparing with Options\n\nNow, let's compare our result with the given choices:\n*   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - Incorrect alphabetical order.\n*   B) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - Incorrect locants.\n*   C) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - Incorrect locants and alphabetical order.\n*   D) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - This matches our derived name perfectly in terms of locants and alphabetical order.\n\n<<<D>>>"
