    "*   **Analysis of the experimental goal:** The user wants to express a recombinant protein in mammalian cells (CHO cells). The protein consists of the mouse GADD45G protein with an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag at its N-terminus. The purpose is to study protein-protein interactions after viral infection.\n\n*   **Identifying the problem:** The experiment fails because the target protein is not overexpressed. The key clue is the DNA sequence of the constructed gene.\n\n*   **Sequence analysis:** The provided sequence is the plus strand (coding strand) of the DNA. The cell's machinery will transcribe this into mRNA (with T replaced by U), which is then translated by ribosomes into a protein. The translation process starts at the first ATG codon and proceeds in triplets (codons) until it encounters a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA).\n\n*   **Dissecting the DNA sequence:** Let's break down the provided sequence into codons and translate it:\n    1.  `5'-ATG...` : The sequence begins with `ATG`, which is the universal start codon, coding for Methionine (M). This is the expected start of the protein.\n    2.  `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC`: Let's translate this part.\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n        *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n        *   `GAT` -> Aspartic acid (D)\n        *   `GTT` -> Valine (V)\n        *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n        *   `GAT` -> Aspartic acid (D)\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n        *   `GCC` -> Alanine (A)\n        This corresponds to the amino acid sequence YPYDVPDYA, which is the exact sequence of the single influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag. So far, the construct seems correct: M-HA_tag-...\n\n    3.  `...AAATGA...`: Following the HA tag sequence (`...GCC`), the very next codons are `AAA` and `TGA`.\n        *   `AAA` -> Lysine (K)\n        *   `TGA` -> This is a **stop codon** (Opal codon).\n\n*   **Conclusion from sequence analysis:** The ribosome will start translation at the `ATG` codon, successfully synthesize the Methionine and the 9-amino-acid HA tag, add one more amino acid (Lysine), and then immediately encounter the `TGA` stop codon. At this point, translation will be terminated, and the ribosome will detach. The rest of the sequence, which corresponds to the GADD45G gene, will never be translated. Instead of a full-length HA-GADD45G protein, only a tiny, 11-amino-acid-long peptide (M-YPYDVPDYA-K) will be produced. This explains why no overexpression of the desired protein was detected.\n\n*   **Evaluating the options:**\n    *   **A) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** This is precisely what our analysis shows. A premature stop codon (`TGA`) in the sequence caused the translation to halt long before the full protein could be synthesized.\n    *   **B) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** While linkers are good practice, their absence doesn't cause a fundamental synthesis failure like this. The main issue is the lack of synthesis, not degradation.\n    *   **C) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This is incorrect. Stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA in mRNA) are not recognized by tRNAs but by protein release factors that terminate translation. Also, the stop codon in the sequence is `TGA`, not `TAA`.\n    *   **D) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** Our analysis shows that the DNA sequence correctly codes for the YPYDVPDYA peptide of the HA tag. There is no mutation within the tag itself.\n\nTherefore, the cause of the experimental failure is the presence of a premature stop codon.\n\n<<<A>>>"
