    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** I'll first identify all the given information and what the question is asking for.\n\n    *   **Given:**\n        *   Two star-planet systems (System 1 and System 2).\n        *   Star masses are equal: `M_star1 = M_star2`.\n        *   Planet masses are equal: `m_p1 = m_p2`.\n        *   Orbits are circular.\n        *   The detection method is Radial Velocity (RV).\n        *   System 1 has a maximum periodic wavelength shift `Δλ1 = 5 mÅ`.\n        *   System 2 has a maximum periodic wavelength shift `Δλ2 = 7 mÅ`.\n\n    *   **Question:** What is the ratio of the orbital periods, `T2 / T1`?\n\n2.  **Relate Observations to Physical Quantities:** The RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's light caused by its \"wobble\" as a planet orbits it. The observed wavelength shift `Δλ` is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity `v_r`. The maximum shift `Δλ_max` corresponds to the amplitude of the radial velocity variation, `K`.\n\n    *   Formula: `Δλ / λ₀ = v_r / c`, where `c` is the speed of light and `λ₀` is the rest wavelength.\n    *   This means `K ∝ Δλ_max`.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the RV amplitudes is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts:\n        `K2 / K1 = Δλ2 / Δλ1 = 7 / 5`.\n\n3.  **Relate RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (T):** I need to find the physical relationship between `K` and the orbital period `T` (or `P`).\n\n    *   For a circular orbit, the star's velocity `v_star` is related to the star's orbital radius around the center of mass (`a_star`) and the period (`T`): `v_star = 2π * a_star / T`.\n    *   The observed RV amplitude is `K = v_star * sin(i)`, where `i` is the orbital inclination. Since inclination is not given, I'll assume it's the same for both systems, so `sin(i)` will cancel out. `K ∝ v_star`.\n    *   From the definition of the center of mass: `m_p * a_p = M_star * a_star`, where `a_p` is the planet's orbital radius. The semi-major axis of the planet's orbit around the star is `a = a_p + a_star`.\n    *   Since planets are much less massive than stars (`m_p << M_star`), `a_p >> a_star`, so `a ≈ a_p`.\n    *   We can write `a_star ≈ a * (m_p / M_star)`.\n    *   Substituting `a_star` into the `v_star` equation: `v_star ≈ 2π * a * (m_p / M_star) / T`. So, `K ∝ a / T * (m_p / M_star)`.\n\n4.  **Incorporate Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period `T` and the semi-major axis `a`.\n\n    *   `T² = (4π² / (G * (M_star + m_p))) * a³`.\n    *   Since `M_star >> m_p`, we can simplify this to `T² ≈ (4π² / (G * M_star)) * a³`.\n    *   Rearranging for `a`: `a³ ≈ (G * M_star * T²) / (4π²)`, which means `a ∝ (M_star * T²)^(1/3)`.\n\n5.  **Combine the Equations:** Now I'll substitute the expression for `a` into the expression for `K`.\n\n    *   `K ∝ a / T * (m_p / M_star)`\n    *   `K ∝ [(M_star * T²)^(1/3)] / T * (m_p / M_star)`\n    *   `K ∝ [M_star^(1/3) * T^(2/3)] / T * (m_p / M_star)`\n    *   `K ∝ m_p * M_star^(1/3 - 1) * T^(2/3 - 1)`\n    *   `K ∝ m_p * M_star^(-2/3) * T^(-1/3)`\n\n6.  **Formulate the Ratio for the Two Systems:** Now I can write the ratio of `K2` to `K1`.\n\n    *   `K2 / K1 = [m_p2 * M_star2^(-2/3) * T2^(-1/3)] / [m_p1 * M_star1^(-2/3) * T1^(-1/3)]`\n\n7.  **Apply the Given Information:** The problem states that `M_star1 = M_star2` and `m_p1 = m_p2`. This simplifies the equation significantly, as these terms cancel out.\n\n    *   `K2 / K1 = T2^(-1/3) / T1^(-1/3) = (T2 / T1)^(-1/3)`\n\n8.  **Solve for the Period Ratio (T2 / T1):**\n\n    *   We know `K2 / K1 = 7 / 5`.\n    *   `7 / 5 = (T2 / T1)^(-1/3)`\n    *   To solve for `T2 / T1`, I'll raise both sides to the power of -3.\n    *   `(7 / 5)^(-3) = ( (T2 / T1)^(-1/3) )^(-3)`\n    *   `(5 / 7)³ = T2 / T1`\n\n9.  **Calculate the Final Value:** The final step is to compute the numerical value of `(5/7)³`. I can use a simple python script for accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods (T2/T1)\n# T2/T1 = (5/7)^3\nresult = (5/7)**3\nprint(result)\n```\n\n>>>0.36443148688046646\n\n10. **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated value is approximately `0.364`.\n    *   A) ~ 0.85\n    *   B) ~ 1.96\n    *   C) ~ 0.36\n    *   D) ~ 1.40\n\nThe calculated result `0.364` is closest to option `C`.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem requires us to relate the observed wavelength shift in the Radial Velocity (RV) method to the orbital period of the exoplanet. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n**Step 1: Relate Wavelength Shift to RV Amplitude (K)**\n\nThe RV method relies on the Doppler effect. The observed shift in the wavelength of a spectral line (`Δλ`) is directly proportional to the radial velocity of the star (`v_r`). The maximum wavelength shift (`Δλ_max`) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star as it \"wobbles,\" which is known as the RV semi-amplitude (`K`).\n\nSo, `K ∝ Δλ_max`.\n\nWe can write the ratio of the RV amplitudes for the two systems as:\n`K₂ / K₁ = Δλ_max₂ / Δλ_max₁ = 7 mÅ / 5 mÅ = 7/5`\n\n**Step 2: Relate RV Amplitude (K) to Physical Properties**\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude `K` for a star orbited by a single planet in a circular orbit (and assuming we are viewing the system edge-on, or that the inclination angle `i` is the same for both systems) can be derived from the laws of gravity and motion.\n\nThe formula for K is given by:\n`K ≈ ( (2πG)^(1/3) / T^(1/3) ) * (mₚ / M_star^(2/3))`\n\nwhere:\n*   `T` is the orbital period.\n*   `mₚ` is the planet's mass.\n*   `M_star` is the star's mass.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nThis formula shows that `K` is proportional to `T^(-1/3)`, `mₚ`, and `M_star^(-2/3)`.\n\n**Step 3: Set up the Ratio for the Two Systems**\n\nWe can now write the ratio `K₂ / K₁` using the relationship from Step 2:\n\n`K₂ / K₁ = [ (mₚ₂ / M_star₂^(2/3) * T₂^(1/3)) ] / [ (mₚ₁ / M_star₁^(2/3) * T₁^(1/3)) ]`\n\nThe problem states that the star masses are the same (`M_star₁ = M_star₂`) and the planet masses are the same (`mₚ₁ = mₚ₂`). Therefore, the mass terms cancel out, simplifying the equation significantly:\n\n`K₂ / K₁ = (1 / T₂^(1/3)) / (1 / T₁^(1/3))`\n`K₂ / K₁ = T₁^(1/3) / T₂^(1/3)`\n`K₂ / K₁ = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)`\n\n**Step 4: Solve for the Period Ratio (T₂ / T₁)**\n\nFrom Step 1, we know `K₂ / K₁ = 7/5`. Let's substitute this into our simplified equation:\n\n`7/5 = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)`\n\nTo find the ratio `T₂ / T₁`, we first solve for `T₁ / T₂` by cubing both sides:\n`(7/5)³ = T₁ / T₂`\n\nNow, we take the reciprocal to find `T₂ / T₁`:\n`T₂ / T₁ = 1 / ( (7/5)³ ) = (5/7)³`\n\n**Step 5: Calculation**\nThe final step is to calculate the value of `(5/7)³`.\n\n`T₂ / T₁ = (5/7) * (5/7) * (5/7) = 125 / 343`\n\nCalculating this decimal value: `125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644`\n\nThis value corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
