    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Process:** The problem describes the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) which results in the creation of two pairs of particles, $A^{+}$ and $A^{-}$. The reaction is:\n    $p + \\bar{p} \\rightarrow 2A^{+} + 2A^{-}$\n    This means a total of four particles of type A are created.\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation Laws:** To solve this problem, we will use the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n3.  **Initial State (Before Annihilation):**\n    *   **Energy ($E_i$):** The system consists of a proton and an antiproton. The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is a common way in physics problems to indicate that the initial kinetic energy of the system is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can assume both particles are effectively at rest. Therefore, the total initial energy is the sum of their rest mass energies.\n        *   The rest mass of a proton ($m_p$) is approximately $938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}/c^2$.\n        *   An antiproton has the same rest mass as a proton ($m_{\\bar{p}} = m_p$).\n        *   $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV} + 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.54 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   **Momentum ($P_i$):** Since the particles are at rest (or their velocities are negligible), the total initial momentum of the system is zero.\n        *   $P_i = 0$.\n\n4.  **Final State (After Annihilation):**\n    *   **Energy ($E_f$):** The system consists of four particles of type A (two $A^+$ and two $A^-$). All these particles have the same mass, $m_A$, given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$. The total final energy is the sum of the relativistic energies (rest energy + kinetic energy) of these four particles.\n        *   $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2)$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor for each particle A.\n    *   **Momentum ($P_f$):** Due to the conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero ($P_f = P_i = 0$). To achieve a total momentum of zero, the four particles must fly off in directions such that their vector momenta sum to zero. The most symmetric and simplest configuration is that they fly apart with equal speeds and momenta magnitudes.\n\n5.  **Solving for Velocity:**\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** We equate the initial and final energies:\n        $E_i = E_f$\n        $1876.54 \\, \\text{MeV} = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2)$\n    *   We can now solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.54 \\, \\text{MeV}}{4 \\times (300 \\, \\text{MeV})} = \\frac{1876.54}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n    *   The Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ is related to the velocity $v$ by the formula:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n    *   We need to solve for $v/c$ (often denoted as $\\beta$):\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n        $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Substitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n    *   Therefore, the velocity of each particle A is $v = 0.7688c$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The calculated velocity is approximately $0.77c$. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) 0.86c\n    B) 0.91c\n    C) 0.77c\n    D) 0.96c\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
