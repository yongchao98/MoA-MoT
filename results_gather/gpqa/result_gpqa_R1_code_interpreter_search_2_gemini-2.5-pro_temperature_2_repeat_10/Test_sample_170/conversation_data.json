    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents**\n\nFirst, we need to classify the substituent on each benzene ring (`C6H5-X`) as either activating or deactivating, and as ortho/para-directing or meta-directing.\n\n1.  `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene): `-CH3` is an alkyl group. It is **activating** and **ortho/para-directing**.\n2.  `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate): `-COOC2H5` is an ester group. It is **deactivating** and **meta-directing**.\n3.  `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene): `-Cl` is a halogen. It is **deactivating** but **ortho/para-directing**.\n4.  `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene): `-NO2` is a nitro group. It is strongly **deactivating** and **meta-directing**.\n5.  `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene): `-C2H5` is an alkyl group. It is **activating** and **ortho/para-directing**.\n6.  `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid): `-COOH` is a carboxylic acid group. It is **deactivating** and **meta-directing**.\n\n**Step 2: General Principle of Para-Isomer Yield**\n\nMeta-directing groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. This means the yield of the para-isomer (and ortho-isomer) will be very low.\nOrtho/para-directing groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The yield of the para-isomer will be significant.\n\nTherefore, all substances with meta-directing groups will have a lower para-isomer yield than those with ortho/para-directing groups. This allows us to split the substances into two groups:\n\n*   Low para-yield group (meta-directors): {`C6H5-NO2` (4), `C6H5-COOH` (6), `C6H5-COOC2H5` (2)}\n*   High para-yield group (ortho/para-directors): {`C6H5-CH3` (1), `C6H5-C2H5` (5), `C6H5-Cl` (3)}\n\nThe final sequence will be of the form: `{4, 6, 2 in some order} < {1, 5, 3 in some order}`.\n\n**Step 3: Ordering the Meta-Directors ({4, 6, 2})**\n\nFor meta-directors, the very small amount of para-product formed is inversely related to the group's deactivating strength. A stronger deactivator is more strongly meta-directing, thus forming even less para-product. We need to order the groups by their deactivating strength.\n\n*   The nitro group (`-NO2`) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n*   The carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and ester (`-COOC2H5`) groups are also strongly deactivating due to the carbonyl group.\n*   Comparing `-COOH` and `-COOC2H5`: The `-C2H5` group in the ester is slightly electron-donating (+I effect) compared to the hydrogen in the carboxylic acid. This makes the ester group slightly *less* deactivating than the carboxylic acid group.\n\nSo, the order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\nThe order of increasing para-isomer yield will be the reverse: `C6H5-NO2` (4) < `C6H5-COOH` (6) < `C6H5-COOC2H5` (2).\nSo, the first part of our sequence is **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Ordering the Ortho/Para-Directors ({1, 3, 5})**\n\nFor ortho/para-directors, the ratio of para to ortho product depends on both electronic and steric factors. The question asks for the order of increasing yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Comparing `-CH3` (1) and `-C2H5` (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased steric hindrance near the ortho positions favors the attack at the more accessible para position. Therefore, ethylbenzene will produce a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. Order: `1 < 5`.\n\n*   **Comparing activating groups ({1, 5}) with the deactivating `-Cl` (3):** While halogens are deactivating overall, they are ortho/para directing. Deactivating groups slow down the reaction, which often leads to higher selectivity (according to Hammond's postulate). The transition state is later and more closely resembles the charged intermediate, so the stability difference between ortho and para attack is more pronounced. The `-Cl` group deactivates the ortho position (which is closer) more strongly than the para position via its inductive effect. This leads to a very high preference for para substitution. Activating groups make the reaction faster and generally less selective. Therefore, chlorobenzene is expected to give a very high yield of the para-isomer, higher than the activating alkylbenzenes. Order: `{1, 5} < 3`.\n\nCombining these points for the o,p-directors, we get the order of increasing para-yield: `C6H5-CH3` (1) < `C6H5-C2H5` (5) < `C6H5-Cl` (3).\nSo, the second part of our sequence is **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the sequences**\n\nNow we combine the two ordered groups:\n({4 < 6 < 2}) < ({1 < 5 < 3})\n\nThe complete sequence in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
