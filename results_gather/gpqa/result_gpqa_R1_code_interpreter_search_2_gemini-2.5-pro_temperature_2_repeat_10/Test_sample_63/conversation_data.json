    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Gas Treatment Process and Identify the Gaseous Products**\n\n    The mixture of gases produced by heating salts A and B is passed through a series of tubes. Let's analyze the function of each tube and quantify the products based on the mass changes.\n\n    *   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂ (a strong desiccant)**\n        *   This tube absorbs water (H₂O).\n        *   The weight increase is 3.60 g, which is the mass of the water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution (limewater)**\n        *   This tube is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂.\n        *   The problem states its weight has not changed. The gas entering this tube is dry (from tube 1), so no water vapor is being carried out. This implies that no acidic gases were present in the mixture. Therefore, the salts A and B do not contain carbon or sulfur.\n\n    *   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper (Cu)**\n        *   Hot copper is a reducing agent that reacts with oxidizing gases, most commonly oxygen (O₂) or nitrogen oxides (like N₂O, NO).\n        *   The weight of the tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n        *   Molar mass of O = 16 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   The gas that reacted must have been an oxygen-containing gas.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas (Gas C)**\n        *   After all reactions, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n        *   This gas is inert to all the reagents used (H₂O absorber, base, hot Cu). Since the original salts contain nitrogen (as we will see), this gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salt Mixture**\n\n    Now we can work backward from the products to find the total amount of each element in the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B.\n\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen ended up in the water.\n        *   Moles of H = 2 × Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the water and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n        *   Moles of O = (Moles of O in H₂O) + (Moles of O that reacted with Cu)\n        *   Moles of O = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n    *   **Nitrogen (N):** Nitrogen makes up the final inert gas, N₂. However, the gas that reacted with copper could also be a nitrogen oxide. Let's consider the reaction in Tube №3. A likely reactant is nitrous oxide (N₂O), which decomposes on hot copper: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. In this reaction, 1 mole of N₂O provides 1 mole of O to the copper and produces 1 mole of N₂. The moles of O that reacted with copper was 0.05 mol, which means 0.05 mol of N₂O reacted, producing 0.05 mol of N₂. The final 0.10 mol of N₂ consists of this 0.05 mol plus another 0.05 mol of N₂ that was present from the beginning.\n        *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × (moles of N₂ produced from N₂O) + 2 × (moles of initial N₂)\n        *   Total moles of N atoms = (2 × 0.05) + (2 × 0.05) = 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.20 mol.\n\n    Let's check if the total mass of these elements matches the initial mass.\n    ```python\n    mass_H = 0.40 * 1.008  # Moles of H * Molar mass of H\n    mass_O = 0.25 * 16.00  # Moles of O * Molar mass of O\n    mass_N = 0.20 * 14.01  # Moles of N * Molar mass of N\n    total_mass = mass_H + mass_O + mass_N\n    print(total_mass)\n    ```\n    7.206\n    The calculated mass (7.206 g) matches the initial mass of the mixture (7.20 g), confirming that salts A and B are composed solely of nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen.\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B**\n\n    We have an equimolar mixture. The total mole ratio of the elements in the combined mixture is:\n    N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n    To get integer ratios, we can multiply by 20:\n    N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n\n    So, the combined \"formula\" of one mole of salt A plus one mole of salt B is N₄H₈O₅. We need to find two salts, A (NₓHᵧO₂) and B (NₐHᵦOₓ), which are composed of N, H, and O, and their formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅. Common salts of this type are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n    Let's test common candidates:\n    *   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂ → Formula N₂H₄O₂\n    *   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃ → Formula N₂H₄O₃\n\n    Let's add these two formulas together:\n    (N₂H₄O₂) + (N₂H₄O₃) = N₍₂₊₂₎H₍₄₊₄₎O₍₂₊₃₎ = N₄H₈O₅\n\n    This perfectly matches our derived elemental ratio. Thus, salts A and B are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n4.  **Verify the Reaction and Products (Self-Correction/Double Check)**\n\n    Let's check if the decomposition of an equimolar mixture of these two salts produces the observed quantities.\n    *   First, find the moles of each salt. Total mass = 7.20 g.\n    *   M(NH₄NO₂) = 64.04 g/mol. M(NH₄NO₃) = 80.04 g/mol.\n    *   Mass of 1 mole of A + 1 mole of B = 64.04 + 80.04 = 144.08 g.\n    *   Let 'n' be the moles of each salt. n * (M_A + M_B) = 7.20 g => n * 144.08 = 7.20 => n ≈ 0.05 mol.\n    *   So, we have 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n    Decomposition reactions:\n    *   0.05 NH₄NO₂ → 0.05 N₂ + 0.10 H₂O\n    *   0.05 NH₄NO₃ → 0.05 N₂O + 0.10 H₂O (a common decomposition pathway at this temperature)\n\n    Total initial products:\n    *   H₂O: 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.20 mol (mass = 0.20 * 18 = 3.6 g). **Matches Tube 1.**\n    *   N₂: 0.05 mol.\n    *   N₂O: 0.05 mol.\n\n    Passing through the tubes:\n    *   Tube 1 absorbs the 0.20 mol H₂O.\n    *   Tube 2 (limewater) is inert to N₂ and N₂O. **Matches.**\n    *   Tube 3 (hot Cu) reacts with N₂O: 0.05 N₂O + Cu → 0.05 N₂ + 0.05 CuO.\n        *   This reaction deposits 0.05 mol of O atoms on the copper.\n        *   Mass increase = 0.05 mol * 16 g/mol = 0.80 g. **Matches Tube 3.**\n    *   Gas C (final gas) = (initial 0.05 mol N₂) + (0.05 mol N₂ from N₂O reaction) = 0.10 mol N₂.\n        *   Volume = 0.10 mol * 22.4 L/mol = 2.24 L. **Matches Gas C.**\n\n    All observations are perfectly explained by this model.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n    *   Salt A: NH₄NO₂ (which is N₂H₄O₂) has 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n    *   Salt B: NH₄NO₃ (which is N₂H₄O₃) has 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
