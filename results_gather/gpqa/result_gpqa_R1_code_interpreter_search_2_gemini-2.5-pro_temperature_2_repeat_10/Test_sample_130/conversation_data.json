    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   The first reactant is described as the anhydride of a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene.\n        *   ¹H NMR: one peak at 7.0 ppm. This suggests two equivalent vinyl protons.\n        *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons).\n        *   This data is perfectly consistent with **maleic anhydride**. It is formed by the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making the two protons and the two alkene carbons, and the two carbonyl carbons pairwise equivalent.\n\n    *   The second reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n        *   This is a cyclic diene that is locked in the *s-cis* conformation required for a Diels-Alder reaction.\n        *   The structure has methyl groups on all four carbons of the conjugated system (C1, C2, C3, C4) and a methylene group (-CH2-) at the C5 position.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder cycloaddition** between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   Two diastereomeric products can be formed: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed.\n\n3.  **Determine the Major and Minor Products:**\n    *   The **Alder Endo Rule** predicts that the *endo* product is typically the major, kinetically-favored product. This is due to favorable secondary orbital interactions between the diene's π-system and the dienophile's electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   However, this rule can be overridden by significant steric hindrance. In this specific case, the diene has methyl groups at positions C1 and C4. These are the positions that will become the bridgehead carbons in the product.\n    *   For the *endo* transition state, the anhydride ring must pass by these bulky methyl groups, leading to significant steric clash.\n    *   For the *exo* transition state, the anhydride ring is oriented away from these methyl groups, resulting in a much lower-energy transition state.\n    *   Therefore, in this specific reaction, the **exo adduct is the major product** (kinetically favored), and the **endo adduct is the minor product**. This is a well-known exception to the endo rule.\n\n4.  **Analyze the 3D Structures and NOESY Correlations:**\n    *   A NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) cross-peak indicates that two protons (or groups of protons) are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent/weak in the minor product. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *exo* adduct but far apart in the *endo* adduct.\n\n    Let's analyze the proton positions in each adduct. The product has a plane of symmetry. We can identify four distinct types of proton signals (plus the C7 bridge protons):\n    *   **H_anhydride:** The two protons at the fusion of the anhydride ring (C2 and C3). They are equivalent by symmetry (2H singlet). Let's estimate their shift as ~3.5 ppm.\n    *   **Me_vinyl:** The two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (C5 and C6). These come from C2 and C3 of the diene (6H singlet). Let's estimate their shift as ~1.7 ppm.\n    *   **Me_bridgehead:** The two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1 and C4). These come from C1 and C4 of the diene (6H singlet). Let's estimate their shift as ~1.0 ppm.\n    *   **H_bridge:** The two protons on the C7 bridge. They are diastereotopic and not equivalent (two 1H signals). Let's estimate their shift as ~1.5 ppm.\n\n    Now let's check their spatial relationships in the two isomers:\n    *   **Major Product (Exo Adduct):** The anhydride ring is on the same side as the C7 bridge. This places the **H_anhydride** protons on the *endo* face, pointing down towards the C5=C6 double bond. Consequently, the **H_anhydride** protons are very **close** to the **Me_vinyl** groups. A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between them.\n\n    *   **Minor Product (Endo Adduct):** The anhydride ring is on the *endo* face, tucked under the C5=C6 double bond. This places the **H_anhydride** protons on the *exo* face, pointing up towards the C7 bridge. Consequently, the **H_anhydride** protons are **far** from the **Me_vinyl** groups. The NOE cross-peak between them would be absent or very weak.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The distinguishing NOESY cross-peak, which is present in the major product (exo) and absent in the minor product (endo), arises from the through-space interaction between the **H_anhydride** protons and the **Me_vinyl** protons.\n\n6.  **Match with the Options:**\n    *   The **H_anhydride** protons correspond to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   The **Me_vinyl** protons correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak connects these two resonances.\n\n    This matches option B.\n    *   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: H_bridge with H_anhydride. This interaction likely exists in both isomers (to different H_bridge protons), so it's not uniquely present in one.\n    *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: Me_vinyl with H_anhydride. This matches our analysis perfectly.\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: Me_bridgehead with Me_vinyl. This distance should be similar in both isomers.\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: Me_bridgehead with H_bridge. This distance should be similar in both isomers.\n\n<<<B>>>"
