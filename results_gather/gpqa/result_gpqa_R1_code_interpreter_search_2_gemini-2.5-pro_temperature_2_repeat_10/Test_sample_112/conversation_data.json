    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data:**\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of an O-H bond stretch. The significant broadness is highly characteristic of the hydrogen-bonded O-H group found in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). While alcohols also show a broad O-H stretch, it is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This could correspond to a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. When combined with the very broad O-H peak, it strongly suggests a carboxylic acid, whose C=O stretch typically appears between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n\n**Summary of FTIR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n**2. Analysis of 1H NMR Data:**\n*   **\"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\"**: Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation explicitly confirms the presence of an alkene functional group, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n**3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. The fragment ion is [COOH]⁺. Let's calculate its mass:\n    *   Mass of Carbon (C) = 12\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 16\n    *   Mass of Hydrogen (H) = 1\n    *   Mass of [COOH]⁺ = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    This provides very strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n\n**4. Synthesis of all Data:**\n*   The combined spectroscopic data points unambiguously to a molecule that is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. It must contain at least one C=C bond and one -COOH group.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Molecular Formula Options:**\nTo evaluate the options, we can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for each formula. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is:\nDoU = C - (H/2) + 1 (for a compound with C, H, and O)\n\nOur identified structure must have at least **two** degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=C double bond and one for the C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group. It also must contain **two** oxygen atoms.\n\nLet's check each option:\n*   **A) C6H10O2:**\n    *   DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**.\n    *   Number of oxygens = **2**.\n    *   This formula has the correct number of oxygens for a carboxylic acid and the correct degree of unsaturation for one C=C bond and one C=O bond. This is a perfect match. An example would be hex-2-enoic acid.\n\n*   **B) C6H12O2:**\n    *   DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**.\n    *   This formula only allows for one degree of unsaturation. It could be a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid) or a cyclic diol, but it cannot contain both a C=C and a C=O group. This contradicts the evidence.\n\n*   **C) C6H10O:**\n    *   DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**.\n    *   This has the correct DoU, but only **one** oxygen. It cannot be a carboxylic acid. It could be an unsaturated ketone or aldehyde, but that would not explain the very broad O-H peak in the FTIR or the m/z=45 fragment in the mass spectrum.\n\n*   **D) C6H12O:**\n    *   DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**.\n    *   This has only one degree of unsaturation and one oxygen. This could be a saturated ketone/aldehyde or an unsaturated alcohol, neither of which fits all the spectral evidence.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOnly the molecular formula C6H10O2 is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data, indicating the presence of an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>"
