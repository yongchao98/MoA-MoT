Understand the Physics**\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system (where we can see the spectral lines of both stars), the total mass of the system (M_total = m1 + m2) can be determined from the orbital period (P) and the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1 and K2). The formula, derived from Kepler's Third Law, is:\n\nM_total = (P / (2πG)) * (K1 + K2)³ / sin³(i)\n\nwhere:\n*   `M_total` is the sum of the masses of the two stars.\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `K1` and `K2` are the amplitudes of the radial velocity curves for the two stars.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbital plane to our line of sight.\n\n**2. Use the Information Given**\n\nThe problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This is a crucial piece of information. An eclipsing binary system means that the orbital plane is viewed nearly edge-on from our perspective. Therefore, we can assume the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90 degrees, which makes `sin(i)` approximately 1, and `sin³(i)` is also 1.\n\nThe formula simplifies to:\n\nM_total = (P / (2πG)) * (K1 + K2)³\n\n**3. Set up the Ratio**\n\nWe need to find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2. This means we need to calculate the ratio of their total masses: M_total_1 / M_total_2.\n\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = [ (P1 / (2πG)) * (K1_1 + K1_2)³ ] / [ (P2 / (2πG)) * (K2_1 + K2_2)³ ]\n\nThe constant term `1 / (2πG)` cancels out, leaving a simpler ratio:\n\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = [ P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)³ ] / [ P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)³ ]\n\n**4. Plug in the Values**\n\nLet's gather the data for each system:\n\n*   **System 1:**\n    *   P1 = 2 years\n    *   K1_1 = 10 km/s\n    *   K1_2 = 5 km/s\n    *   Sum of velocities (K1_1 + K1_2) = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n\n*   **System 2:**\n    *   P2 = 1 year\n    *   K2_1 = 15 km/s\n    *   K2_2 = 10 km/s\n    *   Sum of velocities (K2_1 + K2_2) = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\nNow, substitute these values into the ratio formula. We can keep the units as years and km/s since they will be consistent in the numerator and denominator.\n\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = [ 2 * (15)³ ] / [ 1 * (25)³ ]\n\n**5. Calculate the Result**\n\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = [ 2 * 3375 ] / [ 1 * 15625 ]\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 6750 / 15625\n\nTo simplify the calculation, we can rewrite the expression:\n\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 2 * (15/25)³\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 2 * (3/5)³\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 54 / 125\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 0.432\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 0.432.

For such systems, the total mass (the sum of the masses of the two stars, M_total = m1 + m2) can be related to the orbital period (P) and the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1 and K2).\n\nThe key steps are as follows:\n1.  **Kepler's Third Law**: This law relates the orbital period, the semi-major axis (a), and the total mass of the system.\n2.  **Radial Velocity Information**: For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, we can measure the radial velocity amplitudes (K1 and K2) of both stars from the Doppler shift of their spectral lines.\n3.  **Inclination Angle (i)**: The observed radial velocities are the line-of-sight components of the orbital velocities and depend on the inclination of the orbital plane to our line of sight. However, the problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This is a crucial piece of information, as eclipses only occur when the inclination angle *i* is close to 90 degrees (i.e., the system is viewed edge-on). For an inclination of 90°, sin(i) is 1, which simplifies the calculations significantly.\n\nFor a circular orbit in an eclipsing binary system (where sin(i) ≈ 1), the total mass of the system can be derived from the following formula:\n\nM_total = (P / (2πG)) * (K1 + K2)³\n\nWhere:\n*   M_total is the sum of the masses of the two stars.\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   K1 and K2 are the amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n\nTo find the ratio of the mass of system_1 (M1) to the mass of system_2 (M2), we can set up a ratio of this equation for the two systems. The constant term (1 / 2πG) will cancel out.\n\nThe ratio is:\nM1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)³] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)³]\n\nNow, let's plug in the given values:\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Period (P1) = 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K1a + K1b) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Period (P2) = 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K2a + K2b) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, we calculate the ratio:\n\nM1 / M2 = [2 years * (15 km/s)³] / [1 year * (25 km/s)³]\n\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (15/25)³\n\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (3/5)³\n\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\n\nM1 / M2 = 54 / 125\n\nM1 / M2 = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) ~ 0.7\nB) ~ 1.2\nC) ~ 0.4\nD) ~ 0.6\n\nThe calculated factor of ~0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical principle.** The total mass of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system is related to its orbital period (P) and the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes of its components (K1 + K2). The key relationship, derived from Kepler's Third Law, is `M_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³`. The fact that the systems are eclipsing tells us the inclination angle is close to 90 degrees, which simplifies the relationship and allows for a direct comparison.\n\n2.  **Set up the ratio.** We need to find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, which is the ratio `M_total_1 / M_total_2`. Using the proportionality from step 1, the ratio can be written as:\n    `Ratio = (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³)`\n    Since this is a ratio, the constant of proportionality and the units will cancel out, so we can use the given values directly.\n\n3.  **Assign variables.** I will assign the given values for periods and radial velocities to variables in the Python code.\n    *   `P1 = 2` years\n    *   `K1a = 10` km/s, `K1b = 5` km/s\n    *   `P2 = 1` year\n    *   `K2a = 15` km/s, `K2b = 10` km/s\n\n4.  **Calculate and print the result.** I will implement the formula in Python, calculate the final numerical value, and print it.

This means we need to calculate the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M_total_1) to the total mass of system_2 (M_total_2).\n    *   `Ratio = M_total_1 / M_total_2`\n\n2.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Radial velocity amplitude of star 1a (K1a) = 10 km/s\n        *   Radial velocity amplitude of star 1b (K1b) = 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Radial velocity amplitude of star 2a (K2a) = 15 km/s\n        *   Radial velocity amplitude of star 2b (K2b) = 10 km/s\n\n3.  **Identify Key Concepts and Formulas:**\n    *   The problem involves spectroscopic binary stars. The total mass of such a system can be related to its orbital period (P) and the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K1, K2) of its stars.\n    *   The relationship is derived from Kepler's Third Law. For a binary system, the total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) is given by:\n        `M_total = (P / (2 * π * G)) * ((K1 + K2)^3 / sin^3(i))`\n        where:\n        *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n        *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n4.  **Analyze Careful Points:**\n    *   **The \"Eclipsing\" Clue:** The problem states that both systems are *eclipsing*. This is a crucial piece of information. For eclipses to occur, we must be viewing the system nearly edge-on. This means the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°.\n    *   **Simplification:** When `i ≈ 90°`, then `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and therefore `sin^3(i) ≈ 1`. This significantly simplifies the mass formula, as we can effectively ignore the `sin^3(i)` term.\n    *   **Units:** Since we are calculating a ratio, we do not need to convert the units (years to seconds, km/s to m/s) as long as we are consistent.

The total mass of a spectroscopic binary system is given by the mass function: `M1 + M2 = (P / (2 * π * G * sin^3(i))) * (K1 + K2)^3`.\n2.  Since we are asked for the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (`M_total_1`) to system_2 (`M_total_2`), the constant term `(1 / (2 * π * G))` cancels out.\n3.  The problem states that both systems are eclipsing, which means the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90 degrees. Therefore, `sin(i)` is approximately 1, and `sin^3(i)` is also 1 for both systems. This term also cancels out.\n4.  The ratio simplifies to `M_total_1 / M_total_2 = (P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)^3) / (P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)^3)`.\n5.  Plugging in the given values:\n    *   P1 = 2 years\n    *   K1_1 + K1_2 = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   P2 = 1 year\n    *   K2_1 + K2_2 = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n6.

Key Concepts and Formula\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M_total = M₁ + M₂) can be determined from the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves of the two stars (K₁ and K₂). The formula is:\n\nM₁ + M₂ = (P / (2πG)) * ( (K₁ + K₂)^3 / sin³(i) )\n\nwhere:\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `K₁` and `K₂` are the radial velocity semi-amplitudes.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n\nThe problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This means they are eclipsing binaries, which implies that the orbital inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°. For i ≈ 90°, sin(i) ≈ 1, and therefore sin³(i) ≈ 1. We can assume this for both systems.\n\n### 2. Setting up the Ratio\nWe want to find the ratio M_total_1 / M_total_2. Using the formula above, the constant term (1 / 2πG) will cancel out.

For a system where both stars' radial velocities can be measured, the total mass (M = m₁ + m₂) is given by:\n\nM = [P / (2πG * sin³(i))] * (K₁ + K₂ )³\n\nWhere:\n*   **M** is the total mass of the system.\n*   **P** is the orbital period.\n*   **G** is the gravitational constant.\n*   **K₁** and **K₂** are the amplitudes of the radial velocity variations for each star.\n*   **i** is the orbital inclination (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n### 2. Simplifying for Eclipsing Systems\n\nThe problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This is a crucial piece of information. For an eclipse to occur, our line of sight must be very close to the orbital plane of the stars. This means the inclination angle, *i*, is approximately 90 degrees.\n\nWhen *i* ≈ 90°, sin(*i*) ≈ 1, and therefore sin³(*i*) ≈ 1. This simplifies the mass equation significantly, as the sin³(*i*) term can be omitted. The constants 2πG will be the same for both systems and will cancel out when we take the ratio.\n\nThus, the total mass of a system is directly proportional to its period and the cube of the sum of its radial velocity amplitudes:\n\nM ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³\n\n### 3. Calculating the Masses\n\nNow we can apply this relationship to each system.\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Period (P₁): 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_sum₁): 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n*   The mass of system 1 (M₁) is proportional to: M₁ ∝ 2 * (15)³ = 2 * 3375 = 6750\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Period (P₂): 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_sum₂): 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n*   The mass of system 2 (M₂) is proportional to: M₂ ∝ 1 * (25)³ = 1 * 15625 = 15625\n\n### 4.

The relationship is `M ∝ P * (K_total)³`. The eclipsing nature of the systems is crucial because it tells us the orbital inclination is near 90 degrees (edge-on), which simplifies the mass calculation formula.

This is key information.\n    *   For a binary system, the individual masses (m_a, m_b) and the total mass (M = m_a + m_b) can be determined from the orbital period (P) and the orbital velocities.\n    *   The sinusoidal variation in radial velocities implies that the orbits can be approximated as circular.\n    *   The fact that the systems are eclipsing implies that their orbital planes are viewed nearly edge-on. This means the inclination angle `i` is close to 90°, and `sin(i) ≈ 1`.\n    *   The observed radial velocity amplitude `K` is related to the true orbital velocity `v` by `K = v * sin(i)`. Since `sin(i) ≈ 1`, we can approximate `K ≈ v`.\n\n4.  **Recall the Relevant Formula:**\n    The total mass `M` of a binary system can be found using a combination of Kepler's Third Law and the definition of orbital velocity. The resulting formula for the total mass, assuming circular orbits, is:\n    `M = (P * (v_a + v_b)³) / (2 * π * G)`\n    where `v_a` and `v_b` are the orbital speeds of the two stars.\n    Since we are dealing with radial velocities `K` and have assumed `sin(i) ≈ 1`, we can replace the orbital speeds `v` with their observed amplitudes `K`:\n    `M = (P * (K_a + K_b)³) / (2 * π * G)`\n    where `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Ratio:**\n    We need to find the ratio `M1 / M2`. We can set up the equation as follows:\n    `M1 / M2 = [ (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (2 * π * G) ] / [ (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³) / (2 * π * G) ]`\n    The constants `2`, `π`, and `G` will cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n    `M1 / M2 = [ P1 * (K1a + K1b)³ ] / [ P2 * (K2a + K2b)³ ]`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Units:** As we are calculating a ratio, the units for Period (years) and Velocity (km/s) will cancel out as long as they are consistent for both systems. There is no need to convert them to SI units (seconds and m/s).\n*   **Assumptions:** The accuracy of the result depends on the validity of the assumptions: circular orbits (`sinusoidal variations`) and edge-on inclination (`eclipses`). These are standard and justified assumptions for this type of problem.\n*   **Sum of Velocities:** It is the sum of the velocity amplitudes (`K_a + K_b`), which represents the amplitude of the relative velocity between the two stars, that is used in the formula for the total mass.\n\n### Calculation\n\n1.  **Calculate the sum of velocity amplitudes for each system:**\n    *   System 1: `K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s`\n    *   System 2: `K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s`\n\n2.  **Substitute the values into the ratio formula:**\n    *   `P1 = 2` years\n    *   `P2 = 1` year\n    *   `K1a + K1b = 15` km/s\n    *   `K2a + K2b = 25` km/s\n\n    `M1 / M2 = [ 2 * (15)³ ] / [ 1 * (25)³ ]`\n\n3.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    `M1 / M2 = 2 * (15 / 25)³`\n    The fraction `15 / 25` simplifies to `3 / 5`.\n    `M1 / M2 = 2 * (3 / 5)³`\n\n4.  **Compute the final value:**\n    `M1 / M2 = 2 * (3³ / 5³)`\n    `M1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n    `M1 / M2 = 54 / 125`\n    `M1 / M2 = 0.432`\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The calculated value is `0.432`.\n    A) ~ 0.6\n    B) ~ 0.7\n    C) ~ 1.2\n    D) ~ 0.4\n\n    The value `0.432` is closest to `0.4`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is approximately 0.432. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the mass function for a double-lined spectroscopic binary system. The total mass of a binary system (M_total = m1 + m2) is given by Kepler's Third Law, adapted for spectroscopic binaries:\n\nM_total = (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))\n\nWhere:\n*   `M_total` is the total mass of the system.\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `K1` and `K2` are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight.\n\nThe problem states that both systems are \"eclipsing.\" This is a critical piece of information, as it implies that we are viewing the orbits nearly edge-on. For an eclipsing binary, the inclination `i` is very close to 90°, which means `sin(i)` is very close to 1. Therefore, `sin³(i) ≈ 1`.\n\nWe are asked to find the ratio of the mass of system_1 (M1) to the mass of system_2 (M2).\n\nFor system_1:\nM1 = (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i1))\n\nFor system_2:\nM2 = (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i2))\n\nNow, let's form the ratio M1 / M2:\n\nM1 / M2 = [ (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i1)) ] / [ (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i2)) ]\n\nThe constants `2 * π * G` cancel out. Since both systems are eclipsing, we assume `sin³(i1) ≈ sin³(i2) ≈ 1`, so these terms also cancel out.

The observed radial velocity amplitudes (K₁ and K₂) are related to the orbital velocities by K = v * sin(i), where 'i' is the inclination of the orbital plane to the line of sight. Since both systems exhibit eclipses, their orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, so we can assume the inclination angle i ≈ 90°, which makes sin(i) ≈ 1. Therefore, the radial velocity amplitudes can be taken as the orbital velocities (K ≈ v).\n\nThe orbital velocities are related to the semi-major axes of each star's orbit around the common center of mass (a₁ and a₂) and the period P:\n\nv₁ = 2πa₁ / P  =>  a₁ = (v₁P) / (2π)\nv₂ = 2πa₂ / P  =>  a₂ = (v₂P) / (2π)\n\nThe semi-major axis of the relative orbit is a = a₁ + a₂. Substituting the expressions for a₁ and a₂, and using K for the velocities:\n\na = ( (K₁ + K₂) * P ) / (2π)\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for 'a' back into Kepler's Third Law:\n\nM_total = (4π² / (GP²)) * [ ( (K₁ + K₂) * P ) / (2π) ]³\nM_total = (4π² / (GP²)) * ( (K₁ + K₂ )³ * P³ ) / (8π³)\nM_total = ( P * (K₁ + K₂ )³ ) / (2πG)\n\nThis final expression shows that the total mass of the system is directly proportional to the orbital period and the cube of the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes.\n\n### Calculation\nWe can now calculate the relative masses for the two systems using the derived proportionality M ∝ P * (K_sum)³.\n\n**For system_1:**\n*   Period (P₁) = 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_sum1) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n*   Mass (M_sys1) ∝ 2 * (15)³ = 2 * 3375 = 6750\n\n**For system_2:**\n*   Period (P₂) = 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_sum2) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n*   Mass (M_sys2) ∝ 1 * (25)³ = 1 * 15625 = 15625\n\n**Mass Ratio:**\nTo find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we calculate the ratio M_sys1 / M_sys2:\n\nRatio = M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 6750 / 15625\n\nRatio = 54 / 125 = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\n### Calculation Steps:\n\nTo determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to calculate the total mass for each binary system. The total mass (M) of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system can be derived from Kepler's Third Law and the definitions of radial velocity.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Relationship**: The total mass of a binary system (M = M₁ + M₂) is related to its orbital period (P) and the semi-major axis (a) by Kepler's Third Law:\n    M = (4π²a³) / (GP²)\n\n2.  **Radial Velocity and Semi-Major Axis**: The observed quantities are the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K₁ and K₂). For a circular orbit, the maximum velocities are related to the semi-major axes of the individual orbits (a₁ and a₂) and the period (P):\n    v₁ = 2πa₁ / P\n    v₂ = 2πa₂ / P\n\n3.  **Observed vs. True Velocity**: The radial velocity is the component of the orbital velocity along the line of sight, so K = v * sin(i), where 'i' is the orbital inclination. Since both systems are eclipsing, we can assume the inclination angle i ≈ 90°, which means sin(i) ≈ 1. Therefore, the radial velocity amplitudes (K) are approximately equal to the true orbital velocities (v).\n    K₁ ≈ v₁ and K₂ ≈ v₂\n\n4.  **Total Mass Formula**: From the relationships above, we can derive a formula for the total mass in terms of the observable quantities P, K₁, and K₂. The total mass M is proportional to the period multiplied by the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes.\n    M ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂ )³\n\n5.  **Calculate for System 1**:\n    *   Period (P₁) = 2 years\n    *   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total₁) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   M₁ ∝ 2 * (15)³ = 2 * 3375 = 6750\n\n6.  **Calculate for System 2**:\n    *   Period (P₂) = 1 year\n    *   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total₂) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n    *   M₂ ∝ 1 * (25)³ = 1 * 15625 = 15625\n\n7.  **Determine the Ratio**: Now, we find the ratio of the mass of system_1 to the mass of system_2.\n    Ratio = M₁ / M₂ = 6750 / 15625\n\n8.  **Simplify the Fraction**:\n    Ratio = (2 * (15)³) / (1 * (25)³) = 2 * (15/25)³ = 2 * (3/5)³\n    Ratio = 2 * (27 / 125) = 54 / 125\n    Ratio = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nThe search results confirm the physics principles I used. Specifically, they confirm that for a spectroscopic binary, the masses, period, and velocities are related through Kepler's third law. Several sources mention that if you can measure the radial velocities of both stars (a double-lined spectroscopic binary), you can determine the mass ratio.\n\nThe key relationship for the total mass (M1 + M2) is derived from Kepler's third law. As stated in one of the sources, \"(mass 1 + mass 2) = (separation distance)³/(orbital period)²\". The separation distance can be related to the observed velocities and the period.\n\nCrucially, the observed radial velocity depends on the inclination angle 'i' of the orbit to our line of sight (radial velocity = true velocity × sin(i)). However, for an eclipsing binary, we know the system is viewed nearly edge-on, meaning the inclination angle is close to 90 degrees, and sin(i) is approximately 1. This justifies the assumption made in my derivation.\n\nThe formula I derived, M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³, is consistent with these principles.

Identify the Physical Principles\nThe problem involves determining the masses of binary star systems using observational data (orbital period and radial velocities). The key physical law is Kepler's Third Law, which can be adapted for spectroscopic binaries. For a double-lined spectroscopic binary (where we can see the spectral lines and measure the velocities of both stars), the total mass of the system (M_total = M₁ + M₂) is given by:\n\n`M_total = (P * (K₁ + K₂)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))`\n\nwhere:\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `K₁` and `K₂` are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves of the two stars.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit with respect to our line of sight.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Given Information\nWe are given the following data:\n\n**System 1:**\n*   Period (P₁): 2 years\n*   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K₁ₐ, K₁ᵦ): 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n*   The system is eclipsing.\n\n**System 2:**\n*   Period (P₂): 1 year\n*   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K₂ₐ, K₂ᵦ): 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n*   The system is eclipsing.\n\n### 3. Use the \"Eclipsing\" Constraint\nThe fact that both systems are \"eclipsing\" is crucial. Eclipses can only occur if we view the orbital plane almost perfectly edge-on. This means the inclination angle `i` must be very close to 90 degrees.\n\n*   If `i ≈ 90°`, then `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and `sin³(i) ≈ 1`.\n\nThis allows us to simplify the mass formula by removing the `sin³(i)` term, as it is approximately equal to 1 for both systems. The constants `2`, `π`, and `G` are the same for both systems. Therefore, the total mass is directly proportional to the period and the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes:\n\n`M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³`\n\n### 4. Set Up the Mass Ratio\nWe need to find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, which is the ratio `M_sys1 / M_sys2`. Using the proportionality from the previous step:\n\n`M_sys1 / M_sys2 = [P₁ * (K₁ₐ + K₁ᵦ)³] / [P₂ * (K₂ₐ + K₂ᵦ)³]`\n\n### 5. Substitute the Values and Calculate\n\nFirst, calculate the sum of the velocity amplitudes for each system:\n*   System 1: `K_total_1 = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s`\n*   System 2: `K_total_2 = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s`\n\nNow, substitute all the values into the ratio equation. We can use the units as given (years and km/s) because they will be consistent in the numerator and denominator, and any conversion factors would cancel out.\n\n`Ratio = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]`\n\nTo simplify the calculation:\n`Ratio = 2 * (15 / 25)³`\n`Ratio = 2 * (3 / 5)³`\n`Ratio = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n`Ratio = 54 / 125`\n`Ratio = 0.432`\n\n### 6. Conclusion\nThe calculated ratio of the mass of system_1 to system_2 is 0.432.

For an eclipse to occur, the inclination angle `i` must be close to 90°. For `i ≈ 90°`, `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and therefore `sin^3(i) ≈ 1`. We can assume this for both systems, so `sin^3(i_1)` and `sin^3(i_2)` are both approximately 1 and cancel out.\n    *   The simplified ratio becomes:\n        `M_1_total / M_2_total = (P_1 * (K_{1a} + K_{1b})^3) / (P_2 * (K_{2a} + K_{2b})^3)`\n\n6.  **Substitute the given values:**\n    *   **System 1:** `P_1 = 2` years, `K_{1a} = 10` km/s, `K_{1b} = 5` km/s.\n        `K_{1a} + K_{1b} = 10 + 5 = 15` km/s.\n    *   **System 2:** `P_2 = 1` year, `K_{2a} = 15` km/s, `K_{2b} = 10` km/s.\n        `K_{2a} + K_{2b} = 15 + 10 = 25` km/s.\n\n7.  **Calculate the final ratio:**\n    `M_1_total / M_2_total = (2 * (15)^3) / (1 * (25)^3)`\n    `M_1_total / M_2_total = (2 * 3375) / (1 * 15625)`\n    `M_1_total / M_2_total = 6750 / 15625`\n    `M_1_total / M_2_total = 0.432`\n\nThe calculation was confirmed using the provided python script, which returned `0.432`.\n\n8.  **Compare with the options:** The calculated value `0.432` is closest to the option `0.4`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nTo determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we can use the principles of orbital mechanics applied to binary star systems. For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, where the radial velocities of both stars can be measured, the total mass of the system is related to the orbital period and the radial velocity amplitudes.\n\nThe problem states that both systems are eclipsing, which implies that their orbital planes are viewed nearly edge-on.

For circular orbits, the circumference (2πa) is equal to the velocity multiplied by the period (v*P). Therefore, `a` is proportional to `v*P`.\n4.  **Total Mass Formula:** Combining these, the total mass `M_total = M1 + M2` is proportional to `(v*P)³ / P²`, which simplifies to `M_total ∝ v³ * P`. Here, `v` is the sum of the orbital speeds of the two stars (`v1 + v2`).\n5.  **Radial Velocity:** We don't observe the true orbital velocity `v`, but the radial component `vr = v * sin(i)`, where `i` is the inclination of the orbit. The peak radial velocity is denoted as `K`. So, `v` is proportional to `K / sin(i)`.\n6.  **Eclipsing Systems:** The problem states that both systems are eclipsing. This is crucial because it means the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90 degrees, which makes `sin(i)` approximately equal to 1. This removes the `sin(i)` uncertainty from the calculation.\n7.  **Final Proportionality:** Therefore, the total mass `M_total` is proportional to `(K_total)³ * P`, where `K_total = K1 + K2` is the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes.\n\nThis confirms that the formula I used, `M_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³`, is correct for this problem.\n\nNow, I will re-verify the calculation.\n\n**System 1:**\n*   P1 = 2 years\n*   K1_total = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**System 2:**\n*   P2 = 1 year\n*   K2_total = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n**Mass Ratio (M1 / M2):**\n`M1 / M2 = (P1 * (K1_total)³) / (P2 * (K2_total)³)`\n`M1 / M2 = (2 * (15)³) / (1 * (25)³)`\n`M1 / M2 = (2 * 3375) / (15625)`\n`M1 / M2 = 6750 / 15625`\n`M1 / M2 = 0.432`\n\nThe result of the calculation is robust. 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct answer.\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the total mass of each binary star system and then find the ratio. The total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) of a double-lined spectroscopic and eclipsing binary system can be found using the orbital period (P) and the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1 and K2).\n\nFor a binary system with circular orbits, the total mass is given by the formula:\n\nM_total = [P / (2πG * sin³(i))] * (K1 + K2)³\n\nWhere:\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n*   i is the inclination of the orbital plane to the line of sight.\n*   K1 and K2 are the amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n\nSince both systems are described as eclipsing, we can assume the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°, which means sin(i) ≈ 1. As we are calculating a ratio of the masses of the two systems, the constant term `1 / (2πG)` will cancel out.\n\nTherefore, the total mass of each system is directly proportional to its period multiplied by the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes:\n\nM_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³\n\nNow, we can calculate this value for each system.\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Period (P1) = 2 years\n*   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K_total_1) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n*   M1 ∝ 2 * (15)³ = 2 * 3375 = 6750\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Period (P2) = 1 year\n*   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K_total_2) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n*   M2 ∝ 1 * (25)³ = 1 * 15625 = 15625\n\nFinally, to find by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we calculate the ratio M1 / M2:\n\nRatio = M1 / M2 = 6750 / 15625\n\nRatio = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 ($M_1$) to the total mass of system_2 ($M_2$).\n\n**1.

Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2. This is equivalent to finding the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to the total mass of system_2.\n*   Goal: Calculate `M_total_1 / M_total_2`\n*   `M_total_1 = M_1a + M_1b` (sum of masses in system 1)\n*   `M_total_2 = M_2a + M_2b` (sum of masses in system 2)\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information**\n\n*   **System 1:**\n    *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n    *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 1a (K_1a) = 10 km/s\n    *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 1b (K_1b) = 5 km/s\n*   **System 2:**\n    *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n    *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 2a (K_2a) = 15 km/s\n    *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 2b (K_2b) = 10 km/s\n\n**3. Identify Key Physics Principles and Formulas**\n\nThe problem involves a spectroscopic eclipsing binary system. The total mass of such a system can be determined from the orbital period and the radial velocities of its component stars.\n\nThe relevant formula, derived from Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion, relates the total mass (M1 + M2) to the period (P) and the semi-major axis (a) of the relative orbit:\n`M1 + M2 = (4 * π² * a³) / (G * P²)`\nwhere G is the gravitational constant.\n\nWe do not know the semi-major axis `a` directly, but we can relate it to the observed radial velocity amplitudes (K1 and K2). For circular orbits, the orbital speeds (v1, v2) are given by:\n`v1 = 2π * a1 / P` and `v2 = 2π * a2 / P`\nwhere `a = a1 + a2`.\n\nThe observed radial velocity amplitudes (K1, K2) are the orbital speeds projected onto our line of sight:\n`K1 = v1 * sin(i)` and `K2 = v2 * sin(i)`\nwhere `i` is the inclination of the orbit.\n\nCombining these, we get:\n`a = a1 + a2 = (P / (2π)) * (v1 + v2) = (P / (2π * sin(i))) * (K1 + K2)`\n\nSubstituting this expression for `a` into Kepler's law for the total mass:\n`M1 + M2 = (1 / (2πG)) * (P * (K1 + K2)³ / sin³(i))`\n\n**4. List All Careful Points (Assumptions)**\n\n*   **Eclipsing System:** The problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This is a critical piece of information. Eclipses can only occur when the orbit is viewed nearly edge-on, meaning the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°. For `i ≈ 90°`, `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and therefore `sin³(i) ≈ 1`. This simplifies the mass formula significantly.\n*   **Sinusoidal Variations:** The problem mentions that the radial velocities show \"sinusoidal variations.\" This implies that the orbits of the stars are approximately circular. The formulas used here are for circular orbits.\n*   **Units:** We are asked for a ratio of masses. As long as we use consistent units for both systems (years for period, km/s for velocity), the constants (like `2πG`) and unit conversion factors will cancel out.\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation**\n\nBased on the simplified formula (`sin(i)=1`), the total mass of a system is directly proportional to its period and the cube of the sum of its radial velocity amplitudes:\n`M_total ∝ P * (K_a + K_b)³`\n\n*   **For System 1:**\n    *   P1 = 2 years\n    *   K_sum_1 = K_1a + K_1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   `M_total_1 ∝ P1 * (K_sum_1)³ = 2 * (15)³ = 2 * 3375 = 6750` (in proportional units)\n\n*   **For System 2:**\n    *   P2 = 1 year\n    *   K_sum_2 = K_2a + K_2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n    *   `M_total_2 ∝ P2 * (K_sum_2)³ = 1 * (25)³ = 1 * 15625 = 15625` (in proportional units)\n\n*   **Calculate the Ratio:**\n    *   Ratio = `M_total_1 / M_total_2`\n    *   Ratio = `(2 * 15³) / (1 * 25³)`\n    *   Ratio = `6750 / 15625`\n    *   To simplify, we can write it as: `2 * (15/25)³ = 2 * (3/5)³ = 2 * (27 / 125) = 54 / 125`\n    *   Ratio = `54 / 125 = 0.432`\n\n**6.

The relationship between these quantities and the total mass of the system (`M = m1 + m2`) is given by the formula for double-lined spectroscopic binaries, which is derived from Kepler's Third Law.\n    \n    `M₁ + M₂ = (P * (K₁ + K₂ )³) / (2πG * sin³i)`\n\n3.  **Analyze the \"Eclipsing\" Condition:** The problem states that both systems are \"eclipsing.\" This is a crucial piece of information. For eclipses to occur, the observer's line of sight must be very close to the orbital plane of the stars. This means the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°.\n    \n    When `i ≈ 90°`, `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and `sin³(i) ≈ 1`. This simplifies the mass equation considerably:\n    \n    `M_total ≈ (P * (K₁ + K₂ )³) / (2πG)`\n\n4.  **Formulate the Mass Ratio:** We need to find the ratio `M_system_1 / M_system_2`. Let's write the mass expression for each system:\n    \n    *   `M_system_1 = (P₁ * (K₁₁ + K₁₂)³) / (2πG)`\n    *   `M_system_2 = (P₂ * (K₂₁ + K₂₂)³) / (2πG)`\n    \n    When we create the ratio `M_system_1 / M_system_2`, the constant term `(2πG)` cancels out:\n    \n    `Ratio = M_system_1 / M_system_2 = (P₁ * (K₁₁ + K₁₂)³) / (P₂ * (K₂₁ + K₂₂)³)`\n\n5.  **Substitute the Given Values:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Period `P₁` = 2 years\n        *   Sum of velocity amplitudes `(K₁₁ + K₁₂)` = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Period `P₂` = 1 year\n        *   Sum of velocity amplitudes `(K₂₁ + K₂₂)` = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio:** The python code previously executed this calculation:\n    `Ratio = (2 * (15)³) / (1 * (25)³)`\n    `Ratio = (2 * 3375) / (1 * 15625)`\n    `Ratio = 6750 / 15625`\n\n    The code output confirms that `Ratio = 0.432`.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value is 0.432. We compare this to the provided choices:\n    *   A) ~ 0.4\n    *   B) ~ 0.6\n    *   C) ~ 0.7\n    *   D) ~ 1.2\n\n    The result `0.432` is closest to `0.4`. Therefore, system_1 is about 0.4 times as massive as system_2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\n### System_1 Found to Be Approximately 0.4 Times the Mass of System_2\n\nBy analyzing the observational data from two binary star systems, astronomers have determined the ratio of their total masses. The calculations reveal that system_1 is about 0.432 times as massive as system_2. This value corresponds to option B) ~ 0.4 in the provided choices.\n\nThe conclusion was reached by applying the principles of orbital mechanics to the specific properties of each system. For a double-lined spectroscopic and eclipsing binary system, the total mass (M) can be calculated from the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars (K1 and K2). Since the systems exhibit eclipses, their orbital inclination is assumed to be approximately 90 degrees, simplifying the calculations. The relationship is given by the formula:\n\nM ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³\n\nThis formula is derived from Kepler's Third Law, where the semi-major axis of the orbit is expressed in terms of the observable radial velocities and the period.\n\nFor system_1, the following data was used:\n*   Orbital Period (P1): 2 years\n*   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K1_1, K1_2): 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n\nFor system_2, the data was:\n*   Orbital Period (P2): 1 year\n*   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K2_1, K2_2): 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n\nTo find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, the ratio of their masses (M1/M2) was computed. The constant of proportionality cancels out in the ratio, leading to the following calculation:\n\nM1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)³] / [P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)³]\nM1 / M2 = [2 * (10 + 5)³] / [1 * (15 + 10)³]\nM1 / M2 = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\nM1 / M2 = [2 * 3375] /\nM1 / M2 = 6750 / 15625\nM1 / M2 = 0.432\n\nThis result indicates that system_1 has approximately 43.2% of the mass of system_2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nThe search results confirm the formula I derived. Specifically, result provides the formula for the sum of masses in a spectroscopic binary: `m1 + m2 = (P / (2πG)) * (v1r + v2r)³ / sin³(i)`.\n\nHere:\n*   `m1 + m2` is the total mass of the system.\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `v1r` and `v2r` are the amplitudes of the radial velocities (what I called `K1` and `K2`).\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit.\n\nThe problem states that both systems are eclipsing binaries. As result mentions, for eclipsing binaries, the inclination `i` is known to be close to 90 degrees (`i ≈ 90◦`), which means `sin(i)` is approximately 1. Therefore, `sin³(i)` is also approximately 1.\n\nThis confirms my formula:\n`M_total ∝ P * (K_total)³`\n\nMy calculation steps were as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the given data:**\n    *   **System 1:** P1 = 2 years, K1 = 10 km/s, K2 = 5 km/s.\n    *   **System 2:** P2 = 1 year, K1 = 15 km/s, K2 = 10 km/s.\n\n2.  **Calculate the sum of radial velocity amplitudes for each system:**\n    *   **System 1:** K_total_1 = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s.\n    *   **System 2:** K_total_2 = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s.\n\n3.  **Set up the ratio of the total masses (M1 / M2):**\n    `M1 / M2 = [P1 * (K_total_1)³] / [P2 * (K_total_2)³]`\n\n4.  **Substitute the values:**\n    `M1 / M2 = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]`\n    `M1 / M2 = 2 * (15/25)³`\n    `M1 / M2 = 2 * (3/5)³`\n    `M1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n    `M1 / M2 = 54 / 125`\n\n5.  **Calculate the final decimal value:**\n    `54 / 125 = 0.432`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\nThe steps, formula, and final calculation are consistent and confirmed by the search results. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\nTo determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to calculate the ratio of their total masses (M1 / M2). The total mass of a double-lined spectroscopic binary can be derived from Kepler's third law and the radial velocity observations.\n\nThe formula for the total mass (M) of a binary system is given by:\n\nM = M1 + M2 = [P / (2πG)] * [(K1 + K2)³ / sin³(i)]\n\nWhere:\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   K1 and K2 are the amplitudes of the radial velocities for the two stars.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n*   i is the inclination of the orbit to the plane of the sky.\n\nSince both systems are described as exhibiting eclipses, it is a standard assumption that their orbits are viewed edge-on, meaning the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°. For i = 90°, sin(i) = 1, which simplifies the formula significantly.\n\nThe ratio of the mass of system_1 (M_sys1) to the mass of system_2 (M_sys2) can be calculated as follows:\n\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)³] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)³]\n\nHere, the constant term `1 / (2πG)` cancels out.\n\nFor **system_1**:\n*   Period (P1) = 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K1a + K1b) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\nFor **system_2**:\n*   Period (P2) = 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K2a + K2b) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the ratio equation:\n\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (15 / 25)³\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (3 / 5)³\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 54 / 125\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 0.432\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 0.432, which is closest to the value given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nThe derivation seems correct. The search results confirm that for a double-lined spectroscopic binary, Kepler's Third Law can be expressed in terms of the period and the velocities of the stars. Since both systems are eclipsing, we can assume the inclination angle `i` is close to 90 degrees, making `sin(i)` approximately 1. This is a key assumption that allows for a direct calculation.\n\nThe total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) is related to the period (P) and the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes (K1 + K2) by the formula:\n\nM_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³\n\nLet's re-calculate the ratio of the masses of the two systems using this relationship.\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Eclipse Period (P1) = 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_sum1) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Eclipse Period (P2) = 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_sum2) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nThe ratio of the mass of system 1 (M1) to the mass of system 2 (M2) is:\n\nM1 / M2 = [P1 * (K_sum1)³] / [P2 * (K_sum2)³]\nM1 / M2 = [2 years * (15 km/s)³] / [1 year * (25 km/s)³]\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (15 / 25)³\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (3 / 5)³\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM1 / M2 = 54 / 125\nM1 / M2 = 0.432\n\nThis value is closest to 0.4.\n\nTherefore, system 1 is approximately 0.4 times as massive as system 2.\n\nFinal check of the question: \"By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?\". This phrasing could be ambiguous. It could mean \"how many times more massive\", in which case the answer would be 0.432. Or it could be interpreted differently, but given the multiple-choice options, a direct ratio is expected.

The total mass of a spectroscopic binary system is given by the mass function: `M1 + M2 = (P / (2 * π * G * sin^3(i))) * (K1 + K2)^3`.\n2.  Since we are asked for the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (`M_total_1`) to system_2 (`M_total_2`), the constant term `(1 / (2 * π * G))` cancels out.\n3.  The problem states that both systems are eclipsing, which means the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90 degrees. Therefore, `sin(i)` is approximately 1, and `sin^3(i)` is also 1 for both systems. This term also cancels out.\n4.  The ratio simplifies to `M_total_1 / M_total_2 = (P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)^3) / (P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)^3)`.\n5.

The mass of a double-lined, eclipsing spectroscopic binary system can be determined using the stars' radial velocities and the orbital period.\n\n### Key Principles\nFor a binary star system, the total mass (the sum of the masses of the two stars, M₁ + M₂) is related to the orbital period (P) and the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K₁ and K₂) through Kepler's Third Law. For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, where the spectral lines of both stars are visible, the relationship is given by:\n\nM₁ + M₂ = [P * (K₁ + K₂)³] / (2πG * sin³(i))\n\nHere, 'G' is the gravitational constant, and 'i' is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight. A crucial piece of information is that both systems exhibit eclipses. This means we are viewing the orbits nearly edge-on, so the inclination 'i' is approximately 90 degrees. For i = 90°, sin(i) = 1, which simplifies the formula significantly to:\n\nM_total = [P * (K_total)³] / (2πG)\n\nwhere K_total = K₁ + K₂.\n\n### Calculating the Mass Ratio\nWe need to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M_total1) to the total mass of system_2 (M_total2).\n\nM_total1 / M_total2 = { [P₁ * (K_total1)³] / (2πG) } / { [P₂ * (K_total2)³] / (2πG) }\n\nThe constant term (2πG) cancels out, leaving a straightforward ratio:\n\nM_total1 / M_total2 = (P₁ / P₂) * (K_total1 / K_total2)³\n\n### Applying the Given Data\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Orbital Period (P₁) = 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total1) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Orbital Period (P₂) = 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total2) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the ratio formula:\n\n*   **Period Ratio (P₁ / P₂):** 2 years / 1 year = 2\n*   **Velocity Amplitude Ratio (K_total1 / K_total2):** 15 km/s / 25 km/s = 3/5 = 0.6\n\nPlugging these ratios back into the mass ratio equation:\n\nM_total1 / M_total2 = 2 * (0.6)³\nM_total1 / M_total2 = 2 * 0.216\nM_total1 / M_total2 = 0.432\n\nThis result indicates that system_1 is approximately 0.432 times as massive as system_2.

Key Concepts and Formula\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M_total = M₁ + M₂) can be determined from the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves of the two stars (K₁ and K₂). The formula is:\n\nM₁ + M₂ = (P / (2πG)) * ( (K₁ + K₂)^3 / sin³(i) )\n\nwhere:\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `K₁` and `K₂` are the radial velocity semi-amplitudes.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n\nThe problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This means they are eclipsing binaries, which implies that the orbital inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°. For i ≈ 90°, sin(i) ≈ 1, and therefore sin³(i) ≈ 1. We can assume this for both systems.\n\n### 2. Setting up the Ratio\nWe want to find the ratio M_total_1 / M_total_2. Using the formula above, the constant term (1 / 2πG) will cancel out. Assuming sin³(i) is the same for both systems (≈ 1), this term also cancels.\n\nThis leaves us with the following proportionality:\nM_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)^3\n\nSo, the ratio of the masses is:\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = [ P₁ * (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ)³ ] / [ P₂ * (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ)³ ]\n\n### 3. Plugging in the Values\nLet's gather the data for each system:\n\n**System 1:**\n*   Period (P₁): 2 years\n*   RV Amplitudes (K₁ₐ, K₁ₑ): 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n*   Sum of amplitudes (K_sum_1): 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**System 2:**\n*   Period (P₂): 1 year\n*   RV Amplitudes (K₂ₐ, K₂ₑ): 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n*   Sum of amplitudes (K_sum_2): 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, substitute these values into the ratio formula. We can use the periods in years and velocities in km/s, as the units will cancel out in the ratio.\n\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = [ 2 * (15)³ ] / [ 1 * (25)³ ]\n\n### 4. Calculation\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 2 * (15 / 25)³\nFirst, simplify the fraction inside the parenthesis:\n15 / 25 = 3 / 5\n\nNow, substitute this back:\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 2 * (3 / 5)³\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 54 / 125\n\nFinally, convert the fraction to a decimal:\n54 / 125 = 0.432\n\n### 5.

The Physics of Binary Stars\n\nThe total mass of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system can be determined using a formula derived from Kepler's Third Law. For a system where both stars' radial velocities can be measured, the total mass (M = m₁ + m₂) is given by:\n\nM = [P / (2πG * sin³(i))] * (K₁ + K₂ )³\n\nWhere:\n*   **M** is the total mass of the system.\n*   **P** is the orbital period.\n*   **G** is the gravitational constant.\n*   **K₁** and **K₂** are the amplitudes of the radial velocity variations for each star.\n*   **i** is the orbital inclination (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n### 2. Simplifying for Eclipsing Systems\n\nThe problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This is a crucial piece of information. For an eclipse to occur, our line of sight must be very close to the orbital plane of the stars. This means the inclination angle, *i*, is approximately 90 degrees.\n\nWhen *i* ≈ 90°, sin(*i*) ≈ 1, and therefore sin³(*i*) ≈ 1. This simplifies the mass equation significantly, as the sin³(*i*) term can be omitted. The constants 2πG will be the same for both systems and will cancel out when we take the ratio.\n\nThus, the total mass of a system is directly proportional to its period and the cube of the sum of its radial velocity amplitudes:\n\nM ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³\n\n### 3.

This can be written as `M1 / M2`.\n\n2.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K1a, K1b) = 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K2a, K2b) = 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n\n3.  **Identify Key Physical Concepts:**\n    *   The problem describes spectroscopic binary systems that are also eclipsing. This is key information.\n    *   For a binary system, the individual masses (m_a, m_b) and the total mass (M = m_a + m_b) can be determined from the orbital period (P) and the orbital velocities.\n    *   The sinusoidal variation in radial velocities implies that the orbits can be approximated as circular.\n    *   The fact that the systems are eclipsing implies that their orbital planes are viewed nearly edge-on. This means the inclination angle `i` is close to 90°, and `sin(i) ≈ 1`.\n    *   The observed radial velocity amplitude `K` is related to the true orbital velocity `v` by `K = v * sin(i)`. Since `sin(i) ≈ 1`, we can approximate `K ≈ v`.\n\n4.  **Recall the Relevant Formula:**\n    The total mass `M` of a binary system can be found using a combination of Kepler's Third Law and the definition of orbital velocity. The resulting formula for the total mass, assuming circular orbits, is:\n    `M = (P * (v_a + v_b)³) / (2 * π * G)`\n    where `v_a` and `v_b` are the orbital speeds of the two stars.\n    Since we are dealing with radial velocities `K` and have assumed `sin(i) ≈ 1`, we can replace the orbital speeds `v` with their observed amplitudes `K`:\n    `M = (P * (K_a + K_b)³) / (2 * π * G)`\n    where `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Ratio:**\n    We need to find the ratio `M1 / M2`. We can set up the equation as follows:\n    `M1 / M2 = [ (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (2 * π * G) ] / [ (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³) / (2 * π * G) ]`\n    The constants `2`, `π`, and `G` will cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n    `M1 / M2 = [ P1 * (K1a + K1b)³ ] / [ P2 * (K2a + K2b)³ ]`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Units:** As we are calculating a ratio, the units for Period (years) and Velocity (km/s) will cancel out as long as they are consistent for both systems. There is no need to convert them to SI units (seconds and m/s).\n*   **Assumptions:** The accuracy of the result depends on the validity of the assumptions: circular orbits (`sinusoidal variations`) and edge-on inclination (`eclipses`). These are standard and justified assumptions for this type of problem.\n*   **Sum of Velocities:** It is the sum of the velocity amplitudes (`K_a + K_b`), which represents the amplitude of the relative velocity between the two stars, that is used in the formula for the total mass.\n\n### Calculation\n\n1.  **Calculate the sum of velocity amplitudes for each system:**\n    *   System 1: `K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s`\n    *   System 2: `K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s`\n\n2.  **Substitute the values into the ratio formula:**\n    *   `P1 = 2` years\n    *   `P2 = 1` year\n    *   `K1a + K1b = 15` km/s\n    *   `K2a + K2b = 25` km/s\n\n    `M1 / M2 = [ 2 * (15)³ ] / [ 1 * (25)³ ]`\n\n3.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    `M1 / M2 = 2 * (15 / 25)³`\n    The fraction `15 / 25` simplifies to `3 / 5`.\n    `M1 / M2 = 2 * (3 / 5)³`\n\n4.  **Compute the final value:**\n    `M1 / M2 = 2 * (3³ / 5³)`\n    `M1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n    `M1 / M2 = 54 / 125`\n    `M1 / M2 = 0.432`\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The calculated value is `0.432`.\n    A) ~ 0.6\n    B) ~ 0.7\n    C) ~ 1.2\n    D) ~ 0.4\n\n    The value `0.432` is closest to `0.4`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is approximately 0.432. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the mass function for a double-lined spectroscopic binary system. The total mass of a binary system (M_total = m1 + m2) is given by Kepler's Third Law, adapted for spectroscopic binaries:\n\nM_total = (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))\n\nWhere:\n*   `M_total` is the total mass of the system.\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `K1` and `K2` are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight.\n\nThe problem states that both systems are \"eclipsing.\" This is a critical piece of information, as it implies that we are viewing the orbits nearly edge-on. For an eclipsing binary, the inclination `i` is very close to 90°, which means `sin(i)` is very close to 1. Therefore, `sin³(i) ≈ 1`.\n\nWe are asked to find the ratio of the mass of system_1 (M1) to the mass of system_2 (M2).\n\nFor system_1:\nM1 = (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i1))\n\nFor system_2:\nM2 = (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i2))\n\nNow, let's form the ratio M1 / M2:\n\nM1 / M2 = [ (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i1)) ] / [ (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i2)) ]\n\nThe constants `2 * π * G` cancel out. Since both systems are eclipsing, we assume `sin³(i1) ≈ sin³(i2) ≈ 1`, so these terms also cancel out. The formula simplifies to:\n\nM1 / M2 = (P1 / P2) * [ (K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b) ]³\n\nNow, let's plug in the given values:\n\n**System 1:**\n*   P1 = 2 years\n*   K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**System 2:**\n*   P2 = 1 year\n*   K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nSubstitute these into the simplified ratio formula:\n\nM1 / M2 = (2 / 1) * [ (15) / (25) ]³\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (0.6)³\nM1 / M2 = 2 * 0.216\nM1 / M2 = 0.432\n\nThe factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is approximately 0.432.

The observed radial velocity amplitudes (K₁ and K₂) are related to the orbital velocities by K = v * sin(i), where 'i' is the inclination of the orbital plane to the line of sight. Since both systems exhibit eclipses, their orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, so we can assume the inclination angle i ≈ 90°, which makes sin(i) ≈ 1. Therefore, the radial velocity amplitudes can be taken as the orbital velocities (K ≈ v).\n\nThe orbital velocities are related to the semi-major axes of each star's orbit around the common center of mass (a₁ and a₂) and the period P:\n\nv₁ = 2πa₁ / P  =>  a₁ = (v₁P) / (2π)\nv₂ = 2πa₂ / P  =>  a₂ = (v₂P) / (2π)\n\nThe semi-major axis of the relative orbit is a = a₁ + a₂. Substituting the expressions for a₁ and a₂, and using K for the velocities:\n\na = ( (K₁ + K₂) * P ) / (2π)\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for 'a' back into Kepler's Third Law:\n\nM_total = (4π² / (GP²)) * [ ( (K₁ + K₂) * P ) / (2π) ]³\nM_total = (4π² / (GP²)) * ( (K₁ + K₂ )³ * P³ ) / (8π³)\nM_total = ( P * (K₁ + K₂ )³ ) / (2πG)\n\nThis final expression shows that the total mass of the system is directly proportional to the orbital period and the cube of the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes.\n\n### Calculation\nWe can now calculate the relative masses for the two systems using the derived proportionality M ∝ P * (K_sum)³.\n\n**For system_1:**\n*   Period (P₁) = 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_sum1) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n*   Mass (M_sys1) ∝ 2 * (15)³ = 2 * 3375 = 6750\n\n**For system_2:**\n*   Period (P₂) = 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_sum2) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n*   Mass (M_sys2) ∝ 1 * (25)³ = 1 * 15625 = 15625\n\n**Mass Ratio:**\nTo find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we calculate the ratio M_sys1 / M_sys2:\n\nRatio = M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 6750 / 15625\n\nRatio = 54 / 125 = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\n### Calculation Steps:\n\nTo determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to calculate the total mass for each binary system. The total mass (M) of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system can be derived from Kepler's Third Law and the definitions of radial velocity.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Relationship**: The total mass of a binary system (M = M₁ + M₂) is related to its orbital period (P) and the semi-major axis (a) by Kepler's Third Law:\n    M = (4π²a³) / (GP²)\n\n2.  **Radial Velocity and Semi-Major Axis**: The observed quantities are the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K₁ and K₂). For a circular orbit, the maximum velocities are related to the semi-major axes of the individual orbits (a₁ and a₂) and the period (P):\n    v₁ = 2πa₁ / P\n    v₂ = 2πa₂ / P\n\n3.  **Observed vs. True Velocity**: The radial velocity is the component of the orbital velocity along the line of sight, so K = v * sin(i), where 'i' is the orbital inclination. Since both systems are eclipsing, we can assume the inclination angle i ≈ 90°, which means sin(i) ≈ 1. Therefore, the radial velocity amplitudes (K) are approximately equal to the true orbital velocities (v).\n    K₁ ≈ v₁ and K₂ ≈ v₂\n\n4.  **Total Mass Formula**: From the relationships above, we can derive a formula for the total mass in terms of the observable quantities P, K₁, and K₂. The total mass M is proportional to the period multiplied by the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes.\n    M ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂ )³\n\n5.  **Calculate for System 1**:\n    *   Period (P₁) = 2 years\n    *   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total₁) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   M₁ ∝ 2 * (15)³ = 2 * 3375 = 6750\n\n6.  **Calculate for System 2**:\n    *   Period (P₂) = 1 year\n    *   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total₂) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n    *   M₂ ∝ 1 * (25)³ = 1 * 15625 = 15625\n\n7.  **Determine the Ratio**: Now, we find the ratio of the mass of system_1 to the mass of system_2.\n    Ratio = M₁ / M₂ = 6750 / 15625\n\n8.  **Simplify the Fraction**:\n    Ratio = (2 * (15)³) / (1 * (25)³) = 2 * (15/25)³ = 2 * (3/5)³\n    Ratio = 2 * (27 / 125) = 54 / 125\n    Ratio = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nThe search results confirm the physics principles I used. Specifically, they confirm that for a spectroscopic binary, the masses, period, and velocities are related through Kepler's third law. Several sources mention that if you can measure the radial velocities of both stars (a double-lined spectroscopic binary), you can determine the mass ratio.\n\nThe key relationship for the total mass (M1 + M2) is derived from Kepler's third law. As stated in one of the sources, \"(mass 1 + mass 2) = (separation distance)³/(orbital period)²\". The separation distance can be related to the observed velocities and the period.\n\nCrucially, the observed radial velocity depends on the inclination angle 'i' of the orbit to our line of sight (radial velocity = true velocity × sin(i)). However, for an eclipsing binary, we know the system is viewed nearly edge-on, meaning the inclination angle is close to 90 degrees, and sin(i) is approximately 1. This justifies the assumption made in my derivation.\n\nThe formula I derived, M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³, is consistent with these principles. The search did not provide this exact final formula in one place, but the components of the derivation are all supported by the search results.\n\nI am confident in my initial calculation.

This means calculating the ratio M1 / M2. My calculation does exactly that. The result is less than 1, meaning system 1 is less massive than system 2. The wording \"more massive\" might be slightly confusing, but the factor is the numerical result of the ratio.\n\nThe calculation is correct.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nThe total mass (`M_total = m1 + m2`) of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system can be determined from the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves (K1 and K2). The governing equation, derived from Kepler's Third Law, is:\n\n`M_total * sin^3(i) = (P / (2 * π * G)) * (K1 + K2)^3`\n\nwhere:\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nA crucial piece of information is that both systems are **eclipsing**. For eclipses to happen, our line of sight must be very close to the orbital plane, which means the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°.\n\nFor `i ≈ 90°`, we have `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and therefore `sin^3(i) ≈ 1`. This simplifies the mass equation to:\n\n`M_total ≈ (P / (2 * π * G)) * (K1 + K2)^3`\n\nSince `(1 / (2 * π * G))` is a constant, we can establish a proportionality for the total mass:\n\n`M_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)^3`\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the mass of system 1 (`M_sys1`) to the mass of system 2 (`M_sys2`). We can do this by taking the ratio of their proportional expressions, which will cause the constant terms to cancel out:\n\n`M_sys1 / M_sys2 = (P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)^3) / (P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)^3)`\n\nNow, let's plug in the values from the problem:\n\n**For system_1:**\n*   `P1 = 2` years\n*   `K1_1 = 10` km/s\n*   `K1_2 = 5` km/s\n*   Sum of velocities = `K1_1 + K1_2 = 10 + 5 = 15` km/s\n\n**For system_2:**\n*   `P2 = 1` year\n*   `K2_1 = 15` km/s\n*   `K2_2 = 10` km/s\n*   Sum of velocities = `K2_1 + K2_2 = 15 + 10 = 25` km/s\n\nNow, substitute these into the ratio equation:\n\n`M_sys1 / M_sys2 = (2 * (15)^3) / (1 * (25)^3)`\n`M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (15/25)^3`\n`M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (3/5)^3`\n`M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n`M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 54 / 125`\n`M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 0.432`\n\nThe calculated factor is `0.432`, which is approximately `0.4`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to the total mass of system_2.\n\n**1.

Identify the Physical Principles\nThe problem involves determining the masses of binary star systems using observational data (orbital period and radial velocities). The key physical law is Kepler's Third Law, which can be adapted for spectroscopic binaries. For a double-lined spectroscopic binary (where we can see the spectral lines and measure the velocities of both stars), the total mass of the system (M_total = M₁ + M₂) is given by:\n\n`M_total = (P * (K₁ + K₂)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))`\n\nwhere:\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `K₁` and `K₂` are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves of the two stars.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit with respect to our line of sight.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Given Information\nWe are given the following data:\n\n**System 1:**\n*   Period (P₁): 2 years\n*   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K₁ₐ, K₁ᵦ): 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n*   The system is eclipsing.\n\n**System 2:**\n*   Period (P₂): 1 year\n*   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K₂ₐ, K₂ᵦ): 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n*   The system is eclipsing.\n\n### 3. Use the \"Eclipsing\" Constraint\nThe fact that both systems are \"eclipsing\" is crucial. Eclipses can only occur if we view the orbital plane almost perfectly edge-on. This means the inclination angle `i` must be very close to 90 degrees.\n\n*   If `i ≈ 90°`, then `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and `sin³(i) ≈ 1`.\n\nThis allows us to simplify the mass formula by removing the `sin³(i)` term, as it is approximately equal to 1 for both systems. The constants `2`, `π`, and `G` are the same for both systems. Therefore, the total mass is directly proportional to the period and the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes:\n\n`M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³`\n\n### 4. Set Up the Mass Ratio\nWe need to find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, which is the ratio `M_sys1 / M_sys2`. Using the proportionality from the previous step:\n\n`M_sys1 / M_sys2 = [P₁ * (K₁ₐ + K₁ᵦ)³] / [P₂ * (K₂ₐ + K₂ᵦ)³]`\n\n### 5.

For circular orbits, the circumference (2πa) is equal to the velocity multiplied by the period (v*P). Therefore, `a` is proportional to `v*P`.\n4.  **Total Mass Formula:** Combining these, the total mass `M_total = M1 + M2` is proportional to `(v*P)³ / P²`, which simplifies to `M_total ∝ v³ * P`. Here, `v` is the sum of the orbital speeds of the two stars (`v1 + v2`).\n5.  **Radial Velocity:** We don't observe the true orbital velocity `v`, but the radial component `vr = v * sin(i)`, where `i` is the inclination of the orbit. The peak radial velocity is denoted as `K`. So, `v` is proportional to `K / sin(i)`.\n6.  **Eclipsing Systems:** The problem states that both systems are eclipsing. This is crucial because it means the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90 degrees, which makes `sin(i)` approximately equal to 1. This removes the `sin(i)` uncertainty from the calculation.\n7.  **Final Proportionality:** Therefore, the total mass `M_total` is proportional to `(K_total)³ * P`, where `K_total = K1 + K2` is the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes.\n\nThis confirms that the formula I used, `M_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³`, is correct for this problem.\n\nNow, I will re-verify the calculation.\n\n**System 1:**\n*   P1 = 2 years\n*   K1_total = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**System 2:**\n*   P2 = 1 year\n*   K2_total = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n**Mass Ratio (M1 / M2):**\n`M1 / M2 = (P1 * (K1_total)³) / (P2 * (K2_total)³)`\n`M1 / M2 = (2 * (15)³) / (1 * (25)³)`\n`M1 / M2 = (2 * 3375) / (15625)`\n`M1 / M2 = 6750 / 15625`\n`M1 / M2 = 0.432`\n\nThe result of the calculation is robust. 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct answer.\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the total mass of each binary star system and then find the ratio. The total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) of a double-lined spectroscopic and eclipsing binary system can be found using the orbital period (P) and the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1 and K2).\n\nFor a binary system with circular orbits, the total mass is given by the formula:\n\nM_total = [P / (2πG * sin³(i))] * (K1 + K2)³\n\nWhere:\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n*   i is the inclination of the orbital plane to the line of sight.\n*   K1 and K2 are the amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n\nSince both systems are described as eclipsing, we can assume the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°, which means sin(i) ≈ 1. As we are calculating a ratio of the masses of the two systems, the constant term `1 / (2πG)` will cancel out.\n\nTherefore, the total mass of each system is directly proportional to its period multiplied by the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes:\n\nM_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³\n\nNow, we can calculate this value for each system.\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Period (P1) = 2 years\n*   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K_total_1) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n*   M1 ∝ 2 * (15)³ = 2 * 3375 = 6750\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Period (P2) = 1 year\n*   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K_total_2) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n*   M2 ∝ 1 * (25)³ = 1 * 15625 = 15625\n\nFinally, to find by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we calculate the ratio M1 / M2:\n\nRatio = M1 / M2 = 6750 / 15625\n\nRatio = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 ($M_1$) to the total mass of system_2 ($M_2$).\n\n**1.

Identify Key Physics Principles and Formulas**\n\nThe problem involves a spectroscopic eclipsing binary system. The total mass of such a system can be determined from the orbital period and the radial velocities of its component stars.\n\nThe relevant formula, derived from Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion, relates the total mass (M1 + M2) to the period (P) and the semi-major axis (a) of the relative orbit:\n`M1 + M2 = (4 * π² * a³) / (G * P²)`\nwhere G is the gravitational constant.\n\nWe do not know the semi-major axis `a` directly, but we can relate it to the observed radial velocity amplitudes (K1 and K2). For circular orbits, the orbital speeds (v1, v2) are given by:\n`v1 = 2π * a1 / P` and `v2 = 2π * a2 / P`\nwhere `a = a1 + a2`.\n\nThe observed radial velocity amplitudes (K1, K2) are the orbital speeds projected onto our line of sight:\n`K1 = v1 * sin(i)` and `K2 = v2 * sin(i)`\nwhere `i` is the inclination of the orbit.\n\nCombining these, we get:\n`a = a1 + a2 = (P / (2π)) * (v1 + v2) = (P / (2π * sin(i))) * (K1 + K2)`\n\nSubstituting this expression for `a` into Kepler's law for the total mass:\n`M1 + M2 = (1 / (2πG)) * (P * (K1 + K2)³ / sin³(i))`\n\n**4. List All Careful Points (Assumptions)**\n\n*   **Eclipsing System:** The problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This is a critical piece of information. Eclipses can only occur when the orbit is viewed nearly edge-on, meaning the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°. For `i ≈ 90°`, `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and therefore `sin³(i) ≈ 1`. This simplifies the mass formula significantly.\n*   **Sinusoidal Variations:** The problem mentions that the radial velocities show \"sinusoidal variations.\" This implies that the orbits of the stars are approximately circular. The formulas used here are for circular orbits.\n*   **Units:** We are asked for a ratio of masses. As long as we use consistent units for both systems (years for period, km/s for velocity), the constants (like `2πG`) and unit conversion factors will cancel out.\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation**\n\nBased on the simplified formula (`sin(i)=1`), the total mass of a system is directly proportional to its period and the cube of the sum of its radial velocity amplitudes:\n`M_total ∝ P * (K_a + K_b)³`\n\n*   **For System 1:**\n    *   P1 = 2 years\n    *   K_sum_1 = K_1a + K_1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   `M_total_1 ∝ P1 * (K_sum_1)³ = 2 * (15)³ = 2 * 3375 = 6750` (in proportional units)\n\n*   **For System 2:**\n    *   P2 = 1 year\n    *   K_sum_2 = K_2a + K_2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n    *   `M_total_2 ∝ P2 * (K_sum_2)³ = 1 * (25)³ = 1 * 15625 = 15625` (in proportional units)\n\n*   **Calculate the Ratio:**\n    *   Ratio = `M_total_1 / M_total_2`\n    *   Ratio = `(2 * 15³) / (1 * 25³)`\n    *   Ratio = `6750 / 15625`\n    *   To simplify, we can write it as: `2 * (15/25)³ = 2 * (3/5)³ = 2 * (27 / 125) = 54 / 125`\n    *   Ratio = `54 / 125 = 0.432`\n\n**6.

The relationship between these quantities and the total mass of the system (`M = m1 + m2`) is given by the formula for double-lined spectroscopic binaries, which is derived from Kepler's Third Law.\n    \n    `M₁ + M₂ = (P * (K₁ + K₂ )³) / (2πG * sin³i)`\n\n3.  **Analyze the \"Eclipsing\" Condition:** The problem states that both systems are \"eclipsing.\" This is a crucial piece of information. For eclipses to occur, the observer's line of sight must be very close to the orbital plane of the stars. This means the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°.\n    \n    When `i ≈ 90°`, `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and `sin³(i) ≈ 1`. This simplifies the mass equation considerably:\n    \n    `M_total ≈ (P * (K₁ + K₂ )³) / (2πG)`\n\n4.  **Formulate the Mass Ratio:** We need to find the ratio `M_system_1 / M_system_2`.

Therefore, system_1 is about 0.4 times as massive as system_2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\n### System_1 Found to Be Approximately 0.4 Times the Mass of System_2\n\nBy analyzing the observational data from two binary star systems, astronomers have determined the ratio of their total masses. The calculations reveal that system_1 is about 0.432 times as massive as system_2. This value corresponds to option B) ~ 0.4 in the provided choices.\n\nThe conclusion was reached by applying the principles of orbital mechanics to the specific properties of each system. For a double-lined spectroscopic and eclipsing binary system, the total mass (M) can be calculated from the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars (K1 and K2). Since the systems exhibit eclipses, their orbital inclination is assumed to be approximately 90 degrees, simplifying the calculations. The relationship is given by the formula:\n\nM ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³\n\nThis formula is derived from Kepler's Third Law, where the semi-major axis of the orbit is expressed in terms of the observable radial velocities and the period.\n\nFor system_1, the following data was used:\n*   Orbital Period (P1): 2 years\n*   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K1_1, K1_2): 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n\nFor system_2, the data was:\n*   Orbital Period (P2): 1 year\n*   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K2_1, K2_2): 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n\nTo find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, the ratio of their masses (M1/M2) was computed. The constant of proportionality cancels out in the ratio, leading to the following calculation:\n\nM1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)³] / [P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)³]\nM1 / M2 = [2 * (10 + 5)³] / [1 * (15 + 10)³]\nM1 / M2 = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\nM1 / M2 = [2 * 3375] /\nM1 / M2 = 6750 / 15625\nM1 / M2 = 0.432\n\nThis result indicates that system_1 has approximately 43.2% of the mass of system_2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nThe search results confirm the formula I derived. Specifically, result provides the formula for the sum of masses in a spectroscopic binary: `m1 + m2 = (P / (2πG)) * (v1r + v2r)³ / sin³(i)`.\n\nHere:\n*   `m1 + m2` is the total mass of the system.\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `v1r` and `v2r` are the amplitudes of the radial velocities (what I called `K1` and `K2`).\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit.\n\nThe problem states that both systems are eclipsing binaries. As result mentions, for eclipsing binaries, the inclination `i` is known to be close to 90 degrees (`i ≈ 90◦`), which means `sin(i)` is approximately 1. Therefore, `sin³(i)` is also approximately 1.\n\nThis confirms my formula:\n`M_total ∝ P * (K_total)³`\n\nMy calculation steps were as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the given data:**\n    *   **System 1:** P1 = 2 years, K1 = 10 km/s, K2 = 5 km/s.\n    *   **System 2:** P2 = 1 year, K1 = 15 km/s, K2 = 10 km/s.\n\n2.  **Calculate the sum of radial velocity amplitudes for each system:**\n    *   **System 1:** K_total_1 = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s.\n    *   **System 2:** K_total_2 = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s.\n\n3.  **Set up the ratio of the total masses (M1 / M2):**\n    `M1 / M2 = [P1 * (K_total_1)³] / [P2 * (K_total_2)³]`\n\n4.  **Substitute the values:**\n    `M1 / M2 = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]`\n    `M1 / M2 = 2 * (15/25)³`\n    `M1 / M2 = 2 * (3/5)³`\n    `M1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n    `M1 / M2 = 54 / 125`\n\n5.  **Calculate the final decimal value:**\n    `54 / 125 = 0.432`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\nThe steps, formula, and final calculation are consistent and confirmed by the search results. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\nTo determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to calculate the ratio of their total masses (M1 / M2). The total mass of a double-lined spectroscopic binary can be derived from Kepler's third law and the radial velocity observations.\n\nThe formula for the total mass (M) of a binary system is given by:\n\nM = M1 + M2 = [P / (2πG)] * [(K1 + K2)³ / sin³(i)]\n\nWhere:\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   K1 and K2 are the amplitudes of the radial velocities for the two stars.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n*   i is the inclination of the orbit to the plane of the sky.\n\nSince both systems are described as exhibiting eclipses, it is a standard assumption that their orbits are viewed edge-on, meaning the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°. For i = 90°, sin(i) = 1, which simplifies the formula significantly.\n\nThe ratio of the mass of system_1 (M_sys1) to the mass of system_2 (M_sys2) can be calculated as follows:\n\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)³] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)³]\n\nHere, the constant term `1 / (2πG)` cancels out.\n\nFor **system_1**:\n*   Period (P1) = 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K1a + K1b) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\nFor **system_2**:\n*   Period (P2) = 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K2a + K2b) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the ratio equation:\n\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (15 / 25)³\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (3 / 5)³\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 54 / 125\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 0.432\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 0.432, which is closest to the value given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nThe derivation seems correct. The search results confirm that for a double-lined spectroscopic binary, Kepler's Third Law can be expressed in terms of the period and the velocities of the stars. Since both systems are eclipsing, we can assume the inclination angle `i` is close to 90 degrees, making `sin(i)` approximately 1. This is a key assumption that allows for a direct calculation.\n\nThe total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) is related to the period (P) and the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes (K1 + K2) by the formula:\n\nM_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³\n\nLet's re-calculate the ratio of the masses of the two systems using this relationship.\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Eclipse Period (P1) = 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_sum1) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Eclipse Period (P2) = 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_sum2) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nThe ratio of the mass of system 1 (M1) to the mass of system 2 (M2) is:\n\nM1 / M2 = [P1 * (K_sum1)³] / [P2 * (K_sum2)³]\nM1 / M2 = [2 years * (15 km/s)³] / [1 year * (25 km/s)³]\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (15 / 25)³\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (3 / 5)³\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM1 / M2 = 54 / 125\nM1 / M2 = 0.432\n\nThis value is closest to 0.4.\n\nTherefore, system 1 is approximately 0.4 times as massive as system 2.\n\nFinal check of the question: \"By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?\". This phrasing could be ambiguous. It could mean \"how many times more massive\", in which case the answer would be 0.432. Or it could be interpreted differently, but given the multiple-choice options, a direct ratio is expected.

This leaves a much simpler ratio that depends only on the observed quantities:\n\n    `M_sys1 / M_sys2 = (P1 / P2) * [(K1_1 + K1_2) / (K2_1 + K2_2)]³`\n\n5.  **Gather and Substitute the Data:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   `P1 = 2` years\n        *   `K1_total = K1_1 + K1_2 = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s`\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   `P2 = 1` year\n        *   `K2_total = K2_1 + K2_2 = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s`\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:** I will use a Python script to compute the final value accurately.\n\n```python\n# System 1 parameters\nP1 = 2.0  # years\nK1_sum = 10.0 + 5.0  # km/s\n\n# System 2 parameters\nP2 = 1.0  # year\nK2_sum = 15.0 + 10.0  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the masses\n# M1/M2 = (P1/P2) * (K1_sum / K2_sum)^3\nmass_ratio = (P1 / P2) * (K1_sum / K2_sum)**3\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n\n7.  **Final Result Interpretation:** The code output is `0.432`.

For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, where the radial velocity variations of both stars are observed, the total mass of the system (the sum of the masses of the two stars, M_total = M₁ + M₂) is related to the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (K₁ and K₂).\n\nThe formula for the total mass is:\nM₁ + M₂ = [P / (2πG)] * [(K₁ + K₂)³ / sin³(i)]\n\nWhere:\n*   **P** is the orbital period.\n*   **G** is the gravitational constant.\n*   **K₁ and K₂** are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves for each star.\n*   **i** is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight.\n\nThe problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. For eclipses to occur, the orbital inclination `i` must be very close to 90 degrees. When `i` is 90 degrees, sin(i) = 1, and therefore sin³(i) = 1. This greatly simplifies the mass calculation. We can assume this is the case for both eclipsing systems.\n\nThis means that the total mass (M_total) is directly proportional to the period multiplied by the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes:\nM_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³\n\nNow we can calculate this value for each system and then find their ratio.\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Orbital Period (P₁): 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total₁): 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n*   M₁ ∝ 2 * (15)³ = 2 * 3375 = 6750\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Orbital Period (P₂): 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total₂): 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n*   M₂ ∝ 1 * (25)³ = 1 * 15625 = 15625\n\n**Ratio of the masses:**\nTo find out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we calculate the ratio M₁ / M₂:\n\nRatio = M₁ / M₂ = 6750 / 15625 = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nTo determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we can use the principles of orbital mechanics for binary star systems.

We can also assume circular orbits, as is common for eclipsing binaries.\n\nThe total mass (M_total) of a binary system is given by the formula:\n\nM_total = (P / (2πG)) * (K₁ + K₂)³\n\nWhere:\n*   P is the orbital period\n*   K₁ and K₂ are the amplitudes of the radial velocities for the two stars\n*   G is the gravitational constant\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M_total_1) to the total mass of system_2 (M_total_2).\n\n**For system_1:**\n*   Orbital period (P₁) = 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total_1) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**For system_2:**\n*   Orbital period (P₂) = 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total_2) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, we can set up the ratio of the masses:\n\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = [ (P₁ / (2πG)) * (K_total_1)³ ] / [ (P₂ / (2πG)) * (K_total_2)³ ]\n\nThe constant term (1 / (2πG)) cancels out, leaving:\n\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = (P₁ / P₂) * (K_total_1 / K_total_2)³\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into the equation:\n\n*   P₁ / P₂ = 2 years / 1 year = 2\n*   K_total_1 / K_total_2 = 15 km/s / 25 km/s = 3/5\n\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 2 * (3/5)³\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 54 / 125\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nTo determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we can use the principles of orbital mechanics applied to double-lined spectroscopic binaries.\n\n### Analysis of the Systems\nFor a binary star system where both sets of spectral lines are visible (a double-lined spectroscopic binary), the total mass of the system (the sum of the masses of the two stars, M_total = M₁ + M₂) is related to the orbital period (P) and the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K₁ and K₂).\n\nThe formula for the total mass is:\n\nM_total = [P * (K₁ + K₂)³] / [2πG * sin³(i)]\n\nWhere:\n*   **P** is the orbital period.\n*   **K₁** and **K₂** are the amplitudes of the radial velocity curves for each star.\n*   **G** is the gravitational constant.\n*   **i** is the inclination of the orbital plane to our line of sight.\n\nA critical piece of information given is that both systems exhibit eclipses. For eclipses to occur, the orbital plane must be aligned with our line of sight, meaning the inclination angle *i* is approximately 90°. In this case, sin(i) ≈ 1, and therefore sin³(i) ≈ 1.
