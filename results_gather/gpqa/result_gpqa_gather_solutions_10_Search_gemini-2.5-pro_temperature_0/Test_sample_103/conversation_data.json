The observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) along our line of sight. The maximum wavelength shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve, denoted as K.\n    Therefore, K is proportional to Δλ_max.\n    We can write the ratio for the two systems:\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 mÅ / 7 mÅ = 5/7\n\n2.  **The Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude (K) Formula:**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n    K = (M_p / M_star) * v_p * sin(i)\n    where M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, v_p is the planet's orbital speed, and 'i' is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n3.  **Relate Planet's Velocity to Orbital Period:**\n    The planet's orbital speed (v_p) is the circumference of its orbit divided by the orbital period (P):\n    v_p = 2πa / P\n    where 'a' is the semi-major axis of the orbit.\n\n4.  **Use Kepler's Third Law:**\n    Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period (P) and the semi-major axis (a):\n    P² = (4π² / (G * (M_star + M_p))) * a³\n    Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (M_p << M_star), we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.\n    P² ≈ (4π² / (G * M_star)) * a³\n    We can rearrange this to solve for 'a':\n    a³ ≈ (G * M_star * P²) / 4π²\n    a ≈ (G * M_star / 4π²)^(1/3) * P^(2/3)\n\n5.  **Combine the Equations:**\n    Now, substitute the expressions for v_p and 'a' back into the formula for K:\n    K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * (2πa / P) * sin(i)\n    K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * (2π / P) * [(G * M_star / 4π²)^(1/3) * P^(2/3)] * sin(i)\n    By combining the constants and simplifying the terms involving M_star and P, we find the proportionality:\n    K ∝ M_p * M_star^(-2/3) * P^(-1/3) * sin(i)\n\n6.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions:**\n    The problem states that the stars have the same mass (M_star1 = M_star2) and the planets have similar masses (M_p1 ≈ M_p2). For a unique solution to exist, we must also assume the orbital inclinations are the same (sin(i₁) = sin(i₂)). With these conditions, all terms in the proportionality are constant for both systems except for K and P.\n    Therefore, the relationship simplifies to:\n    K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n7.  **Solve for the Period Ratio:**\n    We can now write a ratio for the two systems:\n    K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n    We know K₁ / K₂ = 5/7. So:\n    5/7 = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n    To find the ratio of the periods (P₂ / P₁), we cube both sides of the equation:\n    P₂ / P₁ = (5/7)³\n    P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\n    P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):**\n    The Doppler effect for light relates the change in wavelength (Δλ) to the radial velocity (v_r) of the source:\n    Δλ / λ₀ = v_r / c\n    where λ₀ is the rest wavelength and c is the speed of light.\n\n    This means that the amplitude of the periodic wavelength shift (Δλ_max) is directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity variation (K).\n    K ∝ Δλ_max\n\n    For the two planets, we have:\n    *   K₁ ∝ Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom\n    *   K₂ ∝ Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom\n\n    The ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes is therefore:\n    K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit detected via the radial velocity method, the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity (K) is given by the formula:\n    K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i)) / (M_star + mₚ)^(2/3)\n\n    Let's analyze the terms based on the information provided:\n    *   **G** is the gravitational constant.\n    *   **P** is the orbital period we need to relate.\n    *   **mₚ** is the planet's mass. The problem states both planets have masses \"similar to that of Neptune.\" In the context of RV measurements, this typically refers to the minimum mass, mₚ sin(i). We will assume (mₚ sin(i)) is the same for both systems.\n    *   **i** is the orbital inclination. As mentioned above, it's part of the mₚ sin(i) term.\n    *   **M_star** is the star's mass. The problem states the two stars have \"exactly the same masses.\"\n    *   The term (M_star + mₚ) can be approximated as M_star, since the mass of a Sun-like star is much greater than the mass of a Neptune-like planet.\n\n    Since M_star and mₚ sin(i) are the same for both systems, all parts of the equation are constant except for K and P. This gives us the proportionality:\n    K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods:**\n    We can rearrange the proportionality to solve for the period, P:\n    If K ∝ P^(-1/3), then K³ ∝ P⁻¹, which means P ∝ K⁻³.\n\n    Now we can find the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 (P₂) to that of planet #1 (P₁):\n    P₂ / P₁ = (K₂ / K₁)⁻³ = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\n    Using the ratio of the radial velocities we found in step 1:\n    P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\n\n    Calculating the final value:\n    P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity (K):** The Doppler effect tells us that the observed shift in a spectral line's wavelength (Δλ) is directly proportional to the radial velocity of the source (the star, in this case). Therefore, the amplitude of the velocity variation, known as the RV semi-amplitude (K), is proportional to the amplitude of the wavelength shift.\n    *   `K ∝ Δλ`\n    *   This means the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts: `K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁`.\n\n2.  **Relate Stellar Velocity (K) to Orbital Period (T):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude (K) of its host star is given by a formula derived from Kepler's and Newton's laws. The key relationship for our problem is:\n    *   `K ∝ 1 / T^(1/3)`\n    *   This relationship holds true because the problem states that the masses of the stars are identical (`M_star1 = M_star2`) and the masses of the planets are similar (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`). We also assume the orbital inclinations are comparable for this analysis.\n    *   From this proportionality, we can write the ratio: `K₂ / K₁ = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)`.\n\n3.  **Combine and Solve for the Period Ratio (T₂ / T₁):** We now have two different expressions for the same ratio, `K₂ / K₁`. We can set them equal to each other:\n    *   `Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)`\n    *   To solve for our target ratio, `T₂ / T₁`, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n    *   `(Δλ₂ / Δλ₁)^3 = T₁ / T₂`\n    *   Finally, we take the reciprocal of both sides to get the desired ratio:\n    *   `T₂ / T₁ = (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)^3`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Value:** We will now plug the given values into the formula and calculate the result.\n    *   `Δλ₁ = 5` miliangstrom\n    *   `Δλ₂ = 7` miliangstrom\n\n```python\n# Given values from the problem\ndelta_lambda_1 = 5  # Wavelength shift for planet #1 in miliangstrom\ndelta_lambda_2 = 7  # Wavelength shift for planet #2 in miliangstrom\n\n# The ratio of the orbital periods (T2 / T1) is related to the ratio of the\n# wavelength shifts (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2) to the power of 3.\n# T2 / T1 = (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2)^3\nperiod_ratio = (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2) ** 3\n\n# The available choices\nchoices = {\n    \"A\": 0.85,\n    \"B\": 1.40,\n    \"C\": 0.36,\n    \"D\": 1.96\n}\n\n# Print the calculated result and the choices\nprint(f\"The calculated ratio of the orbital periods (T2 / T1) is: {period_ratio:.2f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this to the given options:\")\nprint(f\"A) ~ {choices['A']}\")\nprint(f\"B) ~ {choices['B']}\")\nprint(f\"C) ~ {choices['C']}\")\nprint(f\"D) ~ {choices['D']}\")\n\n# Determine the closest choice\nclosest_choice = min(choices, key=lambda k: abs(choices[k] - period_ratio))\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to option {closest_choice}.\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The calculated ratio of the orbital periods (T2 / T1) is: 0.36\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.85\nB) ~ 1.4\nC) ~ 0.36\nD) ~ 1.96\n\nThe calculated value is closest to option C.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K)**\n    The Radial Velocity (RV) method relies on the Doppler effect. The shift in the wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) of a spectral line is directly proportional to the radial velocity ($v_r$) of the star along our line of sight. The formula is:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$\n    where $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n    The problem gives the *maximum* periodic shift, which corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star. This maximum velocity is the amplitude of the RV curve, denoted as $K$.\n    *   For planet #1, the maximum shift is $\\Delta\\lambda_{max,1} = 5$ miliangstrom.\n    *   For planet #2, the maximum shift is $\\Delta\\lambda_{max,2} = 7$ miliangstrom.\n\n    Since $K$ is directly proportional to $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, we can find the ratio of the RV amplitudes for the two stars:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max,2}}{\\Delta\\lambda_{max,1}} = \\frac{7 \\text{ mÅ}}{5 \\text{ mÅ}} = 1.4$\n\n2.  **Relate RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Parameters**\n    For a planet of mass $m_p$ orbiting a star of mass $M_*$ in a circular orbit with period $P$, the RV amplitude $K$ is given by:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_*^{2/3}}$\n    where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $i$ is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight.\n\n3.  **Apply the Given Conditions and Assumptions**\n    The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{*,1} = M_{*,2}$.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: $m_{p,1} = m_{p,2}$.\n    *   The problem does not mention the orbital inclinations. A standard and necessary assumption in such problems is that the viewing conditions are comparable, meaning the inclinations are the same: $\\sin(i_1) = \\sin(i_2)$.\n\n    With these parameters being constant for both systems, the formula simplifies to a direct relationship between $K$ and $P$:\n    $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n4.  **Formulate the Ratio of the Periods**\n    From the relationship $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$, we can write:\n    $K \\cdot P^{1/3} = \\text{constant}$\n\n    Applying this to our two systems:\n    $K_1 \\cdot P_1^{1/3} = K_2 \\cdot P_2^{1/3}$\n\n    We want to find the ratio $P_2 / P_1$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    $\\frac{P_2^{1/3}}{P_1^{1/3}} = \\frac{K_1}{K_2}$\n    $\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} = \\frac{K_1}{K_2}$\n\n    To solve for $P_2 / P_1$, we cube both sides of the equation:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value**\n    We already found that $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$. Therefore, the inverse ratio is $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n\n    Now, substitute this value into our equation for the period ratio:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\approx 0.3644$\n\n    This value is approximately 0.36.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Proportionality:** The core of the problem is understanding that the maximum wavelength shift is directly proportional to the RV amplitude $K$.\n*   **Key Formula:** The relationship $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$ is crucial. It is derived by combining the definition of the star's velocity due to its planet with Kepler's Third Law.\n*   **Assumptions:** The solution relies on the stated conditions (equal star and planet masses) and the implicit assumption that the orbital inclinations are the same for both systems.\n*   **Inverse Relationship:** A larger RV amplitude ($K$) implies a stronger gravitational pull at a closer distance, which means a shorter orbital period ($P$). Since planet #2 induces a larger shift ($K_2 > K_1$), its period must be shorter ($P_2 < P_1$), so the ratio $P_2/P_1$ must be less than 1. This provides a quick sanity check of the result.\n*   **Exponents:** It is easy to make a mistake with the exponents. The final ratio is cubed, not taken to the power of 1/3 or -1/3. The ratio of periods is $(K_1/K_2)^3$, not $(K_2/K_1)^3$.\n\nThe calculated ratio of ~0.36 matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method\n\nThe radial velocity method detects exoplanets by observing the \"wobble\" of their host star. A planet's gravitational pull causes its star to move in a small orbit around their common center of mass. This movement causes a periodic shift in the star's spectral lines due to the Doppler effect. When the star moves towards us, its light is blueshifted; when it moves away, it is redshifted. The maximum velocity of this wobble along our line of sight is called the radial velocity semi-amplitude, denoted as K.\n\n### 2. Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity\n\nThe observed periodic shift in the wavelength of a spectral line (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r). The maximum wavelength shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K).\n\nGiven:\n*   Maximum wavelength shift for star 1 (Δλ₁): 5 milliangstroms\n*   Maximum wavelength shift for star 2 (Δλ₂): 7 milliangstroms\n\nSince K is proportional to Δλ_max, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is:\nK₂ / K₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n### 3. Use the Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude Formula\n\nThe formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit (eccentricity e=0) is:\n\nK = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3))\n\nWhere:\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   m_p is the planet's mass.\n*   M_star is the star's mass.\n*   i is the inclination of the orbit.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n### 4. Simplify the Formula Based on the Given Information\n\nThe problem provides the following key details:\n*   The stars have the same mass: M_star1 = M_star2.\n*   The planets have similar masses, like Neptune: m_p1 ≈ m_p2.\n*   The orbits are circular: e=0.\n\nThe term m_p * sin(i) represents the \"minimum mass\" that can be measured by the RV method, as the inclination 'i' is often unknown. The problem states the *planets'* masses are similar, which implies we can assume the term (m_p * sin(i)) is constant for both systems.\n\nWith these simplifications, most terms in the formula become constant for both planets. The relationship between K and P simplifies to:\n\nK ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n### 5. Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods\n\nWe can set up a ratio for the two systems:\n\nK₂ / K₁ = (P₂)^(-1/3) / (P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nNow, we can solve for the ratio of the periods (P₂ / P₁):\n\nP₁ / P₂ = (K₂ / K₁)^3\n\nWe want to find how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁.\n\nP₂ / P₁ = 1 / (K₂ / K₁)^3 = (K₁ / K₂)^3\n\nSubstitute the known values:\n\nP₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)^3\n\nP₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\n\nP₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis result indicates that the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.36\nB) ~ 1.96\nC) ~ 1.40\nD) ~ 0.85\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe search results confirm the physics and formulas I used.\n\nSpecifically, result provides the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for circular orbits (e=0):\nK = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin(i)) / (M_star + M_p)^(2/3)\n\nThe problem states M_p is similar to Neptune and M_star is similar to the Sun. M_Neptune is about 17 times M_Earth, and M_Sun is about 333,000 times M_Earth. So, M_p << M_star, and the approximation (M_star + M_p) ≈ M_star is valid.\n\nThe formula becomes:\nK ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)\n\nThis confirms that K is proportional to P^(-1/3), assuming all other factors are constant between the two systems.\n\nThe problem states:\n- M_star1 = M_star2 (given)\n- m_p1 ≈ m_p2 (given as \"similar masses\")\n- The RV method measures M_p * sin(i), so the most reasonable interpretation is that M_p1*sin(i1) ≈ M_p2*sin(i2).\n\nThe wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the radial velocity (K).\n\nTherefore, the logic holds:\n1.  K is proportional to Δλ.\n    K2 / K1 = Δλ2 / Δλ1 = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n2.  K is proportional to P^(-1/3).\n    K2 / K1 = (P2 / P1)^(-1/3) = (P1 / P2)^(1/3)\n3.  Equating the two expressions for K2 / K1:\n    1.4 = (P1 / P2)^(1/3)\n4.  Solving for P2 / P1:\n    (1.4)³ = P1 / P2\n    2.744 = P1 / P2\n    P2 / P1 = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThe result is robust. The answer is approximately 0.36.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) ~ 0.85\nB) ~ 1.96\nC) ~ 0.36\nD) ~ 1.40\n\nMy calculated value matches option C.\n\nThe problem is a straightforward application of the radial velocity formula, requiring careful algebraic manipulation. The key is to correctly identify the relationship K ∝ P^(-1/3) and to make the standard assumption that \"similar masses\" in an RV context refers to the observable quantity `m_p * sin(i)`.\n\nThe calculation is complete and verified. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\n### Final Answer Formulation\n\n1.  **State the relationship between wavelength shift and radial velocity amplitude.** The amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is directly proportional to the observed periodic wavelength shift (Δλ).\n2.  **Calculate the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes.** K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7/5 = 1.4.\n3.  **State the formula for the radial velocity amplitude.** For a planet in a circular orbit, K is proportional to M_p*sin(i) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3)).\n4.  **Apply the given conditions.** The stars have the same mass (M₁ = M₂), and the planets have similar masses (implying m_p₁*sin(i₁) ≈ m_p₂*sin(i₂)).\n5.  **Simplify the relationship.** Under these conditions, K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3).\n6.  **Set up the equation.** K₂ / K₁ = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3).\n7.  **Solve for the period ratio.**\n    1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n    (1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n    2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n    P₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644.\n8.  **Compare with the options.** The calculated value of ~0.36 matches option C.\n\nThe reasoning is sound. I will now write the final response.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to relate the observed periodic wavelength shift to the orbital period of the exoplanet using the principles of the Radial Velocity (RV) method.\n\n1.  **Relating Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:** The periodic shift in the spectral line's wavelength (Δλ) is caused by the Doppler effect due to the star's motion along our line of sight. This motion is induced by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. The amplitude of the star's radial velocity (denoted as K) is directly proportional to the amplitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ_max).\n    Therefore, the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars is equal to the ratio of their maximum wavelength shifts:\n    K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 1.4\n\n2.  **The Radial Velocity Formula:** The semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) for a star with an orbiting planet is given by the formula:\n    K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))\n    This formula applies under the given conditions: circular orbits (eccentricity e=0) and a planet mass (m_p) much smaller than the star's mass (M_star). Here, P is the orbital period, G is the gravitational constant, m_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, and i is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Applying the Given Information:** We are given that:\n    *   The stars have identical masses: M_star₁ = M_star₂.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: m_p₁ ≈ m_p₂. In the context of the RV method, the measured quantity is the minimum mass, m_p * sin(i). The problem's phrasing implies that this value is similar for both planets, so we can assume m_p₁ * sin(i₁) ≈ m_p₂ * sin(i₂).\n\n4.  **Finding the Relationship between K and P:** Since M_star and m_p * sin(i) are the same for both systems, the formula simplifies to show that the radial velocity amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period P:\n    K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\n5.  **Calculating the Period Ratio:** We can now set up a ratio for the two systems:\n    K₂ / K₁ = (P₂ / P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    We already calculated that K₂ / K₁ = 1.4. Substituting this value:\n    1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To find the ratio of the periods, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n    (1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n    2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\n    The question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁. We find this by taking the reciprocal:\n    P₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36. Comparing this to the given options, it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method:** The RV method detects exoplanets by observing the gravitational pull they exert on their host star. This pull causes the star to \"wobble,\" moving towards and away from us. This movement induces a periodic Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity:** The observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) along our line of sight.

This means the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (mₚ << Mₛ). Therefore, we can approximate (Mₛ + mₚ) ≈ Mₛ. With Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂, this term cancels out.\n    *   The planets were detected using the RV method and both have \"masses similar to that of Neptune\".

This wobble causes a periodic shift in the star's spectral lines.\n\nThe magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is related to the star's radial velocity (v_r) by the Doppler formula:\nΔλ / λ = v_r / c\nwhere λ is the rest wavelength and c is the speed of light.\n\nThe amplitude of the periodic wavelength shift (Δλ_max), which is what is given in the problem, corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity curve (K, also known as the RV semi-amplitude).\nΔλ_max / λ = K / c\nSince λ and c are constants, the RV amplitude is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift:\nK ∝ Δλ_max\n\n**2. Relate RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P)**\n\nThe formula for the RV semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is:\nK = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin(i)) / (M_s + M_p)^(2/3)\nwhere:\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n*   M_p is the mass of the planet.\n*   M_s is the mass of the star.\n*   i is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n**3. Apply the Given Information**\n\nWe are given that for the two systems:\n*   The star masses are the same: M_s1 = M_s2 = M_s.\n*   The planet masses are the same: M_p1 = M_p2 = M_p.\n*   The problem does not specify the inclinations. For the problem to be solvable, we must assume the inclinations are the same (i₁ = i₂), which is a common assumption in such problems unless stated otherwise.\n\nWith M_s, M_p, and sin(i) being the same for both systems, all terms in the formula for K are constant except for the period, P. Therefore, we can establish a simple proportionality:\nK ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\nThis means that a larger RV amplitude (a faster wobble) corresponds to a shorter orbital period.\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of the Periods**\n\nLet K₁ and P₁ be the RV amplitude and period for planet #1, and K₂ and P₂ be for planet #2. From the proportionality K ∝ P^(-1/3), we can write:\nK₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n\nWe need to solve for the ratio P₂ / P₁. Let's cube both sides of the equation:\n(K₁ / K₂)^3 = P₂ / P₁\n\nNow, we can substitute the values for K, using the fact that K ∝ Δλ_max:\n*   K₁ ∝ Δλ_max_1 = 5 miliangstrom\n*   K₂ ∝ Δλ_max_2 = 7 miliangstrom\n\nSo, the ratio K₁ / K₂ is 5 / 7.\nP₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)^3\nP₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\nP₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\n**5.

This means the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1 (i.e., it is shorter).\n\nComparing our result with the options provided:\nA) ~ 1.40\nB) ~ 0.85\nC) ~ 1.96\nD) ~ 0.36\n\nOur calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nThe search results confirm the physics I used. Specifically, they reiterate the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K), the orbital period (P), the stellar mass (M_star), the planet mass (M_p), and the orbital inclination (i).\n\nThe formula I used is consistent with the information in the search results:\nK ∝ (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3))\n\nThe steps I followed were:\n1.  **Relate wavelength shift to RV semi-amplitude (K):** The Doppler shift is Δλ / λ₀ = v_r / c. Therefore, the maximum wavelength shift (the observable) is directly proportional to the RV semi-amplitude K.\n    *   K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7.\n\n2.  **Use the formula for K:**\n    K = ( (2πG)^(1/3) * m_p * sin(i) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )\n\n3.  **Analyze the ratio K₁ / K₂:**\n    K₁ / K₂ = [ (m_p1 * sin(i₁)) / (M_star1^(2/3) * P₁^(1/3)) ] / [ (m_p2 * sin(i₂)) / (M_star2^(2/3) * P₂^(1/3)) ]\n\n4.  **Apply the given conditions:**\n    *   M_star1 = M_star2 (same star masses)\n    *   m_p1 ≈ m_p2 (similar planet masses)\n    *   Assume sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂) as is standard when no information is provided.\n\n5.  **Simplify the ratio:** With these assumptions, the mass and inclination terms cancel out, leaving:\n    K₁ / K₂ = P₂^(1/3) / P₁^(1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n\n6.  **Solve for the period ratio (P₂ / P₁):**\n    *   5 / 7 = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThe calculation is straightforward and the underlying physics is sound and confirmed by the search results. The key is to correctly identify the relationship K ∝ P^(-1/3) under the given conditions. The result robustly points to option C.\n\nFinal check of the question: \"How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\" This asks for the ratio P₂ / P₁. My result is P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.36.\n\nThe logic is confirmed. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\nThe periodic wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's maximum radial velocity (K), so K ∝ Δλ.\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the orbital period (P), star mass (Mₛ), and planet mass (mₚ) by the formula:\nK ∝ (mₚ sin i) / (Mₛ²/³ * P¹/³)\nwhere *i* is the orbital inclination.\n\nWe are given:\n*   Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂ (stars have the same mass)\n*   mₚ₁ ≈ mₚ₂ (planets have similar masses)\n*   Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ\n*   Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ\n\nSince no information is given about the orbital inclinations, we assume they are similar (sin i₁ ≈ sin i₂). This is a standard assumption in such problems unless stated otherwise.\n\nUnder these conditions, the terms for planet mass, star mass, and inclination are approximately the same for both systems. The relationship simplifies to:\nK ∝ 1 / P¹/³\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes for the two systems is:\nK₂ / K₁ = (P₂/P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁/P₂)^(1/3)\n\nSince K is proportional to Δλ:\nK₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\nNow, we set the two expressions for the ratio K₂ / K₁ equal to each other:\n(P₁/P₂)^(1/3) = 1.4\n\nTo find the required ratio P₂/P₁, we first solve for P₁/P₂:\nP₁/P₂ = (1.4)³ = 1.4 * 1.4 * 1.4 = 2.744\n\nFinally, we find the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1:\nP₂/P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method. The key relationship is between the observed periodic wavelength shift (Δλ) and the properties of the star-planet system.\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Velocity:** The amplitude of the periodic wavelength shift (let's call it Kλ) is directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity (usually denoted as K). So, `Kλ ∝ K`.\n3.  **Relate Velocity to Orbital Period:** For a circular orbit, the star's velocity amplitude `K` is related to the planet's mass (`m_p`), star's mass (`M_star`), and orbital period (`P`) by the formula: `K ∝ m_p / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3))`.\n4.  **Simplify the Relationship:** The problem states that the star masses are identical (`M_star1 = M_star2`) and the planet masses are similar (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`). We can also assume the unstated orbital inclinations are the same. Therefore, the relationship simplifies to `K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)`.\n5.  **Combine the Proportions:** Since `Kλ ∝ K` and `K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)`, it follows that `Kλ ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)`.\n6.  **Formulate an Equation:** This proportionality means that the product `Kλ * P^(1/3)` is constant for both systems. So, `Kλ1 * P1^(1/3) = Kλ2 * P2^(1/3)`.\n7.  **Solve for the Period Ratio:** We need to find `P2 / P1`. Rearranging the equation:\n    *   `P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3) = Kλ1 / Kλ2`\n    *   `(P2 / P1)^(1/3) = Kλ1 / Kλ2`\n    *   `P2 / P1 = (Kλ1 / Kλ2)^3`\n8.  **Calculate the Result:** I will plug in the given values (`Kλ1 = 5` miliangstrom, `Kλ2 = 7` miliangstrom) into this final formula and calculate the ratio.

As the star \"wobbles\" due to the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet, the light we receive from it is alternately blueshifted (moving towards us) and redshifted (moving away). The magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) along our line of sight, according to the Doppler formula: Δλ/λ₀ = v_r/c. The problem gives the *amplitude* of this periodic shift, which corresponds to the *amplitude* of the star's radial velocity, often denoted as K.\n    *   Therefore, K is directly proportional to Δλ_max.\n    *   K ∝ Δλ_max\n\n2.  **Relate the Observed Shifts to Stellar Velocities:**\n    *   For Planet #1, Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom.\n    *   For Planet #2, Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom.\n    *   The ratio of the stellar velocity amplitudes is equal to the ratio of their maximum wavelength shifts.\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4.\n\n3.  **Relate Stellar Velocity (K) to the System's Physical Properties:**\n    *   In a two-body system, the star and planet orbit a common center of mass. By conservation of momentum: M_star * v_star = m_planet * v_planet.\n    *   The amplitude of the star's velocity is K = v_star (assuming we are viewing the orbit edge-on for maximum effect, a standard simplifying assumption when inclination is not given).\n    *   So, K = (m_planet / M_star) * v_planet.\n    *   For a circular orbit, the planet's velocity v_planet is related to the gravitational force: G * M_star * m_planet / a² = m_planet * v_planet² / a, where 'a' is the orbital radius.\n    *   This simplifies to v_planet = sqrt(G * M_star / a).\n    *   Substituting this into the equation for K: K = (m_planet / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = (m_planet * sqrt(G)) / (sqrt(M_star) * sqrt(a)).\n    *   This shows that for given masses, K is proportional to 1/sqrt(a).\n    *   K ∝ 1 / sqrt(a).\n\n4.  **Incorporate Kepler's Third Law:**\n    *   Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period (T) to the semi-major axis (a). For a planet much less massive than its star (m_planet << M_star), the law is: T² ∝ a³.\n    *   From this, we can find the relationship between 'a' and 'T': a ∝ T^(2/3).\n\n5.  **Establish the Final Relationship between Stellar Velocity (K) and Period (T):**\n    *   We have two proportionalities: K ∝ 1/sqrt(a) and a ∝ T^(2/3).\n    *   We can substitute the second into the first: K ∝ 1 / sqrt(T^(2/3)).\n    *   Simplifying the exponent: K ∝ 1 / T^((2/3) * (1/2)) = 1 / T^(1/3).\n    *   So, the stellar velocity amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the planet's orbital period (K ∝ T^(-1/3)).\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods:**\n    *   We can write the relationship from the previous step as a ratio for our two systems: K₂ / K₁ = (T₂ / T₁)^(-1/3).\n    *   This is the same as: K₂ / K₁ = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3).\n    *   We already calculated K₂ / K₁ = 1.4.\n    *   So, 1.4 = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3).\n    *   To find the ratio T₁ / T₂, we must cube both sides of the equation:\n    *   T₁ / T₂ = (1.4)³ = 1.4 * 1.4 * 1.4 = 1.96 * 1.4 = 2.744.\n    *   The question asks for \"How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\", which is the ratio T₂ / T₁.\n    *   T₂ / T₁ = 1 / (T₁ / T₂) = 1 / 2.744.\n    *   T₂ / T₁ ≈ 0.3644.\n\n7.  **Match with the given options:**\n    *   The calculated value of ~0.36 corresponds to option B.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   The given wavelength shifts (5 mÅ and 7 mÅ) are the *amplitudes* of the periodic shift, which directly relate to the *amplitudes* of the star's radial velocity (K).\n*   The problem simplifies the situation by stating the stars have identical masses, the planets have similar masses, and the orbits are circular. This allows us to cancel out these terms when forming a ratio.\n*   We must assume the orbital inclinations are the same for both systems to directly compare the velocity amplitudes.\n*   The final derivation shows that a larger stellar wobble (larger K or Δλ) implies a *shorter* orbital period. This makes sense: for a planet of the same mass, being closer to the star (shorter period) means it has a higher orbital velocity and exerts a stronger, faster tug on the star, causing a larger stellar velocity.\n*   Be careful not to mix up the ratios. The question asks for T₂ / T₁, so after finding T₁ / T₂ = 2.744, we must take the reciprocal.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nThe calculation is correct. The ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 is approximately 0.36.\n\nHere is a summary of the logic:\n\n1.  The amplitude of the star's radial velocity ($K$) is directly proportional to the observed periodic wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). Therefore, the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes is $K_2/K_1 = \\Delta\\lambda_2 / \\Delta\\lambda_1 = 7/5$.\n2.  For a given star mass and planet mass, the radial velocity amplitude $K$ is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period ($P$). This can be written as $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$.\n3.  Therefore, the ratio of the velocities is related to the ratio of the periods as follows: $K_2/K_1 = (P_2/P_1)^{-1/3} = (P_1/P_2)^{1/3}$.\n4.  Combining these two relationships, we get: $7/5 = (P_1/P_2)^{1/3}$.\n5.  To find the desired ratio, $P_2/P_1$, we solve the equation: $P_2/P_1 = (5/7)^3$.\n6.  The calculation yields $(5/7)^3 \\approx 0.3644$, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nTo determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we need to analyze the relationship between the observed Doppler shift and the planet's orbital period.\n\n### Key Principles of the Radial Velocity Method\nThe radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. This shift is caused by the star's \"wobble\" as it's pulled by the orbiting planet's gravity. The magnitude of this wobble, and thus the Doppler shift, is related to the properties of the planet and its orbit.\n\nThe key physical quantities are:\n*   **Wavelength Shift (Δλ):** This is the observed change in the wavelength of a spectral line. It is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (the component of its velocity along our line of sight).\n*   **Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):** This is the maximum speed of the star's wobble towards or away from us. K is directly proportional to the maximum observed wavelength shift (Δλ_max).\n*   **Orbital Period (P):** This is the time the planet takes to complete one orbit.\n\n### The Relationship Between Radial Velocity and Orbital Period\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity amplitude (K) is related to the orbital period (P), the star's mass (M_star), and the planet's mass (m_p) by the following proportionality:\n*K ∝ m_p / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3))*\n\nThis relationship shows that for a given star and planet mass, the radial velocity amplitude (K) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period (P).\n\n### Applying the Principles to the Problem\n\n1.  **Information Given:**\n    *   The two stars have identical masses (M_star1 = M_star2).\n    *   The two planets have similar masses (m_p1 ≈ m_p2).\n    *   The orbits are circular.\n    *   The wavelength shift for planet #1 is Δλ₁ = 5 milliangstroms.\n    *   The wavelength shift for planet #2 is Δλ₂ = 7 milliangstroms.\n\n2.  **Relating Shift to Velocity:**\n    Since the radial velocity amplitude (K) is proportional to the wavelength shift (Δλ), the ratio of the amplitudes is:\n    K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n3.  **Calculating the Period Ratio:**\n    From the proportionality K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3), we can write the ratio of the amplitudes in terms of the periods:\n    K₂ / K₁ = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    Now, we substitute the known value of the velocity ratio:\n    1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To find the ratio of the periods, we cube both sides of the equation:\n    (1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n    2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\n    The question asks for the ratio of planet #2's period to planet #1's period (P₂ / P₁). We can find this by taking the reciprocal:\n    P₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.364\n\n    This result indicates that the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. A larger radial velocity signal implies a shorter orbital period, which is consistent with our calculation.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) ~ 1.96\nB) ~ 0.36\nC) ~ 0.85\nD) ~ 1.40\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.36 corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method:** The RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The gravitational pull of the planet causes the star to \"wobble\" around the system's center of mass. This wobble changes the star's velocity along our line of sight, causing a shift in its spectral lines.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity:** The observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) according to the Doppler effect formula: Δλ/λ₀ = v_r/c. The maximum observed wavelength shift (given in the problem as 5 and 7 miliangstroms) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is called the radial velocity semi-amplitude, denoted by *K*.\n    Therefore, *K* is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift (Δλ_max).\n    *   For planet #1: K₁ ∝ Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ\n    *   For planet #2: K₂ ∝ Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ\n\n3.  **Find the Ratio of Velocities:** We can find the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes for the two stars:\n    K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n4.  **Relate Stellar Velocity (K) to Orbital Period (T):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude *K* is related to the system's parameters. A simplified and widely used formula, especially when the planet's mass (M_p) is much smaller than the star's mass (M_star), shows that *K* is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period (T):\n    K ∝ 1 / T^(1/3) or K ∝ T^(-1/3)\n\n    This relationship holds true because the problem states that the other key parameters—the mass of the stars (M_star1 = M_star2) and the mass of the planets (M_p1 ≈ M_p2)—are the same for both systems. We also assume the orbital inclinations are comparable.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Periods:** Now we can relate the ratio of velocities to the ratio of periods:\n    K₂ / K₁ = (T₂ / T₁)^(-1/3) = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)\n\n    We already found that K₂ / K₁ = 1.4, so:\n    1.4 = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To solve for the period ratio (T₂ / T₁), we first cube both sides of the equation:\n    (1.4)³ = T₁ / T₂\n    2.744 = T₁ / T₂\n\n    The question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio T₂ / T₁.

The measured quantity is the periodic shift of a spectral line, $\\Delta\\lambda$. This shift is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight. The maximum shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is called the RV semi-amplitude, $K$.

The formula is:\n\n    $K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{T} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{(M_s + m_p)^{2/3}}$\n\n    This formula combines Kepler's Third Law with the principle of momentum conservation for the star-planet system.\n\n3.  **Simplify the Relationship Using the Problem's Conditions:** The problem gives us crucial information that simplifies this relationship:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{s1} = M_{s2}$.\n    *   The planets have the same mass: $m_{p1} = m_{p2}$.\n    *   For a problem with a single solvable answer, we assume other unknown parameters, like the orbital inclination, are also the same: $\\sin(i_1) = \\sin(i_2)$.\n\n    Given these equalities, all the terms in the formula for $K$ are identical for both systems except for the orbital period, $T$. This leaves us with a simple proportionality:\n\n    $K \\propto \\frac{1}{T^{1/3}}$ or $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n\n4.  **Solve for the Ratio of Orbital Periods:** Now we can relate the ratio of the K values to the ratio of the T values:\n\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{T_2^{-1/3}}{T_1^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3}$\n\n    We already calculated $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = 1.4$. Plugging this in:\n\n    $1.4 = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3}$\n\n    To find the ratio of the periods, $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$, we need to isolate it.

The observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_{rad}$) along the line of sight, according to the Doppler effect formula: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_{rad}}{c}$. The maximum wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity, which is the amplitude of the velocity curve, denoted as $K$. Therefore, $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n\n2.  **Ratio of Velocity Amplitudes:** From the problem statement, we are given the maximum wavelength shifts for the two stars:\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms\n    The ratio of the velocity amplitudes is therefore:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n3.  **Relating Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Parameters:** The velocity amplitude ($K$) of a star in a circular orbit can be expressed as:\n    $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_s + M_p} \\sqrt{\\frac{G(M_s + M_p)}{a}}$\n    Where $M_s$ is the star mass, $M_p$ is the planet mass, $i$ is the orbital inclination, $a$ is the semi-major axis, and $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\n    Since the planet mass is much smaller than the star mass ($M_p \\ll M_s$), we can simplify this to:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_s} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_s}{a}}$\n    $K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{M_s \\sqrt{a}}$\n\n4.  **Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period ($P$) to the semi-major axis ($a$):\n    $P^2 \\propto \\frac{a^3}{M_s}$ (again, assuming $M_p \\ll M_s$).\n    This means $a^3 \\propto P^2 M_s$, so $a \\propto (P^2 M_s)^{1/3}$.\n    Substituting this into our expression for $K$:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{M_s \\sqrt{(P^2 M_s)^{1/3}}} = \\frac{M_p}{M_s \\cdot (P^2 M_s)^{1/6}} = \\frac{M_p}{M_s^{1+1/6} \\cdot P^{2/6}} = \\frac{M_p}{M_s^{7/6} \\cdot P^{1/3}}$\n\n5.  **Finding the Period Ratio:** The problem states that the star masses are the same ($M_{s1} = M_{s2}$) and the planet masses are the same ($M_{p1} = M_{p2}$). We also assume the inclinations are statistically similar and cancel out. Therefore, the relationship simplifies to:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$ or $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$.\n\n    We can now write the ratio of the velocity amplitudes in terms of the periods:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    We want to find the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$.

The star \"wobbles\" as the planet orbits it, causing its light to be slightly redshifted as it moves away from us and blueshifted as it moves towards us. The magnitude of this shift is related to the star's radial velocity.\n\n2.  **Relating Wavelength Shift to Velocity Amplitude:** The observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r). The maximum wavelength shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve (K).\n    *   For planet #1, Δλ₁ = 5 milliangstrom.\n    *   For planet #2, Δλ₂ = 7 milliangstrom.\n\n    Since K is directly proportional to Δλ_max, we can find the ratio of the velocity amplitudes:\n    K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n3.  **The Radial Velocity Amplitude Formula:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the stellar velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by the formula:\n    K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * [ mₚ sin(i) / M_★^(2/3) ]\n    Where:\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   mₚ is the planet's mass.\n    *   M_★ is the star's mass.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n    *   i is the orbital inclination.\n\n4.  **Applying the Formula to the Problem:** We are given that the star masses are the same (M_★₁ = M_★₂) and the planet masses are similar (mₚ₁ ≈ mₚ₂). In such problems, it is standard to assume that other unstated parameters, like the orbital inclination (i), are also similar for both systems. With these assumptions, all the terms in the formula except the period (P) are constant for both planets.\n\n    This simplifies the relationship to:\n    K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n5.  **Calculating the Period Ratio:** We can now set up a ratio for the two systems:\n    K₂ / K₁ = (P₂)^(-1/3) / (P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    From step 2, we know that K₂ / K₁ = 1.4. So we can substitute this value into the equation:\n    1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To solve for the ratio of the periods, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n    (1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n    1.4 * 1.4 * 1.4 = 1.96 * 1.4 = 2.744\n    So, P₁ / P₂ = 2.744\n\n6.  **Finding the Final Answer:** The question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which corresponds to the ratio P₂ / P₁.

Thus, we assume m_p1*sin(i1) ≈ m_p2*sin(i2). The middle term becomes approximately 1.\n    *   **Wavelength shifts**: The RV amplitude K is directly proportional to the measured wavelength shift Δλ.

The amplitude of this wavelength shift (e.g., 5 mÅ for planet #1) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, known as K. Therefore, we can establish a ratio of the velocity amplitudes:\n    *   K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7\n\n2.  **The Radial Velocity Formula**: For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by the formula:\n    *   K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / Mₛ^(2/3))\n    where P is the orbital period, mₚ is the planet's mass, Mₛ is the star's mass, i is the orbital inclination, and G is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Relating Period (P) to Velocity Amplitude (K)**: We need to rearrange the formula to see how P depends on K.

Since m_p and M_star are the same for both systems, they cancel out, leaving a direct relationship between K and the orbital period P:\n\nK ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is:\n\nK₂ / K₁ = (P₂)^(-1/3) / (P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n### Calculation\n\nWe can now substitute the known ratio of K₂/K₁ into the equation:\n\n1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nTo solve for the ratio of the periods, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n\n(1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 (P₂ / P₁). To find this, we take the reciprocal:\n\nP₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis result indicates that the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This makes physical sense, as a larger stellar wobble (and thus a larger wavelength shift) is caused by a planet that is closer to its star and therefore has a shorter orbital period.\n\nBased on the calculation, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate the Observable to the Star's Velocity:**\n    The Radial Velocity (RV) method measures the periodic Doppler shift of spectral lines from a star. The wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (V_r) along our line of sight:\n    Δλ / λ₀ = V_r / c\n    where λ₀ is the rest wavelength and c is the speed of light.\n\n    The problem gives the amplitude of the periodic wavelength shift for each system. This amplitude corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, known as the RV semi-amplitude, K.\n    Therefore, the RV semi-amplitude K is directly proportional to the measured wavelength shift amplitude Δλ.\n    K ∝ Δλ\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ratio of RV Semi-Amplitudes:**\n    For Planet #1, the shift amplitude is Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ.\n    For Planet #2, the shift amplitude is Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ.\n\n    The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n    K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n3.  **Find the Physical Relationship between K and Orbital Period P:**\n    The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K of a star hosting a planet in a circular orbit (eccentricity e=0) is given by:\n    K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin(i)) / (M_star + M_p)^(2/3)\n\n    Let's analyze the terms based on the problem statement:\n    *   **P:** The orbital period.

We are told the stars have exactly the same mass (M_star1 = M_star2).\n    *   **i:** The inclination of the orbit. We are not given this, but since it is not mentioned, we assume the viewing conditions (sin(i)) are comparable for both systems.\n    *   **G:** The gravitational constant, which is a constant.\n    *   Since the stars are Sun-like and the planets are Neptune-like, M_star >> M_p, so the term (M_star + M_p) ≈ M_star.\n\n    Since M_star, M_p, and sin(i) are treated as being the same for both systems, we can see that K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period P:\n    K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3) or K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n4.  **Solve for the Ratio of the Periods:**\n    We can write the relationship between the two systems as:\n    K₂ / K₁ = (P₂)^(-1/3) / (P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    Now, substitute the value for the ratio of the K's we found in step 2:\n    1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To find the ratio of the periods, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n    (1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n    2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\n    The question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁.

This means the maximum radial velocity of the star (the amplitude, K) is directly proportional to the maximum observed wavelength shift (Δλ_max).\n    *   K ∝ Δλ_max\n\n2.  **Radial Velocity Amplitude (K)**: The amplitude of the star's radial velocity, for a circular orbit (eccentricity e=0), is given by an expression that relates the planet's mass (m_p), the star's mass (M_star), the orbital period (P), and the inclination of the orbit (i). The formula for K, the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity, simplifies to:\n    *   K = (m_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3)) * (2πG / P)^(1/3)\n\nNow, I'll re-apply the logic from the scratchpad with the confirmed formulas.\n\n**Given Information:**\n*   Star masses are equal: M_star1 = M_star2\n*   Planet masses are similar: m_p1 ≈ m_p2\n*   Orbits are circular: e₁ = e₂ = 0\n*   Maximum wavelength shift for planet #1: Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ\n*   Maximum wavelength shift for planet #2: Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ\n*   We need to find the ratio of the periods: P₂ / P₁\n\n**Step 1: Relate wavelength shift to velocity amplitude (K).**\nSince K ∝ Δλ_max, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is:\nK₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n**Step 2: Use the formula for K to relate it to the orbital period.**\nK = (m_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3)) * (2πG / P)^(1/3)\n\nLet's write the ratio K₂ / K₁:\nK₂ / K₁ = [ (m_p2*sin(i₂)/M_star2^(2/3)) * (2πG/P₂)^(1/3) ] / [ (m_p1*sin(i₁)/M_star1^(2/3)) * (2πG/P₁)^(1/3) ]\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the ratio using the given information.**\n*   M_star1 = M_star2, so the M_star terms cancel.\n*   m_p1 ≈ m_p2, so the m_p terms cancel.\n*   The problem does not specify the inclination `i`. The RV method measures `m_p * sin(i)`. When it says the planets have similar masses, it is reasonable to assume the measured `m_p * sin(i)` values are what is being referred to as similar, or that `sin(i)` is assumed to be the same for both. Under this standard assumption for such a problem, the `m_p * sin(i)` terms cancel.\n*   2πG is a constant and cancels out.\n\nThe simplified ratio becomes:\nK₂ / K₁ = (1/P₂)^(1/3) / (1/P₁)^(1/3)\nK₂ / K₁ = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n**Step 4: Solve for the period ratio (P₂ / P₁).**\nWe know K₂ / K₁ = 1.4.\n1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nCube both sides of the equation:\n1.4³ = P₁ / P₂\n2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\nRearrange to find the required ratio, P₂ / P₁:\nP₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744\n\nNow, calculate the final value:\nP₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is very close to 0.36.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.

The periodic shift in a star's spectral line (Doppler shift) is caused by the star \"wobbling\" due to the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet.\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:** The magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r). Therefore, the amplitude of the wavelength shift is proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity (which is called the RV semi-amplitude, K).\n    *   `K ∝ Δλ`\n    *   This means `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`.\n3.  **Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Period:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude (K) is related to the orbital period (T), the star's mass (M_star), and the planet's mass (m_p) by the formula:\n    *   `K ∝ m_p / (M_star^(2/3) * T^(1/3))`\n4.  **Simplify the Relation:** The problem states that the masses of the two stars are identical (`M_star1 = M_star2`) and the masses of the two planets are similar (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`). Therefore, the terms for the masses cancel out when we take a ratio, and the relationship simplifies to:\n    *   `K ∝ 1 / T^(1/3)`\n5.  **Solve for the Period Ratio (T₂/T₁):** We can rearrange the simplified proportion to solve for T:\n    *   `T^(1/3) ∝ 1 / K`\n    *   `T ∝ 1 / K³`\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the periods is: `T₂ / T₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³`.\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** Substitute the values for the wavelength shifts into the equation.\n    *   `T₂ / T₁ = (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ )³ = (5 / 7)³`\n7.  **Select the Correct Option:** Compare the calculated numerical value with the given choices.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the given wavelength shifts in miliangstroms.\ndelta_lambda_1 = 5  # for planet #1\ndelta_lambda_2 = 7  # for planet #2\n\n# Step 2: The ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K1/K2) is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts.\n# K1/K2 = delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2\nk_ratio = delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2\n\n# Step 3: The orbital period (T) is inversely proportional to the cube of the RV semi-amplitude (K),\n# assuming star and planet masses are constant for both systems.\n# T is proportional to 1 / K^3\n# Therefore, T2 / T1 = K1^3 / K2^3 = (K1 / K2)^3\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1.\nperiod_ratio_T2_over_T1 = k_ratio ** 3\n\n# Step 5: The provided options are:\n# A) ~ 0.85\n# B) ~ 1.40\n# C) ~ 0.36\n# D) ~ 1.96\n\n# The calculated value corresponds to option C.\nprint(f\"The calculated ratio T2/T1 is: {period_ratio_T2_over_T1:.2f}\")\nprint(\"This corresponds to option C.\")\nprint(\"The answer is C\")\n\n<<<C>>>\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: \nErrors:   File \"<stdin>\", line 28\n    <<<C>>>\n    ^^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Physics of the Radial Velocity (RV) Method**\n\nThe Radial Velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the light from a host star. A planet's gravity causes its star to \"wobble\" around their common center of mass. This wobble results in a small, periodic change in the star's velocity along our line of sight (its radial velocity). This change in velocity causes the star's spectral lines to shift back and forth periodically.\n\n*   The relationship between the radial velocity (v_r) and the wavelength shift (Δλ) is given by the Doppler effect formula: Δλ / λ₀ = v_r / c, where λ₀ is the rest wavelength and c is the speed of light.\n*   This means the amplitude of the radial velocity variation, called the RV semi-amplitude (K), is directly proportional to the amplitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ).\n    *   K ∝ Δλ\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Formula for RV Semi-amplitude (K)**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude K of the star is given by:\nK = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin(i)) / (M_star + M_p)^(2/3)\n\nWhere:\n*   P is the orbital period of the planet.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n*   M_p is the mass of the planet.\n*   M_star is the mass of the star.\n*   i is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Formula Using the Information Provided**\n\nThe problem provides several key pieces of information that allow us to simplify the relationship between K and P.\n\n*   **\"Circular orbits\":** This means the eccentricity `e` is 0. The formula used is already for circular orbits.\n*   **\"Stars with exactly the same masses\":** M_star1 = M_star2.\n*   **\"Planets... with masses similar to that of Neptune\":** M_p1 ≈ M_p2.\n*   **\"The stars themselves have masses similar to that of our Sun\":** This confirms that M_star >> M_p (Sun mass >> Neptune mass), so we can approximate (M_star + M_p) ≈ M_star.\n*   **Careful Point (Orbital Inclination `i`):** The problem does not specify the orbital inclination. In such comparative problems, it is standard to assume that the unknown factors are the same for both systems. Therefore, we assume sin(i₁) = sin(i₂).\n\nGiven these simplifications, the terms G, M_p, sin(i), and M_star are all constant when comparing the two systems. Thus, the formula for K simplifies to a proportionality:\n\nK ∝ (1 / P)^(1/3)  or  K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n**Step 4: Combine Proportionalities and Form a Ratio**\n\nWe have two key proportionalities:\n1.  K ∝ Δλ (from Step 1)\n2.  K ∝ P^(-1/3) (from Step 3)\n\nCombining these, we find the relationship between the observed wavelength shift (Δλ) and the orbital period (P):\n\nΔλ ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\nNow we can set up a ratio for the two planet systems:\n\n(Δλ₂ / Δλ₁) = (P₂ / P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n**Step 5: Solve for the Ratio of the Orbital Periods (P₂ / P₁)**\n\nWe need to rearrange the equation to solve for P₂ / P₁.\n\n1.  Start with the ratio: (Δλ₂ / Δλ₁) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n2.  Cube both sides to remove the cube root: (Δλ₂ / Δλ₁)^3 = P₁ / P₂\n3.  Invert both sides to get the desired ratio: P₂ / P₁ = (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)^3\n\n**Step 6: Substitute the Given Values and Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe problem gives us the wavelength shifts:\n*   Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom\n*   Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom\n\nSubstitute these into our final equation:\n\nP₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)^3\nP₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\nP₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.36443\n\nThis result indicates that the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. This makes physical sense: planet #2 causes a larger stellar wobble (larger Δλ and K), which for a similar mass planet implies it must be in a tighter, faster orbit with a shorter period.\n\nComparing our result with the options:\nA) ~ 1.96\nB) ~ 0.36\nC) ~ 1.40\nD) ~ 0.85\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.36 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nThe calculation shows that the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 is approximately 0.364.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.36\nB) ~ 0.85\nC) ~ 1.40\nD) ~ 1.96\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is the step-by-step derivation of the answer:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Radial Velocity (RV) Method\n\nThe radial velocity method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. As the star and planet orbit their common center of mass, the star moves towards and away from us, causing its spectral lines to shift to the blue and red, respectively. The amplitude of this periodic wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K).\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars (K₁ and K₂) is equal to the ratio of their observed maximum wavelength shifts (Δλ₁ and Δλ₂):\n\n*   K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 1.4\n\n### 2. The Radial Velocity Amplitude Formula\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by the formula:\n\nK = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3))\n\nWhere:\n*   `P` is the orbital period of the planet.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `m_p` is the mass of the planet.\n*   `M_star` is the mass of the star.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n\nThis formula shows that the radial velocity amplitude `K` is proportional to the inverse cube root of the orbital period, `P^(-1/3)`.\n\n### 3. Setting up the Ratio\n\nWe can write the equation for each of the two systems:\n\n*   **System 1:** K₁ = C₁ * (1 / P₁)^(1/3)\n*   **System 2:** K₂ = C₂ * (1 / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nThe term `C` combines all the other factors: C = (m_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3)) * (2πG)^(1/3).\n\nFrom the problem description, we know:\n*   The stars have the same mass (M₁ = M₂).\n*   The planets have similar masses (m_p1 ≈ m_p2).\n*   Since nothing is stated about the inclination, we assume it is similar for both systems for a meaningful comparison (sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂)).\n\nGiven these equalities and similarities, the constant `C` is approximately the same for both systems (C₁ ≈ C₂).\n\n### 4. Calculating the Period Ratio\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the velocities:\n\nK₂ / K₁ = (C₂ * (1 / P₂)^(1/3)) / (C₁ * (1 / P₁)^(1/3))\n\nSince C₁ ≈ C₂, they cancel out:\n\nK₂ / K₁ = ((1 / P₂) / (1 / P₁))^(1/3)\nK₂ / K₁ = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nWe already calculated that K₂ / K₁ = 1.4. So we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\n1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nTo solve for the period ratio, we cube both sides of the equation:\n\n(1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\nThe question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁. To get this, we take the reciprocal of our result:\n\nP₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744\nP₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times the orbital period of planet #1. This value corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nThe search results confirm the physics I used.\n\n*   **Doppler Shift and Radial Velocity:** The radial velocity ($v_r$) is related to the wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) by the Doppler formula $v_r = c (\\Delta\\lambda / \\lambda_0)$. This confirms that the observed wavelength shift is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity. The maximum shift corresponds to the radial velocity semi-amplitude, K.\n*   **RV Semi-Amplitude (K):** For a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude K is given by a formula that depends on the orbital period (P or T), the planet's mass ($M_p$), the star's mass ($M_{star}$), and the orbital inclination ($i$). Several sources give variations of the formula, which is consistent with the one I derived:\n\n    $K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3} P^{1/3}}$\n\n*   **Problem Interpretation:** The key assumptions from the problem statement are:\n    *   $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$ (explicitly stated).\n    *   Orbits are circular (explicitly stated).\n    *   $M_{p1} \\approx M_{p2}$ and we can assume $\\sin i_1 \\approx \\sin i_2$. The problem says the planets have \"masses similar to that of Neptune.\" In the context of RV measurements, which determine the minimum mass ($M_p \\sin i$), it's a standard simplification in such problems to assume the $M_p \\sin i$ term is the same for both systems.\n\nBased on this, my derivation remains correct.\n\nLet's quickly re-state the logic:\n\n1.  The RV semi-amplitude (K) is proportional to the maximum wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$).\n    *   $K_1 \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ mÅ\n    *   $K_2 \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ mÅ\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of semi-amplitudes is $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$.\n\n2.  The formula for the semi-amplitude shows its dependency on the orbital period (P):\n    *   $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$ when other parameters ($M_{star}$, $M_p \\sin i$) are held constant.\n\n3.  We can set up a ratio for the two systems:\n    *   $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n4.  Now, we solve for the ratio of the periods, $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$:\n    *   $\\frac{7}{5} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    *   Cube both sides: $\\left(\\frac{7}{5}\\right)^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n    *   $\\frac{343}{125} = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n    *   Invert the fraction to get the desired ratio: $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\n5.  Calculate the final numerical value:\n    *   $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThis result matches option C. The reasoning is sound and confirmed by the physics of the radial velocity method.\n\nFinal check of the question: \"How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\" This asks for the ratio $T_2 / T_1$. My calculation correctly solves for this ratio. The result is less than 1, meaning the period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1.\n\nThe reasoning is solid. I'm ready for the final answer.\n\n### Final Calculation Review\n- $K_2/K_1 = 7/5 = 1.4$\n- $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n- $K_2/K_1 = (P_2/P_1)^{-1/3}$\n- $1.4 = (P_2/P_1)^{-1/3}$\n- $(P_2/P_1)^{1/3} = 1/1.4$\n- $P_2/P_1 = (1/1.4)^3 = 1 / (1.4^3) = 1 / 2.744 \\approx 0.3644$\nThe answer is C.\n\nTo provide a final answer, I will outline the steps clearly based on the established physics.\n\n**1. Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:**\nThe measured periodic wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$).\n*   $K_1 \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5 \\text{ mÅ}$\n*   $K_2 \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7 \\text{ mÅ}$\n*   This gives the ratio of the semi-amplitudes: $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\n**2. Use the Radial Velocity Formula:**\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n$K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_{\\star}^{2/3}}$\nwhere P is the orbital period, $M_p$ is the planet mass, $M_{\\star}$ is the star mass, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\n**3. Apply the Given Conditions:**\nThe problem states that the stellar masses are identical ($M_{\\star1} = M_{\\star2}$) and the planet masses are similar ($M_{p1} \\approx M_{p2}$). As the radial velocity method measures the minimum mass ($M_p \\sin i$), and no information on inclination is given, we assume the detectable quantity $M_p \\sin i$ is the same for both planets. Therefore, all terms in the equation are constant except for K and P.\n\nThis simplifies the relationship to:\n$K \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$ or $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n**4. Calculate the Period Ratio:**\nWe can write the relationship for the two planets as a ratio:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{P_2^{-1/3}}{P_1^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nNow, substitute the known values:\n$\\frac{7}{5} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nTo find the required ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$, we first cube both sides:\n$\\left(\\frac{7}{5}\\right)^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n$\\frac{343}{125} = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n\nFinally, we invert the expression:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36, which corresponds to option C.\n\nThis detailed derivation confirms the choice. No further search or calculation is needed.\n\nFinal answer format is <<<X>>>.\n\nThe calculation leads directly to option C.\n\nTo be extra certain there is no misinterpretation, let's analyze the phrase \"How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\".\nThis is $T_2/T_1$. If $T_2$ were twice as long as $T_1$, the answer would be 2. My result is ~0.36. This means planet #2 has a shorter period. The phrasing of the question can be interpreted as just asking for the ratio, regardless of whether it's longer or shorter. The options provided are all numbers, so they represent the value of the ratio $T_2/T_1$.\n\nSeems everything is in order.\n<<<C>>>The relationship between the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude (K) of a star and the orbital period (P) of its planet can be derived from the laws of gravity and motion. For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude is:\n\n$K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_{\\star}^{2/3}}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $P$ is the orbital period of the planet.\n*   $M_p$ is the mass of the planet.\n*   $M_{\\star}$ is the mass of the host star.\n*   $i$ is the inclination of the planet's orbit to our line of sight.\n*   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\nThe periodic shift of a spectral line ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity. Therefore, the maximum shift is proportional to the RV semi-amplitude, K.\n\nFrom the problem, we have:\n*   For Planet #1, the shift is $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms.\n*   For Planet #2, the shift is $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms.\n\nThis implies that the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\nThe problem states that the stars have the same mass ($M_{\\star1} = M_{\\star2}$) and the planets have similar masses ($M_{p1} \\approx M_{p2}$). The RV method measures the minimum mass, $M_p \\sin i$. In the context of such a problem, it is assumed that this measured quantity is the same for both systems. With these parameters being equal for both systems, the formula simplifies to show that the semi-amplitude $K$ is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period $P$:\n\n$K \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$\n\nWe can now write a ratio for the two planet-star systems:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{P_1^{1/3}}{P_2^{1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nSubstituting the known ratio of the semi-amplitudes:\n$\\frac{7}{5} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1, which is $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. To find this, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n$\\left(\\frac{7}{5}\\right)^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n$\\frac{343}{125} = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n\nFinally, we invert the fraction to get the desired ratio:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem based on the principles of the radial velocity (RV) method for exoplanet detection.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Radial Velocity Method\nThe radial velocity method detects exoplanets by measuring the small periodic shift in a star's spectral lines. This shift is caused by the Doppler effect as the star \"wobbles\" due to the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The magnitude of this wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (the component of its velocity along our line of sight). The maximum radial velocity observed is called the semi-amplitude (K).\n\n### 2. Relating Observations to Physical Quantities\n*   The wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K).\n*   For Planet #1, the wavelength shift is Δλ₁ = 5 milliangstroms.\n*   For Planet #2, the wavelength shift is Δλ₂ = 7 milliangstroms.\n*   Therefore, the ratio of their radial velocity semi-amplitudes is K₂ / K₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4.\n\n### 3. The Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude Formula\nFor a planet in a circular orbit (eccentricity e=0), the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) of the star is given by the formula:\n\nK = ( (2πG) / P )^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i)) / (Mₛ)^(2/3)\n\nWhere:\n*   P is the orbital period of the planet.\n*   mₚ is the mass of the planet.\n*   Mₛ is the mass of the star.\n*   i is the inclination of the planet's orbit relative to our line of sight.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n### 4. Setting up the Ratio\nWe can write the formula for each of the two systems:\n\n*   K₁ = ( (2πG) / P₁ )^(1/3) * (mₚ₁ sin(i₁)) / (Mₛ₁)^(2/3)\n*   K₂ = ( (2πG) / P₂ )^(1/3) * (mₚ₂ sin(i₂)) / (Mₛ₂)^(2/3)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio K₂ / K₁.\n\n### 5. Simplifying the Ratio Based on Given Information\nThe problem provides the following crucial details which allow us to cancel out terms:\n*   The stars have the same mass: Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂.\n*   The planets have similar masses: mₚ₁ ≈ mₚ₂.\n*   It is reasonable to assume the orbital inclinations are similar (i₁ ≈ i₂), as no difference is stated. In the context of such problems, unless specified otherwise, we assume comparable observing conditions.\n\nBy dividing the equation for K₂ by the equation for K₁, the following terms cancel out: mₚ, Mₛ, sin(i), 2, π, and G.\n\n(K₂ / K₁) = [ (1/P₂)^(1/3) ] / [ (1/P₁)^(1/3) ]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n(K₂ / K₁) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n### 6. Solving for the Period Ratio\nWe can now substitute the known value of the velocity ratio (K₂ / K₁ = 1.4) into the simplified equation and solve for the period ratio (P₂ / P₁).\n\n1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nTo isolate the period ratio, we cube both sides of the equation:\n\n1.4³ = P₁ / P₂\n2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\nThe question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁. To get this, we take the reciprocal:\n\nP₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744\nP₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\n### 7. Conclusion\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This corresponds to option D. The planet with the larger radial velocity signature (Planet #2) is actually in a shorter-period orbit, which is consistent with Kepler's laws and the RV formula; a closer planet orbits faster and exerts a stronger, more rapid pull on its star.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between Wavelength Shift and Radial Velocity (RV) Semi-Amplitude (K):** The Radial Velocity method relies on the Doppler effect.

The Doppler effect relates the observed wavelength shift (Δλ) to this radial velocity (v_r):\nΔλ / λ = v_r / c\nwhere λ is the rest wavelength and c is the speed of light.\n\nThe maximum observed wavelength shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is the RV semi-amplitude, K. Therefore, K is directly proportional to Δλ_max.\n\nK ∝ Δλ_max\n\nWe are given:\nΔλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom\nΔλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom\n\nThe ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\nK₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5\n\n**Step 2: Relate the RV semi-amplitude (K) to the orbital parameters.**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude is given by the formula:\nK = (mₚ * sin(i) / Mₛ) * √(G * Mₛ / a)\nwhere mₚ is the planet's mass, Mₛ is the star's mass, a is the semi-major axis (the orbital radius for a circular orbit), i is the orbital inclination, and G is the gravitational constant.\n\nWe are given that the stars have the same mass (Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂), and the planets have similar masses (mₚ₁ = mₚ₂). Since the problem provides a single numerical answer, we must assume that other unknown factors, like the orbital inclination (i), are the same for both systems. With these assumptions, the term (mₚ * sin(i) / Mₛ) * √(G * Mₛ) is constant for both systems.\n\nTherefore, K is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis (a):\nK ∝ 1 / √a\n\nWe can write the ratio of the semi-amplitudes in terms of the semi-major axes:\nK₂ / K₁ = √(a₁) / √(a₂) = √(a₁ / a₂)\n\n**Step 3: Combine the results from Step 1 and Step 2 to find the ratio of the semi-major axes.**\n\nWe have two expressions for the ratio K₂ / K₁:\n7 / 5 = √(a₁ / a₂)\n\nSquaring both sides gives:\n(7 / 5)² = a₁ / a₂\n49 / 25 = a₁ / a₂\n\nSo, the ratio of the semi-major axis of planet #2 to that of planet #1 is:\na₂ / a₁ = 25 / 49\n\n**Step 4: Use Kepler's Third Law to relate the orbital period (T) to the semi-major axis (a).**\n\nKepler's Third Law states:\nT² ∝ a³ / (Mₛ + mₚ)\n\nSince the mass of the star (Mₛ) and the mass of the planet (mₚ) are the same for both systems, the term (Mₛ + mₚ) is constant. Therefore, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:\nT² ∝ a³  or  T ∝ a^(3/2)\n\nThe ratio of the orbital periods is:\nT₂ / T₁ = (a₂ / a₁)^(3/2)\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final ratio of the orbital periods.**\n\nSubstitute the ratio of the semi-major axes (a₂ / a₁ = 25 / 49) into the equation from Step 4:\nT₂ / T₁ = (25 / 49)^(3/2)\nT₂ / T₁ = (√(25 / 49))³\nT₂ / T₁ = (5 / 7)³\nT₂ / T₁ = 125 / 343\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\nT₂ / T₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is closest to 0.36.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Radial Velocity (RV) Method**\n    The RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. As the star \"wobbles\" due to the gravitational pull of the planet, the light we receive from it is alternately blueshifted (when moving towards us) and redshifted (when moving away). The magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's maximum radial velocity, also known as the velocity semi-amplitude (K).\n\n    Therefore, we can establish a ratio:\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n2.  **Relating Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Parameters**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity amplitude (K) is given by the formula:\n\n    K ≈ (2πG)^(1/3) * (mₚ / Mₛ^(2/3)) * (1 / P^(1/3))\n\n    where:\n    *   mₚ is the mass of the planet.\n    *   Mₛ is the mass of the star.\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Simplifying the Relationship**\n    The problem states that the masses of the two stars are identical (Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂) and the masses of the two planets are also similar (mₚ₁ = mₚ₂). Since G is a constant, most of the terms in the equation are the same for both systems. This simplifies the relationship to a direct proportionality:\n\n    K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\n4.  **Calculating the Period Ratio**\n    We can now set up a ratio for the two systems:\n    K₁ / K₂ = (1 / P₁^(1/3)) / (1 / P₂^(1/3))\n    K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n\n    We want to find the ratio P₂ / P₁, so we rearrange the equation:\n    P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\n5.  **Substituting the Given Values**\n    We know the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is the same as the ratio of their measured wavelength shifts:\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 miliangstrom / 7 miliangstrom = 5/7\n\n    Now, substitute this value back into the equation for the period ratio:\n    P₂ / P₁ = (5/7)³\n    P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\n    P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis result shows that the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Relate Observational Data to Physical Quantities**\n\nThe problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method. The key observation is the periodic shift in a star's spectral line wavelength, $\\Delta\\lambda$. This shift is caused by the Doppler effect as the star moves towards and away from the observer.\n\nThe amplitude of this wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) is directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity ($K$, also known as the RV semi-amplitude).\n\n*   Therefore: $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$\n\nGiven the data:\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms\n\nThe ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes is:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\n**2. Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Period**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is related to the planet's orbital period ($P$), the planet's mass ($M_p$), and the star's mass ($M_{star}$) by the following formula (where $i$ is the orbital inclination):\n\n$K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{(M_{star})^{2/3}}$\n\nThis assumes the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass, which is true for a Neptune-like planet around a Sun-like star.\n\n**3. Simplify the Relationship Using Given Conditions**\n\nThe problem states that several key parameters are the same for both systems:\n*   The stars have the same mass ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$).\n*   The planets have similar masses ($M_{p1} \\approx M_{p2}$).\n*   It is a standard assumption in such problems that the unstated orbital inclinations ($i$) are also similar, or that \"similar masses\" refers to the measured value $M_p \\sin i$.\n\nUnder these conditions, all terms in the formula for $K$ are constant for both systems except for the orbital period, $P$. This leaves a simple proportionality:\n\n$K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n**4. Solve for the Ratio of the Orbital Periods**\n\nWe can now express the relationship for the two systems as a ratio:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nNow, we substitute the ratio of the velocities we found in Step 1:\n$\\frac{7}{5} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1, which is $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. To solve for this, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n$\\left(\\frac{7}{5}\\right)^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n$\\frac{343}{125} = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n\nFinally, we invert the fraction to get the desired ratio:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644$\n\n**5. Final Conclusion and Careful Points**\n\n*   **Derivation:** The derived relationship $P_2/P_1 = (\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2)^3$ is consistent across the vast majority of the provided solutions that show their work.\n*   **Calculation:** The calculation $(5/7)^3$ correctly yields approximately 0.36.\n*   **Physical Sanity Check:** Planet #2 induces a larger Doppler shift, meaning it causes its star to wobble faster. For a planet of the same mass, this implies it must be in a closer orbit with a shorter period. Therefore, the ratio $P_2 / P_1$ must be less than 1, which is consistent with our result of ~0.36.\n*   **Mapping to Options:** The candidate answers show confusion in mapping the calculated value of ~0.36 to the correct lettered option.

The observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) along our line of sight. The maximum wavelength shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve, denoted as K.\n    Therefore, K is proportional to Δλ_max.\n    We can write the ratio for the two systems:\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 mÅ / 7 mÅ = 5/7\n\n2.  **The Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude (K) Formula:**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n    K = (M_p / M_star) * v_p * sin(i)\n    where M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, v_p is the planet's orbital speed, and 'i' is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n3.  **Relate Planet's Velocity to Orbital Period:**\n    The planet's orbital speed (v_p) is the circumference of its orbit divided by the orbital period (P):\n    v_p = 2πa / P\n    where 'a' is the semi-major axis of the orbit.\n\n4.  **Use Kepler's Third Law:**\n    Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period (P) and the semi-major axis (a):\n    P² = (4π² / (G * (M_star + M_p))) * a³\n    Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (M_p << M_star), we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.\n    P² ≈ (4π² / (G * M_star)) * a³\n    We can rearrange this to solve for 'a':\n    a³ ≈ (G * M_star * P²) / 4π²\n    a ≈ (G * M_star / 4π²)^(1/3) * P^(2/3)\n\n5.  **Combine the Equations:**\n    Now, substitute the expressions for v_p and 'a' back into the formula for K:\n    K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * (2πa / P) * sin(i)\n    K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * (2π / P) * [(G * M_star / 4π²)^(1/3) * P^(2/3)] * sin(i)\n    By combining the constants and simplifying the terms involving M_star and P, we find the proportionality:\n    K ∝ M_p * M_star^(-2/3) * P^(-1/3) * sin(i)\n\n6.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions:**\n    The problem states that the stars have the same mass (M_star1 = M_star2) and the planets have similar masses (M_p1 ≈ M_p2). For a unique solution to exist, we must also assume the orbital inclinations are the same (sin(i₁) = sin(i₂)). With these conditions, all terms in the proportionality are constant for both systems except for K and P.\n    Therefore, the relationship simplifies to:\n    K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n7.  **Solve for the Period Ratio:**\n    We can now write a ratio for the two systems:\n    K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n    We know K₁ / K₂ = 5/7. So:\n    5/7 = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n    To find the ratio of the periods (P₂ / P₁), we cube both sides of the equation:\n    P₂ / P₁ = (5/7)³\n    P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\n    P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):**\n    The Doppler effect for light relates the change in wavelength (Δλ) to the radial velocity (v_r) of the source:\n    Δλ / λ₀ = v_r / c\n    where λ₀ is the rest wavelength and c is the speed of light.\n\n    This means that the amplitude of the periodic wavelength shift (Δλ_max) is directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity variation (K).\n    K ∝ Δλ_max\n\n    For the two planets, we have:\n    *   K₁ ∝ Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom\n    *   K₂ ∝ Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom\n\n    The ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes is therefore:\n    K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit detected via the radial velocity method, the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity (K) is given by the formula:\n    K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i)) / (M_star + mₚ)^(2/3)\n\n    Let's analyze the terms based on the information provided:\n    *   **G** is the gravitational constant.\n    *   **P** is the orbital period we need to relate.\n    *   **mₚ** is the planet's mass. The problem states both planets have masses \"similar to that of Neptune.\" In the context of RV measurements, this typically refers to the minimum mass, mₚ sin(i). We will assume (mₚ sin(i)) is the same for both systems.\n    *   **i** is the orbital inclination. As mentioned above, it's part of the mₚ sin(i) term.\n    *   **M_star** is the star's mass. The problem states the two stars have \"exactly the same masses.\"\n    *   The term (M_star + mₚ) can be approximated as M_star, since the mass of a Sun-like star is much greater than the mass of a Neptune-like planet.\n\n    Since M_star and mₚ sin(i) are the same for both systems, all parts of the equation are constant except for K and P. This gives us the proportionality:\n    K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods:**\n    We can rearrange the proportionality to solve for the period, P:\n    If K ∝ P^(-1/3), then K³ ∝ P⁻¹, which means P ∝ K⁻³.\n\n    Now we can find the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 (P₂) to that of planet #1 (P₁):\n    P₂ / P₁ = (K₂ / K₁)⁻³ = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\n    Using the ratio of the radial velocities we found in step 1:\n    P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\n\n    Calculating the final value:\n    P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity (K):** The Doppler effect tells us that the observed shift in a spectral line's wavelength (Δλ) is directly proportional to the radial velocity of the source (the star, in this case). Therefore, the amplitude of the velocity variation, known as the RV semi-amplitude (K), is proportional to the amplitude of the wavelength shift.\n    *   `K ∝ Δλ`\n    *   This means the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts: `K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁`.\n\n2.  **Relate Stellar Velocity (K) to Orbital Period (T):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude (K) of its host star is given by a formula derived from Kepler's and Newton's laws. The key relationship for our problem is:\n    *   `K ∝ 1 / T^(1/3)`\n    *   This relationship holds true because the problem states that the masses of the stars are identical (`M_star1 = M_star2`) and the masses of the planets are similar (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`). We also assume the orbital inclinations are comparable for this analysis.\n    *   From this proportionality, we can write the ratio: `K₂ / K₁ = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)`.\n\n3.  **Combine and Solve for the Period Ratio (T₂ / T₁):** We now have two different expressions for the same ratio, `K₂ / K₁`. We can set them equal to each other:\n    *   `Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)`\n    *   To solve for our target ratio, `T₂ / T₁`, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n    *   `(Δλ₂ / Δλ₁)^3 = T₁ / T₂`\n    *   Finally, we take the reciprocal of both sides to get the desired ratio:\n    *   `T₂ / T₁ = (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)^3`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Value:** We will now plug the given values into the formula and calculate the result.\n    *   `Δλ₁ = 5` miliangstrom\n    *   `Δλ₂ = 7` miliangstrom\n\n```python\n# Given values from the problem\ndelta_lambda_1 = 5  # Wavelength shift for planet #1 in miliangstrom\ndelta_lambda_2 = 7  # Wavelength shift for planet #2 in miliangstrom\n\n# The ratio of the orbital periods (T2 / T1) is related to the ratio of the\n# wavelength shifts (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2) to the power of 3.\n# T2 / T1 = (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2)^3\nperiod_ratio = (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2) ** 3\n\n# The available choices\nchoices = {\n    \"A\": 0.85,\n    \"B\": 1.40,\n    \"C\": 0.36,\n    \"D\": 1.96\n}\n\n# Print the calculated result and the choices\nprint(f\"The calculated ratio of the orbital periods (T2 / T1) is: {period_ratio:.2f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this to the given options:\")\nprint(f\"A) ~ {choices['A']}\")\nprint(f\"B) ~ {choices['B']}\")\nprint(f\"C) ~ {choices['C']}\")\nprint(f\"D) ~ {choices['D']}\")\n\n# Determine the closest choice\nclosest_choice = min(choices, key=lambda k: abs(choices[k] - period_ratio))\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to option {closest_choice}.\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The calculated ratio of the orbital periods (T2 / T1) is: 0.36\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.85\nB) ~ 1.4\nC) ~ 0.36\nD) ~ 1.96\n\nThe calculated value is closest to option C.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K)**\n    The Radial Velocity (RV) method relies on the Doppler effect. The shift in the wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) of a spectral line is directly proportional to the radial velocity ($v_r$) of the star along our line of sight. The formula is:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$\n    where $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n    The problem gives the *maximum* periodic shift, which corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star. This maximum velocity is the amplitude of the RV curve, denoted as $K$.\n    *   For planet #1, the maximum shift is $\\Delta\\lambda_{max,1} = 5$ miliangstrom.\n    *   For planet #2, the maximum shift is $\\Delta\\lambda_{max,2} = 7$ miliangstrom.\n\n    Since $K$ is directly proportional to $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, we can find the ratio of the RV amplitudes for the two stars:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max,2}}{\\Delta\\lambda_{max,1}} = \\frac{7 \\text{ mÅ}}{5 \\text{ mÅ}} = 1.4$\n\n2.  **Relate RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Parameters**\n    For a planet of mass $m_p$ orbiting a star of mass $M_*$ in a circular orbit with period $P$, the RV amplitude $K$ is given by:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_*^{2/3}}$\n    where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $i$ is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight.\n\n3.  **Apply the Given Conditions and Assumptions**\n    The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{*,1} = M_{*,2}$.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: $m_{p,1} = m_{p,2}$.\n    *   The problem does not mention the orbital inclinations. A standard and necessary assumption in such problems is that the viewing conditions are comparable, meaning the inclinations are the same: $\\sin(i_1) = \\sin(i_2)$.\n\n    With these parameters being constant for both systems, the formula simplifies to a direct relationship between $K$ and $P$:\n    $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n4.  **Formulate the Ratio of the Periods**\n    From the relationship $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$, we can write:\n    $K \\cdot P^{1/3} = \\text{constant}$\n\n    Applying this to our two systems:\n    $K_1 \\cdot P_1^{1/3} = K_2 \\cdot P_2^{1/3}$\n\n    We want to find the ratio $P_2 / P_1$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    $\\frac{P_2^{1/3}}{P_1^{1/3}} = \\frac{K_1}{K_2}$\n    $\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} = \\frac{K_1}{K_2}$\n\n    To solve for $P_2 / P_1$, we cube both sides of the equation:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value**\n    We already found that $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$. Therefore, the inverse ratio is $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n\n    Now, substitute this value into our equation for the period ratio:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\approx 0.3644$\n\n    This value is approximately 0.36.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Proportionality:** The core of the problem is understanding that the maximum wavelength shift is directly proportional to the RV amplitude $K$.\n*   **Key Formula:** The relationship $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$ is crucial. It is derived by combining the definition of the star's velocity due to its planet with Kepler's Third Law.\n*   **Assumptions:** The solution relies on the stated conditions (equal star and planet masses) and the implicit assumption that the orbital inclinations are the same for both systems.\n*   **Inverse Relationship:** A larger RV amplitude ($K$) implies a stronger gravitational pull at a closer distance, which means a shorter orbital period ($P$). Since planet #2 induces a larger shift ($K_2 > K_1$), its period must be shorter ($P_2 < P_1$), so the ratio $P_2/P_1$ must be less than 1. This provides a quick sanity check of the result.\n*   **Exponents:** It is easy to make a mistake with the exponents. The final ratio is cubed, not taken to the power of 1/3 or -1/3. The ratio of periods is $(K_1/K_2)^3$, not $(K_2/K_1)^3$.\n\nThe calculated ratio of ~0.36 matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method\n\nThe radial velocity method detects exoplanets by observing the \"wobble\" of their host star. A planet's gravitational pull causes its star to move in a small orbit around their common center of mass. This movement causes a periodic shift in the star's spectral lines due to the Doppler effect. When the star moves towards us, its light is blueshifted; when it moves away, it is redshifted. The maximum velocity of this wobble along our line of sight is called the radial velocity semi-amplitude, denoted as K.\n\n### 2. Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity\n\nThe observed periodic shift in the wavelength of a spectral line (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r). The maximum wavelength shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K).\n\nGiven:\n*   Maximum wavelength shift for star 1 (Δλ₁): 5 milliangstroms\n*   Maximum wavelength shift for star 2 (Δλ₂): 7 milliangstroms\n\nSince K is proportional to Δλ_max, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is:\nK₂ / K₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n### 3. Use the Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude Formula\n\nThe formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit (eccentricity e=0) is:\n\nK = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3))\n\nWhere:\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   m_p is the planet's mass.\n*   M_star is the star's mass.\n*   i is the inclination of the orbit.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n### 4. Simplify the Formula Based on the Given Information\n\nThe problem provides the following key details:\n*   The stars have the same mass: M_star1 = M_star2.\n*   The planets have similar masses, like Neptune: m_p1 ≈ m_p2.\n*   The orbits are circular: e=0.\n\nThe term m_p * sin(i) represents the \"minimum mass\" that can be measured by the RV method, as the inclination 'i' is often unknown. The problem states the *planets'* masses are similar, which implies we can assume the term (m_p * sin(i)) is constant for both systems.\n\nWith these simplifications, most terms in the formula become constant for both planets. The relationship between K and P simplifies to:\n\nK ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n### 5.

M_Neptune is about 17 times M_Earth, and M_Sun is about 333,000 times M_Earth. So, M_p << M_star, and the approximation (M_star + M_p) ≈ M_star is valid.\n\nThe formula becomes:\nK ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)\n\nThis confirms that K is proportional to P^(-1/3), assuming all other factors are constant between the two systems.\n\nThe problem states:\n- M_star1 = M_star2 (given)\n- m_p1 ≈ m_p2 (given as \"similar masses\")\n- The RV method measures M_p * sin(i), so the most reasonable interpretation is that M_p1*sin(i1) ≈ M_p2*sin(i2).\n\nThe wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the radial velocity (K).\n\nTherefore, the logic holds:\n1.

I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\n### Final Answer Formulation\n\n1.  **State the relationship between wavelength shift and radial velocity amplitude.** The amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is directly proportional to the observed periodic wavelength shift (Δλ).\n2.  **Calculate the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes.** K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7/5 = 1.4.\n3.  **State the formula for the radial velocity amplitude.** For a planet in a circular orbit, K is proportional to M_p*sin(i) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3)).\n4.  **Apply the given conditions.** The stars have the same mass (M₁ = M₂), and the planets have similar masses (implying m_p₁*sin(i₁) ≈ m_p₂*sin(i₂)).\n5.  **Simplify the relationship.** Under these conditions, K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3).\n6.  **Set up the equation.** K₂ / K₁ = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3).\n7.  **Solve for the period ratio.**\n    1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n    (1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n    2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n    P₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644.\n8.  **Compare with the options.** The calculated value of ~0.36 matches option C.\n\nThe reasoning is sound. I will now write the final response.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to relate the observed periodic wavelength shift to the orbital period of the exoplanet using the principles of the Radial Velocity (RV) method.\n\n1.  **Relating Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:** The periodic shift in the spectral line's wavelength (Δλ) is caused by the Doppler effect due to the star's motion along our line of sight. This motion is induced by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. The amplitude of the star's radial velocity (denoted as K) is directly proportional to the amplitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ_max).\n    Therefore, the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars is equal to the ratio of their maximum wavelength shifts:\n    K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 1.4\n\n2.  **The Radial Velocity Formula:** The semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) for a star with an orbiting planet is given by the formula:\n    K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))\n    This formula applies under the given conditions: circular orbits (eccentricity e=0) and a planet mass (m_p) much smaller than the star's mass (M_star). Here, P is the orbital period, G is the gravitational constant, m_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, and i is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Applying the Given Information:** We are given that:\n    *   The stars have identical masses: M_star₁ = M_star₂.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: m_p₁ ≈ m_p₂. In the context of the RV method, the measured quantity is the minimum mass, m_p * sin(i). The problem's phrasing implies that this value is similar for both planets, so we can assume m_p₁ * sin(i₁) ≈ m_p₂ * sin(i₂).\n\n4.  **Finding the Relationship between K and P:** Since M_star and m_p * sin(i) are the same for both systems, the formula simplifies to show that the radial velocity amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period P:\n    K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\n5.  **Calculating the Period Ratio:** We can now set up a ratio for the two systems:\n    K₂ / K₁ = (P₂ / P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    We already calculated that K₂ / K₁ = 1.4. Substituting this value:\n    1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To find the ratio of the periods, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n    (1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n    2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\n    The question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁. We find this by taking the reciprocal:\n    P₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36. Comparing this to the given options, it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method:** The RV method detects exoplanets by observing the gravitational pull they exert on their host star. This pull causes the star to \"wobble,\" moving towards and away from us. This movement induces a periodic Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity:** The observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) along our line of sight. The maximum measured wavelength shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, known as the velocity amplitude (K).\n    *   Δλ ∝ K\n\n3.  **The Velocity Amplitude Formula:** For a planet in a circular orbit (eccentricity e=0), the velocity amplitude K is given by:\n    *   K = ( (2πG) / P )^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))\n    Where:\n        *   P is the orbital period of the planet.\n        *   m_p is the mass of the planet.\n        *   M_star is the mass of the star.\n        *   G is the gravitational constant.\n        *   i is the inclination of the orbit.\n\n4.  **Apply the Given Information:** The problem states that for both systems:\n    *   The mass of the stars are the same (M_star1 = M_star2).\n    *   The mass of the planets are the same (m_p1 = m_p2).\n    *   We can assume the orbital inclinations (i) are comparable, as is standard in such problems unless stated otherwise.\n\n    Therefore, the term `(m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))` is a constant for both planets. This simplifies the relationship between the velocity amplitude (K) and the orbital period (P) to:\n    *   K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n5.  **Establish the Ratio:** Since the wavelength shift (Δλ) is proportional to K, we can also say:\n    *   Δλ ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n    We can now write a ratio for the two planets:\n    *   (Δλ₂ / Δλ₁) = (P₂ / P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n6.  **Substitute the Values and Solve:** We are given:\n    *   Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ\n    *   Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ\n\n    Substituting these into the ratio:\n    *   (7 / 5) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To solve for the ratio of the periods, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n    *   (7 / 5)³ = P₁ / P₂\n    *   343 / 125 = P₁ / P₂\n    *   2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\n7.  **Find the Final Answer:** The question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁. We take the reciprocal of the previous result:\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 = 125 / 343\n    *   P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis result indicates that the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it is significantly shorter. This aligns with the initial data, as a larger Doppler shift (planet #2) implies a larger stellar velocity, which in turn is caused by a planet in a closer, shorter-period orbit.\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.36 matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe reasoning and calculation are as follows:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):** The radial velocity (RV) amplitude, K, is directly proportional to the observed periodic wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$.\n    *   $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$\n    *   For planet #1, $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom.\n    *   For planet #2, $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom.\n    *   The ratio of the RV amplitudes is $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$.\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (T):** The formula for the RV amplitude for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n    where T is the orbital period, $m_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_{star}$ is the star's mass, and i is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Establish Proportionality:** The problem states that the star masses are the same ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$) and the planet masses are the same ($m_{p1} = m_{p2}$).

Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the orbital periods.\n\n1.  **Relating Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:** The RV method measures the periodic Doppler shift of spectral lines from a star. This shift in wavelength (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) along the line of sight. The amplitude of the observed radial velocity, known as the semi-amplitude (K), is therefore proportional to the maximum observed wavelength shift (Δλ_max).\n    *   K ∝ Δλ_max\n\n    Given the periodic shifts for the two planets' host stars:\n    *   Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ\n    *   Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ\n\n    The ratio of their radial velocity semi-amplitudes is:\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n2.  **The Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude Formula:** The semi-amplitude (K) of the star's radial velocity is determined by the properties of the star-planet system. For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula is:\n    *   K = (2πG / T)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))\n    where:\n        *   T is the orbital period.\n        *   m_p is the mass of the planet.\n        *   M_star is the mass of the star.\n        *   i is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n        *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Applying the Given Information:** The problem provides the following crucial details:\n    *   The stars have \"exactly the same masses\": M_star₁ = M_star₂.\n    *   The planets were detected using the RV method and have \"masses similar to that of Neptune.\" In the context of RV discoveries, the measurable quantity is the minimum mass, m_p * sin(i), not the true mass m_p, as the inclination *i* is generally unknown. Therefore, it is standard to assume that the measured minimum masses are what is being referred to as similar.\n    *   (m_p * sin(i))₁ ≈ (m_p * sin(i))₂\n\n4.  **Calculating the Period Ratio:** We can now set up a ratio of the semi-amplitudes for the two systems:\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = [ (2πG / T₂)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i))₂ / (M_star₂^(2/3)) ] / [ (2πG / T₁)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i))₁ / (M_star₁^(2/3)) ]\n\n    Since the stellar masses and the minimum planetary masses are the same, these terms, along with the constants, cancel out, simplifying the equation significantly:\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = (1 / T₂^(1/3)) / (1 / T₁^(1/3))\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)\n\n5.  **Solving for the Final Answer:** Substitute the known value of K₂ / K₁ = 1.4 into the simplified equation:\n    *   1.4 = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To find the ratio of the periods (T₂ / T₁), we first solve for T₁ / T₂ by cubing both sides:\n    *   T₁ / T₂ = (1.4)³ = 2.744\n\n    Finally, invert the fraction to get the desired ratio:\n    *   T₂ / T₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity**\n    The periodic shift in a star's spectral line (Δλ) is caused by its motion along our line of sight, an effect known as the Doppler shift. The magnitude of this shift is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r). The maximum measured wavelength shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is known as the semi-amplitude, K.\n\n    Therefore, we can establish a ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes for the two stars:\n    K₁ ∝ Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom\n    K₂ ∝ Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom\n\n    The ratio is K₂ / K₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4.\n\n2.  **The Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude Formula**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude (K) of the host star's radial velocity is given by the formula:\n\n    K = ( (2πG) / P )^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i)) / (Mₛ + mₚ)^(2/3)\n\n    Where:\n    *   `P` is the orbital period of the planet.\n    *   `mₚ` is the mass of the planet.\n    *   `Mₛ` is the mass of the star.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n    The term `mₚ sin(i)` is the \"minimum mass\" of the planet, which is the quantity directly measured by the RV method.\n\n3.  **Set up a Ratio for the Two Systems**\n    We can write the expression for K for each of the two star-planet systems:\n\n    K₁ = ( (2πG) / P₁ )^(1/3) * (mₚ₁ sin(i₁)) / (Mₛ₁ + mₚ₁)^(2/3)\n    K₂ = ( (2πG) / P₂ )^(1/3) * (mₚ₂ sin(i₂)) / (Mₛ₂ + mₚ₂)^(2/3)\n\n    Now, we can create a ratio of K₂ to K₁:\n\n    K₂ / K₁ = [ (P₁/P₂)^(1/3) ] * [ (mₚ₂ sin(i₂)) / (mₚ₁ sin(i₁)) ] * [ (Mₛ₁ + mₚ₁)^(2/3) / (Mₛ₂ + mₚ₂)^(2/3) ]\n\n4.  **Apply the Given Information**\n    Let's simplify this ratio using the details from the problem description:\n    *   The stars have \"exactly the same masses\" (Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂).\n    *   The planets have masses \"similar to that of Neptune\" and the stars have masses \"similar to that of our Sun\". This means the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (mₚ << Mₛ). Therefore, we can approximate (Mₛ + mₚ) ≈ Mₛ. With Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂, this term cancels out.\n    *   The planets were detected using the RV method and both have \"masses similar to that of Neptune\". In the context of RV discoveries, this implies that their measured minimum masses (`mₚ sin(i)`) are similar. Thus, (mₚ₂ sin(i₂)) / (mₚ₁ sin(i₁)) ≈ 1.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Period Ratio**\n    Substituting these simplifications into the ratio equation, we get:\n\n    K₂ / K₁ ≈ (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    We already found that K₂ / K₁ = 1.4. So:\n\n    1.4 ≈ (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To find the ratio of the periods (P₂ / P₁), we first cube both sides:\n\n    (1.4)³ ≈ P₁ / P₂\n    2.744 ≈ P₁ / P₂\n\n    Now, we invert the expression to find the desired ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1:\n\n    P₂ / P₁ ≈ 1 / 2.744\n    P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    The calculated ratio is approximately 0.36. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method**\n\nThe RV method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The star wobbles around the common center of mass (barycenter) of the star-planet system. This wobble causes a periodic shift in the star's spectral lines.\n\nThe magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is related to the star's radial velocity (v_r) by the Doppler formula:\nΔλ / λ = v_r / c\nwhere λ is the rest wavelength and c is the speed of light.\n\nThe amplitude of the periodic wavelength shift (Δλ_max), which is what is given in the problem, corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity curve (K, also known as the RV semi-amplitude).\nΔλ_max / λ = K / c\nSince λ and c are constants, the RV amplitude is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift:\nK ∝ Δλ_max\n\n**2. Relate RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P)**\n\nThe formula for the RV semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is:\nK = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin(i)) / (M_s + M_p)^(2/3)\nwhere:\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n*   M_p is the mass of the planet.\n*   M_s is the mass of the star.\n*   i is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n**3. Apply the Given Information**\n\nWe are given that for the two systems:\n*   The star masses are the same: M_s1 = M_s2 = M_s.\n*   The planet masses are the same: M_p1 = M_p2 = M_p.\n*   The problem does not specify the inclinations. For the problem to be solvable, we must assume the inclinations are the same (i₁ = i₂), which is a common assumption in such problems unless stated otherwise.\n\nWith M_s, M_p, and sin(i) being the same for both systems, all terms in the formula for K are constant except for the period, P. Therefore, we can establish a simple proportionality:\nK ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\nThis means that a larger RV amplitude (a faster wobble) corresponds to a shorter orbital period.\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of the Periods**\n\nLet K₁ and P₁ be the RV amplitude and period for planet #1, and K₂ and P₂ be for planet #2. From the proportionality K ∝ P^(-1/3), we can write:\nK₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n\nWe need to solve for the ratio P₂ / P₁. Let's cube both sides of the equation:\n(K₁ / K₂)^3 = P₂ / P₁\n\nNow, we can substitute the values for K, using the fact that K ∝ Δλ_max:\n*   K₁ ∝ Δλ_max_1 = 5 miliangstrom\n*   K₂ ∝ Δλ_max_2 = 7 miliangstrom\n\nSo, the ratio K₁ / K₂ is 5 / 7.\nP₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)^3\nP₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\nP₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\n**5.

Therefore, the maximum wavelength shift (the observable) is directly proportional to the RV semi-amplitude K.\n    *   K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7.\n\n2.  **Use the formula for K:**\n    K = ( (2πG)^(1/3) * m_p * sin(i) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )\n\n3.  **Analyze the ratio K₁ / K₂:**\n    K₁ / K₂ = [ (m_p1 * sin(i₁)) / (M_star1^(2/3) * P₁^(1/3)) ] / [ (m_p2 * sin(i₂)) / (M_star2^(2/3) * P₂^(1/3)) ]\n\n4.  **Apply the given conditions:**\n    *   M_star1 = M_star2 (same star masses)\n    *   m_p1 ≈ m_p2 (similar planet masses)\n    *   Assume sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂) as is standard when no information is provided.\n\n5.  **Simplify the ratio:** With these assumptions, the mass and inclination terms cancel out, leaving:\n    K₁ / K₂ = P₂^(1/3) / P₁^(1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n\n6.  **Solve for the period ratio (P₂ / P₁):**\n    *   5 / 7 = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThe calculation is straightforward and the underlying physics is sound and confirmed by the search results. The key is to correctly identify the relationship K ∝ P^(-1/3) under the given conditions. The result robustly points to option C.\n\nFinal check of the question: \"How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\" This asks for the ratio P₂ / P₁. My result is P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.36.\n\nThe logic is confirmed. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\nThe periodic wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's maximum radial velocity (K), so K ∝ Δλ.\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the orbital period (P), star mass (Mₛ), and planet mass (mₚ) by the formula:\nK ∝ (mₚ sin i) / (Mₛ²/³ * P¹/³)\nwhere *i* is the orbital inclination.\n\nWe are given:\n*   Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂ (stars have the same mass)\n*   mₚ₁ ≈ mₚ₂ (planets have similar masses)\n*   Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ\n*   Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ\n\nSince no information is given about the orbital inclinations, we assume they are similar (sin i₁ ≈ sin i₂). This is a standard assumption in such problems unless stated otherwise.\n\nUnder these conditions, the terms for planet mass, star mass, and inclination are approximately the same for both systems. The relationship simplifies to:\nK ∝ 1 / P¹/³\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes for the two systems is:\nK₂ / K₁ = (P₂/P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁/P₂)^(1/3)\n\nSince K is proportional to Δλ:\nK₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\nNow, we set the two expressions for the ratio K₂ / K₁ equal to each other:\n(P₁/P₂)^(1/3) = 1.4\n\nTo find the required ratio P₂/P₁, we first solve for P₁/P₂:\nP₁/P₂ = (1.4)³ = 1.4 * 1.4 * 1.4 = 2.744\n\nFinally, we find the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1:\nP₂/P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method. The key relationship is between the observed periodic wavelength shift (Δλ) and the properties of the star-planet system.\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Velocity:** The amplitude of the periodic wavelength shift (let's call it Kλ) is directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity (usually denoted as K). So, `Kλ ∝ K`.\n3.  **Relate Velocity to Orbital Period:** For a circular orbit, the star's velocity amplitude `K` is related to the planet's mass (`m_p`), star's mass (`M_star`), and orbital period (`P`) by the formula: `K ∝ m_p / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3))`.\n4.  **Simplify the Relationship:** The problem states that the star masses are identical (`M_star1 = M_star2`) and the planet masses are similar (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`). We can also assume the unstated orbital inclinations are the same. Therefore, the relationship simplifies to `K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)`.\n5.  **Combine the Proportions:** Since `Kλ ∝ K` and `K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)`, it follows that `Kλ ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)`.\n6.  **Formulate an Equation:** This proportionality means that the product `Kλ * P^(1/3)` is constant for both systems. So, `Kλ1 * P1^(1/3) = Kλ2 * P2^(1/3)`.\n7.  **Solve for the Period Ratio:** We need to find `P2 / P1`.

As the star \"wobbles\" due to the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet, the light we receive from it is alternately blueshifted (moving towards us) and redshifted (moving away). The magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) along our line of sight, according to the Doppler formula: Δλ/λ₀ = v_r/c. The problem gives the *amplitude* of this periodic shift, which corresponds to the *amplitude* of the star's radial velocity, often denoted as K.\n    *   Therefore, K is directly proportional to Δλ_max.\n    *   K ∝ Δλ_max\n\n2.  **Relate the Observed Shifts to Stellar Velocities:**\n    *   For Planet #1, Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom.\n    *   For Planet #2, Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom.\n    *   The ratio of the stellar velocity amplitudes is equal to the ratio of their maximum wavelength shifts.\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4.\n\n3.  **Relate Stellar Velocity (K) to the System's Physical Properties:**\n    *   In a two-body system, the star and planet orbit a common center of mass. By conservation of momentum: M_star * v_star = m_planet * v_planet.\n    *   The amplitude of the star's velocity is K = v_star (assuming we are viewing the orbit edge-on for maximum effect, a standard simplifying assumption when inclination is not given).\n    *   So, K = (m_planet / M_star) * v_planet.\n    *   For a circular orbit, the planet's velocity v_planet is related to the gravitational force: G * M_star * m_planet / a² = m_planet * v_planet² / a, where 'a' is the orbital radius.\n    *   This simplifies to v_planet = sqrt(G * M_star / a).\n    *   Substituting this into the equation for K: K = (m_planet / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = (m_planet * sqrt(G)) / (sqrt(M_star) * sqrt(a)).\n    *   This shows that for given masses, K is proportional to 1/sqrt(a).\n    *   K ∝ 1 / sqrt(a).\n\n4.  **Incorporate Kepler's Third Law:**\n    *   Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period (T) to the semi-major axis (a). For a planet much less massive than its star (m_planet << M_star), the law is: T² ∝ a³.\n    *   From this, we can find the relationship between 'a' and 'T': a ∝ T^(2/3).\n\n5.  **Establish the Final Relationship between Stellar Velocity (K) and Period (T):**\n    *   We have two proportionalities: K ∝ 1/sqrt(a) and a ∝ T^(2/3).\n    *   We can substitute the second into the first: K ∝ 1 / sqrt(T^(2/3)).\n    *   Simplifying the exponent: K ∝ 1 / T^((2/3) * (1/2)) = 1 / T^(1/3).\n    *   So, the stellar velocity amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the planet's orbital period (K ∝ T^(-1/3)).\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods:**\n    *   We can write the relationship from the previous step as a ratio for our two systems: K₂ / K₁ = (T₂ / T₁)^(-1/3).\n    *   This is the same as: K₂ / K₁ = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3).\n    *   We already calculated K₂ / K₁ = 1.4.\n    *   So, 1.4 = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3).\n    *   To find the ratio T₁ / T₂, we must cube both sides of the equation:\n    *   T₁ / T₂ = (1.4)³ = 1.4 * 1.4 * 1.4 = 1.96 * 1.4 = 2.744.\n    *   The question asks for \"How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\", which is the ratio T₂ / T₁.\n    *   T₂ / T₁ = 1 / (T₁ / T₂) = 1 / 2.744.\n    *   T₂ / T₁ ≈ 0.3644.\n\n7.  **Match with the given options:**\n    *   The calculated value of ~0.36 corresponds to option B.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   The given wavelength shifts (5 mÅ and 7 mÅ) are the *amplitudes* of the periodic shift, which directly relate to the *amplitudes* of the star's radial velocity (K).\n*   The problem simplifies the situation by stating the stars have identical masses, the planets have similar masses, and the orbits are circular. This allows us to cancel out these terms when forming a ratio.\n*   We must assume the orbital inclinations are the same for both systems to directly compare the velocity amplitudes.\n*   The final derivation shows that a larger stellar wobble (larger K or Δλ) implies a *shorter* orbital period. This makes sense: for a planet of the same mass, being closer to the star (shorter period) means it has a higher orbital velocity and exerts a stronger, faster tug on the star, causing a larger stellar velocity.\n*   Be careful not to mix up the ratios. The question asks for T₂ / T₁, so after finding T₁ / T₂ = 2.744, we must take the reciprocal.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nThe calculation is correct. The ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 is approximately 0.36.\n\nHere is a summary of the logic:\n\n1.  The amplitude of the star's radial velocity ($K$) is directly proportional to the observed periodic wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). Therefore, the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes is $K_2/K_1 = \\Delta\\lambda_2 / \\Delta\\lambda_1 = 7/5$.\n2.  For a given star mass and planet mass, the radial velocity amplitude $K$ is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period ($P$). This can be written as $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$.\n3.  Therefore, the ratio of the velocities is related to the ratio of the periods as follows: $K_2/K_1 = (P_2/P_1)^{-1/3} = (P_1/P_2)^{1/3}$.\n4.  Combining these two relationships, we get: $7/5 = (P_1/P_2)^{1/3}$.\n5.  To find the desired ratio, $P_2/P_1$, we solve the equation: $P_2/P_1 = (5/7)^3$.\n6.  The calculation yields $(5/7)^3 \\approx 0.3644$, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nTo determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we need to analyze the relationship between the observed Doppler shift and the planet's orbital period.\n\n### Key Principles of the Radial Velocity Method\nThe radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star.

It is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (the component of its velocity along our line of sight).\n*   **Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):** This is the maximum speed of the star's wobble towards or away from us. K is directly proportional to the maximum observed wavelength shift (Δλ_max).\n*   **Orbital Period (P):** This is the time the planet takes to complete one orbit.\n\n### The Relationship Between Radial Velocity and Orbital Period\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity amplitude (K) is related to the orbital period (P), the star's mass (M_star), and the planet's mass (m_p) by the following proportionality:\n*K ∝ m_p / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3))*\n\nThis relationship shows that for a given star and planet mass, the radial velocity amplitude (K) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period (P).\n\n### Applying the Principles to the Problem\n\n1.  **Information Given:**\n    *   The two stars have identical masses (M_star1 = M_star2).\n    *   The two planets have similar masses (m_p1 ≈ m_p2).\n    *   The orbits are circular.\n    *   The wavelength shift for planet #1 is Δλ₁ = 5 milliangstroms.\n    *   The wavelength shift for planet #2 is Δλ₂ = 7 milliangstroms.\n\n2.  **Relating Shift to Velocity:**\n    Since the radial velocity amplitude (K) is proportional to the wavelength shift (Δλ), the ratio of the amplitudes is:\n    K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n3.  **Calculating the Period Ratio:**\n    From the proportionality K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3), we can write the ratio of the amplitudes in terms of the periods:\n    K₂ / K₁ = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    Now, we substitute the known value of the velocity ratio:\n    1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To find the ratio of the periods, we cube both sides of the equation:\n    (1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n    2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\n    The question asks for the ratio of planet #2's period to planet #1's period (P₂ / P₁). We can find this by taking the reciprocal:\n    P₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.364\n\n    This result indicates that the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.

The gravitational pull of the planet causes the star to \"wobble\" around the system's center of mass. This wobble changes the star's velocity along our line of sight, causing a shift in its spectral lines.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity:** The observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) according to the Doppler effect formula: Δλ/λ₀ = v_r/c. The maximum observed wavelength shift (given in the problem as 5 and 7 miliangstroms) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is called the radial velocity semi-amplitude, denoted by *K*.\n    Therefore, *K* is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift (Δλ_max).\n    *   For planet #1: K₁ ∝ Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ\n    *   For planet #2: K₂ ∝ Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ\n\n3.  **Find the Ratio of Velocities:** We can find the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes for the two stars:\n    K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n4.  **Relate Stellar Velocity (K) to Orbital Period (T):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude *K* is related to the system's parameters.

The measured quantity is the periodic shift of a spectral line, $\\Delta\\lambda$. This shift is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight. The maximum shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is called the RV semi-amplitude, $K$.

This leaves us with a simple proportionality:\n\n    $K \\propto \\frac{1}{T^{1/3}}$ or $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n\n4.  **Solve for the Ratio of Orbital Periods:** Now we can relate the ratio of the K values to the ratio of the T values:\n\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{T_2^{-1/3}}{T_1^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3}$\n\n    We already calculated $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = 1.4$. Plugging this in:\n\n    $1.4 = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3}$\n\n    To find the ratio of the periods, $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$, we need to isolate it. We can do this by raising both sides of the equation to the power of -3:\n\n    $(1.4)^{-3} = \\left(\\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3}\\right)^{-3}$\n\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = (1.4)^{-3}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{1.4^3} = \\frac{1}{2.744} \\approx 0.3644$\n\n    This result means the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1.

The observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_{rad}$) along the line of sight, according to the Doppler effect formula: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_{rad}}{c}$. The maximum wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity, which is the amplitude of the velocity curve, denoted as $K$. Therefore, $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n\n2.  **Ratio of Velocity Amplitudes:** From the problem statement, we are given the maximum wavelength shifts for the two stars:\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms\n    The ratio of the velocity amplitudes is therefore:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n3.  **Relating Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Parameters:** The velocity amplitude ($K$) of a star in a circular orbit can be expressed as:\n    $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_s + M_p} \\sqrt{\\frac{G(M_s + M_p)}{a}}$\n    Where $M_s$ is the star mass, $M_p$ is the planet mass, $i$ is the orbital inclination, $a$ is the semi-major axis, and $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\n    Since the planet mass is much smaller than the star mass ($M_p \\ll M_s$), we can simplify this to:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_s} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_s}{a}}$\n    $K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{M_s \\sqrt{a}}$\n\n4.  **Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period ($P$) to the semi-major axis ($a$):\n    $P^2 \\propto \\frac{a^3}{M_s}$ (again, assuming $M_p \\ll M_s$).\n    This means $a^3 \\propto P^2 M_s$, so $a \\propto (P^2 M_s)^{1/3}$.\n    Substituting this into our expression for $K$:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{M_s \\sqrt{(P^2 M_s)^{1/3}}} = \\frac{M_p}{M_s \\cdot (P^2 M_s)^{1/6}} = \\frac{M_p}{M_s^{1+1/6} \\cdot P^{2/6}} = \\frac{M_p}{M_s^{7/6} \\cdot P^{1/3}}$\n\n5.  **Finding the Period Ratio:** The problem states that the star masses are the same ($M_{s1} = M_{s2}$) and the planet masses are the same ($M_{p1} = M_{p2}$). We also assume the inclinations are statistically similar and cancel out. Therefore, the relationship simplifies to:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$ or $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$.\n\n    We can now write the ratio of the velocity amplitudes in terms of the periods:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    We want to find the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$.

The star \"wobbles\" as the planet orbits it, causing its light to be slightly redshifted as it moves away from us and blueshifted as it moves towards us. The magnitude of this shift is related to the star's radial velocity.\n\n2.  **Relating Wavelength Shift to Velocity Amplitude:** The observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r). The maximum wavelength shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve (K).\n    *   For planet #1, Δλ₁ = 5 milliangstrom.\n    *   For planet #2, Δλ₂ = 7 milliangstrom.\n\n    Since K is directly proportional to Δλ_max, we can find the ratio of the velocity amplitudes:\n    K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n3.  **The Radial Velocity Amplitude Formula:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the stellar velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by the formula:\n    K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * [ mₚ sin(i) / M_★^(2/3) ]\n    Where:\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   mₚ is the planet's mass.\n    *   M_★ is the star's mass.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n    *   i is the orbital inclination.\n\n4.  **Applying the Formula to the Problem:** We are given that the star masses are the same (M_★₁ = M_★₂) and the planet masses are similar (mₚ₁ ≈ mₚ₂). In such problems, it is standard to assume that other unstated parameters, like the orbital inclination (i), are also similar for both systems. With these assumptions, all the terms in the formula except the period (P) are constant for both planets.\n\n    This simplifies the relationship to:\n    K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n5.  **Calculating the Period Ratio:** We can now set up a ratio for the two systems:\n    K₂ / K₁ = (P₂)^(-1/3) / (P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    From step 2, we know that K₂ / K₁ = 1.4. So we can substitute this value into the equation:\n    1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To solve for the ratio of the periods, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n    (1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n    1.4 * 1.4 * 1.4 = 1.96 * 1.4 = 2.744\n    So, P₁ / P₂ = 2.744\n\n6.  **Finding the Final Answer:** The question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which corresponds to the ratio P₂ / P₁.

The search results confirm the formula used.\n\nSpecifically, for a circular orbit (eccentricity e=0) and assuming the planet's mass (m_p) is much smaller than the star's mass (M_star), the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by formulas similar to this one:\n\nK = ( (2πG / P)^(1/3) ) * ( (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3) )\n\nLet's re-verify the derivation based on this confirmed formula.\n\n1.  **Isolate P**: We need to see how P depends on K.\n    *   K ∝ P^(-1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)\n    *   P^(-1/3) ∝ K * M_star^(2/3) / (m_p * sin(i))\n    *   P ∝ [ K * M_star^(2/3) / (m_p * sin(i)) ]^(-3)\n    *   P ∝ K^(-3) * (m_p * sin(i))^3 / M_star^2\n\n2.  **Form the ratio P2 / P1**:\n    *   P2 / P1 = [ K2^(-3) * (m_p2*sin(i2))^3 / M_star2^2 ] / [ K1^(-3) * (m_p1*sin(i1))^3 / M_star1^2 ]\n    *   P2 / P1 = (K1 / K2)^3 * ( (m_p2*sin(i2)) / (m_p1*sin(i1)) )^3 * (M_star1 / M_star2)^2\n\n3.  **Apply the problem's conditions**:\n    *   **Identical star masses**: M_star1 = M_star2. The last term (M_star1 / M_star2)^2 becomes 1.\n    *   **Similar planet masses**: The prompt states the planets have \"masses similar to that of Neptune.\" In the context of the RV method, where `sin(i)` is unknown, this refers to the observable minimum mass, `m_p * sin(i)`. Thus, we assume m_p1*sin(i1) ≈ m_p2*sin(i2). The middle term becomes approximately 1.\n    *   **Wavelength shifts**: The RV amplitude K is directly proportional to the measured wavelength shift Δλ.

The result matches option A.\n\nFinal check of the steps and logic. Everything holds together. No need for further searches.\n\nTo solve this problem, we must relate the orbital period (P) of an exoplanet to the observational data from the radial velocity (RV) method.\n\n1.  **Understanding the RV Method Data**: The periodic shift of a spectral line (Δλ) is caused by the Doppler effect from the star's \"wobble\" as the planet orbits it. The amplitude of this wavelength shift (e.g., 5 mÅ for planet #1) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, known as K. Therefore, we can establish a ratio of the velocity amplitudes:\n    *   K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7\n\n2.  **The Radial Velocity Formula**: For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by the formula:\n    *   K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / Mₛ^(2/3))\n    where P is the orbital period, mₚ is the planet's mass, Mₛ is the star's mass, i is the orbital inclination, and G is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Relating Period (P) to Velocity Amplitude (K)**: We need to rearrange the formula to see how P depends on K. Let's express P in terms of the other variables:\n    *   K³ = (2πG / P) * (mₚ sin(i))³ / Mₛ²\n    *   P = (2πG * (mₚ sin(i))³) / (Mₛ² * K³)\n\n    This shows that the orbital period P is inversely proportional to the cube of the velocity amplitude K (P ∝ 1/K³), assuming all other factors are equal.\n\n4.  **Applying the Problem's Conditions**:\n    *   The stars have the same mass (Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂).\n    *   The planets have masses \"similar to that of Neptune.\" In the context of the RV method, the measured quantity is the minimum mass, mₚ sin(i), as the inclination is generally unknown. Therefore, it is standard to assume that mₚ₁ sin(i₁) ≈ mₚ₂ sin(i₂).\n\n5.  **Calculating the Ratio of the Periods**: Now we can set up the ratio for the orbital periods (P₂ / P₁). Since P ∝ 1/K³, the ratio is:\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\n    Substituting the ratio of the wavelength shifts:\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\n    *   P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nTo determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we can use the principles of the radial velocity (RV) method for exoplanet detection.\n\n### Analysis of the Radial Velocity Method\n\nThe radial velocity method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. This shift is caused by the star's \"wobble\" as it is gravitationally pulled by the orbiting planet. The magnitude of this wobble, known as the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K), is directly proportional to the observed periodic shift in the spectral line's wavelength (Δλ).\n\nThe formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) in the case of a circular orbit is:\n\nK = ( (2πG) / P )^(1/3) * (m_p) / (M_star^(2/3))\n\nWhere:\n*   **P** is the orbital period of the planet.\n*   **m_p** is the mass of the planet.\n*   **M_star** is the mass of the host star.\n*   **G** is the gravitational constant.\n\n### Applying the Formula to the Given Data\n\nWe are given the following information:\n*   The host stars have identical masses (M₁ = M₂).\n*   The planets have similar masses (m_p1 ≈ m_p2).\n*   The orbits are circular.\n*   The wavelength shift for planet #1 (Δλ₁) is 5 miliangstroms.\n*   The wavelength shift for planet #2 (Δλ₂) is 7 miliangstroms.\n\nSince the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is proportional to the wavelength shift (Δλ), we can establish a ratio of the semi-amplitudes for the two systems:\n\nK₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\nNow, let's look at the ratio of the semi-amplitudes using the formula. Since m_p and M_star are the same for both systems, they cancel out, leaving a direct relationship between K and the orbital period P:\n\nK ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is:\n\nK₂ / K₁ = (P₂)^(-1/3) / (P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n### Calculation\n\nWe can now substitute the known ratio of K₂/K₁ into the equation:\n\n1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nTo solve for the ratio of the periods, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n\n(1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 (P₂ / P₁). To find this, we take the reciprocal:\n\nP₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis result indicates that the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This makes physical sense, as a larger stellar wobble (and thus a larger wavelength shift) is caused by a planet that is closer to its star and therefore has a shorter orbital period.\n\nBased on the calculation, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate the Observable to the Star's Velocity:**\n    The Radial Velocity (RV) method measures the periodic Doppler shift of spectral lines from a star. The wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (V_r) along our line of sight:\n    Δλ / λ₀ = V_r / c\n    where λ₀ is the rest wavelength and c is the speed of light.\n\n    The problem gives the amplitude of the periodic wavelength shift for each system. This amplitude corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, known as the RV semi-amplitude, K.\n    Therefore, the RV semi-amplitude K is directly proportional to the measured wavelength shift amplitude Δλ.\n    K ∝ Δλ\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ratio of RV Semi-Amplitudes:**\n    For Planet #1, the shift amplitude is Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ.\n    For Planet #2, the shift amplitude is Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ.\n\n    The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n    K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n3.  **Find the Physical Relationship between K and Orbital Period P:**\n    The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K of a star hosting a planet in a circular orbit (eccentricity e=0) is given by:\n    K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin(i)) / (M_star + M_p)^(2/3)\n\n    Let's analyze the terms based on the problem statement:\n    *   **P:** The orbital period.

We are told the stars have exactly the same mass (M_star1 = M_star2).\n    *   **i:** The inclination of the orbit. We are not given this, but since it is not mentioned, we assume the viewing conditions (sin(i)) are comparable for both systems.\n    *   **G:** The gravitational constant, which is a constant.\n    *   Since the stars are Sun-like and the planets are Neptune-like, M_star >> M_p, so the term (M_star + M_p) ≈ M_star.\n\n    Since M_star, M_p, and sin(i) are treated as being the same for both systems, we can see that K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period P:\n    K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3) or K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n4.  **Solve for the Ratio of the Periods:**\n    We can write the relationship between the two systems as:\n    K₂ / K₁ = (P₂)^(-1/3) / (P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    Now, substitute the value for the ratio of the K's we found in step 2:\n    1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To find the ratio of the periods, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n    (1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n    2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\n    The question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁. So we take the reciprocal:\n    P₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated value is approximately 0.36.

This means the maximum radial velocity of the star (the amplitude, K) is directly proportional to the maximum observed wavelength shift (Δλ_max).\n    *   K ∝ Δλ_max\n\n2.  **Radial Velocity Amplitude (K)**: The amplitude of the star's radial velocity, for a circular orbit (eccentricity e=0), is given by an expression that relates the planet's mass (m_p), the star's mass (M_star), the orbital period (P), and the inclination of the orbit (i). The formula for K, the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity, simplifies to:\n    *   K = (m_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3)) * (2πG / P)^(1/3)\n\nNow, I'll re-apply the logic from the scratchpad with the confirmed formulas.\n\n**Given Information:**\n*   Star masses are equal: M_star1 = M_star2\n*   Planet masses are similar: m_p1 ≈ m_p2\n*   Orbits are circular: e₁ = e₂ = 0\n*   Maximum wavelength shift for planet #1: Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ\n*   Maximum wavelength shift for planet #2: Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ\n*   We need to find the ratio of the periods: P₂ / P₁\n\n**Step 1: Relate wavelength shift to velocity amplitude (K).**\nSince K ∝ Δλ_max, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is:\nK₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n**Step 2: Use the formula for K to relate it to the orbital period.**\nK = (m_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3)) * (2πG / P)^(1/3)\n\nLet's write the ratio K₂ / K₁:\nK₂ / K₁ = [ (m_p2*sin(i₂)/M_star2^(2/3)) * (2πG/P₂)^(1/3) ] / [ (m_p1*sin(i₁)/M_star1^(2/3)) * (2πG/P₁)^(1/3) ]\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the ratio using the given information.**\n*   M_star1 = M_star2, so the M_star terms cancel.\n*   m_p1 ≈ m_p2, so the m_p terms cancel.\n*   The problem does not specify the inclination `i`. The RV method measures `m_p * sin(i)`. When it says the planets have similar masses, it is reasonable to assume the measured `m_p * sin(i)` values are what is being referred to as similar, or that `sin(i)` is assumed to be the same for both. Under this standard assumption for such a problem, the `m_p * sin(i)` terms cancel.\n*   2πG is a constant and cancels out.\n\nThe simplified ratio becomes:\nK₂ / K₁ = (1/P₂)^(1/3) / (1/P₁)^(1/3)\nK₂ / K₁ = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n**Step 4: Solve for the period ratio (P₂ / P₁).**\nWe know K₂ / K₁ = 1.4.\n1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nCube both sides of the equation:\n1.4³ = P₁ / P₂\n2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\nRearrange to find the required ratio, P₂ / P₁:\nP₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744\n\nNow, calculate the final value:\nP₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is very close to 0.36.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This matches option C.\n\nFinal check:\n- Larger wavelength shift (Planet 2) -> Larger stellar velocity K (K₂ > K₁)\n- K is inversely related to the period (K ∝ P⁻¹/³)\n- Therefore, a larger K implies a smaller period (P₂ < P₁).\n- The ratio P₂/P₁ must be less than 1.

The periodic shift in a star's spectral line (Doppler shift) is caused by the star \"wobbling\" due to the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet.\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:** The magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r). Therefore, the amplitude of the wavelength shift is proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity (which is called the RV semi-amplitude, K).\n    *   `K ∝ Δλ`\n    *   This means `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`.\n3.  **Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Period:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude (K) is related to the orbital period (T), the star's mass (M_star), and the planet's mass (m_p) by the formula:\n    *   `K ∝ m_p / (M_star^(2/3) * T^(1/3))`\n4.  **Simplify the Relation:** The problem states that the masses of the two stars are identical (`M_star1 = M_star2`) and the masses of the two planets are similar (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`).

A planet's gravity causes its star to \"wobble\" around their common center of mass. This wobble results in a small, periodic change in the star's velocity along our line of sight (its radial velocity). This change in velocity causes the star's spectral lines to shift back and forth periodically.\n\n*   The relationship between the radial velocity (v_r) and the wavelength shift (Δλ) is given by the Doppler effect formula: Δλ / λ₀ = v_r / c, where λ₀ is the rest wavelength and c is the speed of light.\n*   This means the amplitude of the radial velocity variation, called the RV semi-amplitude (K), is directly proportional to the amplitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ).\n    *   K ∝ Δλ\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Formula for RV Semi-amplitude (K)**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude K of the star is given by:\nK = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin(i)) / (M_star + M_p)^(2/3)\n\nWhere:\n*   P is the orbital period of the planet.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n*   M_p is the mass of the planet.\n*   M_star is the mass of the star.\n*   i is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Formula Using the Information Provided**\n\nThe problem provides several key pieces of information that allow us to simplify the relationship between K and P.\n\n*   **\"Circular orbits\":** This means the eccentricity `e` is 0. The formula used is already for circular orbits.\n*   **\"Stars with exactly the same masses\":** M_star1 = M_star2.\n*   **\"Planets... with masses similar to that of Neptune\":** M_p1 ≈ M_p2.\n*   **\"The stars themselves have masses similar to that of our Sun\":** This confirms that M_star >> M_p (Sun mass >> Neptune mass), so we can approximate (M_star + M_p) ≈ M_star.\n*   **Careful Point (Orbital Inclination `i`):** The problem does not specify the orbital inclination. In such comparative problems, it is standard to assume that the unknown factors are the same for both systems. Therefore, we assume sin(i₁) = sin(i₂).\n\nGiven these simplifications, the terms G, M_p, sin(i), and M_star are all constant when comparing the two systems. Thus, the formula for K simplifies to a proportionality:\n\nK ∝ (1 / P)^(1/3)  or  K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n**Step 4: Combine Proportionalities and Form a Ratio**\n\nWe have two key proportionalities:\n1.  K ∝ Δλ (from Step 1)\n2.  K ∝ P^(-1/3) (from Step 3)\n\nCombining these, we find the relationship between the observed wavelength shift (Δλ) and the orbital period (P):\n\nΔλ ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\nNow we can set up a ratio for the two planet systems:\n\n(Δλ₂ / Δλ₁) = (P₂ / P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n**Step 5: Solve for the Ratio of the Orbital Periods (P₂ / P₁)**\n\nWe need to rearrange the equation to solve for P₂ / P₁.\n\n1.  Start with the ratio: (Δλ₂ / Δλ₁) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n2.  Cube both sides to remove the cube root: (Δλ₂ / Δλ₁)^3 = P₁ / P₂\n3.  Invert both sides to get the desired ratio: P₂ / P₁ = (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)^3\n\n**Step 6: Substitute the Given Values and Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe problem gives us the wavelength shifts:\n*   Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom\n*   Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom\n\nSubstitute these into our final equation:\n\nP₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)^3\nP₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\nP₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.36443\n\nThis result indicates that the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1.

Understanding the Radial Velocity (RV) Method\n\nThe radial velocity method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. As the star and planet orbit their common center of mass, the star moves towards and away from us, causing its spectral lines to shift to the blue and red, respectively. The amplitude of this periodic wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K).\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars (K₁ and K₂) is equal to the ratio of their observed maximum wavelength shifts (Δλ₁ and Δλ₂):\n\n*   K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 1.4\n\n### 2. The Radial Velocity Amplitude Formula\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by the formula:\n\nK = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3))\n\nWhere:\n*   `P` is the orbital period of the planet.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `m_p` is the mass of the planet.\n*   `M_star` is the mass of the star.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n\nThis formula shows that the radial velocity amplitude `K` is proportional to the inverse cube root of the orbital period, `P^(-1/3)`.\n\n### 3. Setting up the Ratio\n\nWe can write the equation for each of the two systems:\n\n*   **System 1:** K₁ = C₁ * (1 / P₁)^(1/3)\n*   **System 2:** K₂ = C₂ * (1 / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nThe term `C` combines all the other factors: C = (m_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3)) * (2πG)^(1/3).\n\nFrom the problem description, we know:\n*   The stars have the same mass (M₁ = M₂).\n*   The planets have similar masses (m_p1 ≈ m_p2).\n*   Since nothing is stated about the inclination, we assume it is similar for both systems for a meaningful comparison (sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂)).\n\nGiven these equalities and similarities, the constant `C` is approximately the same for both systems (C₁ ≈ C₂).\n\n### 4. Calculating the Period Ratio\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the velocities:\n\nK₂ / K₁ = (C₂ * (1 / P₂)^(1/3)) / (C₁ * (1 / P₁)^(1/3))\n\nSince C₁ ≈ C₂, they cancel out:\n\nK₂ / K₁ = ((1 / P₂) / (1 / P₁))^(1/3)\nK₂ / K₁ = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nWe already calculated that K₂ / K₁ = 1.4. So we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\n1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nTo solve for the period ratio, we cube both sides of the equation:\n\n(1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\nThe question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁. To get this, we take the reciprocal of our result:\n\nP₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744\nP₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times the orbital period of planet #1. This value corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nThe search results confirm the physics I used.\n\n*   **Doppler Shift and Radial Velocity:** The radial velocity ($v_r$) is related to the wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) by the Doppler formula $v_r = c (\\Delta\\lambda / \\lambda_0)$. This confirms that the observed wavelength shift is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity. The maximum shift corresponds to the radial velocity semi-amplitude, K.\n*   **RV Semi-Amplitude (K):** For a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude K is given by a formula that depends on the orbital period (P or T), the planet's mass ($M_p$), the star's mass ($M_{star}$), and the orbital inclination ($i$). Several sources give variations of the formula, which is consistent with the one I derived:\n\n    $K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3} P^{1/3}}$\n\n*   **Problem Interpretation:** The key assumptions from the problem statement are:\n    *   $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$ (explicitly stated).\n    *   Orbits are circular (explicitly stated).\n    *   $M_{p1} \\approx M_{p2}$ and we can assume $\\sin i_1 \\approx \\sin i_2$. The problem says the planets have \"masses similar to that of Neptune.\" In the context of RV measurements, which determine the minimum mass ($M_p \\sin i$), it's a standard simplification in such problems to assume the $M_p \\sin i$ term is the same for both systems.\n\nBased on this, my derivation remains correct.\n\nLet's quickly re-state the logic:\n\n1.  The RV semi-amplitude (K) is proportional to the maximum wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$).\n    *   $K_1 \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ mÅ\n    *   $K_2 \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ mÅ\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of semi-amplitudes is $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$.\n\n2.  The formula for the semi-amplitude shows its dependency on the orbital period (P):\n    *   $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$ when other parameters ($M_{star}$, $M_p \\sin i$) are held constant.\n\n3.  We can set up a ratio for the two systems:\n    *   $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n4.  Now, we solve for the ratio of the periods, $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$:\n    *   $\\frac{7}{5} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    *   Cube both sides: $\\left(\\frac{7}{5}\\right)^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n    *   $\\frac{343}{125} = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n    *   Invert the fraction to get the desired ratio: $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\n5.  Calculate the final numerical value:\n    *   $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThis result matches option C. The reasoning is sound and confirmed by the physics of the radial velocity method.\n\nFinal check of the question: \"How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\" This asks for the ratio $T_2 / T_1$. My calculation correctly solves for this ratio. The result is less than 1, meaning the period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1.\n\nThe reasoning is solid. I'm ready for the final answer.\n\n### Final Calculation Review\n- $K_2/K_1 = 7/5 = 1.4$\n- $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n- $K_2/K_1 = (P_2/P_1)^{-1/3}$\n- $1.4 = (P_2/P_1)^{-1/3}$\n- $(P_2/P_1)^{1/3} = 1/1.4$\n- $P_2/P_1 = (1/1.4)^3 = 1 / (1.4^3) = 1 / 2.744 \\approx 0.3644$\nThe answer is C.\n\nTo provide a final answer, I will outline the steps clearly based on the established physics.\n\n**1. Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:**\nThe measured periodic wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$).\n*   $K_1 \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5 \\text{ mÅ}$\n*   $K_2 \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7 \\text{ mÅ}$\n*   This gives the ratio of the semi-amplitudes: $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\n**2. Use the Radial Velocity Formula:**\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n$K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_{\\star}^{2/3}}$\nwhere P is the orbital period, $M_p$ is the planet mass, $M_{\\star}$ is the star mass, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\n**3. Apply the Given Conditions:**\nThe problem states that the stellar masses are identical ($M_{\\star1} = M_{\\star2}$) and the planet masses are similar ($M_{p1} \\approx M_{p2}$). As the radial velocity method measures the minimum mass ($M_p \\sin i$), and no information on inclination is given, we assume the detectable quantity $M_p \\sin i$ is the same for both planets. Therefore, all terms in the equation are constant except for K and P.\n\nThis simplifies the relationship to:\n$K \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$ or $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n**4. Calculate the Period Ratio:**\nWe can write the relationship for the two planets as a ratio:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{P_2^{-1/3}}{P_1^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nNow, substitute the known values:\n$\\frac{7}{5} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nTo find the required ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$, we first cube both sides:\n$\\left(\\frac{7}{5}\\right)^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n$\\frac{343}{125} = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n\nFinally, we invert the expression:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36, which corresponds to option C.\n\nThis detailed derivation confirms the choice. No further search or calculation is needed.\n\nFinal answer format is <<<X>>>.\n\nThe calculation leads directly to option C.\n\nTo be extra certain there is no misinterpretation, let's analyze the phrase \"How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\".\nThis is $T_2/T_1$. If $T_2$ were twice as long as $T_1$, the answer would be 2. My result is ~0.36. This means planet #2 has a shorter period. The phrasing of the question can be interpreted as just asking for the ratio, regardless of whether it's longer or shorter. The options provided are all numbers, so they represent the value of the ratio $T_2/T_1$.\n\nSeems everything is in order.\n<<<C>>>The relationship between the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude (K) of a star and the orbital period (P) of its planet can be derived from the laws of gravity and motion. For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude is:\n\n$K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_{\\star}^{2/3}}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $P$ is the orbital period of the planet.\n*   $M_p$ is the mass of the planet.\n*   $M_{\\star}$ is the mass of the host star.\n*   $i$ is the inclination of the planet's orbit to our line of sight.\n*   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\nThe periodic shift of a spectral line ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity. Therefore, the maximum shift is proportional to the RV semi-amplitude, K.\n\nFrom the problem, we have:\n*   For Planet #1, the shift is $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms.\n*   For Planet #2, the shift is $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms.\n\nThis implies that the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\nThe problem states that the stars have the same mass ($M_{\\star1} = M_{\\star2}$) and the planets have similar masses ($M_{p1} \\approx M_{p2}$). The RV method measures the minimum mass, $M_p \\sin i$. In the context of such a problem, it is assumed that this measured quantity is the same for both systems. With these parameters being equal for both systems, the formula simplifies to show that the semi-amplitude $K$ is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period $P$:\n\n$K \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$\n\nWe can now write a ratio for the two planet-star systems:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{P_1^{1/3}}{P_2^{1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nSubstituting the known ratio of the semi-amplitudes:\n$\\frac{7}{5} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1, which is $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$.

Understanding the Radial Velocity Method\nThe radial velocity method detects exoplanets by measuring the small periodic shift in a star's spectral lines. This shift is caused by the Doppler effect as the star \"wobbles\" due to the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The magnitude of this wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (the component of its velocity along our line of sight). The maximum radial velocity observed is called the semi-amplitude (K).\n\n### 2. Relating Observations to Physical Quantities\n*   The wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K).\n*   For Planet #1, the wavelength shift is Δλ₁ = 5 milliangstroms.\n*   For Planet #2, the wavelength shift is Δλ₂ = 7 milliangstroms.\n*   Therefore, the ratio of their radial velocity semi-amplitudes is K₂ / K₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4.\n\n### 3. The Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude Formula\nFor a planet in a circular orbit (eccentricity e=0), the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) of the star is given by the formula:\n\nK = ( (2πG) / P )^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i)) / (Mₛ)^(2/3)\n\nWhere:\n*   P is the orbital period of the planet.\n*   mₚ is the mass of the planet.\n*   Mₛ is the mass of the star.\n*   i is the inclination of the planet's orbit relative to our line of sight.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n### 4. Setting up the Ratio\nWe can write the formula for each of the two systems:\n\n*   K₁ = ( (2πG) / P₁ )^(1/3) * (mₚ₁ sin(i₁)) / (Mₛ₁)^(2/3)\n*   K₂ = ( (2πG) / P₂ )^(1/3) * (mₚ₂ sin(i₂)) / (Mₛ₂)^(2/3)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio K₂ / K₁.\n\n### 5. Simplifying the Ratio Based on Given Information\nThe problem provides the following crucial details which allow us to cancel out terms:\n*   The stars have the same mass: Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂.\n*   The planets have similar masses: mₚ₁ ≈ mₚ₂.\n*   It is reasonable to assume the orbital inclinations are similar (i₁ ≈ i₂), as no difference is stated. In the context of such problems, unless specified otherwise, we assume comparable observing conditions.\n\nBy dividing the equation for K₂ by the equation for K₁, the following terms cancel out: mₚ, Mₛ, sin(i), 2, π, and G.\n\n(K₂ / K₁) = [ (1/P₂)^(1/3) ] / [ (1/P₁)^(1/3) ]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n(K₂ / K₁) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n### 6. Solving for the Period Ratio\nWe can now substitute the known value of the velocity ratio (K₂ / K₁ = 1.4) into the simplified equation and solve for the period ratio (P₂ / P₁).\n\n1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nTo isolate the period ratio, we cube both sides of the equation:\n\n1.4³ = P₁ / P₂\n2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\nThe question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁. To get this, we take the reciprocal:\n\nP₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744\nP₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\n### 7. Conclusion\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This corresponds to option D.

Therefore, K is directly proportional to Δλ_max.\n\nK ∝ Δλ_max\n\nWe are given:\nΔλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom\nΔλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom\n\nThe ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\nK₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5\n\n**Step 2: Relate the RV semi-amplitude (K) to the orbital parameters.**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude is given by the formula:\nK = (mₚ * sin(i) / Mₛ) * √(G * Mₛ / a)\nwhere mₚ is the planet's mass, Mₛ is the star's mass, a is the semi-major axis (the orbital radius for a circular orbit), i is the orbital inclination, and G is the gravitational constant.\n\nWe are given that the stars have the same mass (Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂), and the planets have similar masses (mₚ₁ = mₚ₂). Since the problem provides a single numerical answer, we must assume that other unknown factors, like the orbital inclination (i), are the same for both systems. With these assumptions, the term (mₚ * sin(i) / Mₛ) * √(G * Mₛ) is constant for both systems.\n\nTherefore, K is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis (a):\nK ∝ 1 / √a\n\nWe can write the ratio of the semi-amplitudes in terms of the semi-major axes:\nK₂ / K₁ = √(a₁) / √(a₂) = √(a₁ / a₂)\n\n**Step 3: Combine the results from Step 1 and Step 2 to find the ratio of the semi-major axes.**\n\nWe have two expressions for the ratio K₂ / K₁:\n7 / 5 = √(a₁ / a₂)\n\nSquaring both sides gives:\n(7 / 5)² = a₁ / a₂\n49 / 25 = a₁ / a₂\n\nSo, the ratio of the semi-major axis of planet #2 to that of planet #1 is:\na₂ / a₁ = 25 / 49\n\n**Step 4: Use Kepler's Third Law to relate the orbital period (T) to the semi-major axis (a).**\n\nKepler's Third Law states:\nT² ∝ a³ / (Mₛ + mₚ)\n\nSince the mass of the star (Mₛ) and the mass of the planet (mₚ) are the same for both systems, the term (Mₛ + mₚ) is constant. Therefore, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:\nT² ∝ a³  or  T ∝ a^(3/2)\n\nThe ratio of the orbital periods is:\nT₂ / T₁ = (a₂ / a₁)^(3/2)\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final ratio of the orbital periods.**\n\nSubstitute the ratio of the semi-major axes (a₂ / a₁ = 25 / 49) into the equation from Step 4:\nT₂ / T₁ = (25 / 49)^(3/2)\nT₂ / T₁ = (√(25 / 49))³\nT₂ / T₁ = (5 / 7)³\nT₂ / T₁ = 125 / 343\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\nT₂ / T₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is closest to 0.36.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Radial Velocity (RV) Method**\n    The RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. As the star \"wobbles\" due to the gravitational pull of the planet, the light we receive from it is alternately blueshifted (when moving towards us) and redshifted (when moving away). The magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's maximum radial velocity, also known as the velocity semi-amplitude (K).\n\n    Therefore, we can establish a ratio:\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n2.  **Relating Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Parameters**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity amplitude (K) is given by the formula:\n\n    K ≈ (2πG)^(1/3) * (mₚ / Mₛ^(2/3)) * (1 / P^(1/3))\n\n    where:\n    *   mₚ is the mass of the planet.\n    *   Mₛ is the mass of the star.\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Simplifying the Relationship**\n    The problem states that the masses of the two stars are identical (Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂) and the masses of the two planets are also similar (mₚ₁ = mₚ₂). Since G is a constant, most of the terms in the equation are the same for both systems. This simplifies the relationship to a direct proportionality:\n\n    K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\n4.  **Calculating the Period Ratio**\n    We can now set up a ratio for the two systems:\n    K₁ / K₂ = (1 / P₁^(1/3)) / (1 / P₂^(1/3))\n    K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n\n    We want to find the ratio P₂ / P₁, so we rearrange the equation:\n    P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\n5.  **Substituting the Given Values**\n    We know the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is the same as the ratio of their measured wavelength shifts:\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 miliangstrom / 7 miliangstrom = 5/7\n\n    Now, substitute this value back into the equation for the period ratio:\n    P₂ / P₁ = (5/7)³\n    P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\n    P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis result shows that the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThe reasoning and derivation seem solid. The search results confirm the key concepts.\n\n1.  **Doppler Shift and Radial Velocity**: The radial velocity (v_r) is calculated from the Doppler shift (Δλ) using the formula v_r = (Δλ/λ) * c. Therefore, the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K), which is the maximum radial velocity, is directly proportional to the maximum observed wavelength shift (Δλ_max).\n\n2.  **Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude (K) and Orbital Period (P)**: The search results show the formula for the semi-amplitude K. For a circular orbit (eccentricity e=0) and assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's (m_p << M_star), the formula is confirmed as K ≈ (2πG/P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3). This confirms that K is proportional to P^(-1/3).\n\nLet's summarize the problem's conditions and my derived relationship:\n*   M_star1 = M_star2 (Same stellar masses)\n*   m_p1 ≈ m_p2 (Similar planet masses)\n*   e1 = e2 = 0 (Circular orbits)\n*   We assume sin(i1) ≈ sin(i2) as it's the only way to solve it, and no other information is given.\n*   The wavelength shifts (Δλ) are directly proportional to the RV semi-amplitude (K).\n*   Δλ1 = 5 mÅ, so K1 ∝ 5.\n*   Δλ2 = 7 mÅ, so K2 ∝ 7.\n\nFrom the physics, we established:\nK ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\nThis leads to the ratio:\nK2 / K1 = (P1 / P2)^(1/3)\n\nSolving for the ratio of the periods (P2 / P1):\nP2 / P1 = (K1 / K2)³\n\nPlugging in the values proportional to K:\nP2 / P1 = (5 / 7)³\n\nCalculation:\nP2 / P1 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis result matches option A. The logic is sound and confirmed by the fundamental equations of the radial velocity method.\n\nFinal check of the question: \"How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\" This asks for the ratio P2 / P1.\n\nThe calculation yielded P2 / P1 ≈ 0.36.\n\nTherefore, the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\nFinal conclusion is firm.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nThe search results confirm the steps and formulas used in the initial reasoning.\n\n1.  **Doppler Shift and Radial Velocity:** The formula `v_r = c * (Δλ / λ_rest)` shows that the radial velocity (v_r) is directly proportional to the wavelength shift (Δλ). Therefore, the ratio of the maximum radial velocities (the semi-amplitudes, K) is equal to the ratio of the maximum wavelength shifts.\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4.\n\n2.  **Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude Formula:** The search results provide the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for a star with an orbiting planet. For a circular orbit (eccentricity e=0), the formula simplifies. Several sources confirm that K is proportional to P⁻¹ᐟ³.\n    The general form is `K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))`.\n\n3.  **Applying the Formula to the Problem:**\n    *   We are given M₁ = M₂.\n    *   The phrase \"detected... both with masses similar to that of Neptune\" implies that the measured quantity, the minimum mass (`m_p * sin(i)`), is the same for both planets.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio K₂ / K₁ simplifies to `(P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)`.\n\n4.  **Calculation:**\n    *   1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n    *   (1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n    *   2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis result matches option C. The reasoning is sound and confirmed by the literature.\n\nFinal check of the question and options.\nQuestion: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?
