Understand the Reaction and the Goal**\n\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a benzene ring with different substituents. We need to arrange the starting substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-monobromo derivative. Since the molar mass of all monobromo isomers (ortho, meta, para) is the same for a given starting material, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the molar percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\n\nSubstituents on a benzene ring can be classified based on their directing effect in electrophilic substitution:\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions. They generally have a high yield of the para-isomer.\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They will have a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n\nLet's classify the given substituents:\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:**\n    *   1) -CH3 (Toluene)\n    *   5) -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n*   **Meta-directors:**\n    *   4) -NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n**3. Initial Ordering**\n\nSince meta-directors produce very little para-product, and ortho, para-directors produce a significant amount, we can immediately say that the substances with meta-directing groups will come first in the list (lowest para yield), followed by the substances with ortho, para-directing groups.\n\nOrder: {4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}\n\n**4. Ordering the Meta-Directors (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is very small. The order depends on the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group makes the ring less reactive and more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the ortho and para isomers.\n\n*   **-NO2 (4):** This is one of the strongest deactivating groups. It will produce the lowest amount of para-product.\n*   **-COOH (6) and -COOC2H5 (2):** Both are strongly deactivating, but less so than -NO2. The -COOH group is generally considered slightly more deactivating than the -COOC2H5 group because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group (-C2H5) in the ester slightly reduces the electron-withdrawing power of the carbonyl group.\n\nTherefore, the order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\nThis means the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order: -NO2 < -COOH < -COOC2H5.\nSo, the order for this group is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**5. Ordering the Ortho, Para-Directors (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these groups, we need to compare the ratio of the para-product to the ortho-product. A higher para/ortho ratio means a higher overall percentage of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **-CH3 (1, Toluene):** This is a relatively small group. It gives a significant amount of both ortho and para products, with the para-isomer being favored (typically ~67% para).\n*   **-C2H5 (5, Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance makes attack at the ortho positions more difficult, thus increasing the proportion of the para-product compared to toluene. So, the para yield for ethylbenzene is greater than for toluene.\n*   **-Cl (3, Chlorobenzene):** The chlorine atom is an ortho, para-director, but it's deactivating. Its strong inductive effect (-I effect) is distance-dependent and deactivates the ortho positions more strongly than the para position. This electronic factor, combined with steric hindrance, strongly favors the para position. The para yield for the bromination of chlorobenzene is very high (typically ~87%). This yield is generally higher than that for ethylbenzene.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\nSo, the order for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**6. Final Combined Order**\n\nCombining the two groups, we get the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nFinal Order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo arrange the given substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction, we must analyze the directing effects of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### **Analysis of Substituents**\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents based on their electronic effects and directing properties:\n\n*   **Activating, Ortho/Para-Directing Groups:** These groups donate electron density to the benzene ring, increasing its reactivity towards electrophiles and directing substitution to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   **-CH3 (Toluene, 1):** Activating, ortho/para-directing.\n    *   **-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene, 5):** Activating, ortho/para-directing.\n\n*   **Deactivating, Ortho/Para-Directing Groups:** These groups withdraw electron density (deactivating the ring) but still direct incoming groups to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   **-Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3):** Deactivating, ortho/para-directing.\n\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups strongly withdraw electron density from the ring, making it much less reactive and directing substitution to the meta position. Consequently, they produce very low yields of the para-isomer.\n    *   **-NO2 (Nitrobenzene, 4):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   **-COOH (Benzoic acid, 6):** Deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   **-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate, 2):** Deactivating, meta-directing.\n\n### **Ordering the Substances**\n\nThe substances with meta-directing groups will have the lowest yields of the para-isomer, while those with ortho/para-directing groups will have the highest.\n\n#### **1. Meta-Directing Substances (Lowest Para Yield)**\n\nFor nitrobenzene (4), benzoic acid (6), and ethyl benzoate (2), the major product is the meta-isomer. The yield of the para-isomer is minimal. The order among these is determined by the strength of the deactivating effect.\n\n*   **Nitrobenzene (-NO2, 4):** The nitro group is one of the strongest deactivating groups. Bromination of nitrobenzene yields almost exclusively the meta-isomer, with only trace amounts of the para product (around 0-5%).\n*   **Benzoic acid (-COOH, 6):** The carboxylic acid group is also strongly deactivating. The para-isomer yield is very low, typically around 1-2%.\n*   **Ethyl benzoate (-COOC2H5, 2):** The ester group is a strong deactivator, similar to a carboxylic acid. Data for nitration (a similar electrophilic substitution) shows about 5% para-product, which is slightly higher than for the other meta-directors.\n\nBased on the deactivating strength and typical isomer distributions, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is:\n**Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**\n\n#### **2. Ortho/Para-Directing Substances (Highest Para Yield)**\n\nFor toluene (1), ethylbenzene (5), and chlorobenzene (3), the major products are the ortho and para isomers. The ratio between them is determined primarily by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will sterically hinder the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para product.\n\n*   **Toluene (-CH3, 1):** The methyl group is relatively small. Conventional bromination of toluene yields about 30-40% ortho-isomer and 60-70% para-isomer.\n*   **Ethylbenzene (-C2H5, 5):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions leads to a higher yield of the para-isomer compared to toluene. For example, in mercuration, the para-product percentage increases from 79.2% for toluene to 83.2% for ethylbenzene. A similar trend is expected for bromination.\n*   **Chlorobenzene (-Cl, 3):** The chloro group is an ortho/para-director. While deactivating, it gives a very high yield of the para-isomer upon bromination, around 89%.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\n**Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**\n\n### **Final Combined Order**\n\nCombining the two groups, we get the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence: Nitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate < Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo solve this problem, we need to arrange the given benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. The weight fraction of the para-isomer is directly proportional to its percentage yield.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Directing Effects:** First, we'll classify each substituent on the benzene ring as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*.\n    *   *Ortho, para-directors* yield a high percentage of the para-isomer.\n    *   *Meta-directors* yield a very low percentage of the para-isomer.\n\n2.  **Group the Substances:**\n    *   **Ortho, para-directors:** -CH3 (1), -C2H5 (5), -Cl (3).\n    *   **Meta-directors:** -NO2 (4), -COOC2H5 (2), -COOH (6).\n    This means the final sequence will have substances 4, 2, and 6 at the beginning (in some order) and 1, 5, and 3 at the end (in some order).\n\n3.  **Order the Meta-Directors:** For meta-directors, the para-isomer is a very minor product. The yield decreases as the deactivating (and meta-directing) strength of the group increases.\n    *   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n\n4.  **Order the Ortho, Para-Directors:** For these, the para-isomer is a major product. The yield depends on the para/ortho ratio, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n    *   **-CH3 (1, Toluene):** Gives a high para yield (~67%), but generally the lowest among these three due to its relatively small size allowing for more ortho attack.\n    *   **-C2H5 (5, Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group is bulkier than methyl, causing more steric hindrance at the ortho positions. This increases the para-isomer yield compared to toluene.\n    *   **-Cl (3, Chlorobenzene):** While halogens are deactivating, they are strongly para-directing. Literature data often shows that the para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (~89%) is very high, even slightly higher than for bulky alkyl groups like tert-butylbenzene (~88%). This suggests the order of increasing para yield is Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\n    *   Thus, the order is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\n5.  **Combine the Orders:** By combining the two groups, we get the final sequence.\n    *   (4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n    *   The complete order is: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3.\n\n6.  **Match with Options:** This sequence matches option C. The following Python code will verify this logic by sorting the substances based on their approximate para-isomer yields.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem by ordering substances based on the para-isomer yield\n    in electrophilic bromination.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Define substances with their number, name, and directing group type.\n    # We also assign an approximate para-isomer percentage yield based on chemical principles and literature data.\n    # C6H5- means a benzene ring.\n    # 1) С6H5-CH3 (Toluene)\n    # 2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n    # 3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n    # 4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n    # 5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n    # 6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n\n    substances = {\n        1: {'name': 'Toluene', 'group': '-CH3', 'type': 'o,p-director', 'para_yield': 67},\n        2: {'name': 'Ethyl benzoate', 'group': '-COOC2H5', 'type': 'm-director', 'para_yield': 4},\n        3: {'name': 'Chlorobenzene', 'group': '-Cl', 'type': 'o,p-director', 'para_yield': 89},\n        4: {'name': 'Nitrobenzene', 'group': '-NO2', 'type': 'm-director', 'para_yield': 1},\n        5: {'name': 'Ethylbenzene', 'group': '-C2H5', 'type': 'o,p-director', 'para_yield': 85}, # Less than Cl, more than CH3\n        6: {'name': 'Benzoic acid', 'group': '-COOH', 'type': 'm-director', 'para_yield': 2}\n    }\n\n    # Step 3: Sort the substances based on their para-isomer yield in increasing order.\n    # The sorted() function takes a list of items and a key.

The substituent already on the benzene ring (C6H5-) directs the incoming bromine electrophile (Br+) to specific positions. The yield of the para-isomer depends on the nature of this substituent.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the substituents**\nWe need to classify the substituents into two main categories:\n1.  **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The products are a mixture of ortho and para isomers.\n    *   1) -CH3 (methyl group)\n    *   5) -C2H5 (ethyl group)\n    *   3) -Cl (chloro group)\n2.  **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. The para-isomer is formed in very small amounts.\n    *   4) -NO2 (nitro group)\n    *   6) -COOH (carboxyl group)\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (ester group)\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the para-isomer yield for meta-directors**\nSubstances with meta-directing groups (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest yields of the para-isomer. The amount of para-product formed is inversely related to how strongly the group deactivates the ring towards ortho/para attack.\n*   The deactivating strength of these groups follows the order: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n*   The -NO2 group is the strongest deactivator, so it will give the lowest yield of the para-isomer.\n*   The -COOC2H5 group is the weakest deactivator among the three, so it will give the highest yield of the para-isomer among this group.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for these substances is: 4 < 6 < 2.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the para-isomer yield for ortho, para-directors**\nSubstances with ortho, para-directing groups (1, 3, 5) will have much higher yields of the para-isomer. The distribution between the ortho and para positions depends on steric and electronic factors. A higher para/ortho ratio leads to a higher percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** The para position is sterically unhindered, while the ortho positions are adjacent to the substituent. A bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher yield of the para-isomer. The order of steric bulk is: -C2H5 > -CH3 > -Cl.\n*   **Electronic Effects:** For halogens like -Cl, a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) deactivates the ortho position more than the para position, which also favors para substitution.\n*   **Comparing the groups:**\n    *   **-CH3 (1):** The methyl group has moderate steric bulk. The para-isomer is favored over the ortho, but the ortho product is still significant. (Para yield is ~67%).\n    *   **-Cl (3):** The combination of steric hindrance and the strong deactivating inductive effect at the ortho position makes the para-isomer highly favored. (Para yield is ~87%).\n    *   **-C2H5 (5):** The ethyl group is significantly bulkier than the methyl group. This large steric hindrance makes the para-isomer extremely favored. (Para yield is ~94%).\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for these substances is: 1 < 3 < 5.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the results to get the final order**\nWe combine the two groups. The meta-directors have the lowest para yields, followed by the ortho, para-directors.\n*   Order of meta-directors: 4 < 6 < 2\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: 1 < 3 < 5\n*   Combining them gives the final order of increasing para-isomer yield: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**\n\n**Step 6: Compare with the given options**\nLet's check the provided options against our derived correct order (4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5).\n*   A) 3<5<1<6<2<4 - Incorrect.\n*   B) 4<6<2<1<5<3 - This option correctly orders the meta-directors (4 < 6 < 2) and correctly identifies toluene (1) as the least para-selective of the o,p-directors. However, it incorrectly swaps the order of ethylbenzene (5) and chlorobenzene (3). The correct order is 3 < 5, not 5 < 3.\n*   C) 4<2<6<3<1<5 - Incorrect.\n*   D) 6<2<4<5<1<3 - Incorrect.\n\nAmong the given choices, option B is the closest to the chemically correct order. It correctly orders the first four substances in the sequence (4 < 6 < 2 < 1). The only error is the relative order of the last two substances. In the context of a multiple-choice question with a likely error, this is the best possible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents**\n\nFirst, we need to classify the substituent on each benzene ring (C6H5-). Substituents determine the position (ortho, meta, or para) where the incoming electrophile (Br+) will attack and the rate of the reaction.\n\n*   **Activating, ortho/para-directing groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive than benzene. They direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) -CH3 (methyl): Activating\n    *   5) -C2H5 (ethyl): Activating\n*   **Deactivating, ortho/para-directing groups:** These groups withdraw electron density (deactivating the ring) but have lone pairs that can donate through resonance, directing the electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   3) -Cl (chloro): Deactivating\n*   **Deactivating, meta-directing groups:** These groups strongly withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive. They direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position.\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (ethyl carboxylate)\n    *   4) -NO2 (nitro)\n    *   6) -COOH (carboxylic acid)\n\n**Step 2: Separate into low-yield and high-yield groups**\n\nBased on the directing effects, we can separate the substances into two groups:\n*   **Low para-yield group (meta-directors):** For these substances, the para-isomer is a very minor product. The main product is the meta-isomer. This group includes substances 2, 4, and 6.\n*   **High para-yield group (ortho/para-directors):** For these substances, the para-isomer is a major product, along with the ortho-isomer. This group includes substances 1, 3, and 5.\n\nThe final ordered list will have all the meta-directors first, followed by the ortho/para-directors.\n\n**Step 3: Order the substances within the low-yield (meta-directing) group**\n\nThe substances are 4 (-NO2), 6 (-COOH), and 2 (-COOC2H5). For these meta-directors, the amount of para-product formed is inversely proportional to the strength of the deactivating/meta-directing effect. A stronger deactivating group will lead to a higher percentage of the meta-isomer and consequently a lower percentage of the para-isomer.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n(Nitro is one of the strongest deactivators, followed by carboxylic acid, and then the ester).\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing yield of the para-isomer is the reverse of the deactivating strength:\n**4 (-NO2) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC2H5)**\n\n**Step 4: Order the substances within the high-yield (ortho/para-directing) group**\n\nThe substances are 1 (-CH3), 5 (-C2H5), and 3 (-Cl). The yield of the para-isomer depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing 1 (-CH3) and 5 (-C2H5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The primary difference is their size. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This larger size creates more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, making the para position relatively more accessible for the incoming bromine. Therefore, ethylbenzene is expected to give a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   Order: **1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5)**\n\n*   **Comparing with 3 (-Cl):** The chloro group is deactivating but directs ortho/para. For halogens, electronic factors cause a strong preference for substitution at the para position compared to the ortho position. The deactivating inductive effect is felt more strongly at the ortho position than the para position. This leads to a very high para/ortho ratio. Experimental data shows that the bromination of chlorobenzene yields about 87% of the para-isomer, which is higher than the yield from toluene (about 67%). It is also expected to be higher than the yield from ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, chlorobenzene (3) will have the highest para-isomer yield in this group.\n\nCombining these findings, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\n**1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl)**\n\n**Step 5: Combine the two groups to get the final order**\n\nWe combine the ordered low-yield group and the ordered high-yield group. The para-yield for any ortho/para-director will be significantly greater than for any meta-director.\n\n*   Low-yield order: 4 < 6 < 2\n*   High-yield order: 1 < 5 < 3\n\nCombining them gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence:\nC6H5-NO2 < C6H5-COOH < C6H5-COOC2H5 < C6H5-CH3 < C6H5-C2H5 < C6H5-Cl\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nB) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nThe derived order matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### **Analysis of Substituents**\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents into two groups: ortho-, para-directing and meta-directing.\n\n*   **Ortho-, Para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the positions ortho and para to themselves.\n    *   1) **-CH3** (Toluene): Activating group.\n    *   5) **-C2H5** (Ethylbenzene): Activating group.\n    *   3) **-Cl** (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating group, but still ortho-, para-directing.\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. The yield of the para-isomer for these substances will be very low.\n    *   4) **-NO2** (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   2) **-COOC2H5** (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   6) **-COOH** (Benzoic acid)\n\n### **Ordering the Substances**\n\n**1. Meta-directing groups (Lowest para-yield):**\n\nSubstances with meta-directing groups will produce the smallest amount of the para-isomer.\n*   **Nitrobenzene (4):** The -NO2 group is a very strong deactivating, meta-director. Bromination of nitrobenzene requires harsh conditions and yields almost exclusively the meta-isomer (m-bromonitrobenzene). The para-isomer yield is negligible, often less than 1%.\n*   **Ethyl benzoate (2) and Benzoic acid (6):** The -COOC2H5 and -COOH groups are also deactivating and meta-directing. While still producing very low amounts of the para-isomer, they are generally less deactivating than the nitro group. For bromination of benzoic acid, the distribution is approximately 75-80% meta, 20-25% ortho, and only a very small fraction (1-2%) para. The ester group (-COOC2H5) behaves similarly to the carboxylic acid group.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-yield among the meta-directors is: **4 (-NO2) < 2 (-COOC2H5) ≈ 6 (-COOH)**. The options provided distinguish between 2 and 6, and typically the ester group is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid, but both result in very low para yields. Based on typical data, the order is generally considered **4 < 2 < 6**.\n\n**2. Ortho-, Para-directing groups (Highest para-yield):**\n\nFor these groups, the formation of the para-isomer is favored, and the yield is influenced by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para-product.\n\n*   **Chlorobenzene (3):** The -Cl group is ortho-, para-directing. For bromination, the para-isomer is the major product due to the steric bulk and electronic effect of the chlorine atom. The typical distribution for bromination gives a high yield of the para-isomer, often around 87-90%.\n*   **Toluene (1):** The -CH3 group is less sterically hindering than -Cl or -C2H5. During bromination, it yields a significant amount of both ortho and para products. The para-isomer yield is typically around 33-40%.\n*   **Ethylbenzene (5):** The -C2H5 group is bulkier than the -CH3 group. This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions leads to a greater preference for para-substitution compared to toluene. The para-isomer yield for bromination of ethylbenzene is higher than for toluene, typically around 40-50%.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-yield among the ortho-, para-directors is: **1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl)**.\n\n### **Final Combined Order**\n\nCombining the two groups, we get the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n\n1.  **Nitrobenzene (4):** Lowest yield (<1%).\n2.  **Ethyl benzoate (2):** Very low yield (~1-2%).\n3.  **Benzoic acid (6):** Very low yield (~1-2%, slightly different from the ester).\n4.  **Toluene (1):** Moderate para yield (~33-40%).\n5.  **Ethylbenzene (5):** Higher para yield than toluene due to sterics (~40-50%).\n6.  **Chlorobenzene (3):** Highest para yield (~87-90%).\n\nThe complete sequence is **4 < 2 < 6 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4 (Incorrect - reverse order)\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3 (Incorrect)\nC) 4<2<6<3<1<5 (Incorrect)\nD) 4<6<2<1<5<3 (This order is very close to our derived order, with a slight swap of 2 and 6, which have very similar and low para yields).\n\nLet's re-examine the order of 2 and 6. Both -COOH and -COOC2H5 are strongly deactivating and meta-directing. Their para yields are minimal and very close. The provided options suggest a specific order. Let's assume the order in option D is the intended one.\n\nFinal Order based on analysis and matching with options: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n### Analysis of Substituent Effects on Electrophilic Bromination\n\nTo arrange the given substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we must first classify the substituents on the benzene ring. These substituents determine the reaction's regioselectivity, directing the incoming bromine to specific positions (ortho, meta, or para).\n\n**1. Classification of Substituents:**\n\nThe substituents are classified based on their electronic effects (activating or deactivating) and their directing influence (ortho/para or meta).\n\n*   **Activating, Ortho/Para-Directing Groups:** These groups donate electron density to the benzene ring, making it more reactive. They direct the electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   **-CH₃ (Toluene, 1):** Alkyl group, activating.\n    *   **-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene, 5):** Alkyl group, activating.\n\n*   **Deactivating, Ortho/Para-Directing Groups:** Halogens are electron-withdrawing via induction (deactivating) but can donate electrons via resonance, which directs substitution to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   **-Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3):** Halogen, deactivating.\n\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups withdraw significant electron density from the ring, making it less reactive and directing the electrophile to the meta position.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene, 4):** Strongly deactivating.\n    *   **-COOH (Benzoic acid, 6):** Deactivating.\n    *   **-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate, 2):** Deactivating.\n\n**2. Isomer Distribution and Para-Yield:**\n\nThe percentage of the para-isomer formed depends on the nature of the substituent.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Substances 4, 2, 6):** For nitrobenzene (4), ethyl benzoate (2), and benzoic acid (6), the primary product is the meta-isomer. The yield of the para-isomer is consequently very low. For instance, the nitration of ethyl benzoate yields only 5% of the para-isomer, with the majority being the meta-product (73%). Similarly, the bromination of nitrobenzene almost exclusively produces the meta-isomer. Therefore, these three substances will have the lowest para-isomer yields. Among these, the deactivating strength generally follows the order -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅, which correlates with lower ortho/para substitution. Thus, the para yield order is expected to be 4 < 6 < 2.\n\n*   **Ortho/Para-Directors (Substances 1, 5, 3):** For toluene (1), ethylbenzene (5), and chlorobenzene (3), the substitution occurs at the ortho and para positions. The ratio between ortho and para products is influenced by steric hindrance.\n    *   **-CH₃ and -C₂H₅:** Alkyl groups are ortho/para directors. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased steric hindrance around the ortho positions in ethylbenzene favors substitution at the less hindered para position. Therefore, ethylbenzene (5) is expected to have a higher para-isomer yield than toluene (1). For example, in nitration, toluene gives 37% para-product, while the more sterically hindered tert-butylbenzene gives 75% para-product.\n    *   **-Cl:** The chloro group is also an ortho/para director. Halogens typically yield a high percentage of the para-isomer due to a combination of electronic and steric factors. For example, the nitration of chlorobenzene results in 70% para-product. In bromination, chlorobenzene shows high selectivity for the para position, with yields over 95% under certain conditions. This strong preference for the para position is generally higher than for simple alkylbenzenes.\n\n**3. Final Ordering:**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can establish the order of increasing para-isomer yield:\n\n1.  **Lowest Yields (Meta-Directors):** The deactivating, meta-directing groups will produce the smallest amount of the para-isomer. The order among them, from lowest to highest para yield, is generally accepted as: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n2.  **Intermediate Yields (Ortho/Para-Directors):** The activating alkyl groups will produce significant amounts of para-isomer. Due to less steric hindrance, toluene (1) will have a lower para-to-ortho ratio compared to the bulkier ethylbenzene (5). Thus, the order is Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5).\n3.  **Highest Yield (Ortho/Para-Director):** The chloro group in chlorobenzene (3) strongly directs substitution to the para position, often with very high selectivity, surpassing that of the alkylbenzenes.\n\nCombining these groups, the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### Step 1: Classify the Substituents\n\nFirst, we classify each substituent as either ortho-, para-directing or meta-directing.\n*   **Ortho-, Para-directors:** These groups direct incoming electrophiles to the positions ortho and para to themselves. Generally, these will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) **-CH3** (Methyl): Activating, ortho-, para-directing.\n    *   5) **-C2H5** (Ethyl): Activating, ortho-, para-directing.\n    *   3) **-Cl** (Chloro): Deactivating, but ortho-, para-directing.\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position. They produce very little para-isomer, so their para-isomer yield will be the lowest.\n    *   4) **-NO2** (Nitro): Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   2) **-COOC2H5** (Ethyl ester): Deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   6) **-COOH** (Carboxylic acid): Deactivating, meta-directing.\n\n### Step 2: Rank the Meta-Directors\n\nThe meta-directing substituents will have the lowest yield of the para-isomer. For these compounds, the vast majority of the product will be the meta-isomer.\n*   **Nitrobenzene (4, C6H5-NO2):** The -NO2 group is one of the strongest deactivating, meta-directing groups. Bromination yields almost exclusively the meta-product, with para-isomer yields being negligible, often less than 1%.\n*   **Ethyl benzoate (2, C6H5-COOC2H5):** The ester group is also deactivating and meta-directing. Data for nitration (a similar electrophilic substitution) shows it yields predominantly the meta-product (73%), with a small amount of para-isomer (5%).\n*   **Benzoic acid (6, C6H5-COOH):** The carboxylic acid group is deactivating and meta-directing, similar to the ester group.\n\nComparing these three, the -NO2 group is the strongest deactivator, leading to the lowest overall yield and the lowest proportion of the para-isomer. Between -COOH and -COOC2H5, their deactivating effects are comparable, but both will produce significantly more para-isomer than the -NO2 group. Generally, the order of para-isomer yield will be: **-NO2 < -COOC2H5 ≈ -COOH**. Therefore, the beginning of our sequence is **4 < 2 ≈ 6**.\n\n### Step 3: Rank the Ortho-, Para-Directors\n\nFor the ortho-, para-directing substituents (-Cl, -CH3, -C2H5), the yield of the para-isomer depends on the ortho-to-para ratio. This ratio is primarily influenced by **steric hindrance**. A larger substituent will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of the para-product.\n\nLet's compare the steric bulk of these groups:\n*   **-CH3 (Methyl):** This is a relatively small alkyl group.\n*   **-C2H5 (Ethyl):** This group is larger than the methyl group.\n*   **-Cl (Chloro):** This is a single atom.\n\nThe steric hindrance increases in the order: **-Cl < -CH3 < -C2H5**.\n*   **Toluene (1, C6H5-CH3):** The bromination of toluene yields about 66.8% para-isomer.\n*   **Ethylbenzene (5, C6H5-C2H5):** Due to the larger size of the ethyl group compared to the methyl group, there is more steric hindrance at the ortho positions. This favors the formation of the para-isomer even more than in toluene. Nitration data, for example, shows that the para-isomer percentage increases from 37% for toluene to 49% for ethylbenzene. A similar trend is expected for bromination.\n*   **Chlorobenzene (3, C6H5-Cl):** While the chloro group is ortho-, para-directing, its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect deactivates the ring. However, the key factor for the *ratio* is sterics. The chlorine atom is sterically less demanding than a methyl group. However, experimental data for halogenation of chlorobenzene often shows a high percentage of the para-isomer, sometimes as high as 70% for nitration. For bromination, the para-isomer is also heavily favored.\n\nLet's refine the order based on typical isomer distributions:\n*   The para-isomer yield increases as the steric bulk of the alkyl group increases: **-CH3 < -C2H5**.\n*   Comparing the alkyl groups to the chloro group, halogenation of chlorobenzene typically results in a very high para-isomer yield, often higher than for toluene and ethylbenzene under similar conditions. For example, nitration of chlorobenzene gives about 64-70% para-isomer, while for toluene it's about 37% and ethylbenzene about 49%. This suggests the order of para-yield is **-CH3 < -C2H5 < -Cl**.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Rankings\n\nCombining the two groups, we get the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n\n1.  **4 (C6H5-NO2):** Lowest yield (meta-director, strong deactivator).\n2.  **2 (C6H5-COOC2H5):** Very low yield (meta-director).\n3.  **6 (C6H5-COOH):** Very low yield (meta-director, similar to 2).\n4.  **1 (C6H5-CH3):** Significant para yield, but less than 5 and 3 due to lower steric hindrance.\n5.  **5 (C6H5-C2H5):** Higher para yield than 1 due to increased steric hindrance.\n6.  **3 (C6H5-Cl):** Highest para yield among the o,p-directors.\n\nThe complete sequence is: **4 < 2 < 6 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nLooking at the options, this does not perfectly match any of them. Let's re-evaluate the order of 2 and 6. The -COOH and -COOC2H5 groups have similar deactivating strengths. Without precise experimental data for bromination of both under identical conditions, their relative order is ambiguous but they will be close and occupy the positions after -NO2.\n\nLet's re-examine the options provided:\nA) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nB) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nC) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nD) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nOption B starts with the meta-directors (4, 2, 6) and ends with the ortho, para-directors (3, 1, 5). Let's analyze the order within these groups in option B.\n*   Meta-directors order: **4 < 2 < 6**. This is plausible, with NO2 giving the least para-product.\n*   Ortho, para-directors order: **3 < 1 < 5**. This implies the para yield is Cl < CH3 < C2H5. This contradicts our analysis based on steric hindrance and literature data, which suggests the para-yield increases with steric bulk (CH3 < C2H5) and that halogens often give a high para ratio.\n\nLet's reconsider the steric hindrance argument. The primary factor for the ortho/para ratio is the size of the substituent.\n*   Size: C2H5 > CH3 > Cl.\n*   This would lead to a para-isomer yield order of: Cl < CH3 < C2H5.\nThis matches the order in option B: **3 < 1 < 5**.\n\nLet's combine this with the meta-directors. The deactivating strength is generally considered -NO2 > -COOR > -COOH. This would mean the para-yield is **4 < 2 < 6**.\n\nCombining these two orderings gives: **4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**. This matches option B exactly.\n\nFinal check of the logic:\n*   **Lowest para yield:** Meta-directors. Order based on deactivating strength: NO2 > COOC2H5 > COOH. So, para yield is 4 < 2 < 6.\n*   **Highest para yield:** Ortho, para-directors. Order based on increasing steric hindrance favoring the para position: C2H5 > CH3 > Cl. So, para yield is 3 < 1 < 5.\n*   **Combined:** 4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5.\n\nThis provides a consistent rationale for option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Reaction and Substituent Effects**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a substituted benzene ring (C6H5-X). The substituent (X) on the ring determines two things:\n1.  **Reactivity:** Whether the ring reacts faster (activating group) or slower (deactivating group) than benzene itself.\n2.  **Orientation:** Where the incoming electrophile (Br+) will add. Substituents are either *ortho, para-directing* or *meta-directing*.\n\nThe question asks to arrange the substances in order of increasing yield of the *para-isomer*.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\n\nLet's classify the substituent for each substance:\n\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** -CH3 is an alkyl group. It is **activating** and **ortho, para-directing**.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** -COOC2H5 is an ester group. It is **deactivating** and **meta-directing**.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl is a halogen. It is **deactivating** but **ortho, para-directing** (a special case).\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** -NO2 is a nitro group. It is strongly **deactivating** and **meta-directing**.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** -C2H5 is an alkyl group. It is **activating** and **ortho, para-directing**.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** -COOH is a carboxylic acid group. It is **deactivating** and **meta-directing**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Groups**\n\nSubstances 2, 4, and 6 are meta-directors. For these compounds, the para-isomer is a minor byproduct, so its yield will be very low. The amount of para-product formed is inversely related to how strongly the group deactivates the ring and directs to the meta position.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength for these groups is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n*   This means -NO2 is the strongest meta-director, followed by -COOH, and then -COOC2H5.\n*   Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be the lowest for nitrobenzene (4), then higher for benzoic acid (6), and slightly higher again for ethyl benzoate (2).\n*   So, the order of increasing para-yield for this group is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\nBased on typical experimental data:\n*   Bromination of Nitrobenzene (4) gives <1% para-isomer.\n*   Bromination of Benzoic acid (6) gives ~2% para-isomer.\n*   Bromination of Ethyl benzoate (2) gives a slightly higher percentage than benzoic acid, around 3-5%.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Groups**\n\nSubstances 1, 3, and 5 are ortho, para-directors. For these compounds, the ortho and para isomers are the major products. The ratio of para to ortho product (p/o ratio) is primarily determined by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **-CH3 (Toluene, 1):** The methyl group is relatively small. It gives a significant amount of both ortho and para products. The para-isomer yield is about 67%.\n*   **-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene, 5):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance strongly favors the para position. The para-isomer yield is very high, about 94%.\n*   **-Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3):** The chloro group's size is comparable to a methyl group, but its electronic properties also influence the p/o ratio. Experimentally, it is highly para-directing. The para-isomer yield is about 89%.\n\nComparing the para-yields for this group:\n*   Toluene (1): ~67%\n*   Chlorobenzene (3): ~89%\n*   Ethylbenzene (5): ~94%\n\nThe order of increasing para-yield for this group is: **1 < 3 < 5**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Orders**\n\nThe meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2) will have significantly lower para-yields than the ortho, para-directing substances (1, 3, 5).\n\nCombining the two ordered sets:\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 3 < 5)\n\nThe complete order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**\n\n**Step 6: Compare with the Given Options**\n\nLet's examine the options provided:\nA) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nB) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nOur derived order is 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5. None of the options match this exactly. However, option C is the closest.\n\nLet's analyze Option C: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n*   The order of the meta-directors (4 < 6 < 2) is correct.\n*   The placement of the meta-directors before the ortho, para-directors is correct.\n*   The placement of toluene (1) as the o,p-director with the lowest para-yield is correct.\n*   The only discrepancy is the relative order of ethylbenzene (5) and chlorobenzene (3). Option C suggests that chlorobenzene gives a higher para-yield than ethylbenzene (5 < 3), whereas our data shows the opposite (3 < 5).\n\nGiven that all other options contain more significant and fundamental errors (e.g., incorrect ordering of meta-directors), Option C is the most plausible answer. It is likely that there is a small error in the question's options, but it follows the correct chemical principles for most of the sequence.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Reaction and the Question**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a series of monosubstituted benzene rings. The goal is to arrange the starting substances in order of increasing yield of the *para*-substituted product. Since all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material have the same molar mass, the \"weight fraction of the yield\" is directly proportional to the \"mole fraction\" or \"percentage yield\" of the para-isomer.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\n\nThe directing effect of the substituent already on the benzene ring determines the position of the incoming bromine atom. We need to classify each substituent as either ortho,para-directing or meta-directing.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups donate electron density to the ring (activating groups) or are halogens (deactivating but o,p-directing). They direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) `-CH3` (in Toluene): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   5) `-C2H5` (in Ethylbenzene): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   3) `-Cl` (in Chlorobenzene): Deactivating, o,p-director.\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring (deactivating groups). They direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position.\n    *   4) `-NO2` (in Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating, m-director.\n    *   2) `-COOC2H5` (in Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating, m-director.\n    *   6) `-COOH` (in Benzoic acid): Deactivating, m-director.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Substances within Each Group**\n\nSubstances with meta-directing groups will produce a very small amount of the para-isomer, while substances with ortho,para-directing groups will produce a significant amount. Therefore, the final order will be (meta-directors) < (ortho,para-directors).\n\n**A) Ordering the meta-directors (Substances 2, 4, 6):**\n\nFor these groups, the yield of the para-isomer is very low. The order depends on the strength of the deactivating and meta-directing effect. A stronger deactivating group will direct more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower percentage of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n    *   The `-NO2` group is one of the strongest electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   The `-COOH` group is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The `-COOC2H5` group is slightly less deactivating than `-COOH` because the ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is weakly electron-donating, which slightly counteracts the withdrawal effect.\n\n*   Therefore, the percentage of para-product will be the lowest for the strongest deactivator and increase as the deactivating strength decreases.\n*   Order of increasing para-yield: **4 (`-NO2`) < 6 (`-COOH`) < 2 (`-COOC2H5`)**.\n\n**B) Ordering the ortho,para-directors (Substances 1, 3, 5):**\n\nFor these groups, the yield of the para-isomer is high. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho product (p/o ratio). This ratio is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing `-CH3` (1) and `-C2H5` (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The primary factor determining the p/o ratio is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). The increased bulk hinders the electrophile's approach to the adjacent ortho positions, thus favoring substitution at the less hindered para position. This leads to a higher para-isomer yield for ethylbenzene compared to toluene.\n    *   Order of increasing para-yield: **1 (`-CH3`) < 5 (`-C2H5`)**.\n\n*   **Comparing with `-Cl` (3):** The chlorine atom is an o,p-director but is deactivating overall. It has a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) and a weaker electron-donating resonance effect (+R). The strong -I effect deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic effect leads to a very high preference for para substitution. Typically, the para-isomer yield for halobenzenes is exceptionally high, often higher than for alkylbenzenes. For bromination, chlorobenzene yields about 87% para-isomer, while toluene yields about 67%.\n    *   Therefore, chlorobenzene will have the highest para-yield among this group.\n    *   Order of increasing para-yield: **1 (`-CH3`) < 5 (`-C2H5`) < 3 (`-Cl`)**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Orders**\n\nNow, we combine the two ordered groups. The meta-directors will have the lowest para-yields, followed by the ortho,para-directors.\n\n*   Order of m-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of o,p-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nCombining them gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Reaction and Classify the Substituents**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination). The substituent already on the benzene ring directs the incoming bromine atom (Br+) to specific positions. We need to classify each substituent based on its directing effect.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the positions ortho and para to themselves. These substances will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) -CH3 (Toluene): Activating group.\n    *   5) -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene): Activating group.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating group, but directs ortho, para.\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. For these substances, the ortho and para isomers are formed in very small amounts, meaning their para-yield will be the lowest.\n    *   4) -NO2 (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating.\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid): Deactivating.\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating.\n\nBased on this classification, the substances with meta-directing groups will have the lowest yields of the para-isomer and will appear first in the list. The ortho, para-directors will have the highest yields and will appear last.\n\nThe overall order will look like: **(Meta-directors in order) < (Ortho, para-directors in order)**.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a very minor product. The amount of para-product formed is inversely related to the strength of the deactivating effect of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group will more strongly direct to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nWe need to rank the deactivating strength of the -NO2, -COOH, and -COOC2H5 groups.\n*   The nitro group (-NO2) is one of the strongest electron-withdrawing and deactivating groups.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also a strong deactivating group.\n*   The ester group (-COOC2H5) is deactivating, but generally considered less deactivating than -COOH.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength is: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**\n\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the *reverse* order of this deactivating strength:\nYield(para-NO2) < Yield(para-COOH) < Yield(para-COOC2H5)\n\nThis corresponds to the substance numbers: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these substances, we need to compare the ratio of the para-isomer to the ortho-isomer. This ratio is heavily influenced by **steric hindrance**. A bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions, making the para position more accessible for the incoming bromine.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1, -CH3) and Ethylbenzene (5, -C2H5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk provides more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, which leads to a higher proportion of the para-isomer for ethylbenzene compared to toluene.\n    *   Therefore, the order of para-yield is: **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3, -Cl):** Halogens like chlorine are a special case. While they are deactivating overall, they are known to give a very high yield of the para-isomer in electrophilic substitutions. For example, the bromination of chlorobenzene yields approximately 87% of the para-isomer. This percentage is typically higher than that for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene. The electronic effects of the halogen's lone pairs strongly favor the para position.\n\nCombining these facts, the order of increasing para-yield for this group is:\nToluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)\nSo, the order is **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Two Groups**\n\nNow we combine the ordered groups to get the final sequence:\n(Meta-directors) < (Ortho, para-directors)\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe final combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order:\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents**\nFirst, we need to classify the substituent on each benzene ring (C6H5-) based on its effect on electrophilic substitution. Substituents can be either activating (and ortho,para-directing) or deactivating (and mostly meta-directing, with the exception of halogens).\n\n*   **Activating, ortho,para-directing groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive, and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a high yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) -CH3 (Toluene)\n    *   5) -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n\n*   **Deactivating, meta-directing groups:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive, and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   4) -NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid)\n\n*   **Deactivating, ortho,para-directing group:** Halogens are a special case. They are deactivating due to their strong inductive effect but are ortho,para-directing due to their resonance effect. They will produce a high yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\n**Step 2: Separate into low-yield and high-yield groups**\nBased on the directing effects, we can immediately say that the meta-directing substances will have a much lower yield of the para-isomer than the ortho,para-directing substances.\n\n*   **Low para-yield group:** 2, 4, 6\n*   **High para-yield group:** 1, 3, 5\n\nThe final order will look like: (Order of 2, 4, 6) < (Order of 1, 3, 5).\n\n**Step 3: Order the low-yield (meta-directing) group**\nFor meta-directors, the amount of para-isomer formed is very small. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group directs more strongly to the meta position, leaving less for the para position.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n    *   The -NO2 group is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The -COOH group is a stronger deactivator than the -COOC2H5 (ester) group because the electron-donating ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing ability.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength:\n    *   **4 (-NO2) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC2H5)**\n\n**Step 4: Order the high-yield (ortho,para-directing) group**\nFor these substances, we need to compare the ratio of the para product to the ortho product.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The primary difference is the size (steric bulk) of the alkyl group. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is larger than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk hinders the attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene will give a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   **1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5)**\n\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) has a very strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect. This effect is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more strongly than the distant para position. This electronic factor leads to a very high preference for para substitution, even more so than for alkylbenzenes. The yield of para-bromochlorobenzene is typically very high (around 85-90%).\n    *   Therefore, chlorobenzene gives the highest yield of the para-isomer in this group.\n    *   **1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl)**\n\n**Step 5: Combine the groups for the final order**\nBy combining the orders from Step 3 and Step 4, we get the final arrangement from lowest to highest para-isomer yield.\n\n*   (4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we must analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent on the benzene ring. The weight fraction of the yield is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the isomer.\n\nHere is a substance-by-substance analysis based on the directing effects of their functional groups:\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups (Deactivating):** These groups direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position, resulting in very low yields of the para-isomer. The strength of the deactivating effect influences the selectivity for the meta position; stronger deactivators yield even less para-product.\n    *   **4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group (-NO₂) is a very strong deactivator and meta-director. Bromination of nitrobenzene almost exclusively yields the meta-isomer, with only trace amounts of the para-isomer. Theoretical calculations show the para intermediate is significantly less stable than the meta intermediate.\n    *   **6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is a strong deactivator and meta-director. Its deactivating effect is less than the nitro group, so it will produce a slightly higher, yet still very small, yield of the para-isomer compared to nitrobenzene.\n    *   **2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate):** The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is also a deactivating meta-director. It is generally considered a weaker deactivator than a carboxylic acid. For instance, in nitration reactions, ethyl benzoate yields about 5% of the para-isomer. This is expected to be the highest para yield among the three meta-directors.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups (Activating/Deactivating):** These groups direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. The ratio between ortho and para products is largely determined by steric hindrance.\n    *   **1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is an activating, ortho, para-director. For bromination, the typical distribution gives a significant amount of para-isomer, around 33-40%.\n    *   **5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is also an activating, ortho, para-director, similar to the methyl group. However, the ethyl group is larger, causing more steric hindrance at the ortho positions. This increased hindrance favors substitution at the para position, leading to a higher yield of the para-isomer compared to toluene.\n    *   **3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group (-Cl) is deactivating overall but is an ortho, para-director due to its lone pairs of electrons. Halogens are known to give a very high proportion of the para-isomer in electrophilic substitutions. For example, the bromination of chlorobenzene can yield up to 87% of the para-isomer, which is the highest among this set of ortho, para-directors.\n\n**Summary of Isomer Yields:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we can establish the following order of increasing para-isomer yield:\n\n1.  **Nitrobenzene (4):** Lowest para yield due to the strongly deactivating -NO₂ group.\n2.  **Benzoic acid (6):** Very low para yield, but slightly more than nitrobenzene.\n3.  **Ethyl benzoate (2):** Low para yield, but the most of the meta-directors.\n4.  **Toluene (1):** Significant para yield (~33-40%).\n5.  **Ethylbenzene (5):** Higher para yield than toluene due to greater steric hindrance from the ethyl group.\n6.  **Chlorobenzene (3):** Highest para yield (~87%) due to the electronic properties of the chloro substituent.\n\nTherefore, the final order of substances in increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nB) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nC) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nD) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nThe correct sequence matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we must analyze the directing effects of each substituent on the benzene ring. The formation of the para-isomer is influenced by whether the substituent is ortho-, para-directing or meta-directing, and by steric hindrance at the ortho position.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the substituents:\n*   **-NO2 (Nitrobenzene, 4), -COOH (Benzoic acid, 6), and -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate, 2):** These are deactivating, meta-directing groups. They withdraw electron density from the ring, making electrophilic substitution difficult and directing the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. Consequently, the yield of the para-isomer is extremely low for these substances.\n    *   The -NO2 group is one of the strongest deactivating groups, resulting in a para-isomer yield of less than 1%.\n    *   The -COOH and -COOC2H5 groups are also strongly deactivating. For ethyl benzoate, the para-isomer yield is around 5%, while the meta-isomer is the major product (73%). For benzoic acid, the para yield is also very small, with the vast majority being the meta-isomer. Comparing the three, the order of increasing para yield is generally considered to be nitrobenzene < benzoic acid < ethyl benzoate, although all are very low.\n\n*   **-CH3 (Toluene, 1), -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene, 5), and -Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3):** These are ortho-, para-directing groups. They will all produce a significant amount of the para-isomer. The specific yield of the para-isomer versus the ortho-isomer is largely determined by steric effects.\n    *   **Toluene (-CH3, 1):** The methyl group is activating and directs to the ortho and para positions. In bromination, toluene typically yields about 30-40% ortho-isomer and the rest is almost all para-isomer, giving a para yield of about 60-70%.\n    *   **Ethylbenzene (-C2H5, 5):** The ethyl group is also activating and ortho-, para-directing. Because the ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group, it creates more steric hindrance at the ortho positions. This increased hindrance favors substitution at the less crowded para position, resulting in a higher para-isomer yield compared to toluene.\n    *   **Chlorobenzene (-Cl, 3):** The chloro group is deactivating overall but is ortho-, para-directing due to its lone pairs participating in resonance. The para-isomer is strongly favored, with conventional bromination yielding an ortho to para isomer ratio of about 0.1 to 1, which corresponds to approximately 9% ortho and 91% para.\n\nBased on this analysis, the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n1.  **Nitrobenzene (4):** Has the lowest para yield (<1%).\n2.  **Benzoic acid (6):** Has a very low para yield, slightly higher than nitrobenzene.\n3.  **Ethyl benzoate (2):** Has a very low para yield (around 5%), but generally slightly higher than benzoic acid.\n4.  **Toluene (1):** Has a substantial para yield (~60-70%).\n5.  **Ethylbenzene (5):** Has a higher para yield than toluene due to greater steric hindrance from the ethyl group.\n6.  **Chlorobenzene (3):** Has the highest para yield (~91%) due to a strong preference for para substitution.\n\nThus, the final order is 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we need to consider the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### Analysis of Substituents\n\nThe substituents can be classified based on their directing effects in electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups (deactivating):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. Consequently, they will produce the lowest yield of the para-isomer. The substances with these groups are:\n    *   **4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group (-NO2) is a very strong deactivating, meta-director. It produces almost exclusively the meta-isomer, with only trace amounts of the ortho and para products.\n    *   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** The ester group (-COOC2H5) is a deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   **6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also a deactivating, meta-director.\n\n    Among these three, the nitro group is one of the strongest meta-directors, leading to a very low para yield. The ester and carboxylic acid groups are also strongly meta-directing. For nitration of a benzoic ester, the para yield is about 5%. For the bromination of nitrobenzene, the reaction requires harsh conditions and yields predominantly the meta isomer. The para yield for all three will be very low, with nitrobenzene expected to be the lowest. Following nitrobenzene, the ester and carboxylic acid groups will also have very low para yields.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce significantly higher yields of the para-isomer compared to meta-directors.\n    *   **1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The methyl group (-CH3) is an activating, ortho, para-director. Due to its small size, it allows for a significant amount of ortho substitution, but the para isomer is also a major product.\n    *   **5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is also an activating, ortho, para-director. It is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions makes the para position more accessible for the incoming electrophile. Therefore, ethylbenzene will produce a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   **3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group (-Cl) is a deactivating, but ortho, para-director. Halogens generally lead to a high yield of the para-isomer, often more so than simple alkyl groups, due to a combination of electronic and steric effects. For example, the nitration of chlorobenzene gives a 70% yield of the para-isomer.\n\n### Establishing the Order\n\n1.  **Lowest Para Yields (Meta-directors):** The lowest yields of the para-isomer will come from the meta-directing groups. The order among them, from lowest to highest para yield, is generally based on the strength of their deactivating and meta-directing nature.\n    *   Nitrobenzene (4) is extremely deactivating and gives a negligible para yield.\n    *   Ethyl benzoate (2) and Benzoic acid (6) are also strongly deactivating. Data for the nitration of ethyl benzoate shows a 5% para yield. The deactivating strength of -COOH and -COOR are comparable.\n    *   Therefore, the order for the lowest para yields is: **4 < 2 ≈ 6**.\n\n2.  **Highest Para Yields (Ortho, para-directors):** Now we order the o,p-directors.\n    *   Comparing toluene (1) and ethylbenzene (5), the bulkier ethyl group in (5) sterically hinders the ortho positions more than the methyl group in (1). This results in a higher proportion of the para product for ethylbenzene. So, the order is **1 < 5**.\n    *   Comparing the alkylbenzenes to chlorobenzene (3), halogens are known to give high para-to-ortho ratios. The nitration of chlorobenzene, for instance, yields 70% para-product, while the nitration of toluene yields 37% para-product. This suggests that chlorobenzene will have a higher para-isomer yield than both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, the order for the highest para yields is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n3.  **Combining the Groups:** Combining the two groups, we need to place the meta-directors before the ortho, para-directors. The question asks for an increasing order of the *weight fraction* of the para-isomer. Based on typical isomer distributions, there is a significant gap between the para yield from meta-directors and ortho, para-directors.\n\nThe final combined order is determined by arranging the meta-directors first, followed by the ortho, para-directors, each subgroup ordered by increasing para yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (lowest para yield):** 4 (-NO2) < 2 (-COOC2H5) < 6 (-COOH). The relative order of 2 and 6 can be debated without precise data for bromination, but they are very close and both are significantly lower than the o,p-directors. Let's check the options. Option C suggests 4 < 2 < 6. Option D suggests 4 < 6 < 2.\n*   **Ortho, para-directors (highest para yield):** 1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl).\n\nLet's re-evaluate the meta-directors. The -NO2 group is the strongest deactivator. Between -COOH and -COOC2H5, their deactivating strengths are similar. Let's look at the provided options to resolve the ambiguity.\n\n*   A) 3<5<1<6<2<4 (Decreasing order)\n*   B) 6<2<4<5<1<3 (Incorrect grouping)\n*   C) 4<2<6<3<1<5 (Incorrect order for o,p directors)\n*   D) 4<6<2<1<5<3 (Correct grouping and plausible internal order)\n\nLet's analyze option D: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n*   **Meta-directors:** 4 (-NO2) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC2H5). This order is plausible for the very low para yields.\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** 1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl). This order is consistent with our analysis based on steric hindrance and the known high para-selectivity for halogens.\n\nThe order presented in option D aligns well with established principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution. The meta-directors produce the least para-isomer, with the strongly deactivating nitro group producing the absolute least. The ortho, para-directors produce the most, with the yield increasing as ortho-attack is sterically disfavored (-CH3 < -C2H5) and with the electronically favored para-direction of halogens (-Cl being the highest).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents.**\nFirst, we need to classify each substituent on the benzene ring as either an *ortho,para-director* or a *meta-director*. This classification determines the primary positions where the incoming bromine electrophile will attach.\n\n*   **Ortho,para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They are typically activating groups (electron-donating) or halogens.\n    *   1) -CH3 (methyl): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   5) -C2H5 (ethyl): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   3) -Cl (chloro): Deactivating, but o,p-director.\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They are deactivating groups (electron-withdrawing).\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (ethyl ester): Deactivating, m-director.\n    *   4) -NO2 (nitro): Strongly deactivating, m-director.\n    *   6) -COOH (carboxylic acid): Deactivating, m-director.\n\n**Step 2: Compare the two main groups.**\nSubstances with meta-directing groups will produce the meta-isomer as the major product, with very small amounts of ortho and para isomers. Substances with ortho,para-directing groups will produce ortho and para isomers as the major products.\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be much lower for the meta-directing group than for the ortho,para-directing group.\nThis means substances 2, 4, and 6 will come before substances 1, 3, and 5 in the final ranking.\n\n**Step 3: Order the meta-directors (lowest para yield).**\nWe need to arrange substances 2, 4, and 6 in order of increasing para-isomer yield. The yield of the para-isomer will be lowest for the substituent that is the strongest deactivating/meta-directing group.\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n*   -NO2 (4) is the strongest deactivator, so it will direct most strongly to the meta position, resulting in the lowest yield of the para-isomer.\n*   -COOH (6) is a weaker deactivator than -NO2 but generally considered stronger than an ester group.\n*   -COOC2H5 (2) is the weakest deactivator among these three.\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: 4 < 6 < 2.\n\n**Step 4: Order the ortho,para-directors (highest para yield).**\nWe need to arrange substances 1, 3, and 5 in order of increasing para-isomer yield. For these groups, both ortho and para products are formed. The proportion of the para-isomer depends on steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n*   **-CH3 (1) vs. -C2H5 (5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size hinders the attack at the ortho positions more significantly, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer for ethylbenzene compared to toluene. So, the para yield for 1 is less than for 5 (1 < 5).\n*   **-Cl (3) vs. alkyl groups (1, 5):** The chloro group is a special case. Although it is a deactivating group, it is ortho,para-directing. Its strong inductive electron-withdrawing effect (-I effect) disfavors the adjacent ortho position more than the distant para position. This electronic effect, combined with its own steric bulk, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer is often the overwhelming product in the electrophilic halogenation of halobenzenes. For bromination, the para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (~89%) is significantly higher than for toluene (~62%) or ethylbenzene (~64%).\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: 1 < 5 < 3.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the rankings.**\nCombining the two groups, we get the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete sequence is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nComparing this sequence with the given options:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nC) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nD) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nTo arrange the given substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we must consider the directing effects and steric properties of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### Analysis of Substituents\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents based on their electronic effects and how they direct incoming electrophiles:\n\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The methyl group (`-CH3`) is an activating, ortho-, para-director.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** The ethoxycarbonyl group (`-COOC2H5`) is a deactivating, meta-director.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is a deactivating, ortho-, para-director.\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group (`-NO2`) is a strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is an activating, ortho-, para-director.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The carboxyl group (`-COOH`) is a deactivating, meta-director.\n\n### Yield of the Para-Isomer\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups (4, 2, 6):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the meta position. The yield of the para-isomer is extremely low. Among these, the `-NO2` group is the most strongly deactivating, leading to the highest selectivity for the meta position and thus the lowest yield of the para-isomer. The deactivating strength generally follows the order: `-NO2` > `-COOC2H5` ≈ `-COOH`. Therefore, the para-isomer yield will be lowest for nitrobenzene (4), followed by ethyl benzoate (2) and benzoic acid (6). While data for bromination of benzoic acid and its ester can be difficult to find and reactions often require harsh conditions, literature on nitration (a similar electrophilic substitution) shows ethyl benzoate gives about 5% para-isomer. We can infer a similar trend for bromination, placing these three at the beginning of the sequence.\n    *   **4 (Nitrobenzene):** ~0-5% para yield.\n    *   **2 (Ethyl benzoate):** Low para yield, likely slightly higher than nitrobenzene.\n    *   **6 (Benzoic acid):** Low para yield, comparable to ethyl benzoate.\n\n*   **Ortho-, para-directing groups (3, 1, 5):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions. The ratio of para to ortho product is primarily determined by steric hindrance; a bulkier substituent will sterically hinder the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer.\n    *   **3 (Chlorobenzene):** The `-Cl` atom is relatively small. Nitration of chlorobenzene, for comparison, yields about 64-70% para product. Bromination is expected to yield a high percentage of the para isomer.\n    *   **1 (Toluene):** The `-CH3` group is bulkier than `-Cl`. In conventional bromination, the para-isomer is the major product, forming about 60-70% of the monobrominated mixture.\n    *   **5 (Ethylbenzene):** The `-C2H5` group is bulkier than `-CH3`. Increased steric bulk leads to greater hindrance at the ortho positions, thus favoring para substitution even more than in toluene. Data for bromination in trifluoroacetic acid shows ethylbenzene gives 83.2% para-isomer, while toluene gives 79.2% para-isomer.\n\n### Arranging the Substances\n\nBased on the analysis, we can establish the order of increasing para-isomer yield:\n\n1.  **Nitrobenzene (4):** As the strongest meta-director, it will have the lowest para-yield.\n2.  **Ethyl benzoate (2):** A meta-director with a very low para-yield.\n3.  **Benzoic acid (6):** Another meta-director with a very low para-yield, likely slightly higher than the ester due to less deactivation.\n4.  **Chlorobenzene (3):** An ortho-, para-director where the `-Cl` atom is sterically small, but electronic effects strongly favor para substitution, often leading to a high para yield, but less than the alkylbenzenes in some conditions.\n5.  **Toluene (1):** The methyl group's steric hindrance favors the para position. Standard bromination yields around 36.8% para product under certain conditions, though this can vary. However, relative to other substituents, it is well-established.\n6.  **Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group, leading to the highest proportion of para-isomer among the ortho-, para-directors due to the most significant steric hindrance at the ortho positions.\n\nCombining these findings, the correct order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 (Nitrobenzene) < 2 (Ethyl benzoate) < 6 (Benzoic acid) < 3 (Chlorobenzene) < 1 (Toluene) < 5 (Ethylbenzene)**.\n\nThis sequence matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n1.  **Classify Substituents:** First, we'll categorize the substituents on the benzene ring (C6H5-) as either *ortho,para-directing* or *meta-directing*.\n    *   *Ortho,para-directors* activate (or slightly deactivate, in the case of halogens) the ring and direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. These will have a **high** yield of the para-isomer. The substances in this group are:\n        *   1) Toluene (-CH3)\n        *   3) Chlorobenzene (-Cl)\n        *   5) Ethylbenzene (-C2H5)\n    *   *Meta-directors* deactivate the ring and direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position. These will have a **very low** yield of the para-isomer. The substances in this group are:\n        *   2) Ethyl benzoate (-COOC2H5)\n        *   4) Nitrobenzene (-NO2)\n        *   6) Benzoic acid (-COOH)\n\n2.  **Order the Meta-Directors (Lowest Yields):** For meta-directing groups, the para-isomer is a minor byproduct. The stronger the deactivating and meta-directing effect of the group, the lower the yield of the para-isomer will be.\n    *   The deactivating strength generally follows the order: -NO2 > -COOC2H5 ≈ -COOH.\n    *   Based on experimental data, the percentage of the para-isomer formed is lowest for Nitrobenzene (4), followed by Benzoic acid (6), and then Ethyl benzoate (2).\n    *   So, the beginning of our sequence is **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n3.  **Order the Ortho,Para-Directors (Highest Yields):** For this group, we need to compare the ratio of para to ortho product. This ratio is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n    *   **Steric Hindrance:** A larger substituent will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer. The size of the groups is: -C2H5 > -CH3. Therefore, the para yield of Ethylbenzene (5) will be greater than that of Toluene (1).\n    *   **Electronic Effects:** The -Cl group in Chlorobenzene (3) is strongly electron-withdrawing by induction, which deactivates the ortho positions more than the para position. This, combined with its size, leads to a very high preference for the para position.\n    *   Comparing the three, experimental data for bromination shows the following trend for para-isomer percentage: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n    *   So, the end of our sequence is **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n4.  **Combine the Orders:** By combining the two groups, we get the complete sequence for increasing para-isomer yield.\n    *   (4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n    *   The final order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n5.  **Match with Options:** This sequence matches option B.

The position of the incoming bromine atom (ortho, meta, or para) is determined by the nature of the substituent 'X'. The question asks to arrange the substances in order of increasing yield of the *para-isomer*.\n\nSubstituents can be classified into two main categories based on their directing effects:\n1.  **Ortho, Para-Directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the positions ortho and para to themselves. They are typically activating groups (like alkyl groups -R) or halogens (-Cl). For these substances, the para-isomer is a major product.\n2.  **Meta-Directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They are deactivating groups (like -NO2, -COOH, -COOR). For these substances, the para-isomer is a very minor product.\n\n### Step 2: Classify the Substituents in the Given Substances\n\nLet's classify each substituent:\n*   **1) С6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** -CH3 is an alkyl group. It is a weakly activating, **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** -COOC2H5 is an ester group. It is a deactivating, **meta-director**.\n*   **3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl is a halogen. It is a deactivating, **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** -NO2 is a nitro group. It is a strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n*   **5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** -C2H5 is an alkyl group. It is a weakly activating, **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** -COOH is a carboxylic acid group. It is a deactivating, **meta-director**.\n\n### Step 3: Initial Sorting into Two Groups\n\nSince meta-directors yield very little para product and ortho, para-directors yield a significant amount of para product, we can immediately say that all meta-directing substances will have a lower para yield than all ortho, para-directing substances.\n\n*   **Low Para Yield Group (Meta-Directors):** {C6H5-NO2 (4), C6H5-COOH (6), C6H5-COOC2H5 (2)}\n*   **High Para Yield Group (Ortho, Para-Directors):** {C6H5-CH3 (1), C6H5-C2H5 (5), C6H5-Cl (3)}\n\nThe final order will be: {Group of 4, 6, 2} < {Group of 1, 5, 3}\n\n### Step 4: Arrange the Meta-Directors (4, 6, 2)\n\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the minor para product is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, thus forming even less para product.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n*   The -NO2 group is the strongest deactivator, so it will produce the least amount of para-isomer.\n*   The -COOH group is the next strongest deactivator.\n*   The -COOC2H5 group is the weakest deactivator among the three.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: -NO2 < -COOH < -COOC2H5.\n*   This corresponds to the order of substances: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### Step 5: Arrange the Ortho, Para-Directors (1, 5, 3)\n\nFor ortho, para-directors, we need to compare the ratio of para to ortho substitution. A higher para yield is favored by factors that disfavor substitution at the ortho position.\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** The bulky incoming electrophile (Br+) will have difficulty approaching the ortho positions if the substituent is also bulky.\n    *   Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5): The ethyl group (-C2H5) is larger than the methyl group (-CH3). The greater steric hindrance of the ethyl group leads to a higher proportion of substitution at the less hindered para position. Thus, the para yield for ethylbenzene is greater than for toluene. Order: **1 < 5**.\n*   **Electronic and Steric Effects of Halogens:**\n    *   Comparing alkyl groups (1, 5) with -Cl (3): The chlorine atom is an ortho, para-director, but it is deactivating due to its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect). This effect is stronger at the ortho positions than at the more distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with sterics, makes the para position much more favored for halogens compared to alkyl groups. The para-isomer yield for the bromination of chlorobenzene is known to be very high (around 89%). This is significantly higher than for toluene (~67%) or ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, the para yield for chlorobenzene is the highest in this group.\n*   Combining these points, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: -CH3 < -C2H5 < -Cl.\n*   This corresponds to the order of substances: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### Step 6: Combine the Groups for the Final Answer\n\nCombining the results from Step 4 and Step 5:\n\nThe group of meta-directors (4 < 6 < 2) has a lower para yield than the group of ortho, para-directors (1 < 5 < 3).\n\nThe final order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order:\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction and the Goal**\n\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a series of substituted benzene rings (C6H5-R). The goal is to arrange these substances in order of the *increasing* yield (weight fraction) of the *para*-isomer.\n\nThe directing effect of the substituent (R) on the benzene ring is the primary factor determining the product distribution (ortho, meta, para). We need to consider two main aspects for each substituent:\n*   **Directing effect**: Does it direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho/para positions or the meta position?\n*   **Steric and electronic factors**: How do the size and electronic properties of the substituent influence the ratio of para to ortho product?\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\n\nFirst, we classify each substituent based on its directing effect.\n\n*   **Substituents that direct to the ortho and para positions (o,p-directors):**\n    *   These are typically activating groups (electron-donating) or halogens.\n    *   1) **-CH3 (methyl)**: Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   5) **-C2H5 (ethyl)**: Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   3) **-Cl (chloro)**: Deactivating, but o,p-director due to lone pair resonance.\n\n*   **Substituents that direct to the meta position (m-directors):**\n    *   These are deactivating groups (electron-withdrawing).\n    *   2) **-COOC2H5 (ethyl ester)**: Deactivating, m-director.\n    *   4) **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, m-director.\n    *   6) **-COOH (carboxylic acid)**: Deactivating, m-director.\n\n**3. Initial Broad Grouping**\n\nCompounds with meta-directing groups will produce very little para-isomer, as the main product is the meta-isomer. Compounds with ortho,para-directing groups will produce a significant amount of para-isomer. Therefore, the order will start with the meta-directors and end with the ortho,para-directors.\n\nOrder: [m-directors in increasing para yield] < [o,p-directors in increasing para yield]\nOrder: [2, 4, 6] < [1, 3, 5]\n\n**4. Ordering the Meta-Directors (Substances 2, 4, 6)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the para-isomer is a very minor side product. The yield of this side product is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group makes the ring less reactive overall and more selective for the meta position, thus producing even less of the para (and ortho) isomers.\n\nLet's rank the deactivating strength of these groups:\n*   **-NO2 (4)** is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n*   **-COOH (6)** is a strong deactivating group.\n*   **-COOC2H5 (2)** is also a strong deactivating group, but slightly weaker than -COOH.\n\nThe generally accepted order of deactivating strength is: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**.\n\nTherefore, the selectivity for the meta position follows the same order. This means the yield of the undesired para-isomer will be in the reverse order of deactivating strength.\n\n*   Lowest para yield: C6H5-NO2 (4)\n*   Intermediate para yield: C6H5-COOH (6)\n*   Highest para yield (among this group): C6H5-COOC2H5 (2)\n\nSo, the order for this group is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**5. Ordering the Ortho,Para-Directors (Substances 1, 3, 5)**\n\nFor these substances, both ortho and para isomers are formed. The percentage of the para-isomer depends on steric hindrance and electronic effects that influence the para/ortho ratio.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, thus favoring substitution at the more accessible para position.\n    *   Therefore, the para yield for ethylbenzene (5) is greater than for toluene (1).\n    *   Order: **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chloro group is unique. It is deactivating due to its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I), but its lone pairs allow for a resonance effect (+M) that directs ortho/para. The strong -I effect is distance-dependent and deactivates the ortho positions more significantly than the para position. This electronic factor, combined with the steric size of the chlorine atom, makes para substitution highly favorable. The percentage of para-isomer in the bromination of chlorobenzene is typically very high (around 89-90%), which is higher than for both toluene (around 66%) and ethylbenzene (around 75-80%).\n    *   Therefore, the para yield for chlorobenzene (3) is the highest among these three.\n\nCombining these observations, the order of increasing para yield for the o,p-directors is:\n**C6H5-CH3 (1) < C6H5-C2H5 (5) < C6H5-Cl (3)**.\n\n**6. Final Combined Order**\n\nNow, we combine the two ranked groups:\n\n(Order of m-directors) < (Order of o,p-directors)\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe final arrangement of substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nTo determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in the electrophilic bromination of the given substances, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric properties of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n**Analysis of Substituents**\n\nThe rate and orientation of electrophilic aromatic substitution are governed by the nature of the substituent already present on the benzene ring. Substituents are classified as either activating (electron-donating) or deactivating (electron-withdrawing), and as ortho, para-directing or meta-directing.\n\n1.  **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups deactivate the ring and direct the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br+) primarily to the meta position. Consequently, the yield of the para-isomer is extremely low, close to zero. The substances with meta-directing groups will have the lowest para-isomer yields.\n    *   **C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene, 4):** The nitro group (-NO₂) is a very strong electron-withdrawing group, making it a strong deactivator and a meta-director. It will produce the least amount of para-isomer.\n    *   **C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate, 2):** The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is an electron-withdrawing group, a deactivator, and a meta-director.\n    *   **C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid, 6):** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also an electron-withdrawing, deactivating, and meta-directing group.\n\n    Among these three, the deactivating strength generally follows the order -NO₂ > -COOR ≈ -COOH. The stronger the deactivating and meta-directing effect, the lower the yield of the para-isomer. Therefore, the order of increasing para-yield among these is: Nitrobenzene (4) < Ethyl benzoate (2) < Benzoic acid (6).\n\n2.  **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The yield of the para-isomer is significant for these substances. The ratio of para to ortho product is primarily influenced by steric hindrance – larger substituents will sterically hinder the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer.\n    *   **C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3):** The chloro group (-Cl) is deactivating overall but is ortho, para-directing due to electron donation by resonance. Halogens typically yield a high proportion of the para-isomer compared to the ortho-isomer. For bromination, the para-isomer is the major product.\n    *   **C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene, 1):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is an activating, ortho, para-directing group. Due to its relatively small size, a considerable amount of the ortho-isomer is formed, although the para-isomer is still slightly favored. In bromination, the para/ortho ratio is approximately 1.8:1, meaning about 64% of the mixture is the para-isomer.\n    *   **C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene, 5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is also an activating, ortho, para-directing group. It is sterically bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions leads to a higher yield of the para-isomer compared to toluene. For bromination, the para-isomer constitutes about 93% of the ortho-para product mixture.\n\n    Ordering the ortho, para-directors by increasing para-yield: The -C₂H₅ group is significantly bulkier than the -CH₃ group, leading to a higher para/ortho ratio for ethylbenzene than for toluene. The -Cl group, while also favoring the para position, results in a very high para yield, often the highest among these three common substituents due to a combination of electronic and steric factors. Thus, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\n**Overall Ordering**\n\nCombining the two groups, we first list the meta-directors in order of increasing (but still very low) para-yield, followed by the ortho, para-directors in order of increasing para-yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (lowest para-yield):** 4 < 2 < 6\n*   **Ortho, para-directors (highest para-yield):** 1 < 5 < 3\n\nThe complete sequence in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 2 < 6 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic substitution reaction with bromine, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### **Analysis of Substituents**\n\nThe six substances and their substituents are:\n1.  **C6H5-CH3** (Toluene): `-CH3` (methyl) is an activating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5** (Ethyl benzoate): `-COOC2H5` (carboethoxy) is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl** (Chlorobenzene): `-Cl` (chloro) is a deactivating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n4.  **C6H5-NO2** (Nitrobenzene): `-NO2` (nitro) is a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5** (Ethylbenzene): `-C2H5` (ethyl) is an activating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH** (Benzoic acid): `-COOH` (carboxyl) is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n\n### **Categorizing by Directing Effect**\n\nThe yield of the para-isomer is primarily determined by whether the substituent is meta-directing or ortho-, para-directing.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors**: These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the meta position. The formation of the para-isomer is heavily disfavored and occurs in very small amounts.\n    *   `-NO2` (4)\n    *   `-COOC2H5` (2)\n    *   `-COOH` (6)\n\n*   **Ortho-, Para-Directors**: These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. Significant amounts of the para-isomer will be formed.\n    *   `-CH3` (1)\n    *   `-C2H5` (5)\n    *   `-Cl` (3)\n\n### **Ranking the Substances**\n\n**1. Meta-Directors (Lowest para-isomer yield)**\n\nThese three substances will have the lowest yield of the para-isomer. The order among them depends on their deactivating strength and any minor electronic or steric factors influencing the small amount of para-product.\n*   The `-NO2` group is one of the strongest deactivating groups. During its bromination, the para-isomer yield is extremely low, often less than 1%.\n*   The `-COOH` and `-COOC2H5` groups are also deactivating and meta-directing. For the nitration of ethyl benzoate, the para-isomer is about 5%. For benzoic acid, the para-isomer yield is also very low, typically around 1-2%. Comparing the deactivating strength, the order is generally `-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5`. Stronger deactivation leads to a more pronounced meta-direction and thus a lower fraction of para-product.\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-yield for the meta-directors is:\n**4 (`-NO2`) < 2 (`-COOC2H5`) < 6 (`-COOH`)**\n*(Note: Some sources might show slight variations, but they will consistently be the lowest).*\n\n**2. Ortho-, Para-Directors (Highest para-isomer yield)**\n\nFor these substances, the ratio of para to ortho product determines their order. This is mainly influenced by steric hindrance: a bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer.\n*   **-CH3 (1, Toluene) vs. -C2H5 (5, Ethylbenzene)**: The ethyl group is sterically bulkier than the methyl group. This increased bulk hinders the attack at the ortho positions, resulting in a higher yield of the para-isomer for ethylbenzene compared to toluene. For example, during bromination, toluene yields about 67% para-isomer, while ethylbenzene will yield more due to greater steric hindrance.\n*   **-Cl (3, Chlorobenzene)**: The chloro group is ortho-, para-directing. Due to its high electronegativity (inductive effect) and its ability to donate a lone pair of electrons (resonance effect), it strongly favors the para position. The bromination of chlorobenzene yields a very high proportion of the para-isomer, around 87-89%.\n\nComparing the three ortho-, para-directors:\n*   Toluene (**1**) has the smallest alkyl group and thus the lowest para/ortho ratio among the alkylbenzenes.\n*   Ethylbenzene (**5**) has a larger alkyl group, leading to a higher para/ortho ratio than toluene.\n*   Chlorobenzene (**3**) yields a very high percentage of the para-isomer, higher than both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n\nThus, the order of increasing para-yield for the ortho-, para-directors is:\n**1 (`-CH3`) < 5 (`-C2H5`) < 3 (`-Cl`)**\n\n### **Final Combined Order**\n\nCombining the two groups, we get the final sequence for increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n\n**4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**\n\nWait, re-evaluating the order based on literature values.\n\n*   (4) Nitrobenzene: < 1% para\n*   (2) Ethyl Benzoate: ~5% para (from nitration data, as a proxy)\n*   (6) Benzoic Acid: ~1-2% para\n*   (1) Toluene: ~67% para\n*   (5) Ethylbenzene: >67% para (higher than toluene due to sterics)\n*   (3) Chlorobenzene: ~87% para\n\nLet's refine the order based on these values:\n1.  **Nitrobenzene (4)**: ~1%\n2.  **Benzoic Acid (6)**: ~1-2%\n3.  **Ethyl Benzoate (2)**: ~5%\n4.  **Toluene (1)**: ~67%\n5.  **Ethylbenzene (5)**: >67%\n6.  **Chlorobenzene (3)**: ~87%\n\nThis gives the order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nLet's recheck the options provided. The order derived (4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3) matches option A.\n\nFinal check of the reasoning.\n- Meta directors (4, 6, 2) have the lowest para yield. The order among them is based on the degree of deactivation and meta-direction. NO2 is the strongest meta-director, giving the least para. Between COOH and COOC2H5, the difference is small, but the order 4 < 6 < 2 seems plausible.\n- Ortho-para directors (1, 5, 3) have high para yields. The order among them is based on steric and electronic effects. The para/ortho ratio increases with the steric bulk of the alkyl group, so 1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5). Halogens like Cl give a particularly high percentage of the para product, often higher than alkylbenzenes. So, 1 < 5 < 3 is correct.\n- Combining them, the lowest yields are from the meta directors, and the highest are from the o,p directors.\n\nTherefore, the complete sequence is 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nTo determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in the electrophilic bromination of the given substances, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent on the benzene ring. The yield of the para-isomer is influenced by whether the substituent is an ortho-, para-director or a meta-director, and by the substituent's size.\n\n**Analysis of Substituents:**\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents into two main groups:\n1.  **Ortho-, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (bromine) to the positions ortho and para to themselves. All activating groups and halogens fall into this category.\n    *   1) **-CH3 (methyl):** Activating, ortho-, para-director.\n    *   3) **-Cl (chloro):** Deactivating, but ortho-, para-director.\n    *   5) **-C2H5 (ethyl):** Activating, ortho-, para-director.\n\n2.  **Meta-Directing Groups:** These are deactivating groups that direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. Consequently, the yield of the para-isomer is very low.\n    *   2) **-COOC2H5 (ethoxycarbonyl):** Deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   4) **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   6) **-COOH (carboxyl):** Deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**Ranking the Substances:**\n\n**1. Meta-Directors (Lowest para-yield):**\nFor meta-directing groups, the yield of ortho and para products is inherently very small. The order among them depends on the strength of their deactivating and meta-directing effect.\n*   **4) C6H5-NO2:** The nitro group is one of the strongest deactivating, meta-directing groups. The bromination reaction is very slow and produces almost exclusively the meta-isomer, with only trace amounts of the para-isomer (typically <1%).\n*   **6) C6H5-COOH:** The carboxylic acid group is also a strong deactivator and meta-director. Its deactivating effect is slightly less than the nitro group, leading to a marginally higher, yet still very low, yield of the para-isomer compared to nitrobenzene.\n*   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5:** The ethyl ester group is a deactivator and meta-director, comparable in strength to the carboxylic acid group. Some sources indicate that for nitration, it yields a slightly higher percentage of the para-isomer (~5-8%) compared to other strong deactivators.\n\nBased on the strength of the deactivating effect, the order of increasing para-yield for these three is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**2. Ortho-, Para-Directors (Highest para-yield):**\nFor these groups, both ortho and para products are formed. The ratio between them (and thus the percentage of para-isomer) is primarily determined by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will sterically hinder the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para-product.\n*   **1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The methyl group is relatively small. Bromination of toluene yields a significant amount of both ortho and para products. A typical distribution for bromination is about 33% ortho and 66% para.\n*   **5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance disfavors substitution at the ortho position, resulting in a higher yield of the para-isomer compared to toluene. The para-isomer is strongly favored.\n*   **3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** Halogens are ortho-, para-directors but are deactivating overall. The chlorine atom's steric hindrance is significant, and its electronic effects also favor para substitution. Data for nitration shows chlorobenzene gives about 64-70% para product, which is higher than for toluene's nitration. For bromination, the para-selectivity is even higher, often around 87-89%.\n\nComparing the typical para yields for the ortho-, para-directors:\n*   Toluene (-CH3): ~66% para\n*   Chlorobenzene (-Cl): ~87% para\n*   Ethylbenzene (-C2H5): >90% para (higher than toluene due to sterics)\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-yield for this group is: **1 < 3 < 5**.\n\n**Final Combined Order:**\n\nCombining the two groups, the overall order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield is:\n-NO2 (4) < -COOH (6) < -COOC2H5 (2) < -CH3 (1) < -Cl (3) < -C2H5 (5)\n\nThis corresponds to the order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**.\n\nLet's re-examine the options and the established order. My derived order does not match any of the provided options exactly. Let me re-evaluate the relative positions of -CH3 (1), -C2H5 (5), and -Cl (3).\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** C2H5 > CH3. So, para yield for 5 > 1. This is consistent.\n*   **-Cl vs Alkyl groups:** Comparing -Cl with alkyl groups is nuanced. Data for nitration often shows: Toluene (37% para), Chlorobenzene (70% para). This suggests para yield for 3 > 1.\n*   **-Cl vs -C2H5:** This is the most critical comparison. Steric bulk of ethyl is generally considered greater than chloro, which would suggest para yield for 5 > 3.\n\nLet's reconsider my order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**.\nLet's check the options again.\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nB) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nOption C is **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**. This is very close to my derived order, only differing in the placement of 5 (ethyl) and 3 (chloro). Option C suggests para yield for ethylbenzene is less than for chlorobenzene.\nLet's check literature values again specifically for bromination:\n*   Bromination of Toluene (1): ~66% para.\n*   Bromination of Chlorobenzene (3): ~87% para.\n*   Bromination of Ethylbenzene (5): ~94% para (one source claims this), another suggests it should be simply \"more than toluene\".\n\nIf we strictly follow the steric hindrance argument, the order of bulk is -C2H5 > -CH3. The position of -Cl is complex. If the data holds that Chlorobenzene gives ~87% para and Ethylbenzene gives more than Toluene (66%) but potentially less than Chlorobenzene, then option C might be correct. However, most sources point to increasing steric hindrance of the alkyl chain leading to progressively higher para-selectivity (Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Isopropylbenzene). This would make the order 1 < 3 < 5 or 1 < 5 < 3 depending on where Cl fits.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the meta-directors in option C: 4 < 6 < 2. This part is consistent with our analysis.\nLet's re-evaluate the ortho-para directors in option C: 1 < 5 < 3.\nThis means: Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\nPara %: ~66% < (more than 66%) < ~87%. This is plausible. It suggests that the para-directing effect of chlorine (combination of electronic and steric factors) results in a higher para yield than the purely steric argument for the ethyl group relative to the methyl group.\n\nLet's consider another possibility. Is it possible that the order is 4 < 2 < 6? This would mean Benzoic Acid (-COOH) gives more para-isomer than Ethyl Benzoate (-COOC2H5). This is unlikely, as the bulkier ester group might slightly favor para over ortho compared to the COOH group, even in the trace amounts formed. So the 4 < 6 < 2 order is the most chemically sound for the meta-directors.\n\nGiven the options, C: **4<6<2<1<5<3** seems the most plausible, although the relative order of ethylbenzene (5) and chlorobenzene (3) can be debated. However, the order among the meta-directors (4<6<2) and the fact that toluene (1) has the lowest para-yield among the o,p-directors is firm. The high para-selectivity of halogens is also a well-established fact. The question then hinges on whether ethylbenzene's para-yield surpasses that of chlorobenzene. Without definitive, directly comparable experimental data for bromination under identical conditions, and given the multiple-choice format, we must choose the best fit. Option C aligns well with the majority of the chemical principles.\n\nFinal Check:\n*   Lowest para yield: -NO2 (4). Correct.\n*   Order of meta-directors: -NO2 (4) < -COOH (6) < -COOC2H5 (2). Correct.\n*   Lowest yield among o,p directors: -CH3 (1). Correct.\n*   Order of highest yields: The question is between (1 < 5 < 3) and (1 < 3 < 5). Both are plausible depending on exact conditions. Option C presents 1 < 5 < 3. This means Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene. This is a reasonable ranking.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### Step 1: Classify the substituents\nFirst, we need to classify the substituent on each benzene ring (C6H5-) as either *ortho, para*-directing or *meta*-directing. This classification determines the primary positions of substitution.\n\n*   **Activating groups** are *ortho, para*-directing.\n*   **Deactivating groups** are *meta*-directing (with the exception of halogens).\n*   **Halogens** are deactivating but *ortho, para*-directing.\n\nLet's classify the substituents for substances 1-6:\n1.  **-CH3 (in Toluene)**: An alkyl group. It is **activating** and ***ortho, para*-directing**.\n2.  **-COOC2H5 (in Ethyl benzoate)**: An ester group. The carbonyl (C=O) makes it electron-withdrawing. It is **deactivating** and ***meta*-directing**.\n3.  **-Cl (in Chlorobenzene)**: A halogen. It is **deactivating** but ***ortho, para*-directing**.\n4.  **-NO2 (in Nitrobenzene)**: A nitro group. It is strongly electron-withdrawing. It is a **strong deactivator** and ***meta*-directing**.\n5.  **-C2H5 (in Ethylbenzene)**: An alkyl group. It is **activating** and ***ortho, para*-directing**.\n6.  **-COOH (in Benzoic acid)**: A carboxylic acid group. The carbonyl (C=O) makes it electron-withdrawing. It is **deactivating** and ***meta*-directing**.\n\nSo we have two groups of substances:\n*   **Meta-directors**: 4 (-NO2), 2 (-COOC2H5), 6 (-COOH)\n*   **Ortho, para-directors**: 1 (-CH3), 5 (-C2H5), 3 (-Cl)\n\n### Step 2: Order the substances within each group\n\n**A. Meta-directors (4, 2, 6)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the main product is the meta-isomer. The yield of the ortho and para isomers is very low. We need to arrange them in order of increasing para-isomer yield. A stronger deactivating and meta-directing group will lead to a higher proportion of the meta product and consequently a lower proportion of the para product.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength (and thus meta-directing strength) for these groups is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n\n*   **-NO2 (4)** is the strongest deactivator, so it will give the lowest yield of the para-isomer (typically <1%).\n*   **-COOH (6)** is a strong deactivator, stronger than the ester group. It will give a very low yield of the para-isomer (typically 1-2%).\n*   **-COOC2H5 (2)** is also a strong deactivator, but generally considered slightly weaker than -COOH. It will give a low, but slightly higher, yield of the para-isomer compared to -COOH (typically ~5%).\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for the meta-directors is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**B. Ortho, para-directors (1, 3, 5)**\n\nFor ortho, para-directors, the substitution occurs primarily at the ortho and para positions. The ratio of para to ortho product (p/o ratio) determines the percentage yield of the para-isomer. The p/o ratio is influenced by:\n*   **Steric Hindrance**: Larger substituents will block the ortho positions, leading to a higher yield of the para product. The size of the incoming electrophile (bromine) is also significant.\n*   **Electronic Effects**: For halogens like -Cl, the strong deactivating inductive effect is felt more at the ortho position than the para position, which also increases the p/o ratio.\n\nLet's compare the three groups:\n*   **-CH3 (1, Toluene)**: This is a relatively small group. It gives a significant amount of both ortho and para products. For bromination, the para-isomer yield is typically around 67%.\n*   **-C2H5 (5, Ethylbenzene)**: This group is bulkier than -CH3. The increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions leads to a higher proportion of the para product compared to toluene.\n*   **-Cl (3, Chlorobenzene)**: This group's size is comparable to a methyl group, but its electronic properties are different. The deactivating inductive effect of chlorine disfavors the ortho positions more than the para position, leading to a high p/o ratio.\n\nComparing the para-yields is complex and can depend on reaction conditions. However, a common trend observed for nitration (a similar electrophilic substitution) is that the electronic effect in chlorobenzene leads to a very high para percentage, while the steric effect of the ethyl group also increases the para percentage relative to toluene. The established order of para-isomer yield for nitration is: Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene. While bromination involves a larger electrophile (making sterics more important), this established chemical trend is likely what the question is based on.\n\nIf we assume this order, we get: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### Step 3: Combine the groups\n\nThe para-isomer yield for any *meta*-director will be significantly lower than for any *ortho, para*-director. So, we place the ordered list of meta-directors before the ordered list of ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Meta-director order: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Ortho, para-director order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nCombining these gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Reaction and the Goal**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a series of monosubstituted benzene rings. The goal is to arrange the starting substances in order of *increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer*. The yield of the para-isomer depends on two main factors:\n1.  The directing effect of the substituent (ortho/para vs. meta).\n2.  The steric and electronic properties of the substituent, which influence the ortho-to-para ratio for ortho/para directors.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\n\nFirst, we classify each substituent based on its directing effect.\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups**: These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer yield will be significant.\n    *   1) -CH3 (Toluene): Activating, ortho/para-directing.\n    *   5) -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene): Activating, ortho/para-directing.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating, but ortho/para-directing.\n*   **Meta-directing groups**: These groups direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. The yield of the para-isomer will be very low.\n    *   4) -NO2 (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid): Deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating, meta-directing.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Groups**\n\nFor meta-directors, the ortho and para positions are strongly deactivated. Therefore, they will produce the smallest amount of the para-isomer. The amount of para-product formed is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group; the more deactivating the group, the lower the yield of the para-isomer.\n\nLet's rank the deactivating strength of these meta-directing groups:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n(Nitro is one of the strongest deactivators, followed by carboxylic acid, and then the ester group).\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for these substances is:\nNitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n\nThis establishes the beginning of our sequence: **4 < 6 < 2 ...**\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Groups**\n\nThese substances will produce a much higher yield of the para-isomer compared to the meta-directors. To order them, we need to compare their para-selectivity (the ratio of para to ortho product).\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The primary difference affecting the ortho/para ratio is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk sterically hinders attack at the two adjacent ortho positions, thus favoring attack at the more accessible para position. Therefore, ethylbenzene is expected to give a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   Order: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5).\n\n*   **Comparing alkyl groups with -Cl (3):** Halogens like chlorine (-Cl) are a special case. While they are deactivating overall due to their strong inductive electron withdrawal (-I effect), they are ortho/para-directing due to resonance electron donation (+M effect). A well-known characteristic of halogen substituents in electrophilic substitution is that they show very high selectivity for the para position, partly due to sterics and electronic factors. Experimental data confirms this; for example, the bromination of chlorobenzene yields about 87% para-isomer, which is significantly higher than for toluene (around 67%).\n    *   Order: Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\nCombining the order for the ortho/para directors, we get:\nToluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\nThis establishes the end of our sequence: **... 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the two groups**\n\nWe combine the sequence for the meta-directors and the ortho/para-directors. The para yield for any ortho/para-director will be substantially higher than for any meta-director.\n\n*   Meta-directors order: 4 < 6 < 2\n*   Ortho/para-directors order: 1 < 5 < 3\n\nThe complete sequence in order of increasing yield of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**Step 6: Match with the given options**\n\nLet's compare our derived sequence with the choices provided:\nA) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nB) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nOur derived sequence, 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3, perfectly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents based on their directing effects.**\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, the substituent already on the benzene ring determines where the new group will be added. We can classify them into two main categories:\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (bromine) to the positions ortho and para to themselves. They typically have lone pairs on the atom attached to the ring or are alkyl groups.\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the positions meta to themselves. They typically have a partial or full positive charge on the atom attached to the ring.\n\nLet's classify each substance:\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** -CH3 is an alkyl group. It is an **ortho, para-director**.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** -COOC2H5 is an ester group. The carbonyl carbon has a partial positive charge, making it electron-withdrawing. It is a **meta-director**.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl is a halogen. It is an **ortho, para-director**.\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** -NO2 is a strongly electron-withdrawing group. It is a **meta-director**.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** -C2H5 is an alkyl group. It is an **ortho, para-director**.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** -COOH is a carboxylic acid group. The carbonyl carbon has a partial positive charge. It is a **meta-director**.\n\n**Step 2: Separate the substances into two groups.**\nBased on the directing effects, we can form two groups. The meta-directors will have a very low yield of the para-isomer, while the ortho, para-directors will have a significantly higher yield.\n*   **Low Para Yield Group (Meta-directors):**\n    *   4) Nitrobenzene (C6H5-NO2)\n    *   6) Benzoic acid (C6H5-COOH)\n    *   2) Ethyl benzoate (C6H5-COOC2H5)\n*   **High Para Yield Group (Ortho, para-directors):**\n    *   1) Toluene (C6H5-CH3)\n    *   5) Ethylbenzene (C6H5-C2H5)\n    *   3) Chlorobenzene (C6H5-Cl)\n\nThe final correct sequence must have the meta-directors first, followed by the ortho, para-directors.\n\n**Step 3: Order the meta-directing substances.**\nFor meta-directors, the para-isomer is a minor product. The yield of this minor product is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para isomer. The established order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n(Nitro > Carboxylic Acid > Ester)\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse:\nYield(para-NO2) < Yield(para-COOH) < Yield(para-COOC2H5)\nThis corresponds to the substance order: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the ortho, para-directing substances.**\nFor this group, the para-isomer is a major product. The ratio of para to ortho product depends mainly on steric hindrance and electronic factors.\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) vs. -C2H5 (5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size blocks the adjacent ortho positions, making the less hindered para position a more likely site for substitution. Therefore, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. This gives us the order: **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1, 5) vs. -Cl (3):** The chloro group, while deactivating overall, is known to be highly para-selective. This is because its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more strongly than the distant para position. This electronic factor typically results in a higher para/ortho ratio for halogens compared to alkyl groups. Thus, chlorobenzene will produce the highest percentage of para-isomer in this group. This gives us the order: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the orders into the final answer.**\nBy combining the results from Steps 3 and 4, we place the ordered meta-directing group before the ordered ortho, para-directing group.\n\n*   Meta-directors order: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Ortho, para-directors order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe complete sequence for increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning for the arrangement:\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents.**\nSubstituents on a benzene ring determine the position of incoming electrophiles. They are classified as either ortho, para-directing or meta-directing.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br+) to the positions ortho and para to themselves.\n    *   -CH3 (Toluene, 1): Activating group\n    *   -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene, 5): Activating group\n    *   -Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3): Deactivating group, but directs ortho/para\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They will have a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   -NO2 (Nitrobenzene, 4): Strongly deactivating group\n    *   -COOH (Benzoic acid, 6): Deactivating group\n    *   -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate, 2): Deactivating group\n\n**Step 2: Order the substances with meta-directing groups.**\nMeta-directing groups result in the lowest yields of para-isomers. The yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group will more strongly direct to the meta position, leaving an even smaller percentage for the para position.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing yield of the para-isomer is the reverse of this:\nC6H5-NO2 < C6H5-COOH < C6H5-COOC2H5\nThis corresponds to the substance numbers: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the substances with ortho, para-directing groups.**\nThese groups will have the highest yields of the para-isomer. The ratio of para to ortho product is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions. As a result, substitution at the less hindered para position is favored more in ethylbenzene than in toluene.\n    *   Therefore, the para-isomer yield is higher for ethylbenzene. Order: **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing -Cl (3) with the alkyl groups:** The chlorine atom is an ortho, para-director due to the resonance effect of its lone pairs. However, it has a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect), which is most pronounced at the ortho positions. This deactivates the ortho positions more than the para position, leading to a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is significantly higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para yield is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the two groups.**\nThe substances with meta-directing groups will have lower para-isomer yields than those with ortho, para-directing groups. Combining the two ordered sets gives the final sequence.\n\n(Lowest para yield) **4 < 6 < 2** < **1 < 5 < 3** (Highest para yield)\n\nThis complete order matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield from electrophilic bromination, we must first classify the substituents on the benzene ring and then analyze their directing effects and the steric hindrance they impose.\n\n### **Step 1: Classify the Substituents**\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents as either ortho-, para-directing or meta-directing. This determines where the bromine atom is most likely to substitute.\n\n*   **Ortho-, para-directing groups:** These groups activate or weakly deactivate the ring and direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho (positions 2 and 6) and para (position 4) positions.\n    *   **-CH3 (in Toluene, 1):** Activating, ortho-, para-directing.\n    *   **-C2H5 (in Ethylbenzene, 5):** Activating, ortho-, para-directing.\n    *   **-Cl (in Chlorobenzene, 3):** Deactivating, but ortho-, para-directing.\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups deactivate the ring and direct incoming electrophiles to the meta (positions 3 and 5) positions.\n    *   **-NO2 (in Nitrobenzene, 4):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   **-COOH (in Benzoic acid, 6):** Deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   **-COOC2H5 (in Ethyl benzoate, 2):** Deactivating, meta-directing.\n\n### **Step 2: Compare Para-Isomer Yields Within Each Group**\n\n**Meta-Directing Substances (Lowest Para Yield)**\n\nSubstances with meta-directing groups will produce very low yields of the para-isomer. Bromination of these compounds predominantly yields the meta-product. The small amount of para-isomer formed is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent.\n\n*   **Nitrobenzene (4, -NO2):** The nitro group is one of the strongest deactivating groups. Bromination yields almost exclusively the meta-isomer, with only trace amounts of the para-isomer (around 1% or less).\n*   **Benzoic acid (6, -COOH) and Ethyl benzoate (2, -COOC2H5):** These are also strong deactivators, though generally less so than the nitro group. They will produce slightly more para-isomer than nitrobenzene but still in very small quantities. For similar reactions like nitration, ethyl benzoate yields around 5% para-isomer. Comparing -COOH and -COOC2H5, they have similar deactivating strengths, but the trend generally places -COOH as slightly more deactivating than -COOR.\n\nThus, for the meta-directors, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is:\n**Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**\n\n**Ortho-, Para-Directing Substances (Highest Para Yield)**\n\nSubstances with ortho-, para-directing groups will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer. The ratio of the para to ortho isomer is primarily governed by two factors: electronics and sterics.\n\n*   **-Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3):** Halogens are a unique case. While they are deactivating overall due to their strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I), they direct ortho-para because of their electron-donating resonance effect (+R). The inductive effect deactivates the adjacent ortho positions more strongly than the more distant para position. This leads to a strong preference for para substitution. For instance, nitration of chlorobenzene gives about 70% para product. For bromination, the para-isomer is also heavily favored, often around 89%.\n*   **-CH3 (Toluene, 1) and -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene, 5):** Alkyl groups are activating and direct ortho-para. The key factor determining the ortho/para ratio between them is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size makes it more difficult for the incoming electrophile (the bulky bromine) to attack the ortho positions, thus favoring the less hindered para position to a greater extent. Therefore, ethylbenzene will have a higher para/ortho ratio than toluene.\n    *   The bromination of toluene yields about 67% para-isomer.\n    *   The bromination of ethylbenzene is expected to yield an even higher percentage of the para-isomer due to increased steric hindrance at the ortho position.\n\nSo, for the ortho-, para-directors, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is:\n**Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**\n\n### **Step 3: Combine the Rankings**\n\nBy combining the two groups, we establish the final order from the lowest percentage of para-isomer to the highest:\n\n**4 (-NO2) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC2H5) < 1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl)**\n\nThis sequence matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nTo arrange the given substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we must consider the directing effects and steric properties of each substituent on the benzene ring. The yield of the para-isomer is influenced by whether the substituent is ortho-, para-directing or meta-directing, and by the steric hindrance around the ortho positions.\n\n### Analysis of Substituents:\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents into two main categories:\n*   **Ortho-, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the positions ortho (adjacent) and para (opposite) to themselves. All activating groups and halogens fall into this category.\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta positions. Deactivating groups (except for halogens) are meta-directors.\n\nThe substances are:\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** -CH3 is an activating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** -COOC2H5 is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl is a deactivating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** -NO2 is a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** -C2H5 is an activating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** -COOH is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n\n### Ranking the Substances:\n\nThe substances with meta-directing groups will produce very low yields of the para-isomer, while those with ortho-, para-directing groups will produce significantly higher yields.\n\n**1. Meta-Directors (lowest para-yield):**\nFor substances 4, 6, and 2, the primary product is the meta-isomer. The para-isomer is formed in very small quantities.\n*   **4) C6H5-NO2:** The -NO2 group is a powerful deactivator. During nitration (a similar electrophilic substitution), it yields only a trace (0-5%) of the para-isomer. Bromination is expected to be similar, yielding predominantly the meta-isomer.\n*   **6) C6H5-COOH:** The -COOH group is also a meta-director. Its deactivating effect leads to low yields of ortho and para products.\n*   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5:** The -COOC2H5 group is a meta-director, similar to -COOH. Data for the nitration of ethyl benzoate shows it yields predominantly the meta-isomer (73%), with about 5% being the para-isomer.\n\nComparing these three, the order of deactivating strength is generally -NO2 > -COOH ≈ -COOR. This correlates with the very low amounts of para-product. Based on available data for similar reactions, the para-isomer yield increases in the order: Nitrobenzene < Benzoic Acid < Ethyl Benzoate.\n*   **Order of increasing para-yield for meta-directors: 4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**2. Ortho-, Para-Directors (highest para-yield):**\nFor substances 1, 5, and 3, the major products are the ortho- and para-isomers. The ratio between para and ortho products is largely determined by steric hindrance; bulkier groups hinder attack at the ortho position, thus favoring the para position.\n*   **1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The -CH3 group is relatively small. Bromination gives a substantial amount of both ortho and para products, with the para-isomer being favored. For example, sulfonation of toluene yields about 60-65% para-isomer. Nitration gives about 37% para-isomer. For bromination, the para-isomer is the major product over the ortho-isomer.\n*   **5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The -C2H5 group is bulkier than the -CH3 group. This increased steric hindrance further disfavors ortho-substitution, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer compared to toluene.\n*   **3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The -Cl atom, while deactivating overall, is an ortho-, para-director. Halogens often lead to a high percentage of the para-isomer. For example, the nitration of chlorobenzene yields 70% of the para-product. This high para-selectivity is due to a combination of steric effects and the strong inductive electron withdrawal that deactivates the ortho position more than the para position.\n\nComparing these three, the steric bulk increases from -CH3 to -C2H5, so the para-yield of ethylbenzene (5) is greater than that of toluene (1). Chlorobenzene (3) is known to give a very high proportion of the para-isomer in electrophilic substitutions.\n*   **Order of increasing para-yield for ortho-, para-directors: 1 < 5 < 3**\n\n### Final Order:\n\nCombining the two groups, the overall order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is obtained by placing the meta-directors before the ortho-, para-directors.\n\nFinal sequence: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nTo determine the order of substances by the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction, we must analyze the directing effects of each substituent on the benzene ring. The reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution, where a bromine atom replaces a hydrogen atom on the ring. The substituent already present on the ring dictates the position (ortho, meta, or para) where the new bromine atom will attach.\n\nThe six substances are:\n1.  **С6H5-CH3** (Toluene)\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5** (Ethyl benzoate)\n3.  **C6H5-Cl** (Chlorobenzene)\n4.  **C6H5-NO2** (Nitrobenzene)\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5** (Ethylbenzene)\n6.  **C6H5-COOH** (Benzoic acid)\n\nThese substituents can be classified into two main groups based on their directing effects:\n\n**1. Meta-directing groups:** These groups are deactivating, meaning they make the benzene ring less reactive towards electrophilic substitution. They direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position, resulting in very low yields of the ortho and para isomers. The stronger the deactivating effect, the lower the yield of the para-isomer.\n*   **-NO2 (4)**: This is a very strong deactivating group. Bromination of nitrobenzene yields almost exclusively the meta-isomer, with the para-isomer yield being extremely low, typically around 1%.\n*   **-COOH (6)**: This is a deactivating group, directing incoming substituents to the meta position. Its para-isomer yield is very small.\n*   **-COOC2H5 (2)**: Similar to the carboxylic acid group, the ethyl ester group is also a deactivating, meta-director. The para-isomer yield is minimal, though typically slightly higher than for nitrobenzene. For nitration, which follows similar principles, ethyl benzoate yields about 5% para product.\n\nAmong these three, the nitro group is the strongest deactivator, leading to the lowest para yield. The carboxylic acid and ethyl ester groups are also strong deactivators. Based on typical isomer distributions, the order of increasing para-yield for these meta-directors is: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n\n**2. Ortho, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. For these substances, the para-isomer is a significant product. The ratio of para to ortho product is largely influenced by steric hindrance; bulkier groups hinder substitution at the adjacent ortho positions, thus increasing the proportion of the para-isomer.\n*   **-CH3 (1)**: The methyl group is an activating, ortho, para-director. In bromination, toluene yields a significant amount of para-isomer, typically around 62-67%.\n*   **-C2H5 (5)**: The ethyl group is also an activating, ortho, para-director. It is sterically bulkier than the methyl group. This increased bulk hinders the ortho positions more, leading to a higher yield of the para-isomer compared to toluene. The para product can be as high as 94%.\n*   **-Cl (3)**: The chloro group is deactivating overall but is an ortho, para-director. Due to electronic factors and its size, it directs a very high proportion of the product to the para position, typically around 89% in bromination.\n\nComparing these three, toluene (1) has the lowest para yield. Comparing chlorobenzene (3) and ethylbenzene (5), literature data suggests that the larger steric bulk of the ethyl group leads to a slightly higher para-selectivity (around 94%) than the chloro group (around 89%). Thus, the order of increasing para yield is: Toluene (1) < Chlorobenzene (3) < Ethylbenzene (5).\n\n**Combined Ranking:**\n\nBy combining the two groups, we can establish the overall order from the lowest para-isomer yield to the highest:\n\n{Meta-directors} < {Ortho, para-directors}\n\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 3 < 5)\n\nThis gives the final sequence: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**.\n\nUpon reviewing the provided options, this exact sequence is not available. However, option C is the closest match, differing only in the final two positions.\n\nMy analysis: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**\nOption C:      **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe discrepancy lies in the relative para-isomer yield of chlorobenzene (3) versus ethylbenzene (5). While most data suggest ethylbenzene gives a slightly higher para yield due to sterics, the values are close (89% vs 94%), and slight variations in reaction conditions could potentially alter this order. Given the options, Option C correctly identifies the meta-directors as having the lowest para yields in the order 4 < 6 < 2, and correctly identifies toluene (1) as having the lowest para yield among the o,p-directors. The distinction between chlorobenzene and ethylbenzene is the most subtle point. Considering the provided choices, option C is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order:\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction and Substituent Effects**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination). The substituent already on the benzene ring (C₆H₅-X) determines two things:\n*   **Reactivity:** Activating groups increase the reaction rate, while deactivating groups decrease it.\n*   **Directing Effect (Regioselectivity):** Substituents direct the incoming electrophile (Br⁺) to specific positions.\n    *   **Ortho/Para Directors:** These direct the electrophile to the positions ortho (adjacent) and para (opposite) to the substituent. This group includes activators (like alkyl groups) and weak deactivators (halogens).\n    *   **Meta Directors:** These direct the electrophile to the meta position. This group includes moderate and strong deactivators.\n\nThe question asks to arrange the substances in order of *increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer*.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\n\nFirst, let's classify the six substituents based on their directing effects.\n\n*   **Substances that will give a high yield of the para-isomer (Ortho/Para Directors):**\n    *   1) -CH₃ (Methyl): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   5) -C₂H₅ (Ethyl): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chloro): Deactivating, but o,p-director.\n\n*   **Substances that will give a very low yield of the para-isomer (Meta Directors):**\n    *   4) -NO₂ (Nitro): Strongly deactivating, m-director.\n    *   2) -COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl ester): Deactivating, m-director.\n    *   6) -COOH (Carboxylic acid): Deactivating, m-director.\n\nThis means that the three meta-directing substances (4, 2, 6) will have the lowest yields of the para-isomer and will come first in the ordered list. The three ortho/para-directing substances (1, 5, 3) will have the highest yields of the para-isomer and will come last.\n\n**3. Rank the Meta Directors (Lowest Para Yield)**\n\nFor the meta-directing groups (-NO₂, -COOC₂H₅, -COOH), the para-isomer is a very minor product. The absolute yield of any product (including the para-isomer) depends on the overall reactivity of the benzene ring. The more deactivated the ring, the lower the overall yield of products.\n\n*   We need to rank them by their deactivating strength. Stronger deactivation means lower reactivity and thus a lower yield of the para-isomer.\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid group because the ethyl group (+I effect) donates a small amount of electron density, which slightly counteracts the withdrawal effect.\n*   Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will increase in the reverse order of deactivating strength: **-NO₂ < -COOH < -COOC₂H₅**.\n*   In terms of substance numbers, the order is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**4. Rank the Ortho/Para Directors (Highest Para Yield)**\n\nFor the o,p-directing groups (-CH₃, -C₂H₅, -Cl), we are comparing the relative amounts of the para-isomer produced. This is determined by the ratio of para to ortho products, which is influenced by both steric and electronic effects.\n\n*   **-CH₃ vs. -C₂H₅ (Substances 1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased bulk hinders the approach of the electrophile to the ortho positions more significantly, leading to a higher proportion of the para product. Therefore, the para-isomer yield from ethylbenzene will be higher than from toluene. Order: **-CH₃ < -C₂H₅** (or **1 < 5**).\n*   **-Cl vs. the Alkyl Groups (Substance 3 vs. 1 & 5):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is small, but it has a powerful electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I). This -I effect deactivates the ortho position more strongly than the more distant para position. This electronic effect strongly favors substitution at the para position, leading to a very high para/ortho ratio. For many electrophilic substitutions, chlorobenzene gives a higher percentage of the para isomer than toluene and even ethylbenzene.\n*   Based on common experimental data (e.g., nitration is a good proxy), the typical percentage of the para product increases in the order: **-CH₃ < -C₂H₅ < -Cl**.\n*   In terms of substance numbers, the order is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**5. Combine the Rankings**\n\nNow we combine the two groups. The meta-directors have the lowest para yield, and the ortho/para directors have the highest.\n\n*   Order of m-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of o,p-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nCombining these gives the final order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence matches option C.\n\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nThe correct order is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a breakdown of the isomer distribution for the electrophilic bromination of the given substances to determine the increasing order of the weight fraction of the para-isomer yield. The weight fraction is equivalent to the molar percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n### 1. Classification of Substituents\n\n*   **-NO₂ (Nitro group in substance 4):** This is a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group. It significantly reduces the reactivity of the benzene ring and directs the incoming electrophile to the meta position. Consequently, the yield of the para-isomer is extremely low.\n*   **-COOH (Carboxyl group in substance 6):** This is a deactivating, meta-directing group. The yield of the para-isomer is very low, but generally slightly higher than for the nitro group.\n*   **-COOC₂H₅ (Ester group in substance 2):** This is also a deactivating, meta-directing group. Textbooks generally place its deactivating strength as slightly less than the carboxylic acid group. This would suggest a slightly higher para yield than for benzoic acid. However, some data for nitration reactions shows ethyl benzoate gives 5% para product, while other sources imply a very low yield for benzoic acid. There is some ambiguity in the relative order of these two.\n*   **-Cl (Chloro group in substance 3):** This is a deactivating, ortho-, para-directing group. The inductive effect deactivates the ring, but resonance directs incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. Halogens typically yield a high percentage of the para isomer. For example, nitration of chlorobenzene yields about 70% para-isomer.\n*   **-CH₃ (Methyl group in substance 1):** This is an activating, ortho-, para-directing group. Due to its relatively small size, it allows for a significant amount of ortho substitution. For bromination, the para isomer yield is typically around 67%.\n*   **-C₂H₅ (Ethyl group in substance 5):** This is an activating, ortho-, para-directing group. It is bulkier than the methyl group, which causes greater steric hindrance at the ortho positions. This leads to a higher proportion of the para-isomer compared to toluene. For bromination, the para-isomer yield is about 62%. However, some studies on bromination kinetics suggest that under certain conditions, ethylbenzene can be less para-selective than other alkylbenzenes.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Para-Isomer Yield\n\nThe order of increasing para-isomer yield can be established by considering the directing effects and steric hindrance.\n\n1.  **Meta-directing groups (-NO₂, -COOH, -COOC₂H₅):** These will produce the lowest yields of the para-isomer. The stronger the deactivating effect, the lower the proportion of ortho and para products. The order of deactivation is generally considered to be -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅. This means the para-isomer yield should increase in the order: NO₂ < COOH < COOC₂H₅. This corresponds to substance order: 4 < 6 < 2.\n\n2.  **Ortho-, para-directing groups (-Cl, -CH₃, -C₂H₅):** These produce significantly more para-isomer. The ratio of para to ortho product is largely determined by steric hindrance. A bulkier group will favor substitution at the less hindered para position.\n    *   The steric bulk increases in the order: -Cl < -CH₃ < -C₂H₅.\n    *   Therefore, the preference for the para position, and thus the yield of the para-isomer, should increase in this order: 3 (-Cl) < 1 (-CH₃) < 5 (-C₂H₅).\n\n### 3. Combining the Ranks\n\nCombining the two groups gives a predicted order. However, the provided options suggest a specific ordering that may reflect nuanced experimental realities not captured by simple rules. Let's analyze the most plausible option based on available data.\n\n*   **Lowest Yield:** Nitrobenzene (4) is the most deactivated and gives the least para product.\n*   **Next Lowest:** The other meta-directors, ethyl benzoate (2) and benzoic acid (6), will follow. While textbook deactivating trends suggest 4 < 6 < 2, some data for similar reactions (nitration) indicates ethyl benzoate (2) yields 5% para while benzoic acid's para yield is lower, around 1-2%. Let's re-evaluate based on the option C, which places (2) before (6), suggesting para-yield(2) < para-yield(6). This would imply -COOC₂H₅ is more strongly deactivating towards the para position than -COOH, which is contrary to general rules but could arise under specific reaction conditions.\n*   **Ortho, Para Directors:** The order among these is determined by a balance of electronic and steric effects. My steric argument suggested the order of increasing para yield as 3 < 1 < 5. This is consistent with option C. Let's look at the data again:\n    *   **Chlorobenzene (3):** Bromination gives a high para/ortho ratio, with some sources stating an o/p ratio of 0.1 to 1, meaning para is the major product, up to ~90%. However, other substitutions like nitration give ~70% para.\n    *   **Toluene (1):** Bromination yields are reported as 33% ortho and 67% para.\n    *   **Ethylbenzene (5):** Bromination data shows 38% ortho and 62% para.\n\nThis new data suggests the order of increasing para-yield for the o,p-directors is **5 (-C₂H₅, 62%) < 1 (-CH₃, 67%) < 3 (-Cl, ~70-90%)**. This contradicts my initial steric bulk argument and the order in option C.\n\nLet's re-examine Option C: `4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5`. This suggests the para yield order is: `NO₂ < COOC₂H₅ < COOH < Cl < CH₃ < C₂H₅`.\n*   The right side `Cl < CH₃ < C₂H₅` aligns with the steric hindrance argument.\n*   The left side `NO₂ < COOC₂H₅ < COOH` contradicts the standard deactivating order.\n\nThere appears to be conflicting information between simple textbook rules and specific experimental data, and even among different data sources. However, let's re-evaluate the premise. The key is the steric effect on the *o,p*-directors. The common understanding is that increasing steric bulk of the substituent increases the proportion of the para-isomer.\n*   Order of steric bulk: -Cl < -CH₃ < -C₂H₅\n*   This leads to increasing para yield: **3 < 1 < 5**\n\nNow for the *meta*-directors. The yield of the para-isomer is minimal. Stronger deactivation correlates with less ortho/para product.\n*   Order of deactivating strength: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅\n*   This leads to increasing para yield: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\nCombining these two established orders gives: **4 < 6 < 2 < 3 < 1 < 5**.\n\nLet's re-check the options. This sequence does not match any of the options perfectly. Let's look closely at option C again: **4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**. This option has the o,p-directors in the order I deduced from sterics (`3 < 1 < 5`). The only discrepancy with my reasoning is the relative order of (2) and (6). It is possible that under the specific reaction conditions, the ester group (-COOC₂H₅) leads to a lower para yield than the carboxylic acid group (-COOH), possibly due to complexation with the Lewis acid catalyst. Given that the order for the o,p-directors (`3 < 1 < 5`) is chemically sound based on sterics and aligns with option C, and the placement of the meta-directors (4, 2, 6) at the beginning is correct, option C appears to be the most plausible choice, despite the small ambiguity between substances 2 and 6.\n\nFinal arrangement based on this analysis:\n**4 (-NO₂) < 2 (-COOC₂H₅) < 6 (-COOH) < 3 (-Cl) < 1 (-CH₃) < 5 (-C₂H₅)**\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring and how they influence the product distribution in an electrophilic substitution reaction (bromination). The goal is to arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. The weight fraction is directly proportional to the molar percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Classify Substituents**: We will classify each substituent (-CH3, -COOC2H5, -Cl, -NO2, -C2H5, -COOH) as either ortho,para-directing or meta-directing.\n2.  **Estimate Para Yield**:\n    *   Substituents that are *meta*-directing will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer. We will rank them based on their deactivating strength; stronger deactivators are more selective for the *meta* position, resulting in even less para product.\n    *   Substituents that are *ortho,para*-directing will produce a significant yield of the para-isomer. We will rank them based on factors like steric hindrance and electronic effects, which determine the ratio of para to ortho product.\n3.  **Combine and Sort**: We will combine the two groups and create a final sorted list from lowest to highest para-isomer yield.\n4.  **Implement in Python**: A Python script will be used to store these properties, sort the substances according to the para-yield, and print the final ordered list to identify the correct option.\n\n**Step 1 & 2: Analysis of Substituents**\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Low Para Yield)**:\n    *   4) C6H5-NO2: The -NO2 group is a very strong deactivator and meta-director. It will have the lowest para yield (typically <1%).\n    *   6) C6H5-COOH: The -COOH group is a strong deactivator and meta-director. Para yield is very low, but slightly more than for -NO2.\n    *   2) C6H5-COOC2H5: The -COOC2H5 group is also a deactivator and meta-director, generally considered slightly less deactivating than -COOH. It will have a low para yield, but the highest among the meta-directors in this list.\n    *   Order of increasing para yield: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n*   **Ortho,Para-Directors (High Para Yield)**:\n    *   1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene): The -CH3 group is activating and o,p-directing. It produces a substantial amount of both ortho and para isomers. The para isomer is favored, with a typical yield of about 66%.\n    *   5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene): The -C2H5 group is also activating and o,p-directing. It is bulkier than -CH3, which increases steric hindrance at the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para product compared to toluene.\n    *   3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene): The -Cl atom is deactivating but o,p-directing. Due to the combination of chlorine's strong inductive effect (which deactivates the ortho position more than the para) and sterics, the para isomer is highly favored, with a yield of around 87%.\n    *   Order of increasing para yield: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**Step 3: Final Combined Order**\n\nCombining the two groups, we get the complete order of increasing para-isomer yield:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D. Now, we'll confirm this with a Python script.\n\n```python\ndef solve_isomer_yield_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the chemistry problem by sorting substances based on the\n    expected yield of their para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Data for each substance based on chemical principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n    # 'id' is the number from the problem statement.\n    # 'para_yield_estimate' is a representative percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n    substances = [\n        {'id': 1, 'name': 'C6H5-CH3', 'para_yield_estimate': 66},  # o,p director, baseline for alkyls\n        {'id': 2, 'name': 'C6H5-COOC2H5', 'para_yield_estimate': 3},  # m-director\n        {'id': 3, 'name': 'C6H5-Cl', 'para_yield_estimate': 87},   # o,p director, high para-selectivity\n        {'id': 4, 'name': 'C6H5-NO2', 'para_yield_estimate': 0.3}, # m-director, very strong deactivator\n        {'id': 5, 'name': 'C6H5-C2H5', 'para_yield_estimate': 75},  # o,p director, bulkier than CH3, more para\n        {'id': 6, 'name': 'C6H5-COOH', 'para_yield_estimate': 1},   # m-director, strong deactivator\n    ]\n\n    # Sort the list of substances in increasing order of their para-isomer yield.\n    # The lambda function specifies that the sorting key is the 'para_yield_estimate' value.\n    sorted_substances = sorted(substances, key=lambda x: x['para_yield_estimate'])\n\n    # Extract the IDs from the sorted list to get the final order.\n    sorted_ids = [s['id'] for s in sorted_substances]\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final result.\n    print(\"The substances are arranged in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.\")\n    print(\"The reasoning is as follows:\")\n    print(\"1.

The goal is to arrange these compounds in order of the increasing weight fraction (percentage) of the para-isomer formed as the product.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\nSubstituents on a benzene ring determine the position of the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br+). We classify them as either *ortho, para-directing* or *meta-directing*.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups donate electron density to the ring (activating groups) or are halogens. They direct the incoming electrophile to the positions ortho and para to themselves. These will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring (deactivating groups). They direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. For these compounds, the para-isomer is formed in very small, often trace, amounts.\n\nLet's classify the substituent for each substance:\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The -CH3 (methyl) group is an alkyl group. It is an **activating, ortho, para-director**.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** The -COOC2H5 (ester) group is a carbonyl-containing group. It is a **deactivating, meta-director**.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The -Cl (chloro) group is a halogen. It is **deactivating but ortho, para-directing**.\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** The -NO2 (nitro) group is a very strong electron-withdrawing group. It is a **strongly deactivating, meta-director**.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The -C2H5 (ethyl) group is an alkyl group. It is an **activating, ortho, para-director**.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The -COOH (carboxyl) group is a carbonyl-containing group. It is a **deactivating, meta-director**.\n\n**Step 3: Separate into Two Groups**\nBased on the classification, we can separate the compounds into two groups: those that will produce very little para-isomer and those that will produce a lot.\n\n*   **Low Para Yield (meta-directors):** 2 (Ethyl benzoate), 4 (Nitrobenzene), 6 (Benzoic acid).\n*   **High Para Yield (ortho, para-directors):** 1 (Toluene), 3 (Chlorobenzene), 5 (Ethylbenzene).\n\nThis means the final sequence will have compounds 2, 4, and 6 at the beginning (lowest yield) and compounds 1, 3, and 5 at the end (highest yield).\n\n**Step 4: Order the Compounds with Low Para Yield (2, 4, 6)**\nFor meta-directors, the amount of the minor para-product formed is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group makes the ortho and para positions even more electron-poor, thus favoring the meta position more strongly and producing even less para-isomer.\nThe deactivating strength of these groups follows the order:\n-NO2 (strongest) > -COOH > -COOC2H5 (weakest of the three)\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order:\nYield for -NO2 < Yield for -COOH < Yield for -COOC2H5\nThis corresponds to the substance order: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**Step 5: Order the Compounds with High Para Yield (1, 3, 5)**\nFor ortho, para-directors, the yield of the para-isomer depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This ratio is influenced by electronic and steric factors.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The primary difference is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size makes it harder for the incoming bromine to attack the adjacent ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of substitution at the less crowded para position. Thus, the para yield for ethylbenzene is higher than for toluene.\n    *   Order: **1 < 5** (Typical para yields: Toluene ~62%, Ethylbenzene ~66%)\n\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chlorine atom is a halogen. While it directs ortho/para due to its lone pairs (resonance effect), it strongly withdraws electrons inductively (-I effect). This inductive effect is strongest at the nearby ortho positions, making them significantly more deactivated than the distant para position. This strong electronic preference for the para position results in a very high yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   Typical para yield for Chlorobenzene is ~89%.\n\n*   Combining these observations, the order of increasing para yield for this group is: Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\n    *   Substance order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**Step 6: Combine the Orders to Get the Final Answer**\nNow, we combine the two ordered subgroups. The compounds with low para yield come before the compounds with high para yield.\n\n(Order for low-yield group) < (Order for high-yield group)\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer during bromination, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of the substituent on each benzene ring.\n\nThe six substances are:\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** -CH3 is a weakly activating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** -COOC2H5 is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl is a deactivating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** -NO2 is a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** -C2H5 is a weakly activating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** -COOH is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n\n### Step 1: Separate into Ortho-, Para- and Meta-directing Groups\n\nFirst, we can separate the compounds into two categories: those that will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer (ortho-, para-directors) and those that will produce very little (meta-directors).\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These will have the lowest para-isomer yields. They primarily direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. This group includes Nitrobenzene (4), Ethyl benzoate (2), and Benzoic acid (6).\n*   **Ortho-, Para-directors:** These will have the highest para-isomer yields. This group includes Toluene (1), Ethylbenzene (5), and Chlorobenzene (3).\n\n### Step 2: Order the Meta-directors by Para-isomer Yield\n\nFor meta-directing groups, the para-isomer is a very minor product. The yield of the para-isomer generally decreases as the deactivating strength of the substituent increases.\n\n*   **(4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** The -NO2 group is one of the strongest deactivating groups. During nitration (a similar electrophilic substitution), it yields only a trace (0-5%) of the para-isomer. Bromination requires harsh conditions, and it produces the meta-isomer as the chief product. This compound will have the lowest para-yield.\n*   **(2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate) & (6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** Both the ester and carboxylic acid groups are deactivating and meta-directing. For the nitration of ethyl benzoate, the para-isomer yield is about 5%. Data for the bromination of benzoic acid indicates it forms the m-bromobenzoic acid, implying a very low para-yield. In terms of deactivating strength, -COOH is generally considered stronger than -COOR. Therefore, we can expect the para-yield for benzoic acid to be lower than for ethyl benzoate.\n\nThe order of increasing para-yield for the meta-directors is: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n\n### Step 3: Order the Ortho-, Para-directors by Para-isomer Yield\n\nFor ortho-, para-directing groups, both positions are favored, but the ratio between them is affected by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will hinder the approach of the electrophile (bromine) to the adjacent ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **(1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The -CH3 group is relatively small. In bromination, toluene typically yields about 36.8% of the para-isomer.\n*   **(5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The -C2H5 group is bulkier than -CH3. This increased steric hindrance disfavors ortho-substitution, making the para-isomer more predominant compared to toluene. For bromination in trifluoroacetic acid, ethylbenzene gives 83.2% para-isomer.\n*   **(3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The -Cl group, while deactivating overall, is ortho-, para-directing. Halogens are known to produce a very high yield of the para-isomer due to a combination of electronic and steric factors. For example, the nitration of chlorobenzene gives 70% para-product. Bromination of chlorobenzene also shows high para-selectivity, often over 95%.\n\nComparing the ortho-, para-directors:\n*   Para yield (Ethylbenzene) > Para yield (Toluene) due to sterics.\n*   Para yield (Chlorobenzene) is typically very high, exceeding that of simple alkylbenzenes.\n\nThe order of increasing para-yield for the ortho-, para-directors is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Orders\n\nCombining the two groups, we get the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n\n**4 (Nitrobenzene) < 6 (Benzoic acid) < 2 (Ethyl benzoate) < 1 (Toluene) < 5 (Ethylbenzene) < 3 (Chlorobenzene)**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer during electrophilic bromination, we need to consider the directing effects and steric hindrance of the substituents on the benzene ring.\n\n1.  **С₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is an activating, ortho,para-directing group. Due to its relatively small size, it allows for significant substitution at both ortho and para positions. For bromination, this results in a notable amount of the ortho-isomer, thus the para-isomer does not completely dominate. Typical uncatalyzed bromination yields about 67% para-isomer.\n2.  **C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate):** The ethyl carboxylate group (-COOC₂H₅) is a deactivating, meta-directing group. Such groups strongly disfavor substitution at the ortho and para positions. The yield of the para-isomer is very low. For the similar nitration reaction, the para yield is only about 5%.\n3.  **C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group (-Cl) is deactivating but ortho,para-directing. Due to the combination of its inductive withdrawal and resonance donation, it directs incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. Steric hindrance from the chloro group is not excessively large, but the para position is generally favored. For nitration, chlorobenzene gives 70% of the para isomer.\n4.  **C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group (-NO₂) is a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group. It significantly reduces the electron density at the ortho and para positions, making meta-substitution overwhelmingly favorable. Consequently, the yield of the para-isomer is extremely low. Bromination of nitrobenzene primarily yields the meta-isomer.\n5.  **C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is an activating, ortho,para-directing group. It is bulkier than a methyl group. This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions leads to a higher proportion of substitution at the less hindered para position compared to toluene. Therefore, ethylbenzene is expected to give a higher yield of the para-isomer than toluene.\n6.  **C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The carboxyl group (-COOH) is a deactivating, meta-directing group. It makes the formation of the para-isomer unfavorable, similar to the nitro and ethyl carboxylate groups. Its deactivating strength is generally considered to be between that of the nitro and ester groups.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can establish the order:\n\n*   **Lowest para-yield:** The m-directing groups will have the lowest yields of the para-isomer. Among -NO₂, -COOC₂H₅, and -COOH, the nitro group is one of the strongest deactivators, leading to the least amount of para product. The carboxyl and ester groups are also strongly deactivating. Let's assume the order of para-isomer yield among meta-directors is -NO₂ < -COOC₂H₅ < -COOH. This gives us the sequence: 4 < 2 < 6.\n*   **Highest para-yield:** The o,p-directing groups will produce the highest yields of the para-isomer. These are -CH₃, -C₂H₅, and -Cl. The proportion of the para-isomer is influenced by steric hindrance. The bulkier the group, the more the para isomer is favored. The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group, so ethylbenzene (5) will give a higher para yield than toluene (1). The chloro group (-Cl) also strongly favors the para position, often more so than small alkyl groups. Typical yields for chlorination of chlorobenzene show a high preference for para-substitution (e.g., 90% para for bromination with certain catalysts). Comparing the three, the steric hindrance and electronic effects lead to an order of increasing para-yield as: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n*   **Combining the groups:** The ortho,para-directors will have a significantly higher yield of para-isomer than the meta-directors.\n\nTherefore, the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\nNitrobenzene (4) < Ethyl benzoate (2) < Benzoic acid (6) < Chlorobenzene (3) < Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5).\n\nRevisiting the ortho,para-directors: Standard bromination of toluene yields about 62% para-product. Chlorobenzene gives a higher percentage (around 90%), and due to greater steric hindrance, ethylbenzene also yields a very high percentage of para-isomer (around 94%). Therefore, the order should be Toluene < Chlorobenzene < Ethylbenzene.\n\nLet's refine the final sequence:\n**4 (-NO₂) < 2 (-COOC₂H₅) < 6 (-COOH) < 1 (-CH₃) < 3 (-Cl) < 5 (-C₂H₅)**.\n\nHowever, another analysis considering the balance between electronic and steric effects for ortho,para directors might place chlorobenzene's para yield above ethylbenzene's. Also, the exact order among the meta-directors can be subtle.\n\nLet's re-examine the options provided against our derived principles.\n\nA) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nB) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nC) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nD) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nLet's re-evaluate the order of o,p directors based on known data for similar reactions like nitration, where the para percentages are: Toluene (37%), Chlorobenzene (70%), tert-Butylbenzene (75%, for steric reference). This suggests Toluene (1) < Chlorobenzene (3). Comparing -C₂H₅ and -Cl, the ethyl group's steric hindrance is significant, pushing the para percentage very high, likely exceeding that of toluene. Some data suggests p-selectivity for ethylbenzene bromination is very high, potentially making the order 1 (-CH₃) < 3 (-Cl) < 5 (-C₂H₅) plausible.\n\nLet's check our derived order: 4 < 2 < 6 < 1 < 3 < 5. This does not match any of the options perfectly.\n\nLet's re-examine option D: **4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**\nThis ordering suggests:\n- Lowest para yield: Nitrobenzene (4), then Ethyl Benzoate (2), then Benzoic Acid (6). This is a plausible ranking for meta-directors.\n- Highest para yield: Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5) have higher para yields than Chlorobenzene (3). This contradicts the principle that greater steric hindrance (-C₂H₅ > -CH₃) leads to more para isomer. It also seems to contradict that halogens often give high para yields.\n\nHowever, let's carefully reconsider the literature. Conventional bromination of toluene (FeBr₃ catalyst) gives about 33% para-bromotoluene and 66% ortho. Chlorination of chlorobenzene gives 64% para product. Nitration of toluene gives 37% para, while nitration of chlorobenzene gives 70% para. Nitration of ethyl benzoate gives 5% para. Bromination of nitrobenzene gives almost exclusively meta. For ethylbenzene, the ethyl group is an o,p-director, and steric hindrance makes the para isomer the major product.\n\nGiven these values (even from mixed reaction types):\n- Nitrobenzene (4): ~0% para\n- Ethyl benzoate (2): ~5% para\n- Toluene (1): ~33-37% para\n- Chlorobenzene (3): ~64-70% para\n- Ethylbenzene (5): The para isomer is the major product, likely >60-70% due to sterics.\n- Benzoic acid (6): meta-director, low para yield, probably slightly more than nitrobenzene.\n\nLet's re-rank based on these approximate percentages:\n4 (-NO₂) < 2 (-COOC₂H₅) ≈ 6 (-COOH) < 1 (-CH₃) < 3 (-Cl) < 5 (-C₂H₅)\n\nLet's reconsider option D: **4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**\nThis implies an order of para yield: NO₂ < COOC₂H₅ < COOH < Cl < CH₃ < C₂H₅.\nThis ranking places the para yield for Toluene (1) higher than for Chlorobenzene (3). This contradicts several sources.\n\nThere seems to be a discrepancy between standard textbook values and the provided options. Let's assume there is a specific condition or interpretation intended by the question. Let's focus on the relative strengths.\n- Meta directors (-NO₂, -COOH, -COOC₂H₅) will be the lowest. Order of deactivation strength is generally -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOR. A stronger deactivator would suppress para substitution more. So, 4 < 6 < 2 seems plausible.\n- Ortho, para directors (-Cl, -CH₃, -C₂H₅) will be highest. For alkyl groups, steric hindrance increases with size, increasing the para/ortho ratio. So, 1 < 5. -Cl is deactivating by induction but o,p-directing by resonance. Its para/ortho ratio is typically high.\n\nLet's assume the order D is correct and try to rationalize it.\n**4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5** means the para yield increases in the order:\nNitrobenzene < Ethyl Benzoate < Benzoic Acid < Chlorobenzene < Toluene < Ethylbenzene.\n\nThis order is consistent with:\n1.  Meta-directors having the lowest para yields.\n2.  Among meta-directors: NO₂ < COOC₂H₅ < COOH. This order of increasing para yield (or decreasing meta-directing strength for the para position) is reasonable.\n3.  Ortho,para-directors having the highest yields.\n4.  Among ortho,para-directors: Cl < CH₃ < C₂H₅. The Cl being the lowest among o,p directors is plausible since it's a deactivator overall. The order CH₃ < C₂H₅ is correct based on sterics.\n\nThis rationalization seems consistent.\n\nFinal Check:\n- Lowest three: 4, 2, 6 are all meta-directors. Correct.\n- Highest three: 3, 1, 5 are all ortho,para-directors. Correct.\n- Order within meta-directors: 4 < 2 < 6. Plausible, all are very low.\n- Order within o,p-directors: 3 < 1 < 5. This implies Toluene gives more para than Chlorobenzene. This contradicts some data, but might be true under specific conditions. However, the order of alkylbenzenes 1 < 5 is solid. The question is whether 3 is less than 1. Given the conflicting data points in the search results (some showing high para for toluene, some low), this is the most uncertain part. But if we must choose from the options, option D presents the most internally consistent logic based on general principles, despite the ambiguity around Toluene vs. Chlorobenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nTo determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we need to analyze the directing effects of each substituent on the benzene ring. Substituents can be classified as activating or deactivating, and as ortho/para-directing or meta-directing.\n\n### **Analysis of Substituents**\n\nFirst, let's categorize each substituent:\n1.  **-CH3 (in Toluene):** An alkyl group, which is activating and an ortho, para-director.\n2.  **-COOC2H5 (in Ethyl benzoate):** A deactivating group and a meta-director.\n3.  **-Cl (in Chlorobenzene):** A halogen, which is deactivating but an ortho, para-director.\n4.  **-NO2 (in Nitrobenzene):** A strongly deactivating group and a meta-director.\n5.  **-C2H5 (in Ethylbenzene):** An alkyl group, which is activating and an ortho, para-director.\n6.  **-COOH (in Benzoic acid):** A deactivating group and a meta-director.\n\n### **Ordering Based on Director Type**\n\nThe yield of the para-isomer is significant only for ortho, para-directing substituents. For meta-directing substituents, the para-isomer is formed in very small, often negligible amounts.\n\n*   **Lowest Para Yield (Meta-Directors):**\n    *   Substances 4 (C6H5-NO2), 2 (C6H5-COOC2H5), and 6 (C6H5-COOH) are all meta-directors. The electrophilic attack is strongly directed to the meta position, meaning the para-isomer yield is extremely low. For the nitration of a benzoic ester, which is chemically similar to ethyl benzoate, the para isomer yield is about 5%, while the meta isomer is 73%. Bromination of nitrobenzene primarily yields the meta-bromo isomer. For these strongly deactivating, meta-directing groups, the para yield is minimal. The order among them is based on the strength of their deactivating and meta-directing nature. The generally accepted order of deactivating strength is -NO2 > -COOH > -COOR. A stronger deactivating group leads to an even smaller percentage of the para product. Thus, the order of increasing para yield is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n*   **Highest Para Yield (Ortho, Para-Directors):**\n    *   Substances 1 (C6H5-CH3), 5 (C6H5-C2H5), and 3 (C6H5-Cl) are all ortho, para-directors. They will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer.\n    *   The ratio of para to ortho product is heavily influenced by **steric hindrance**. A bulkier substituent will sterically hinder the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para product.\n    *   Comparing the ortho, para-directors:\n        *   **Toluene (-CH3):** The methyl group is relatively small. The bromination of toluene yields about 66.8% para-isomer. Other sources suggest a para-yield of around 56%.\n        *   **Ethylbenzene (-C2H5):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance disfavors ortho substitution, resulting in a higher yield of the para-isomer. For example, in nitration, moving from toluene to tert-butylbenzene (a very bulky group) increases the para-isomer yield from 37% to 75%. The bromination of ethylbenzene is expected to give a very high para yield.\n        *   **Chlorobenzene (-Cl):** Halogens are an exception; they are deactivating but ortho, para-directing. Despite being deactivating, the para-isomer is strongly favored. Nitration of chlorobenzene, for instance, gives about 70% para-product.\n\n*   **Refined Order of Ortho, Para-Directors:**\n    *   To establish the precise order, we compare the para-yields.\n    *   **Toluene (1):** Para yield is significant but the lowest among the three due to the relatively small size of the methyl group. (~56-67%)\n    *   **Ethylbenzene (5):** The larger ethyl group leads to more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, thus a higher para yield than toluene.\n    *   **Chlorobenzene (3):** The bromination of chlorobenzene yields ortho and para isomers in a ratio of about 0.1 to 1, which means the para isomer can be up to ~90% of the o/p mixture. Comparing this with the ~56-67% for toluene, chlorobenzene gives a higher para yield. When comparing ethylbenzene and chlorobenzene, ethylbenzene's larger size typically leads to an even greater preference for the para position than chlorine. However, the options provided place -Cl after the alkyl groups. Let's re-examine this. For nitration, ethylbenzene yields 49% para. In another source for nitration, chlorobenzene gives 70% para and toluene gives 37% para. The data can vary with reaction conditions, but the general trend related to sterics holds: a larger group increases the para ratio. The steric order is C2H5 > CH3. The electronic and steric balance for Cl results in a high para yield, often intermediate between small and large alkyl groups.\n    *   Let's follow the most cited trend: Steric hindrance increases the para/ortho ratio. The steric bulk is C2H5 > CH3. Chlorine's size is comparable to a methyl group but its electronic effects also strongly favor the para position. Looking at the options, a common pattern tested in chemistry is the steric effect on alkylbenzenes.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para yield for the o,p-directors is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3). *Correction based on typical data*: Chlorobenzene (~70-90% para) and Ethylbenzene (~49% para for nitration, expected to be higher but perhaps not as high as for Cl for bromination) have yields that need careful comparison. However, all options end with `1<5<3` or `1<5`. Option A ends in `...<3<1<5`, B `...<1<6<2<4`, C `...<5<1<3`, and D `...<1<5<3`. Options D seems most plausible for the ortho-para directors based on common textbook examples where steric hindrance is the dominant factor shown for alkyl groups, and halogens give very high para yields.\n\n### **Final Assembly**\n\nCombining the two groups, we get the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n\n1.  **Meta-Directors (lowest yield):** Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic Acid (6) < Ethyl Benzoate (2).\n2.  **Ortho, Para-Directors (highest yield):** Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\nThe complete sequence is **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nB) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nC) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nD) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nThe derived sequence matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Reaction and Substituent Effects\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a substituted benzene ring. The substituent already on the ring determines the position (regioselectivity) of the incoming bromine atom.\n\nSubstituents are classified into two main types:\n1.  **Activating Groups (Ortho, Para-directing):** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive than benzene. They direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. Examples here are -CH3 (methyl) and -C2H5 (ethyl).\n2.  **Deactivating Groups:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive than benzene.\n    *   **Meta-directing Deactivators:** Most deactivating groups direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position. This is because the ortho and para positions are more strongly deactivated than the meta position. Examples here are -NO2 (nitro), -COOH (carboxyl), and -COOC2H5 (ethyl carboxylate). The yield of the para-isomer for these substances will be very low.\n    *   **Ortho, Para-directing Deactivators:** Halogens are the main exception. They are deactivating due to their strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect but are ortho, para-directing due to electron donation via resonance. The example here is -Cl (chloro).\n\n### Step 2: Separate Meta-directors from Ortho, Para-directors\n\nBased on the expected major products, we can split the substances into two groups:\n\n*   **Group 1 (Low para-yield):** Meta-directors.\n    *   2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n*   **Group 2 (High para-yield):** Ortho, para-directors.\n    *   1) С6H5-CH3 (Toluene)\n    *   3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n    *   5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n\nThe final order will have all substances from Group 1 followed by all substances from Group 2.\n\n### Step 3: Order the Substances within Group 1 (Meta-directors)\n\nFor meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is very small but not necessarily zero. The order depends on the strength of the deactivating/meta-directing effect. A stronger deactivating group leads to a higher proportion of the meta-isomer and consequently, a lower proportion of the ortho and para isomers.\n\nWe need to rank the deactivating strength of -NO2, -COOH, and -COOC2H5.\n*   The **-NO2** group is one of the strongest deactivating groups. It will give the highest percentage of meta product and the lowest percentage of para product.\n*   The **-COOH** and **-COOC2H5** groups are also strongly deactivating, but less so than -NO2. Between them, the -COOH group is generally considered slightly more deactivating than the -COOC2H5 group. Therefore, the ester will allow for a slightly higher proportion of non-meta products compared to the carboxylic acid.\n\nSo, the order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\nThis means the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse: C6H5-NO2 < C6H5-COOH < C6H5-COOC2H5.\nIn terms of substance numbers, the order is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### Step 4: Order the Substances within Group 2 (Ortho, Para-directors)\n\nFor ortho, para-directing groups, we need to compare the ratio of para to ortho product. A higher para/ortho ratio results in a higher overall percentage yield of the para-isomer. This ratio is primarily influenced by two factors: steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n1.  **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):**\n    *   Both -CH3 and -C2H5 are activating alkyl groups.\n    *   The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   This increased bulk hinders the attack of the electrophile (bromine) at the adjacent ortho positions more significantly.\n    *   Therefore, ethylbenzene will produce a higher proportion of the para-isomer compared to toluene.\n    *   Order: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5).\n\n2.  **Comparing Ethylbenzene (5) and Chlorobenzene (3):**\n    *   The -Cl group is deactivating but ortho, para-directing. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect) deactivates the ortho positions (which are closer) more strongly than the para position.\n    *   This electronic effect strongly favors substitution at the para position, leading to a very high para/ortho ratio for halobenzenes.\n    *   This effect is typically stronger than the steric effect of alkyl groups. Experimental data confirms that bromination of chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer (around 88-89%). This percentage is generally higher than for toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene (which is expected to be higher than toluene, e.g., ~75-80%, though some data sources vary).\n    *   Therefore, chlorobenzene is expected to give the highest yield of para-isomer among these three.\n    *   Order: Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\nCombining the order for Group 2: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### Step 5: Combine the Orders of Both Groups\n\nNow, we combine the sorted groups to get the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield.\n\nGroup 1 order: **4 < 6 < 2**\nGroup 2 order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nCombined full order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is the reasoning process to determine the order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction and Substituent Effects**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a substituted benzene ring. The substituent already on the ring (C6H5-X) directs the incoming bromine atom to certain positions (ortho, meta, or para). This is known as the directing effect of the substituent.\n\nWe need to classify the substituents based on their effect on the benzene ring:\n\n*   **Activating, Ortho-, Para-directing groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive. They direct new substituents to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) -CH3 (Toluene)\n    *   5) -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-directing groups:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive. They direct new substituents to the meta position.\n    *   4) -NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n*   **Deactivating, Ortho-, Para-directing groups:** Halogens are an exception. They withdraw electron density (deactivating) but direct to ortho and para positions due to resonance.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\n**2. Separate into Low and High Para-Yield Groups**\n\nThe question asks for the order of increasing yield of the *para-isomer*.\n\n*   **Low Para-Yield:** The meta-directing groups (4, 6, 2) will produce very little para-isomer, as their primary product is the meta-isomer.\n*   **High Para-Yield:** The ortho-, para-directing groups (1, 5, 3) will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer.\n\nTherefore, the final ordered list will have the meta-directing compounds first, followed by the ortho-, para-directing compounds.\n\n**(Low Yield Group: 4, 6, 2) < (High Yield Group: 1, 5, 3)**\n\n**3. Order the Meta-Directing Groups (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor these groups, the para-isomer is a very minor product. The yield of the para-isomer will be inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A more strongly deactivating group will result in a lower yield of the (already unfavored) para product.\n\n*   **-NO2 (4):** This is one of the strongest electron-withdrawing and deactivating groups. It will give the lowest yield of the para-isomer. (Typical para yield is <1%).\n*   **-COOH (6) and -COOC2H5 (2):** Both are strongly deactivating due to the carbonyl group. Comparing them, the -COOH group is generally considered slightly more deactivating than the -COOR group. Furthermore, experimental data for bromination shows that benzoic acid gives a slightly lower para yield (~2%) compared to ethyl benzoate (~5%).\n\nSo, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\nOrder: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**4. Order the Ortho-, Para-Directing Groups (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these groups, both ortho and para products are formed. The ratio of para to ortho product (p/o ratio) depends on two factors:\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** A larger substituent will block the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para product.\n*   **Electronic Effects:** The inductive effect of a substituent is distance-dependent and affects the ortho position more strongly than the para position.\n\nLet's compare them:\n*   **-CH3 (1) vs. -C2H5 (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is larger than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased steric bulk hinders attack at the ortho position more effectively, resulting in a higher yield of the para-isomer for ethylbenzene compared to toluene.\n    *   Yield(para-C6H4Br-C2H5) > Yield(para-C6H4Br-CH3)\n    *   Order: **1 < 5**\n*   **-Cl (3):** Chlorine is deactivating overall due to its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I), but it is ortho-, para-directing because of its electron-donating resonance effect (+R). The strong -I effect deactivates the nearby ortho position more than the distant para position. This electronic factor leads to a very high preference for para substitution. Experimental data shows that the p/o ratio for chlorobenzene is significantly higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n    *   Yield(para-C6H4Br-Cl) > Yield(para-C6H4Br-C2H5)\n    *   Order: **5 < 3**\n\nCombining the ortho-, para-directors, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\nOrder: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**5. Combine the Groups to Get the Final Order**\n\nNow, we combine the ordered subgroups:\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete sequence in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence:\nNitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate < Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene\n\n**6. Match with the Given Options**\n\nLet's check the options provided:\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nOur derived order, **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**, matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nThis problem requires ranking substituted benzenes by the increasing yield of their *para*-brominated product after an electrophilic substitution reaction. The yield of the para-isomer is determined by the electronic and steric properties of the substituent already on the benzene ring.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Classify Substituents as Ortho, Para-Directors or Meta-Directors**\n\nFirst, we divide the substituents into two main groups based on where they direct the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br+).\n\n*   **Group 1: Meta-Directors (Low Para Yield)**\n    These are electron-withdrawing groups (deactivators) that direct the new substituent to the *meta* position. They will produce a very small amount of the *para*-isomer.\n    *   **4) C6H5-NO2:** The nitro group (-NO2) is a very strong deactivator and a strong *meta*-director.\n    *   **6) C6H5-COOH:** The carboxyl group (-COOH) is a deactivator and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5:** The ester group (-COOC2H5) is a deactivator and a *meta*-director.\n\n*   **Group 2: Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para Yield)**\n    These are groups that direct the new substituent to the *ortho* and *para* positions. They will produce a significant amount of the *para*-isomer.\n    *   **1) С6H5-CH3:** The methyl group (-CH3) is an activator and an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **5) C6H5-C2H5:** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is an activator and an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **3) C6H5-Cl:** The chloro group (-Cl) is a deactivator but is an *ortho, para*-director.\n\nThis initial sorting tells us that the final sequence will have all substances from Group 1 (4, 6, 2) before all substances from Group 2 (1, 5, 3).\n\n**Step 2: Rank the Substances Within Each Group**\n\n*   **Ranking the Meta-Directors (Group 1):**\n    The stronger the deactivating effect, the more strongly the group directs *meta*, and therefore the *less* *para*-isomer is formed. The order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n    Therefore, the order of increasing *para*-isomer yield is the reverse: C6H5-NO2 < C6H5-COOH < C6H5-COOC2H5.\n    This gives the order: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n*   **Ranking the Ortho, Para-Directors (Group 2):**\n    For this group, the yield of the *para*-product depends on the ratio of *para* to *ortho* isomers formed. This is primarily influenced by steric hindrance.\n    *   Comparing **1 (-CH3)** and **5 (-C2H5)**: The ethyl group is larger (bulkier) than the methyl group. This increased steric bulk makes it harder for the bromine to attack the nearby *ortho* positions, favoring attack at the more accessible *para* position. Thus, ethylbenzene produces a higher proportion of the *para*-isomer than toluene. Order: **1 < 5**.\n    *   Comparing with **3 (-Cl)**: Halogens are known to be highly *para*-directing, often yielding the *para*-isomer as the major product by a large margin (e.g., ~87% for chlorobenzene). This is a stronger *para*-directing effect than that of simple alkyl groups.\n    Therefore, the order of increasing *para*-isomer yield for this group is: Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\n    This gives the order: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the Ranked Groups**\n\nBy combining the two ranked lists, we get the final overall order from the lowest *para* yield to the highest *para* yield:\n\n(Group 1 order) < (Group 2 order)\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis order matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nThe correct answer is derived by analyzing the directing effects and steric properties of the substituents on the benzene ring.\n\n1.  **Categorize Substituents:**\n    *   **Meta-directors (strongly deactivating):** These groups direct the incoming bromine primarily to the meta position, resulting in a very low yield of the para-isomer. The substances in this category are:\n        *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n        *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n        *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a high yield of the para-isomer. The substances in this category are:\n        *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n        *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n        *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\n2.  **Rank the Meta-Directors:**\n    The yield of the para-isomer is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more effective at directing to the meta position, thus yielding less para product.\n    *   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para yield is: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n\n3.  **Rank the Ortho, Para-Directors:**\n    The yield of the para-isomer depends on the para/ortho ratio, which is heavily influenced by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent blocks the ortho positions more, favoring para substitution.\n    *   Comparing -CH₃ (in 1) and -C₂H₅ (in 5): The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance leads to a higher yield of the para-isomer for ethylbenzene than for toluene. So, the order is **1 < 5**.\n    *   Comparing with -Cl (in 3): The chloro substituent gives an exceptionally high para-to-ortho ratio due to a combination of steric and electronic factors. It produces the highest percentage of para-isomer in this group.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para yield is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\n4.  **Combine the Rankings:**\n    Combining the two groups, the meta-directors will always have lower para yields than the ortho, para-directors.\n    *   The complete order is: **(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**.\n\nThis matches the sequence derived by the code: `4<6<2<1<5<3`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nBased on the principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution and analysis of experimental data, the correct order can be determined.\n\n### Analysis of Substituents\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents on the benzene ring:\n\n*   **Substances with Meta-Directing Groups:** These are deactivating groups that direct the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br⁺) primarily to the meta position. The yield of the para-isomer is consequently very low.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene): -NO₂ is a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group.\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid): -COOH is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate): -COOC₂H₅ is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n\n*   **Substances with Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The yield of the para-isomer is significant.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene): -CH₃ is an activating, ortho, para-directing group.\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene): -C₂H₅ is an activating, ortho, para-directing group.\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene): -Cl is a deactivating, but ortho, para-directing group.\n\n### Ranking the Substances\n\n#### **Part 1: The Meta-Directors (Lowest Para-Yield)**\n\nSubstances 4, 6, and 2 will have the lowest yields of the para-isomer because they are meta-directors. For these groups, electrophilic attack at the ortho and para positions is highly disfavored. Data from nitration reactions (which follow similar principles to bromination) show the para isomer yields for these types of compounds are very small. For example, the nitration of nitrobenzene (4) yields only about 2% of the para-isomer. The nitration of ethyl benzoate (2) gives about 5% para-product. The nitration of benzoic acid (6) yields about 2% para-product. The order of deactivating strength is generally -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅, which correlates with very low para yields. Based on available data for similar reactions, we can establish their low position in the overall ranking. Looking at the options provided, they all correctly place combinations of 2, 4, and 6 at the beginning. The precise order among these three is nuanced, but data for nitration shows para-yields as: -NO₂ (7%/2%), -CO₂H (22%/2%), -CO₂Et (28%/5%). The numbers vary but consistently show very low para yield. Let's look at option D's order: 4 < 2 < 6. This corresponds to para yield: NO₂ < COOC₂H₅ < COOH.\n\n#### **Part 2: The Ortho, Para-Directors (Highest Para-Yield)**\n\nFor substances 1, 3, and 5, the yield of the para-isomer is primarily determined by steric hindrance. A larger substituent group will sterically block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of the para-product.\n\n*   **Substituent Sizes:** The steric bulk of the groups increases in the order: -Cl < -CH₃ < -C₂H₅.\n    *   The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is significantly bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   A methyl group is generally considered sterically larger than a single chlorine atom.\n\n*   **Predicted Para-Yield Order:** Based on steric hindrance, the fraction of para-isomer should increase as the substituent size increases. Therefore, we expect the order of increasing para-yield to be:\n    Chlorobenzene (3) < Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5).\n\nThis prediction is supported by experimental data for similar reactions. For instance, in nitration, the para product percentages are approximately: Chlorobenzene (~70%), Toluene (~37%), and t-butylbenzene (a bulky alkyl group) (~75%). Note that the reaction conditions can influence these ratios, but the general trend related to sterics holds. The increased bulk of an alkyl group strongly favors para-substitution.\n\n### Combining the Rankings\n\nCombining the two groups, the meta-directors will have the lowest para-yields, followed by the ortho, para-directors in order of increasing steric hindrance.\n\nThe full sequence should start with the meta-directors and end with the ortho, para-directors arranged by steric effect (3 < 1 < 5).\n\nLet's examine the given options:\n*   A) 4<6<2<**1<5<3** - The order for o,p-directors is incorrect.\n*   B) 6<2<4<**5<1<3** - The order for o,p-directors is incorrect.\n*   C) **3<5<1**... - Starts with an o,p-director, which is incorrect.\n*   D) 4<2<6<**3<1<5** - This option correctly places the meta-directors first and then correctly orders the ortho, para-directors based on increasing steric hindrance leading to a higher yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThus, the final order is determined by grouping the substances into meta- and ortho/para-directors and then arranging the latter based on the steric effect of the substituent.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer during electrophilic bromination, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n1.  **Substituent Classification and Directing Effects:**\n    *   **-CH₃ (Toluene, 1)** and **-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene, 5)** are alkyl groups. They are activating and ortho-, para-directing.\n    *   **-Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3)** is a halogen. It is deactivating but ortho-, para-directing.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene, 4)**, **-COOH (Benzoic acid, 6)**, and **-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate, 2)** are deactivating, meta-directing groups.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Meta-Directing Groups (Low Para Yield):**\n    These substituents direct the incoming electrophile (Br⁺) primarily to the meta position, resulting in very low yields of the para-isomer.\n    *   **Nitrobenzene (-NO₂):** The nitro group is one of the strongest deactivating groups. It makes the ortho and para positions highly electron-deficient, leading to a very high preference for meta-substitution. For bromination, the para-isomer yield is extremely low, often less than 1%.\n    *   **Benzoic acid (-COOH):** The carboxylic acid group is also a strong deactivator. Bromination yields predominantly the meta-isomer. The para yield is very low, around 1-2%.\n    *   **Ethyl benzoate (-COOC₂H₅):** The ester group is a deactivator, similar to the carboxylic acid group. Its deactivating strength is slightly less than -COOH. Data for nitration of ethyl benzoate shows a para yield of about 5%, which suggests the para yield for bromination would also be low but likely slightly higher than for benzoic acid.\n\n    Therefore, the order of increasing para yield for this subset is: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n\n3.  **Analysis of Ortho, Para-Directing Groups (High Para Yield):**\n    These substituents direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The ratio between the ortho and para isomers is influenced by steric effects and electronic factors.\n    *   **Ethylbenzene (-C₂H₅):** The ethyl group is an o,p-director. One might expect the bulkier ethyl group to sterically hinder the ortho position more than a methyl group, leading to a higher para yield. However, experimental data for bromination often shows the opposite. For example, one source indicates the product distribution is about 29.6% ortho and 70.4% para. Another source cites 24.6% ortho and 75.4% para.\n    *   **Toluene (-CH₃):** The methyl group is an o,p-director. Typical bromination product distributions are around 33% ortho and 67% para. While some conditions show slightly different ratios, the para yield is consistently high.\n    *   **Chlorobenzene (-Cl):** The chloro group is o,p-directing but deactivating. The inductive electron-withdrawing effect deactivates the ring, but resonance directs substitution to the o,p positions. For halogens, the para-isomer is highly favored over the ortho-isomer due to the combination of inductive and steric effects. Bromination of chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer, approximately 90%.\n\n    Comparing the three, the experimental data shows that the para-isomer yield generally follows this order: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3). It is worth noting that the exact ortho/para ratio for toluene and ethylbenzene can vary with reaction conditions, but the para-selectivity for chlorobenzene is consistently the highest among these three. Some sources might show ethylbenzene giving a slightly higher para yield than toluene, but chlorobenzene's para-selectivity is distinctly superior. Let's re-examine the order of toluene and ethylbenzene. A catalyst system with ZnBr₂ on K-10 clay gave 75.4% para-bromoethylbenzene versus 65.1% para-bromotoluene, suggesting ethylbenzene can give a higher para yield. The key factor is that the para position is generally less sterically hindered. Given the options, let's re-establish the most likely order. Alkyl groups (-CH₃, -C₂H₅) are less para-directing than halogens (-Cl). The larger size of the ethyl group compared to the methyl group increases steric hindrance at the ortho positions, favouring para substitution more. Therefore, the para yield should be higher for ethylbenzene than for toluene.\n\n    So, the revised order for this subset is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\n4.  **Final Arrangement:**\n    Combining the two groups gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n\n    **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\n    This corresponds to:\n    Nitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate < Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene\n\n    This order aligns with option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic substitution reaction with bromine, we need to analyze the directing effects of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\nFirst, let's classify the substituents on each molecule:\n\n*   **Substances 4, 6, and 2** have meta-directing groups:\n    *   4) **C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group (-NO₂) is a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group.\n    *   6) **C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The carboxyl group (-COOH) is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n    *   2) **C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate):** The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is also a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n    For these substances, the primary product will be the meta-isomer. The yield of the para-isomer will be very low. The order of para-isomer yield among these is determined by the group's deactivating strength; stronger deactivation leads to a more pronounced meta-direction and thus an even lower para yield. The deactivating strength follows the order: -NO₂ > -COOR > -COOH. However, for practical purposes in this context, all produce minimal para product. Data for the nitration of ethyl benzoate shows only about 5% para-product formation, and it's expected to be similarly low for bromination. For nitrobenzene, the para product is often negligible. Therefore, these three will have the lowest para-isomer yields. Based on deactivating strength, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is generally: nitrobenzene < ethyl benzoate < benzoic acid. So, 4 < 2 < 6.\n\n*   **Substances 3, 1, and 5** have ortho,para-directing groups:\n    *   3) **C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group (-Cl) is deactivating but directs incoming groups to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) **C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is an activating, ortho,para-directing group.\n    *   5) **C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is also an activating, ortho,para-directing group.\n\nFor these ortho,para-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is influenced by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will sterically hinder the ortho positions, making the para position more accessible to the incoming electrophile.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased steric hindrance in ethylbenzene leads to a higher proportion of the para-isomer compared to toluene. For bromination, ethylbenzene can yield over 80% para-isomer, while toluene yields significantly less (around 37-40% para-isomer). Therefore, the para-yield for ethylbenzene is greater than for toluene (1 < 5).\n\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** Halogens like chlorine also direct to the ortho and para positions. Due to a combination of electronic and steric effects, chlorobenzene typically gives a high yield of the para-isomer upon halogenation, often higher than toluene but lower than more sterically hindered groups. For nitration, chlorobenzene gives about 70% para-product. In bromination, this trend holds, placing it between toluene and ethylbenzene in terms of para yield.\n\n**Final Ordering:**\n\n1.  **Lowest para-yields (meta-directors):** The order among the meta-directors based on the general strength of deactivation and the resulting preference for meta-substitution is 4 (-NO₂) < 2 (-COOC₂H₅) < 6 (-COOH).\n2.  **Higher para-yields (ortho,para-directors):** The order among the o,p-directors is determined by steric effects favouring para substitution. The increasing bulkiness of the substituent (and other electronic factors for Cl) gives the order: 1 (-CH₃) < 3 (-Cl) < 5 (-C₂H₅).\n\nCombining these two groups gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n**4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**\n\nLooking at the options provided, none perfectly match this derived order. Let's re-evaluate the ortho-para directors. While the steric argument is strong, sometimes the order of -CH₃ and -Cl can be debated based on specific reaction conditions. However, the order of meta-directors is quite certain to be at the beginning of the sequence, and the order of the alkyl groups (-CH₃ < -C₂H₅) is also well-established.\n\nLet's re-examine the provided options against our established facts:\n*   Meta directors (4, 2, 6) must come first.\n*   Ortho-para directors (1, 5, 3) must come last.\n*   Among ortho-para directors, the yield should generally increase with steric hindrance: para yield for Toluene(1) < Ethylbenzene(5).\n\nLet's review the provided options:\n*   A) 6<2<4<5<1<3 -> Incorrectly places o,p directors before a meta-director.\n*   B) 3<5<1<6<2<4 -> Incorrectly places o,p directors before meta-directors.\n*   C) 4<6<2<1<5<3 -> Incorrect start (places 2 after 6), and incorrect end (places 3 last).\n*   D) 4<2<6<3<1<5 -> Incorrectly places 3 before 1. But let's check the data. For nitration, toluene gives ~37% para while chlorobenzene gives ~70% para. This suggests the para yield for chlorobenzene (3) is indeed higher than for toluene (1). The steric hindrance of -C2H5 is greater than -CH3, so para yield for ethylbenzene(5) > toluene(1). A bulky t-butyl group gives ~75% para product in nitration. Bromination of ethylbenzene gives ~83% para-isomer. Bromination of toluene gives ~37% para-isomer. Thus, the order among the o,p directors is **1 < 3 < 5**.\n\nLet's reconsider the meta-directors. While all yield very little para product, their relative deactivating effects are -NO₂ > -COOR > -COOH. Stronger deactivation correlates with a stronger preference for the meta position, and thus a lower yield of the para isomer. Therefore, the order of increasing para yield is **4 < 2 < 6**.\n\nCombining these findings, the correct sequence should be **4 < 2 < 6 < 1 < 3 < 5**.\n\nLet's carefully re-examine the provided options one last time with the established order of **4 < 2 < 6 < 1 < 3 < 5**. None of the options match this order. There might be an error in the question or the options provided. However, let's analyze the most plausible option. Option D starts with 4 < 2 < 6 which is correct for the meta-directors. The second part is 3 < 1 < 5. This implies para yield Cl < CH3 < C2H5. This contradicts the data found.\n\nLet's check another possibility. Perhaps the order of deactivators is different. -NO2 > -COOH > -COOR. This would give 4 < 6 < 2.\nThis would lead to the sequence **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**. This matches the beginning of option C. Let's look at the end of option C: 1 < 5 < 3. This means para yield of chlorobenzene is the highest, which is plausible as halogens are known to give high para-selectivity.\n\nLet's re-verify ortho-para ratios:\n-   Toluene (1, -CH₃): ~37% para (Bromination)\n-   Ethylbenzene (5, -C₂H₅): ~83% para (Bromination)\n-   Chlorobenzene (3, -Cl): ~70% para (Nitration data, bromination expected to be similar or higher, with some sources claiming near 100% para selectivity for bromination under certain conditions).\n\nBased on this data, the order of increasing para yield for o,p directors is definitively **1 < 3 < 5**.\n\nNow let's revisit the meta-directors. Their para yield is very low.\n- Nitrobenzene (4): 0-5%\n- Benzoic acid (6): Bromination mainly gives m-bromobenzoic acid.\n- Ethyl benzoate (2): Nitration gives 5% para. Bromination gives predominantly meta.\n\nThe deactivating strength is -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅. The stronger the deactivator, the more it disfavors o,p substitution, hence the lower the para yield.\nSo, the order of increasing para yield should be: 4 (-NO₂) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC₂H₅).\n\nThis leads to the full order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**.\n\nLet's reconsider the provided choices. There appears to be an inconsistency between established chemical principles/data and the options. However, let's select the \"best fit\" or reconsider if there's an alternative interpretation.\n\nOption D: 4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5\nThis has the meta-directors in the correct starting block. The relative order is 4<2<6. As discussed, 4<6<2 is more likely. The o,p directors are ordered 3<1<5, which contradicts the data.\n\nOption C: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3\nThis has the meta-directors ordered as 4<6<2, which is consistent with their deactivating strength. It has the o,p directors ordered as 1<5<3. This suggests the para yield from chlorobenzene is the highest, which is plausible under some conditions, and the yield from ethylbenzene is higher than toluene, which is correct. This seems the most chemically sound option despite potential nuances with chlorobenzene's yield vs ethylbenzene's.\n\nLet's commit to the order based on the most consistent rules:\n1. Meta-directors have the lowest para yield. Order of increasing yield is based on decreasing deactivation strength: -NO₂ < -COOH < -COOR. So: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n2. Ortho,para-directors have higher para yield. Order is based on steric hindrance and electronic factors: -CH₃ < -C₂H₅. -Cl also gives high para yield. Data suggests: -CH₃ < -Cl < -C₂H₅. So: **1 < 3 < 5**.\n\nThis gives a combined order of **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**. Since this is not an option, let's reconsider the ortho, para order. Could the para yield of chlorobenzene (3) be the highest? Let's assume so. Then 1 < 5 < 3. This would make the overall order **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**. This matches option C.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents based on their directing effect.**\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, the substituent already on the benzene ring directs the incoming electrophile to specific positions.\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the positions ortho and para to themselves. They will have a high yield of the para isomer.\n    *   1) `-CH₃` (Toluene)\n    *   5) `-C₂H₅` (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They will have a very low yield of the para isomer.\n    *   4) `-NO₂` (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   2) `-COOC₂H₅` (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n\nBased on this classification, the final order must have the meta-directors (substances 4, 2, 6) placed before the ortho, para-directors (substances 1, 5, 3).\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directors (lowest para yield).**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a minor byproduct. The yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: `-NO₂` > `-COOH` > `-COOC₂H₅`.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse: `-NO₂` < `-COOH` < `-COOC₂H₅`.\n*   This corresponds to the substance number order: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (highest para yield).**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The percentage yield of the para-isomer depends on the para/ortho product ratio. This is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** A bulkier substituent blocks the adjacent ortho positions, favoring substitution at the less hindered para position. The steric bulk of the alkyl groups is `-C₂H₅` > `-CH₃`. Therefore, the para-yield of ethylbenzene (5) is higher than that of toluene (1). This establishes the order: `1 < 5`.\n*   **Electronic and Steric Effects of Chlorine:** The `-Cl` group in chlorobenzene (3) is strongly electron-withdrawing by induction. This effect deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with sterics, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. Experimental data shows the para-isomer yield for the bromination of chlorobenzene is exceptionally high (approx. 87-90%), which is greater than that for both toluene (approx. 67%) and ethylbenzene (which has a yield higher than toluene but often cited as lower than that of chlorobenzene).\n*   Thus, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3). This corresponds to the order: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the groups for the final order.**\nThe meta-directors have the lowest para yields, and the ortho, para-directors have the highest. Combining the sorted subgroups gives the final sequence:\n(meta-directors) < (ortho, para-directors)\n**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe complete order is **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Match with the provided options.**\nThe derived sequence is: C₆H₅-NO₂ < C₆H₅-COOH < C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ < C₆H₅-CH₃ < C₆H₅-C₂H₅ < C₆H₅-Cl.\nThis corresponds to the numerical order **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nC) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nD) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nThe derived order matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"

Understand the Reaction and the Goal**\n\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a benzene ring with different substituents. We need to arrange the starting substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-monobromo derivative. Since the molar mass of all monobromo isomers (ortho, meta, para) is the same for a given starting material, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the molar percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\n\nSubstituents on a benzene ring can be classified based on their directing effect in electrophilic substitution:\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions. They generally have a high yield of the para-isomer.\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They will have a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n\nLet's classify the given substituents:\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:**\n    *   1) -CH3 (Toluene)\n    *   5) -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n*   **Meta-directors:**\n    *   4) -NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n**3. Initial Ordering**\n\nSince meta-directors produce very little para-product, and ortho, para-directors produce a significant amount, we can immediately say that the substances with meta-directing groups will come first in the list (lowest para yield), followed by the substances with ortho, para-directing groups.\n\nOrder: {4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}\n\n**4. Ordering the Meta-Directors (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is very small. The order depends on the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group makes the ring less reactive and more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the ortho and para isomers.\n\n*   **-NO2 (4):** This is one of the strongest deactivating groups. It will produce the lowest amount of para-product.\n*   **-COOH (6) and -COOC2H5 (2):** Both are strongly deactivating, but less so than -NO2. The -COOH group is generally considered slightly more deactivating than the -COOC2H5 group because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group (-C2H5) in the ester slightly reduces the electron-withdrawing power of the carbonyl group.\n\nTherefore, the order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\nThis means the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order: -NO2 < -COOH < -COOC2H5.\nSo, the order for this group is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**5. Ordering the Ortho, Para-Directors (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these groups, we need to compare the ratio of the para-product to the ortho-product. A higher para/ortho ratio means a higher overall percentage of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **-CH3 (1, Toluene):** This is a relatively small group. It gives a significant amount of both ortho and para products, with the para-isomer being favored (typically ~67% para).\n*   **-C2H5 (5, Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance makes attack at the ortho positions more difficult, thus increasing the proportion of the para-product compared to toluene. So, the para yield for ethylbenzene is greater than for toluene.\n*   **-Cl (3, Chlorobenzene):** The chlorine atom is an ortho, para-director, but it's deactivating. Its strong inductive effect (-I effect) is distance-dependent and deactivates the ortho positions more strongly than the para position. This electronic factor, combined with steric hindrance, strongly favors the para position. The para yield for the bromination of chlorobenzene is very high (typically ~87%). This yield is generally higher than that for ethylbenzene.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\nSo, the order for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**6. Final Combined Order**\n\nCombining the two groups, we get the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nFinal Order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo arrange the given substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction, we must analyze the directing effects of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### **Analysis of Substituents**\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents based on their electronic effects and directing properties:\n\n*   **Activating, Ortho/Para-Directing Groups:** These groups donate electron density to the benzene ring, increasing its reactivity towards electrophiles and directing substitution to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   **-CH3 (Toluene, 1):** Activating, ortho/para-directing.\n    *   **-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene, 5):** Activating, ortho/para-directing.\n\n*   **Deactivating, Ortho/Para-Directing Groups:** These groups withdraw electron density (deactivating the ring) but still direct incoming groups to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   **-Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3):** Deactivating, ortho/para-directing.\n\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups strongly withdraw electron density from the ring, making it much less reactive and directing substitution to the meta position. Consequently, they produce very low yields of the para-isomer.\n    *   **-NO2 (Nitrobenzene, 4):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   **-COOH (Benzoic acid, 6):** Deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   **-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate, 2):** Deactivating, meta-directing.\n\n### **Ordering the Substances**\n\nThe substances with meta-directing groups will have the lowest yields of the para-isomer, while those with ortho/para-directing groups will have the highest.\n\n#### **1. Meta-Directing Substances (Lowest Para Yield)**\n\nFor nitrobenzene (4), benzoic acid (6), and ethyl benzoate (2), the major product is the meta-isomer. The yield of the para-isomer is minimal. The order among these is determined by the strength of the deactivating effect.\n\n*   **Nitrobenzene (-NO2, 4):** The nitro group is one of the strongest deactivating groups. Bromination of nitrobenzene yields almost exclusively the meta-isomer, with only trace amounts of the para product (around 0-5%).\n*   **Benzoic acid (-COOH, 6):** The carboxylic acid group is also strongly deactivating. The para-isomer yield is very low, typically around 1-2%.\n*   **Ethyl benzoate (-COOC2H5, 2):** The ester group is a strong deactivator, similar to a carboxylic acid. Data for nitration (a similar electrophilic substitution) shows about 5% para-product, which is slightly higher than for the other meta-directors.\n\nBased on the deactivating strength and typical isomer distributions, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is:\n**Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**\n\n#### **2. Ortho/Para-Directing Substances (Highest Para Yield)**\n\nFor toluene (1), ethylbenzene (5), and chlorobenzene (3), the major products are the ortho and para isomers. The ratio between them is determined primarily by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will sterically hinder the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para product.\n\n*   **Toluene (-CH3, 1):** The methyl group is relatively small. Conventional bromination of toluene yields about 30-40% ortho-isomer and 60-70% para-isomer.\n*   **Ethylbenzene (-C2H5, 5):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions leads to a higher yield of the para-isomer compared to toluene. For example, in mercuration, the para-product percentage increases from 79.2% for toluene to 83.2% for ethylbenzene. A similar trend is expected for bromination.\n*   **Chlorobenzene (-Cl, 3):** The chloro group is an ortho/para-director. While deactivating, it gives a very high yield of the para-isomer upon bromination, around 89%.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\n**Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**\n\n### **Final Combined Order**\n\nCombining the two groups, we get the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence: Nitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate < Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo solve this problem, we need to arrange the given benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. The weight fraction of the para-isomer is directly proportional to its percentage yield.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Directing Effects:** First, we'll classify each substituent on the benzene ring as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*.\n    *   *Ortho, para-directors* yield a high percentage of the para-isomer.\n    *   *Meta-directors* yield a very low percentage of the para-isomer.\n\n2.  **Group the Substances:**\n    *   **Ortho, para-directors:** -CH3 (1), -C2H5 (5), -Cl (3).\n    *   **Meta-directors:** -NO2 (4), -COOC2H5 (2), -COOH (6).\n    This means the final sequence will have substances 4, 2, and 6 at the beginning (in some order) and 1, 5, and 3 at the end (in some order).\n\n3.  **Order the Meta-Directors:** For meta-directors, the para-isomer is a very minor product. The yield decreases as the deactivating (and meta-directing) strength of the group increases.\n    *   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n\n4.  **Order the Ortho, Para-Directors:** For these, the para-isomer is a major product. The yield depends on the para/ortho ratio, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n    *   **-CH3 (1, Toluene):** Gives a high para yield (~67%), but generally the lowest among these three due to its relatively small size allowing for more ortho attack.\n    *   **-C2H5 (5, Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group is bulkier than methyl, causing more steric hindrance at the ortho positions. This increases the para-isomer yield compared to toluene.\n    *   **-Cl (3, Chlorobenzene):** While halogens are deactivating, they are strongly para-directing. Literature data often shows that the para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (~89%) is very high, even slightly higher than for bulky alkyl groups like tert-butylbenzene (~88%). This suggests the order of increasing para yield is Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\n    *   Thus, the order is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\n5.  **Combine the Orders:** By combining the two groups, we get the final sequence.\n    *   (4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n    *   The complete order is: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3.\n\n6.  **Match with Options:** This sequence matches option C.

The substituent already on the benzene ring (C6H5-) directs the incoming bromine electrophile (Br+) to specific positions. The yield of the para-isomer depends on the nature of this substituent.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the substituents**\nWe need to classify the substituents into two main categories:\n1.  **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The products are a mixture of ortho and para isomers.\n    *   1) -CH3 (methyl group)\n    *   5) -C2H5 (ethyl group)\n    *   3) -Cl (chloro group)\n2.  **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. The para-isomer is formed in very small amounts.\n    *   4) -NO2 (nitro group)\n    *   6) -COOH (carboxyl group)\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (ester group)\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the para-isomer yield for meta-directors**\nSubstances with meta-directing groups (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest yields of the para-isomer. The amount of para-product formed is inversely related to how strongly the group deactivates the ring towards ortho/para attack.\n*   The deactivating strength of these groups follows the order: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n*   The -NO2 group is the strongest deactivator, so it will give the lowest yield of the para-isomer.\n*   The -COOC2H5 group is the weakest deactivator among the three, so it will give the highest yield of the para-isomer among this group.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for these substances is: 4 < 6 < 2.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the para-isomer yield for ortho, para-directors**\nSubstances with ortho, para-directing groups (1, 3, 5) will have much higher yields of the para-isomer. The distribution between the ortho and para positions depends on steric and electronic factors. A higher para/ortho ratio leads to a higher percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** The para position is sterically unhindered, while the ortho positions are adjacent to the substituent. A bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher yield of the para-isomer. The order of steric bulk is: -C2H5 > -CH3 > -Cl.\n*   **Electronic Effects:** For halogens like -Cl, a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) deactivates the ortho position more than the para position, which also favors para substitution.\n*   **Comparing the groups:**\n    *   **-CH3 (1):** The methyl group has moderate steric bulk. The para-isomer is favored over the ortho, but the ortho product is still significant. (Para yield is ~67%).\n    *   **-Cl (3):** The combination of steric hindrance and the strong deactivating inductive effect at the ortho position makes the para-isomer highly favored. (Para yield is ~87%).\n    *   **-C2H5 (5):** The ethyl group is significantly bulkier than the methyl group. This large steric hindrance makes the para-isomer extremely favored. (Para yield is ~94%).\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for these substances is: 1 < 3 < 5.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the results to get the final order**\nWe combine the two groups. The meta-directors have the lowest para yields, followed by the ortho, para-directors.\n*   Order of meta-directors: 4 < 6 < 2\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: 1 < 3 < 5\n*   Combining them gives the final order of increasing para-isomer yield: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**\n\n**Step 6: Compare with the given options**\nLet's check the provided options against our derived correct order (4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5).\n*   A) 3<5<1<6<2<4 - Incorrect.\n*   B) 4<6<2<1<5<3 - This option correctly orders the meta-directors (4 < 6 < 2) and correctly identifies toluene (1) as the least para-selective of the o,p-directors. However, it incorrectly swaps the order of ethylbenzene (5) and chlorobenzene (3). The correct order is 3 < 5, not 5 < 3.\n*   C) 4<2<6<3<1<5 - Incorrect.\n*   D) 6<2<4<5<1<3 - Incorrect.\n\nAmong the given choices, option B is the closest to the chemically correct order. It correctly orders the first four substances in the sequence (4 < 6 < 2 < 1). The only error is the relative order of the last two substances. In the context of a multiple-choice question with a likely error, this is the best possible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents**\n\nFirst, we need to classify the substituent on each benzene ring (C6H5-). Substituents determine the position (ortho, meta, or para) where the incoming electrophile (Br+) will attack and the rate of the reaction.\n\n*   **Activating, ortho/para-directing groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive than benzene. They direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) -CH3 (methyl): Activating\n    *   5) -C2H5 (ethyl): Activating\n*   **Deactivating, ortho/para-directing groups:** These groups withdraw electron density (deactivating the ring) but have lone pairs that can donate through resonance, directing the electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   3) -Cl (chloro): Deactivating\n*   **Deactivating, meta-directing groups:** These groups strongly withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive. They direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position.\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (ethyl carboxylate)\n    *   4) -NO2 (nitro)\n    *   6) -COOH (carboxylic acid)\n\n**Step 2: Separate into low-yield and high-yield groups**\n\nBased on the directing effects, we can separate the substances into two groups:\n*   **Low para-yield group (meta-directors):** For these substances, the para-isomer is a very minor product. The main product is the meta-isomer. This group includes substances 2, 4, and 6.\n*   **High para-yield group (ortho/para-directors):** For these substances, the para-isomer is a major product, along with the ortho-isomer. This group includes substances 1, 3, and 5.\n\nThe final ordered list will have all the meta-directors first, followed by the ortho/para-directors.\n\n**Step 3: Order the substances within the low-yield (meta-directing) group**\n\nThe substances are 4 (-NO2), 6 (-COOH), and 2 (-COOC2H5). For these meta-directors, the amount of para-product formed is inversely proportional to the strength of the deactivating/meta-directing effect. A stronger deactivating group will lead to a higher percentage of the meta-isomer and consequently a lower percentage of the para-isomer.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n(Nitro is one of the strongest deactivators, followed by carboxylic acid, and then the ester).\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing yield of the para-isomer is the reverse of the deactivating strength:\n**4 (-NO2) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC2H5)**\n\n**Step 4: Order the substances within the high-yield (ortho/para-directing) group**\n\nThe substances are 1 (-CH3), 5 (-C2H5), and 3 (-Cl). The yield of the para-isomer depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing 1 (-CH3) and 5 (-C2H5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The primary difference is their size. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This larger size creates more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, making the para position relatively more accessible for the incoming bromine. Therefore, ethylbenzene is expected to give a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   Order: **1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5)**\n\n*   **Comparing with 3 (-Cl):** The chloro group is deactivating but directs ortho/para. For halogens, electronic factors cause a strong preference for substitution at the para position compared to the ortho position. The deactivating inductive effect is felt more strongly at the ortho position than the para position. This leads to a very high para/ortho ratio. Experimental data shows that the bromination of chlorobenzene yields about 87% of the para-isomer, which is higher than the yield from toluene (about 67%). It is also expected to be higher than the yield from ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, chlorobenzene (3) will have the highest para-isomer yield in this group.\n\nCombining these findings, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\n**1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl)**\n\n**Step 5: Combine the two groups to get the final order**\n\nWe combine the ordered low-yield group and the ordered high-yield group. The para-yield for any ortho/para-director will be significantly greater than for any meta-director.\n\n*   Low-yield order: 4 < 6 < 2\n*   High-yield order: 1 < 5 < 3\n\nCombining them gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence:\nC6H5-NO2 < C6H5-COOH < C6H5-COOC2H5 < C6H5-CH3 < C6H5-C2H5 < C6H5-Cl\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nB) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nThe derived order matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### **Analysis of Substituents**\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents into two groups: ortho-, para-directing and meta-directing.\n\n*   **Ortho-, Para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the positions ortho and para to themselves.\n    *   1) **-CH3** (Toluene): Activating group.\n    *   5) **-C2H5** (Ethylbenzene): Activating group.\n    *   3) **-Cl** (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating group, but still ortho-, para-directing.\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. The yield of the para-isomer for these substances will be very low.\n    *   4) **-NO2** (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   2) **-COOC2H5** (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   6) **-COOH** (Benzoic acid)\n\n### **Ordering the Substances**\n\n**1. Meta-directing groups (Lowest para-yield):**\n\nSubstances with meta-directing groups will produce the smallest amount of the para-isomer.\n*   **Nitrobenzene (4):** The -NO2 group is a very strong deactivating, meta-director. Bromination of nitrobenzene requires harsh conditions and yields almost exclusively the meta-isomer (m-bromonitrobenzene). The para-isomer yield is negligible, often less than 1%.\n*   **Ethyl benzoate (2) and Benzoic acid (6):** The -COOC2H5 and -COOH groups are also deactivating and meta-directing. While still producing very low amounts of the para-isomer, they are generally less deactivating than the nitro group. For bromination of benzoic acid, the distribution is approximately 75-80% meta, 20-25% ortho, and only a very small fraction (1-2%) para. The ester group (-COOC2H5) behaves similarly to the carboxylic acid group.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-yield among the meta-directors is: **4 (-NO2) < 2 (-COOC2H5) ≈ 6 (-COOH)**. The options provided distinguish between 2 and 6, and typically the ester group is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid, but both result in very low para yields. Based on typical data, the order is generally considered **4 < 2 < 6**.\n\n**2. Ortho-, Para-directing groups (Highest para-yield):**\n\nFor these groups, the formation of the para-isomer is favored, and the yield is influenced by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para-product.\n\n*   **Chlorobenzene (3):** The -Cl group is ortho-, para-directing. For bromination, the para-isomer is the major product due to the steric bulk and electronic effect of the chlorine atom. The typical distribution for bromination gives a high yield of the para-isomer, often around 87-90%.\n*   **Toluene (1):** The -CH3 group is less sterically hindering than -Cl or -C2H5. During bromination, it yields a significant amount of both ortho and para products. The para-isomer yield is typically around 33-40%.\n*   **Ethylbenzene (5):** The -C2H5 group is bulkier than the -CH3 group. This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions leads to a greater preference for para-substitution compared to toluene. The para-isomer yield for bromination of ethylbenzene is higher than for toluene, typically around 40-50%.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-yield among the ortho-, para-directors is: **1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl)**.\n\n### **Final Combined Order**\n\nCombining the two groups, we get the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n\n1.  **Nitrobenzene (4):** Lowest yield (<1%).\n2.  **Ethyl benzoate (2):** Very low yield (~1-2%).\n3.  **Benzoic acid (6):** Very low yield (~1-2%, slightly different from the ester).\n4.  **Toluene (1):** Moderate para yield (~33-40%).\n5.  **Ethylbenzene (5):** Higher para yield than toluene due to sterics (~40-50%).\n6.  **Chlorobenzene (3):** Highest para yield (~87-90%).\n\nThe complete sequence is **4 < 2 < 6 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4 (Incorrect - reverse order)\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3 (Incorrect)\nC) 4<2<6<3<1<5 (Incorrect)\nD) 4<6<2<1<5<3 (This order is very close to our derived order, with a slight swap of 2 and 6, which have very similar and low para yields).\n\nLet's re-examine the order of 2 and 6. Both -COOH and -COOC2H5 are strongly deactivating and meta-directing. Their para yields are minimal and very close. The provided options suggest a specific order. Let's assume the order in option D is the intended one.\n\nFinal Order based on analysis and matching with options: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n### Analysis of Substituent Effects on Electrophilic Bromination\n\nTo arrange the given substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we must first classify the substituents on the benzene ring. These substituents determine the reaction's regioselectivity, directing the incoming bromine to specific positions (ortho, meta, or para).\n\n**1. Classification of Substituents:**\n\nThe substituents are classified based on their electronic effects (activating or deactivating) and their directing influence (ortho/para or meta).\n\n*   **Activating, Ortho/Para-Directing Groups:** These groups donate electron density to the benzene ring, making it more reactive. They direct the electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   **-CH₃ (Toluene, 1):** Alkyl group, activating.\n    *   **-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene, 5):** Alkyl group, activating.\n\n*   **Deactivating, Ortho/Para-Directing Groups:** Halogens are electron-withdrawing via induction (deactivating) but can donate electrons via resonance, which directs substitution to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   **-Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3):** Halogen, deactivating.\n\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups withdraw significant electron density from the ring, making it less reactive and directing the electrophile to the meta position.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene, 4):** Strongly deactivating.\n    *   **-COOH (Benzoic acid, 6):** Deactivating.\n    *   **-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate, 2):** Deactivating.\n\n**2. Isomer Distribution and Para-Yield:**\n\nThe percentage of the para-isomer formed depends on the nature of the substituent.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Substances 4, 2, 6):** For nitrobenzene (4), ethyl benzoate (2), and benzoic acid (6), the primary product is the meta-isomer. The yield of the para-isomer is consequently very low. For instance, the nitration of ethyl benzoate yields only 5% of the para-isomer, with the majority being the meta-product (73%). Similarly, the bromination of nitrobenzene almost exclusively produces the meta-isomer. Therefore, these three substances will have the lowest para-isomer yields. Among these, the deactivating strength generally follows the order -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅, which correlates with lower ortho/para substitution. Thus, the para yield order is expected to be 4 < 6 < 2.\n\n*   **Ortho/Para-Directors (Substances 1, 5, 3):** For toluene (1), ethylbenzene (5), and chlorobenzene (3), the substitution occurs at the ortho and para positions. The ratio between ortho and para products is influenced by steric hindrance.\n    *   **-CH₃ and -C₂H₅:** Alkyl groups are ortho/para directors. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased steric hindrance around the ortho positions in ethylbenzene favors substitution at the less hindered para position. Therefore, ethylbenzene (5) is expected to have a higher para-isomer yield than toluene (1). For example, in nitration, toluene gives 37% para-product, while the more sterically hindered tert-butylbenzene gives 75% para-product.\n    *   **-Cl:** The chloro group is also an ortho/para director. Halogens typically yield a high percentage of the para-isomer due to a combination of electronic and steric factors. For example, the nitration of chlorobenzene results in 70% para-product. In bromination, chlorobenzene shows high selectivity for the para position, with yields over 95% under certain conditions. This strong preference for the para position is generally higher than for simple alkylbenzenes.\n\n**3. Final Ordering:**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can establish the order of increasing para-isomer yield:\n\n1.  **Lowest Yields (Meta-Directors):** The deactivating, meta-directing groups will produce the smallest amount of the para-isomer. The order among them, from lowest to highest para yield, is generally accepted as: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n2.  **Intermediate Yields (Ortho/Para-Directors):** The activating alkyl groups will produce significant amounts of para-isomer. Due to less steric hindrance, toluene (1) will have a lower para-to-ortho ratio compared to the bulkier ethylbenzene (5). Thus, the order is Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5).\n3.  **Highest Yield (Ortho/Para-Director):** The chloro group in chlorobenzene (3) strongly directs substitution to the para position, often with very high selectivity, surpassing that of the alkylbenzenes.\n\nCombining these groups, the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### Step 1: Classify the Substituents\n\nFirst, we classify each substituent as either ortho-, para-directing or meta-directing.\n*   **Ortho-, Para-directors:** These groups direct incoming electrophiles to the positions ortho and para to themselves. Generally, these will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) **-CH3** (Methyl): Activating, ortho-, para-directing.\n    *   5) **-C2H5** (Ethyl): Activating, ortho-, para-directing.\n    *   3) **-Cl** (Chloro): Deactivating, but ortho-, para-directing.\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position. They produce very little para-isomer, so their para-isomer yield will be the lowest.\n    *   4) **-NO2** (Nitro): Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   2) **-COOC2H5** (Ethyl ester): Deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   6) **-COOH** (Carboxylic acid): Deactivating, meta-directing.\n\n### Step 2: Rank the Meta-Directors\n\nThe meta-directing substituents will have the lowest yield of the para-isomer. For these compounds, the vast majority of the product will be the meta-isomer.\n*   **Nitrobenzene (4, C6H5-NO2):** The -NO2 group is one of the strongest deactivating, meta-directing groups. Bromination yields almost exclusively the meta-product, with para-isomer yields being negligible, often less than 1%.\n*   **Ethyl benzoate (2, C6H5-COOC2H5):** The ester group is also deactivating and meta-directing. Data for nitration (a similar electrophilic substitution) shows it yields predominantly the meta-product (73%), with a small amount of para-isomer (5%).\n*   **Benzoic acid (6, C6H5-COOH):** The carboxylic acid group is deactivating and meta-directing, similar to the ester group.\n\nComparing these three, the -NO2 group is the strongest deactivator, leading to the lowest overall yield and the lowest proportion of the para-isomer. Between -COOH and -COOC2H5, their deactivating effects are comparable, but both will produce significantly more para-isomer than the -NO2 group. Generally, the order of para-isomer yield will be: **-NO2 < -COOC2H5 ≈ -COOH**. Therefore, the beginning of our sequence is **4 < 2 ≈ 6**.\n\n### Step 3: Rank the Ortho-, Para-Directors\n\nFor the ortho-, para-directing substituents (-Cl, -CH3, -C2H5), the yield of the para-isomer depends on the ortho-to-para ratio. This ratio is primarily influenced by **steric hindrance**. A larger substituent will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of the para-product.\n\nLet's compare the steric bulk of these groups:\n*   **-CH3 (Methyl):** This is a relatively small alkyl group.\n*   **-C2H5 (Ethyl):** This group is larger than the methyl group.\n*   **-Cl (Chloro):** This is a single atom.\n\nThe steric hindrance increases in the order: **-Cl < -CH3 < -C2H5**.\n*   **Toluene (1, C6H5-CH3):** The bromination of toluene yields about 66.8% para-isomer.\n*   **Ethylbenzene (5, C6H5-C2H5):** Due to the larger size of the ethyl group compared to the methyl group, there is more steric hindrance at the ortho positions. This favors the formation of the para-isomer even more than in toluene. Nitration data, for example, shows that the para-isomer percentage increases from 37% for toluene to 49% for ethylbenzene. A similar trend is expected for bromination.\n*   **Chlorobenzene (3, C6H5-Cl):** While the chloro group is ortho-, para-directing, its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect deactivates the ring. However, the key factor for the *ratio* is sterics. The chlorine atom is sterically less demanding than a methyl group. However, experimental data for halogenation of chlorobenzene often shows a high percentage of the para-isomer, sometimes as high as 70% for nitration. For bromination, the para-isomer is also heavily favored.\n\nLet's refine the order based on typical isomer distributions:\n*   The para-isomer yield increases as the steric bulk of the alkyl group increases: **-CH3 < -C2H5**.\n*   Comparing the alkyl groups to the chloro group, halogenation of chlorobenzene typically results in a very high para-isomer yield, often higher than for toluene and ethylbenzene under similar conditions. For example, nitration of chlorobenzene gives about 64-70% para-isomer, while for toluene it's about 37% and ethylbenzene about 49%. This suggests the order of para-yield is **-CH3 < -C2H5 < -Cl**.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Rankings\n\nCombining the two groups, we get the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n\n1.  **4 (C6H5-NO2):** Lowest yield (meta-director, strong deactivator).\n2.  **2 (C6H5-COOC2H5):** Very low yield (meta-director).\n3.  **6 (C6H5-COOH):** Very low yield (meta-director, similar to 2).\n4.  **1 (C6H5-CH3):** Significant para yield, but less than 5 and 3 due to lower steric hindrance.\n5.  **5 (C6H5-C2H5):** Higher para yield than 1 due to increased steric hindrance.\n6.  **3 (C6H5-Cl):** Highest para yield among the o,p-directors.\n\nThe complete sequence is: **4 < 2 < 6 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nLooking at the options, this does not perfectly match any of them. Let's re-evaluate the order of 2 and 6. The -COOH and -COOC2H5 groups have similar deactivating strengths. Without precise experimental data for bromination of both under identical conditions, their relative order is ambiguous but they will be close and occupy the positions after -NO2.\n\nLet's re-examine the options provided:\nA) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nB) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nC) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nD) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nOption B starts with the meta-directors (4, 2, 6) and ends with the ortho, para-directors (3, 1, 5). Let's analyze the order within these groups in option B.\n*   Meta-directors order: **4 < 2 < 6**. This is plausible, with NO2 giving the least para-product.\n*   Ortho, para-directors order: **3 < 1 < 5**. This implies the para yield is Cl < CH3 < C2H5. This contradicts our analysis based on steric hindrance and literature data, which suggests the para-yield increases with steric bulk (CH3 < C2H5) and that halogens often give a high para ratio.\n\nLet's reconsider the steric hindrance argument. The primary factor for the ortho/para ratio is the size of the substituent.\n*   Size: C2H5 > CH3 > Cl.\n*   This would lead to a para-isomer yield order of: Cl < CH3 < C2H5.\nThis matches the order in option B: **3 < 1 < 5**.\n\nLet's combine this with the meta-directors. The deactivating strength is generally considered -NO2 > -COOR > -COOH. This would mean the para-yield is **4 < 2 < 6**.\n\nCombining these two orderings gives: **4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**. This matches option B exactly.\n\nFinal check of the logic:\n*   **Lowest para yield:** Meta-directors. Order based on deactivating strength: NO2 > COOC2H5 > COOH. So, para yield is 4 < 2 < 6.\n*   **Highest para yield:** Ortho, para-directors. Order based on increasing steric hindrance favoring the para position: C2H5 > CH3 > Cl. So, para yield is 3 < 1 < 5.\n*   **Combined:** 4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5.\n\nThis provides a consistent rationale for option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Reaction and Substituent Effects**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a substituted benzene ring (C6H5-X). The substituent (X) on the ring determines two things:\n1.  **Reactivity:** Whether the ring reacts faster (activating group) or slower (deactivating group) than benzene itself.\n2.  **Orientation:** Where the incoming electrophile (Br+) will add. Substituents are either *ortho, para-directing* or *meta-directing*.\n\nThe question asks to arrange the substances in order of increasing yield of the *para-isomer*.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\n\nLet's classify the substituent for each substance:\n\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** -CH3 is an alkyl group. It is **activating** and **ortho, para-directing**.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** -COOC2H5 is an ester group. It is **deactivating** and **meta-directing**.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl is a halogen. It is **deactivating** but **ortho, para-directing** (a special case).\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** -NO2 is a nitro group. It is strongly **deactivating** and **meta-directing**.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** -C2H5 is an alkyl group. It is **activating** and **ortho, para-directing**.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** -COOH is a carboxylic acid group. It is **deactivating** and **meta-directing**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Groups**\n\nSubstances 2, 4, and 6 are meta-directors. For these compounds, the para-isomer is a minor byproduct, so its yield will be very low. The amount of para-product formed is inversely related to how strongly the group deactivates the ring and directs to the meta position.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength for these groups is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n*   This means -NO2 is the strongest meta-director, followed by -COOH, and then -COOC2H5.\n*   Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be the lowest for nitrobenzene (4), then higher for benzoic acid (6), and slightly higher again for ethyl benzoate (2).\n*   So, the order of increasing para-yield for this group is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\nBased on typical experimental data:\n*   Bromination of Nitrobenzene (4) gives <1% para-isomer.\n*   Bromination of Benzoic acid (6) gives ~2% para-isomer.\n*   Bromination of Ethyl benzoate (2) gives a slightly higher percentage than benzoic acid, around 3-5%.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Groups**\n\nSubstances 1, 3, and 5 are ortho, para-directors. For these compounds, the ortho and para isomers are the major products. The ratio of para to ortho product (p/o ratio) is primarily determined by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **-CH3 (Toluene, 1):** The methyl group is relatively small. It gives a significant amount of both ortho and para products. The para-isomer yield is about 67%.\n*   **-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene, 5):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance strongly favors the para position. The para-isomer yield is very high, about 94%.\n*   **-Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3):** The chloro group's size is comparable to a methyl group, but its electronic properties also influence the p/o ratio. Experimentally, it is highly para-directing. The para-isomer yield is about 89%.\n\nComparing the para-yields for this group:\n*   Toluene (1): ~67%\n*   Chlorobenzene (3): ~89%\n*   Ethylbenzene (5): ~94%\n\nThe order of increasing para-yield for this group is: **1 < 3 < 5**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Orders**\n\nThe meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2) will have significantly lower para-yields than the ortho, para-directing substances (1, 3, 5).\n\nCombining the two ordered sets:\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 3 < 5)\n\nThe complete order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**\n\n**Step 6: Compare with the Given Options**\n\nLet's examine the options provided:\nA) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nB) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nOur derived order is 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5. None of the options match this exactly. However, option C is the closest.\n\nLet's analyze Option C: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n*   The order of the meta-directors (4 < 6 < 2) is correct.\n*   The placement of the meta-directors before the ortho, para-directors is correct.\n*   The placement of toluene (1) as the o,p-director with the lowest para-yield is correct.\n*   The only discrepancy is the relative order of ethylbenzene (5) and chlorobenzene (3). Option C suggests that chlorobenzene gives a higher para-yield than ethylbenzene (5 < 3), whereas our data shows the opposite (3 < 5).\n\nGiven that all other options contain more significant and fundamental errors (e.g., incorrect ordering of meta-directors), Option C is the most plausible answer. It is likely that there is a small error in the question's options, but it follows the correct chemical principles for most of the sequence.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Reaction and the Question**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a series of monosubstituted benzene rings. The goal is to arrange the starting substances in order of increasing yield of the *para*-substituted product. Since all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material have the same molar mass, the \"weight fraction of the yield\" is directly proportional to the \"mole fraction\" or \"percentage yield\" of the para-isomer.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\n\nThe directing effect of the substituent already on the benzene ring determines the position of the incoming bromine atom. We need to classify each substituent as either ortho,para-directing or meta-directing.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups donate electron density to the ring (activating groups) or are halogens (deactivating but o,p-directing). They direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) `-CH3` (in Toluene): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   5) `-C2H5` (in Ethylbenzene): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   3) `-Cl` (in Chlorobenzene): Deactivating, o,p-director.\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring (deactivating groups). They direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position.\n    *   4) `-NO2` (in Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating, m-director.\n    *   2) `-COOC2H5` (in Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating, m-director.\n    *   6) `-COOH` (in Benzoic acid): Deactivating, m-director.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Substances within Each Group**\n\nSubstances with meta-directing groups will produce a very small amount of the para-isomer, while substances with ortho,para-directing groups will produce a significant amount. Therefore, the final order will be (meta-directors) < (ortho,para-directors).\n\n**A) Ordering the meta-directors (Substances 2, 4, 6):**\n\nFor these groups, the yield of the para-isomer is very low. The order depends on the strength of the deactivating and meta-directing effect. A stronger deactivating group will direct more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower percentage of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n    *   The `-NO2` group is one of the strongest electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   The `-COOH` group is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The `-COOC2H5` group is slightly less deactivating than `-COOH` because the ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is weakly electron-donating, which slightly counteracts the withdrawal effect.\n\n*   Therefore, the percentage of para-product will be the lowest for the strongest deactivator and increase as the deactivating strength decreases.\n*   Order of increasing para-yield: **4 (`-NO2`) < 6 (`-COOH`) < 2 (`-COOC2H5`)**.\n\n**B) Ordering the ortho,para-directors (Substances 1, 3, 5):**\n\nFor these groups, the yield of the para-isomer is high. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho product (p/o ratio). This ratio is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing `-CH3` (1) and `-C2H5` (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The primary factor determining the p/o ratio is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). The increased bulk hinders the electrophile's approach to the adjacent ortho positions, thus favoring substitution at the less hindered para position. This leads to a higher para-isomer yield for ethylbenzene compared to toluene.\n    *   Order of increasing para-yield: **1 (`-CH3`) < 5 (`-C2H5`)**.\n\n*   **Comparing with `-Cl` (3):** The chlorine atom is an o,p-director but is deactivating overall. It has a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) and a weaker electron-donating resonance effect (+R). The strong -I effect deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic effect leads to a very high preference for para substitution. Typically, the para-isomer yield for halobenzenes is exceptionally high, often higher than for alkylbenzenes. For bromination, chlorobenzene yields about 87% para-isomer, while toluene yields about 67%.\n    *   Therefore, chlorobenzene will have the highest para-yield among this group.\n    *   Order of increasing para-yield: **1 (`-CH3`) < 5 (`-C2H5`) < 3 (`-Cl`)**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Orders**\n\nNow, we combine the two ordered groups. The meta-directors will have the lowest para-yields, followed by the ortho,para-directors.\n\n*   Order of m-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of o,p-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nCombining them gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Reaction and Classify the Substituents**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination). The substituent already on the benzene ring directs the incoming bromine atom (Br+) to specific positions. We need to classify each substituent based on its directing effect.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the positions ortho and para to themselves. These substances will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) -CH3 (Toluene): Activating group.\n    *   5) -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene): Activating group.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating group, but directs ortho, para.\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. For these substances, the ortho and para isomers are formed in very small amounts, meaning their para-yield will be the lowest.\n    *   4) -NO2 (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating.\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid): Deactivating.\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating.\n\nBased on this classification, the substances with meta-directing groups will have the lowest yields of the para-isomer and will appear first in the list. The ortho, para-directors will have the highest yields and will appear last.\n\nThe overall order will look like: **(Meta-directors in order) < (Ortho, para-directors in order)**.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a very minor product. The amount of para-product formed is inversely related to the strength of the deactivating effect of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group will more strongly direct to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nWe need to rank the deactivating strength of the -NO2, -COOH, and -COOC2H5 groups.\n*   The nitro group (-NO2) is one of the strongest electron-withdrawing and deactivating groups.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also a strong deactivating group.\n*   The ester group (-COOC2H5) is deactivating, but generally considered less deactivating than -COOH.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength is: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**\n\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the *reverse* order of this deactivating strength:\nYield(para-NO2) < Yield(para-COOH) < Yield(para-COOC2H5)\n\nThis corresponds to the substance numbers: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these substances, we need to compare the ratio of the para-isomer to the ortho-isomer. This ratio is heavily influenced by **steric hindrance**. A bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions, making the para position more accessible for the incoming bromine.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1, -CH3) and Ethylbenzene (5, -C2H5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk provides more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, which leads to a higher proportion of the para-isomer for ethylbenzene compared to toluene.\n    *   Therefore, the order of para-yield is: **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3, -Cl):** Halogens like chlorine are a special case. While they are deactivating overall, they are known to give a very high yield of the para-isomer in electrophilic substitutions. For example, the bromination of chlorobenzene yields approximately 87% of the para-isomer. This percentage is typically higher than that for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene. The electronic effects of the halogen's lone pairs strongly favor the para position.\n\nCombining these facts, the order of increasing para-yield for this group is:\nToluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)\nSo, the order is **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Two Groups**\n\nNow we combine the ordered groups to get the final sequence:\n(Meta-directors) < (Ortho, para-directors)\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe final combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order:\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents**\nFirst, we need to classify the substituent on each benzene ring (C6H5-) based on its effect on electrophilic substitution. Substituents can be either activating (and ortho,para-directing) or deactivating (and mostly meta-directing, with the exception of halogens).\n\n*   **Activating, ortho,para-directing groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive, and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a high yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) -CH3 (Toluene)\n    *   5) -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n\n*   **Deactivating, meta-directing groups:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive, and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   4) -NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid)\n\n*   **Deactivating, ortho,para-directing group:** Halogens are a special case. They are deactivating due to their strong inductive effect but are ortho,para-directing due to their resonance effect. They will produce a high yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\n**Step 2: Separate into low-yield and high-yield groups**\nBased on the directing effects, we can immediately say that the meta-directing substances will have a much lower yield of the para-isomer than the ortho,para-directing substances.\n\n*   **Low para-yield group:** 2, 4, 6\n*   **High para-yield group:** 1, 3, 5\n\nThe final order will look like: (Order of 2, 4, 6) < (Order of 1, 3, 5).\n\n**Step 3: Order the low-yield (meta-directing) group**\nFor meta-directors, the amount of para-isomer formed is very small. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group directs more strongly to the meta position, leaving less for the para position.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n    *   The -NO2 group is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The -COOH group is a stronger deactivator than the -COOC2H5 (ester) group because the electron-donating ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing ability.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength:\n    *   **4 (-NO2) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC2H5)**\n\n**Step 4: Order the high-yield (ortho,para-directing) group**\nFor these substances, we need to compare the ratio of the para product to the ortho product.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The primary difference is the size (steric bulk) of the alkyl group. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is larger than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk hinders the attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene will give a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   **1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5)**\n\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) has a very strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect. This effect is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more strongly than the distant para position. This electronic factor leads to a very high preference for para substitution, even more so than for alkylbenzenes. The yield of para-bromochlorobenzene is typically very high (around 85-90%).\n    *   Therefore, chlorobenzene gives the highest yield of the para-isomer in this group.\n    *   **1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl)**\n\n**Step 5: Combine the groups for the final order**\nBy combining the orders from Step 3 and Step 4, we get the final arrangement from lowest to highest para-isomer yield.\n\n*   (4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we must analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent on the benzene ring. The weight fraction of the yield is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the isomer.\n\nHere is a substance-by-substance analysis based on the directing effects of their functional groups:\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups (Deactivating):** These groups direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position, resulting in very low yields of the para-isomer. The strength of the deactivating effect influences the selectivity for the meta position; stronger deactivators yield even less para-product.\n    *   **4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group (-NO₂) is a very strong deactivator and meta-director. Bromination of nitrobenzene almost exclusively yields the meta-isomer, with only trace amounts of the para-isomer. Theoretical calculations show the para intermediate is significantly less stable than the meta intermediate.\n    *   **6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is a strong deactivator and meta-director. Its deactivating effect is less than the nitro group, so it will produce a slightly higher, yet still very small, yield of the para-isomer compared to nitrobenzene.\n    *   **2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate):** The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is also a deactivating meta-director. It is generally considered a weaker deactivator than a carboxylic acid. For instance, in nitration reactions, ethyl benzoate yields about 5% of the para-isomer. This is expected to be the highest para yield among the three meta-directors.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups (Activating/Deactivating):** These groups direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. The ratio between ortho and para products is largely determined by steric hindrance.\n    *   **1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is an activating, ortho, para-director. For bromination, the typical distribution gives a significant amount of para-isomer, around 33-40%.\n    *   **5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is also an activating, ortho, para-director, similar to the methyl group. However, the ethyl group is larger, causing more steric hindrance at the ortho positions. This increased hindrance favors substitution at the para position, leading to a higher yield of the para-isomer compared to toluene.\n    *   **3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group (-Cl) is deactivating overall but is an ortho, para-director due to its lone pairs of electrons. Halogens are known to give a very high proportion of the para-isomer in electrophilic substitutions. For example, the bromination of chlorobenzene can yield up to 87% of the para-isomer, which is the highest among this set of ortho, para-directors.\n\n**Summary of Isomer Yields:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we can establish the following order of increasing para-isomer yield:\n\n1.  **Nitrobenzene (4):** Lowest para yield due to the strongly deactivating -NO₂ group.\n2.  **Benzoic acid (6):** Very low para yield, but slightly more than nitrobenzene.\n3.  **Ethyl benzoate (2):** Low para yield, but the most of the meta-directors.\n4.  **Toluene (1):** Significant para yield (~33-40%).\n5.  **Ethylbenzene (5):** Higher para yield than toluene due to greater steric hindrance from the ethyl group.\n6.  **Chlorobenzene (3):** Highest para yield (~87%) due to the electronic properties of the chloro substituent.\n\nTherefore, the final order of substances in increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nB) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nC) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nD) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nThe correct sequence matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we must analyze the directing effects of each substituent on the benzene ring. The formation of the para-isomer is influenced by whether the substituent is ortho-, para-directing or meta-directing, and by steric hindrance at the ortho position.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the substituents:\n*   **-NO2 (Nitrobenzene, 4), -COOH (Benzoic acid, 6), and -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate, 2):** These are deactivating, meta-directing groups. They withdraw electron density from the ring, making electrophilic substitution difficult and directing the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. Consequently, the yield of the para-isomer is extremely low for these substances.\n    *   The -NO2 group is one of the strongest deactivating groups, resulting in a para-isomer yield of less than 1%.\n    *   The -COOH and -COOC2H5 groups are also strongly deactivating. For ethyl benzoate, the para-isomer yield is around 5%, while the meta-isomer is the major product (73%). For benzoic acid, the para yield is also very small, with the vast majority being the meta-isomer. Comparing the three, the order of increasing para yield is generally considered to be nitrobenzene < benzoic acid < ethyl benzoate, although all are very low.\n\n*   **-CH3 (Toluene, 1), -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene, 5), and -Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3):** These are ortho-, para-directing groups. They will all produce a significant amount of the para-isomer. The specific yield of the para-isomer versus the ortho-isomer is largely determined by steric effects.\n    *   **Toluene (-CH3, 1):** The methyl group is activating and directs to the ortho and para positions. In bromination, toluene typically yields about 30-40% ortho-isomer and the rest is almost all para-isomer, giving a para yield of about 60-70%.\n    *   **Ethylbenzene (-C2H5, 5):** The ethyl group is also activating and ortho-, para-directing. Because the ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group, it creates more steric hindrance at the ortho positions. This increased hindrance favors substitution at the less crowded para position, resulting in a higher para-isomer yield compared to toluene.\n    *   **Chlorobenzene (-Cl, 3):** The chloro group is deactivating overall but is ortho-, para-directing due to its lone pairs participating in resonance. The para-isomer is strongly favored, with conventional bromination yielding an ortho to para isomer ratio of about 0.1 to 1, which corresponds to approximately 9% ortho and 91% para.\n\nBased on this analysis, the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n1.  **Nitrobenzene (4):** Has the lowest para yield (<1%).\n2.  **Benzoic acid (6):** Has a very low para yield, slightly higher than nitrobenzene.\n3.  **Ethyl benzoate (2):** Has a very low para yield (around 5%), but generally slightly higher than benzoic acid.\n4.  **Toluene (1):** Has a substantial para yield (~60-70%).\n5.  **Ethylbenzene (5):** Has a higher para yield than toluene due to greater steric hindrance from the ethyl group.\n6.  **Chlorobenzene (3):** Has the highest para yield (~91%) due to a strong preference for para substitution.\n\nThus, the final order is 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we need to consider the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### Analysis of Substituents\n\nThe substituents can be classified based on their directing effects in electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups (deactivating):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. Consequently, they will produce the lowest yield of the para-isomer. The substances with these groups are:\n    *   **4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group (-NO2) is a very strong deactivating, meta-director. It produces almost exclusively the meta-isomer, with only trace amounts of the ortho and para products.\n    *   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** The ester group (-COOC2H5) is a deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   **6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also a deactivating, meta-director.\n\n    Among these three, the nitro group is one of the strongest meta-directors, leading to a very low para yield. The ester and carboxylic acid groups are also strongly meta-directing. For nitration of a benzoic ester, the para yield is about 5%. For the bromination of nitrobenzene, the reaction requires harsh conditions and yields predominantly the meta isomer. The para yield for all three will be very low, with nitrobenzene expected to be the lowest. Following nitrobenzene, the ester and carboxylic acid groups will also have very low para yields.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce significantly higher yields of the para-isomer compared to meta-directors.\n    *   **1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The methyl group (-CH3) is an activating, ortho, para-director. Due to its small size, it allows for a significant amount of ortho substitution, but the para isomer is also a major product.\n    *   **5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is also an activating, ortho, para-director. It is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions makes the para position more accessible for the incoming electrophile. Therefore, ethylbenzene will produce a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   **3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group (-Cl) is a deactivating, but ortho, para-director. Halogens generally lead to a high yield of the para-isomer, often more so than simple alkyl groups, due to a combination of electronic and steric effects. For example, the nitration of chlorobenzene gives a 70% yield of the para-isomer.\n\n### Establishing the Order\n\n1.  **Lowest Para Yields (Meta-directors):** The lowest yields of the para-isomer will come from the meta-directing groups. The order among them, from lowest to highest para yield, is generally based on the strength of their deactivating and meta-directing nature.\n    *   Nitrobenzene (4) is extremely deactivating and gives a negligible para yield.\n    *   Ethyl benzoate (2) and Benzoic acid (6) are also strongly deactivating. Data for the nitration of ethyl benzoate shows a 5% para yield. The deactivating strength of -COOH and -COOR are comparable.\n    *   Therefore, the order for the lowest para yields is: **4 < 2 ≈ 6**.\n\n2.  **Highest Para Yields (Ortho, para-directors):** Now we order the o,p-directors.\n    *   Comparing toluene (1) and ethylbenzene (5), the bulkier ethyl group in (5) sterically hinders the ortho positions more than the methyl group in (1). This results in a higher proportion of the para product for ethylbenzene. So, the order is **1 < 5**.\n    *   Comparing the alkylbenzenes to chlorobenzene (3), halogens are known to give high para-to-ortho ratios. The nitration of chlorobenzene, for instance, yields 70% para-product, while the nitration of toluene yields 37% para-product. This suggests that chlorobenzene will have a higher para-isomer yield than both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, the order for the highest para yields is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n3.  **Combining the Groups:** Combining the two groups, we need to place the meta-directors before the ortho, para-directors. The question asks for an increasing order of the *weight fraction* of the para-isomer. Based on typical isomer distributions, there is a significant gap between the para yield from meta-directors and ortho, para-directors.\n\nThe final combined order is determined by arranging the meta-directors first, followed by the ortho, para-directors, each subgroup ordered by increasing para yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (lowest para yield):** 4 (-NO2) < 2 (-COOC2H5) < 6 (-COOH). The relative order of 2 and 6 can be debated without precise data for bromination, but they are very close and both are significantly lower than the o,p-directors. Let's check the options. Option C suggests 4 < 2 < 6. Option D suggests 4 < 6 < 2.\n*   **Ortho, para-directors (highest para yield):** 1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl).\n\nLet's re-evaluate the meta-directors. The -NO2 group is the strongest deactivator. Between -COOH and -COOC2H5, their deactivating strengths are similar. Let's look at the provided options to resolve the ambiguity.\n\n*   A) 3<5<1<6<2<4 (Decreasing order)\n*   B) 6<2<4<5<1<3 (Incorrect grouping)\n*   C) 4<2<6<3<1<5 (Incorrect order for o,p directors)\n*   D) 4<6<2<1<5<3 (Correct grouping and plausible internal order)\n\nLet's analyze option D: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n*   **Meta-directors:** 4 (-NO2) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC2H5). This order is plausible for the very low para yields.\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** 1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl). This order is consistent with our analysis based on steric hindrance and the known high para-selectivity for halogens.\n\nThe order presented in option D aligns well with established principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution. The meta-directors produce the least para-isomer, with the strongly deactivating nitro group producing the absolute least. The ortho, para-directors produce the most, with the yield increasing as ortho-attack is sterically disfavored (-CH3 < -C2H5) and with the electronically favored para-direction of halogens (-Cl being the highest).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents.**\nFirst, we need to classify each substituent on the benzene ring as either an *ortho,para-director* or a *meta-director*. This classification determines the primary positions where the incoming bromine electrophile will attach.\n\n*   **Ortho,para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They are typically activating groups (electron-donating) or halogens.\n    *   1) -CH3 (methyl): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   5) -C2H5 (ethyl): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   3) -Cl (chloro): Deactivating, but o,p-director.\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They are deactivating groups (electron-withdrawing).\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (ethyl ester): Deactivating, m-director.\n    *   4) -NO2 (nitro): Strongly deactivating, m-director.\n    *   6) -COOH (carboxylic acid): Deactivating, m-director.\n\n**Step 2: Compare the two main groups.**\nSubstances with meta-directing groups will produce the meta-isomer as the major product, with very small amounts of ortho and para isomers. Substances with ortho,para-directing groups will produce ortho and para isomers as the major products.\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be much lower for the meta-directing group than for the ortho,para-directing group.\nThis means substances 2, 4, and 6 will come before substances 1, 3, and 5 in the final ranking.\n\n**Step 3: Order the meta-directors (lowest para yield).**\nWe need to arrange substances 2, 4, and 6 in order of increasing para-isomer yield. The yield of the para-isomer will be lowest for the substituent that is the strongest deactivating/meta-directing group.\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n*   -NO2 (4) is the strongest deactivator, so it will direct most strongly to the meta position, resulting in the lowest yield of the para-isomer.\n*   -COOH (6) is a weaker deactivator than -NO2 but generally considered stronger than an ester group.\n*   -COOC2H5 (2) is the weakest deactivator among these three.\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: 4 < 6 < 2.\n\n**Step 4: Order the ortho,para-directors (highest para yield).**\nWe need to arrange substances 1, 3, and 5 in order of increasing para-isomer yield. For these groups, both ortho and para products are formed. The proportion of the para-isomer depends on steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n*   **-CH3 (1) vs. -C2H5 (5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size hinders the attack at the ortho positions more significantly, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer for ethylbenzene compared to toluene. So, the para yield for 1 is less than for 5 (1 < 5).\n*   **-Cl (3) vs. alkyl groups (1, 5):** The chloro group is a special case. Although it is a deactivating group, it is ortho,para-directing. Its strong inductive electron-withdrawing effect (-I effect) disfavors the adjacent ortho position more than the distant para position. This electronic effect, combined with its own steric bulk, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer is often the overwhelming product in the electrophilic halogenation of halobenzenes. For bromination, the para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (~89%) is significantly higher than for toluene (~62%) or ethylbenzene (~64%).\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: 1 < 5 < 3.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the rankings.**\nCombining the two groups, we get the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete sequence is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nComparing this sequence with the given options:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nC) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nD) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nTo arrange the given substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we must consider the directing effects and steric properties of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### Analysis of Substituents\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents based on their electronic effects and how they direct incoming electrophiles:\n\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The methyl group (`-CH3`) is an activating, ortho-, para-director.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** The ethoxycarbonyl group (`-COOC2H5`) is a deactivating, meta-director.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is a deactivating, ortho-, para-director.\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group (`-NO2`) is a strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is an activating, ortho-, para-director.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The carboxyl group (`-COOH`) is a deactivating, meta-director.\n\n### Yield of the Para-Isomer\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups (4, 2, 6):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the meta position. The yield of the para-isomer is extremely low. Among these, the `-NO2` group is the most strongly deactivating, leading to the highest selectivity for the meta position and thus the lowest yield of the para-isomer. The deactivating strength generally follows the order: `-NO2` > `-COOC2H5` ≈ `-COOH`. Therefore, the para-isomer yield will be lowest for nitrobenzene (4), followed by ethyl benzoate (2) and benzoic acid (6). While data for bromination of benzoic acid and its ester can be difficult to find and reactions often require harsh conditions, literature on nitration (a similar electrophilic substitution) shows ethyl benzoate gives about 5% para-isomer. We can infer a similar trend for bromination, placing these three at the beginning of the sequence.\n    *   **4 (Nitrobenzene):** ~0-5% para yield.\n    *   **2 (Ethyl benzoate):** Low para yield, likely slightly higher than nitrobenzene.\n    *   **6 (Benzoic acid):** Low para yield, comparable to ethyl benzoate.\n\n*   **Ortho-, para-directing groups (3, 1, 5):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions. The ratio of para to ortho product is primarily determined by steric hindrance; a bulkier substituent will sterically hinder the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer.\n    *   **3 (Chlorobenzene):** The `-Cl` atom is relatively small. Nitration of chlorobenzene, for comparison, yields about 64-70% para product. Bromination is expected to yield a high percentage of the para isomer.\n    *   **1 (Toluene):** The `-CH3` group is bulkier than `-Cl`. In conventional bromination, the para-isomer is the major product, forming about 60-70% of the monobrominated mixture.\n    *   **5 (Ethylbenzene):** The `-C2H5` group is bulkier than `-CH3`. Increased steric bulk leads to greater hindrance at the ortho positions, thus favoring para substitution even more than in toluene. Data for bromination in trifluoroacetic acid shows ethylbenzene gives 83.2% para-isomer, while toluene gives 79.2% para-isomer.\n\n### Arranging the Substances\n\nBased on the analysis, we can establish the order of increasing para-isomer yield:\n\n1.  **Nitrobenzene (4):** As the strongest meta-director, it will have the lowest para-yield.\n2.  **Ethyl benzoate (2):** A meta-director with a very low para-yield.\n3.  **Benzoic acid (6):** Another meta-director with a very low para-yield, likely slightly higher than the ester due to less deactivation.\n4.  **Chlorobenzene (3):** An ortho-, para-director where the `-Cl` atom is sterically small, but electronic effects strongly favor para substitution, often leading to a high para yield, but less than the alkylbenzenes in some conditions.\n5.  **Toluene (1):** The methyl group's steric hindrance favors the para position. Standard bromination yields around 36.8% para product under certain conditions, though this can vary. However, relative to other substituents, it is well-established.\n6.  **Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group, leading to the highest proportion of para-isomer among the ortho-, para-directors due to the most significant steric hindrance at the ortho positions.\n\nCombining these findings, the correct order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 (Nitrobenzene) < 2 (Ethyl benzoate) < 6 (Benzoic acid) < 3 (Chlorobenzene) < 1 (Toluene) < 5 (Ethylbenzene)**.\n\nThis sequence matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n1.  **Classify Substituents:** First, we'll categorize the substituents on the benzene ring (C6H5-) as either *ortho,para-directing* or *meta-directing*.\n    *   *Ortho,para-directors* activate (or slightly deactivate, in the case of halogens) the ring and direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. These will have a **high** yield of the para-isomer. The substances in this group are:\n        *   1) Toluene (-CH3)\n        *   3) Chlorobenzene (-Cl)\n        *   5) Ethylbenzene (-C2H5)\n    *   *Meta-directors* deactivate the ring and direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position. These will have a **very low** yield of the para-isomer. The substances in this group are:\n        *   2) Ethyl benzoate (-COOC2H5)\n        *   4) Nitrobenzene (-NO2)\n        *   6) Benzoic acid (-COOH)\n\n2.  **Order the Meta-Directors (Lowest Yields):** For meta-directing groups, the para-isomer is a minor byproduct. The stronger the deactivating and meta-directing effect of the group, the lower the yield of the para-isomer will be.\n    *   The deactivating strength generally follows the order: -NO2 > -COOC2H5 ≈ -COOH.\n    *   Based on experimental data, the percentage of the para-isomer formed is lowest for Nitrobenzene (4), followed by Benzoic acid (6), and then Ethyl benzoate (2).\n    *   So, the beginning of our sequence is **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n3.  **Order the Ortho,Para-Directors (Highest Yields):** For this group, we need to compare the ratio of para to ortho product. This ratio is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n    *   **Steric Hindrance:** A larger substituent will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer. The size of the groups is: -C2H5 > -CH3. Therefore, the para yield of Ethylbenzene (5) will be greater than that of Toluene (1).\n    *   **Electronic Effects:** The -Cl group in Chlorobenzene (3) is strongly electron-withdrawing by induction, which deactivates the ortho positions more than the para position. This, combined with its size, leads to a very high preference for the para position.\n    *   Comparing the three, experimental data for bromination shows the following trend for para-isomer percentage: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n    *   So, the end of our sequence is **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n4.  **Combine the Orders:** By combining the two groups, we get the complete sequence for increasing para-isomer yield.\n    *   (4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n    *   The final order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n5.  **Match with Options:** This sequence matches option B.

Combine the groups to get the final order of increasing para-isomer yield.\n\nExecution:\nMeta-directors ordered by increasing para-yield: 4 (0.3%) < 6 (1.0%) < 2 (2.0%)\nOrtho,para-directors ordered by increasing para-yield: 1 (62.0%) < 5 (80.0%) < 3 (87.0%)\n\nCombined Final Order:\n4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nThis order corresponds to option B.\n<<<B>>>\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Reaction and Substituent Effects\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a series of monosubstituted benzene rings (C6H5-X). The position of the incoming bromine atom (ortho, meta, or para) is determined by the nature of the substituent 'X'. The question asks to arrange the substances in order of increasing yield of the *para-isomer*.\n\nSubstituents can be classified into two main categories based on their directing effects:\n1.  **Ortho, Para-Directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the positions ortho and para to themselves. They are typically activating groups (like alkyl groups -R) or halogens (-Cl). For these substances, the para-isomer is a major product.\n2.  **Meta-Directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They are deactivating groups (like -NO2, -COOH, -COOR). For these substances, the para-isomer is a very minor product.\n\n### Step 2: Classify the Substituents in the Given Substances\n\nLet's classify each substituent:\n*   **1) С6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** -CH3 is an alkyl group. It is a weakly activating, **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** -COOC2H5 is an ester group. It is a deactivating, **meta-director**.\n*   **3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl is a halogen. It is a deactivating, **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** -NO2 is a nitro group. It is a strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n*   **5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** -C2H5 is an alkyl group. It is a weakly activating, **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** -COOH is a carboxylic acid group. It is a deactivating, **meta-director**.\n\n### Step 3: Initial Sorting into Two Groups\n\nSince meta-directors yield very little para product and ortho, para-directors yield a significant amount of para product, we can immediately say that all meta-directing substances will have a lower para yield than all ortho, para-directing substances.\n\n*   **Low Para Yield Group (Meta-Directors):** {C6H5-NO2 (4), C6H5-COOH (6), C6H5-COOC2H5 (2)}\n*   **High Para Yield Group (Ortho, Para-Directors):** {C6H5-CH3 (1), C6H5-C2H5 (5), C6H5-Cl (3)}\n\nThe final order will be: {Group of 4, 6, 2} < {Group of 1, 5, 3}\n\n### Step 4: Arrange the Meta-Directors (4, 6, 2)\n\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the minor para product is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, thus forming even less para product.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n*   The -NO2 group is the strongest deactivator, so it will produce the least amount of para-isomer.\n*   The -COOH group is the next strongest deactivator.\n*   The -COOC2H5 group is the weakest deactivator among the three.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: -NO2 < -COOH < -COOC2H5.\n*   This corresponds to the order of substances: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### Step 5: Arrange the Ortho, Para-Directors (1, 5, 3)\n\nFor ortho, para-directors, we need to compare the ratio of para to ortho substitution. A higher para yield is favored by factors that disfavor substitution at the ortho position.\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** The bulky incoming electrophile (Br+) will have difficulty approaching the ortho positions if the substituent is also bulky.\n    *   Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5): The ethyl group (-C2H5) is larger than the methyl group (-CH3). The greater steric hindrance of the ethyl group leads to a higher proportion of substitution at the less hindered para position. Thus, the para yield for ethylbenzene is greater than for toluene. Order: **1 < 5**.\n*   **Electronic and Steric Effects of Halogens:**\n    *   Comparing alkyl groups (1, 5) with -Cl (3): The chlorine atom is an ortho, para-director, but it is deactivating due to its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect). This effect is stronger at the ortho positions than at the more distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with sterics, makes the para position much more favored for halogens compared to alkyl groups. The para-isomer yield for the bromination of chlorobenzene is known to be very high (around 89%). This is significantly higher than for toluene (~67%) or ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, the para yield for chlorobenzene is the highest in this group.\n*   Combining these points, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: -CH3 < -C2H5 < -Cl.\n*   This corresponds to the order of substances: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### Step 6: Combine the Groups for the Final Answer\n\nCombining the results from Step 4 and Step 5:\n\nThe group of meta-directors (4 < 6 < 2) has a lower para yield than the group of ortho, para-directors (1 < 5 < 3).\n\nThe final order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order:\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction and the Goal**\n\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a series of substituted benzene rings (C6H5-R). The goal is to arrange these substances in order of the *increasing* yield (weight fraction) of the *para*-isomer.\n\nThe directing effect of the substituent (R) on the benzene ring is the primary factor determining the product distribution (ortho, meta, para). We need to consider two main aspects for each substituent:\n*   **Directing effect**: Does it direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho/para positions or the meta position?\n*   **Steric and electronic factors**: How do the size and electronic properties of the substituent influence the ratio of para to ortho product?\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\n\nFirst, we classify each substituent based on its directing effect.\n\n*   **Substituents that direct to the ortho and para positions (o,p-directors):**\n    *   These are typically activating groups (electron-donating) or halogens.\n    *   1) **-CH3 (methyl)**: Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   5) **-C2H5 (ethyl)**: Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   3) **-Cl (chloro)**: Deactivating, but o,p-director due to lone pair resonance.\n\n*   **Substituents that direct to the meta position (m-directors):**\n    *   These are deactivating groups (electron-withdrawing).\n    *   2) **-COOC2H5 (ethyl ester)**: Deactivating, m-director.\n    *   4) **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, m-director.\n    *   6) **-COOH (carboxylic acid)**: Deactivating, m-director.\n\n**3. Initial Broad Grouping**\n\nCompounds with meta-directing groups will produce very little para-isomer, as the main product is the meta-isomer. Compounds with ortho,para-directing groups will produce a significant amount of para-isomer. Therefore, the order will start with the meta-directors and end with the ortho,para-directors.\n\nOrder: [m-directors in increasing para yield] < [o,p-directors in increasing para yield]\nOrder: [2, 4, 6] < [1, 3, 5]\n\n**4. Ordering the Meta-Directors (Substances 2, 4, 6)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the para-isomer is a very minor side product. The yield of this side product is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group makes the ring less reactive overall and more selective for the meta position, thus producing even less of the para (and ortho) isomers.\n\nLet's rank the deactivating strength of these groups:\n*   **-NO2 (4)** is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n*   **-COOH (6)** is a strong deactivating group.\n*   **-COOC2H5 (2)** is also a strong deactivating group, but slightly weaker than -COOH.\n\nThe generally accepted order of deactivating strength is: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**.\n\nTherefore, the selectivity for the meta position follows the same order. This means the yield of the undesired para-isomer will be in the reverse order of deactivating strength.\n\n*   Lowest para yield: C6H5-NO2 (4)\n*   Intermediate para yield: C6H5-COOH (6)\n*   Highest para yield (among this group): C6H5-COOC2H5 (2)\n\nSo, the order for this group is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**5. Ordering the Ortho,Para-Directors (Substances 1, 3, 5)**\n\nFor these substances, both ortho and para isomers are formed. The percentage of the para-isomer depends on steric hindrance and electronic effects that influence the para/ortho ratio.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, thus favoring substitution at the more accessible para position.\n    *   Therefore, the para yield for ethylbenzene (5) is greater than for toluene (1).\n    *   Order: **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chloro group is unique. It is deactivating due to its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I), but its lone pairs allow for a resonance effect (+M) that directs ortho/para. The strong -I effect is distance-dependent and deactivates the ortho positions more significantly than the para position. This electronic factor, combined with the steric size of the chlorine atom, makes para substitution highly favorable. The percentage of para-isomer in the bromination of chlorobenzene is typically very high (around 89-90%), which is higher than for both toluene (around 66%) and ethylbenzene (around 75-80%).\n    *   Therefore, the para yield for chlorobenzene (3) is the highest among these three.\n\nCombining these observations, the order of increasing para yield for the o,p-directors is:\n**C6H5-CH3 (1) < C6H5-C2H5 (5) < C6H5-Cl (3)**.\n\n**6. Final Combined Order**\n\nNow, we combine the two ranked groups:\n\n(Order of m-directors) < (Order of o,p-directors)\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe final arrangement of substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nTo determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in the electrophilic bromination of the given substances, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric properties of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n**Analysis of Substituents**\n\nThe rate and orientation of electrophilic aromatic substitution are governed by the nature of the substituent already present on the benzene ring. Substituents are classified as either activating (electron-donating) or deactivating (electron-withdrawing), and as ortho, para-directing or meta-directing.\n\n1.  **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups deactivate the ring and direct the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br+) primarily to the meta position. Consequently, the yield of the para-isomer is extremely low, close to zero. The substances with meta-directing groups will have the lowest para-isomer yields.\n    *   **C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene, 4):** The nitro group (-NO₂) is a very strong electron-withdrawing group, making it a strong deactivator and a meta-director. It will produce the least amount of para-isomer.\n    *   **C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate, 2):** The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is an electron-withdrawing group, a deactivator, and a meta-director.\n    *   **C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid, 6):** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also an electron-withdrawing, deactivating, and meta-directing group.\n\n    Among these three, the deactivating strength generally follows the order -NO₂ > -COOR ≈ -COOH. The stronger the deactivating and meta-directing effect, the lower the yield of the para-isomer. Therefore, the order of increasing para-yield among these is: Nitrobenzene (4) < Ethyl benzoate (2) < Benzoic acid (6).\n\n2.  **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The yield of the para-isomer is significant for these substances. The ratio of para to ortho product is primarily influenced by steric hindrance – larger substituents will sterically hinder the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer.\n    *   **C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3):** The chloro group (-Cl) is deactivating overall but is ortho, para-directing due to electron donation by resonance. Halogens typically yield a high proportion of the para-isomer compared to the ortho-isomer. For bromination, the para-isomer is the major product.\n    *   **C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene, 1):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is an activating, ortho, para-directing group. Due to its relatively small size, a considerable amount of the ortho-isomer is formed, although the para-isomer is still slightly favored. In bromination, the para/ortho ratio is approximately 1.8:1, meaning about 64% of the mixture is the para-isomer.\n    *   **C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene, 5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is also an activating, ortho, para-directing group. It is sterically bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions leads to a higher yield of the para-isomer compared to toluene. For bromination, the para-isomer constitutes about 93% of the ortho-para product mixture.\n\n    Ordering the ortho, para-directors by increasing para-yield: The -C₂H₅ group is significantly bulkier than the -CH₃ group, leading to a higher para/ortho ratio for ethylbenzene than for toluene. The -Cl group, while also favoring the para position, results in a very high para yield, often the highest among these three common substituents due to a combination of electronic and steric factors. Thus, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\n**Overall Ordering**\n\nCombining the two groups, we first list the meta-directors in order of increasing (but still very low) para-yield, followed by the ortho, para-directors in order of increasing para-yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (lowest para-yield):** 4 < 2 < 6\n*   **Ortho, para-directors (highest para-yield):** 1 < 5 < 3\n\nThe complete sequence in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 2 < 6 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic substitution reaction with bromine, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### **Analysis of Substituents**\n\nThe six substances and their substituents are:\n1.  **C6H5-CH3** (Toluene): `-CH3` (methyl) is an activating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5** (Ethyl benzoate): `-COOC2H5` (carboethoxy) is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl** (Chlorobenzene): `-Cl` (chloro) is a deactivating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n4.  **C6H5-NO2** (Nitrobenzene): `-NO2` (nitro) is a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5** (Ethylbenzene): `-C2H5` (ethyl) is an activating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH** (Benzoic acid): `-COOH` (carboxyl) is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n\n### **Categorizing by Directing Effect**\n\nThe yield of the para-isomer is primarily determined by whether the substituent is meta-directing or ortho-, para-directing.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors**: These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the meta position. The formation of the para-isomer is heavily disfavored and occurs in very small amounts.\n    *   `-NO2` (4)\n    *   `-COOC2H5` (2)\n    *   `-COOH` (6)\n\n*   **Ortho-, Para-Directors**: These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. Significant amounts of the para-isomer will be formed.\n    *   `-CH3` (1)\n    *   `-C2H5` (5)\n    *   `-Cl` (3)\n\n### **Ranking the Substances**\n\n**1. Meta-Directors (Lowest para-isomer yield)**\n\nThese three substances will have the lowest yield of the para-isomer. The order among them depends on their deactivating strength and any minor electronic or steric factors influencing the small amount of para-product.\n*   The `-NO2` group is one of the strongest deactivating groups. During its bromination, the para-isomer yield is extremely low, often less than 1%.\n*   The `-COOH` and `-COOC2H5` groups are also deactivating and meta-directing. For the nitration of ethyl benzoate, the para-isomer is about 5%. For benzoic acid, the para-isomer yield is also very low, typically around 1-2%. Comparing the deactivating strength, the order is generally `-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5`. Stronger deactivation leads to a more pronounced meta-direction and thus a lower fraction of para-product.\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-yield for the meta-directors is:\n**4 (`-NO2`) < 2 (`-COOC2H5`) < 6 (`-COOH`)**\n*(Note: Some sources might show slight variations, but they will consistently be the lowest).*\n\n**2. Ortho-, Para-Directors (Highest para-isomer yield)**\n\nFor these substances, the ratio of para to ortho product determines their order. This is mainly influenced by steric hindrance: a bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer.\n*   **-CH3 (1, Toluene) vs. -C2H5 (5, Ethylbenzene)**: The ethyl group is sterically bulkier than the methyl group. This increased bulk hinders the attack at the ortho positions, resulting in a higher yield of the para-isomer for ethylbenzene compared to toluene. For example, during bromination, toluene yields about 67% para-isomer, while ethylbenzene will yield more due to greater steric hindrance.\n*   **-Cl (3, Chlorobenzene)**: The chloro group is ortho-, para-directing. Due to its high electronegativity (inductive effect) and its ability to donate a lone pair of electrons (resonance effect), it strongly favors the para position. The bromination of chlorobenzene yields a very high proportion of the para-isomer, around 87-89%.\n\nComparing the three ortho-, para-directors:\n*   Toluene (**1**) has the smallest alkyl group and thus the lowest para/ortho ratio among the alkylbenzenes.\n*   Ethylbenzene (**5**) has a larger alkyl group, leading to a higher para/ortho ratio than toluene.\n*   Chlorobenzene (**3**) yields a very high percentage of the para-isomer, higher than both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n\nThus, the order of increasing para-yield for the ortho-, para-directors is:\n**1 (`-CH3`) < 5 (`-C2H5`) < 3 (`-Cl`)**\n\n### **Final Combined Order**\n\nCombining the two groups, we get the final sequence for increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n\n**4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**\n\nWait, re-evaluating the order based on literature values.\n\n*   (4) Nitrobenzene: < 1% para\n*   (2) Ethyl Benzoate: ~5% para (from nitration data, as a proxy)\n*   (6) Benzoic Acid: ~1-2% para\n*   (1) Toluene: ~67% para\n*   (5) Ethylbenzene: >67% para (higher than toluene due to sterics)\n*   (3) Chlorobenzene: ~87% para\n\nLet's refine the order based on these values:\n1.  **Nitrobenzene (4)**: ~1%\n2.  **Benzoic Acid (6)**: ~1-2%\n3.  **Ethyl Benzoate (2)**: ~5%\n4.  **Toluene (1)**: ~67%\n5.  **Ethylbenzene (5)**: >67%\n6.  **Chlorobenzene (3)**: ~87%\n\nThis gives the order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nLet's recheck the options provided. The order derived (4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3) matches option A.\n\nFinal check of the reasoning.\n- Meta directors (4, 6, 2) have the lowest para yield. The order among them is based on the degree of deactivation and meta-direction. NO2 is the strongest meta-director, giving the least para. Between COOH and COOC2H5, the difference is small, but the order 4 < 6 < 2 seems plausible.\n- Ortho-para directors (1, 5, 3) have high para yields. The order among them is based on steric and electronic effects. The para/ortho ratio increases with the steric bulk of the alkyl group, so 1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5). Halogens like Cl give a particularly high percentage of the para product, often higher than alkylbenzenes. So, 1 < 5 < 3 is correct.\n- Combining them, the lowest yields are from the meta directors, and the highest are from the o,p directors.\n\nTherefore, the complete sequence is 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nTo determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in the electrophilic bromination of the given substances, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent on the benzene ring. The yield of the para-isomer is influenced by whether the substituent is an ortho-, para-director or a meta-director, and by the substituent's size.\n\n**Analysis of Substituents:**\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents into two main groups:\n1.  **Ortho-, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (bromine) to the positions ortho and para to themselves. All activating groups and halogens fall into this category.\n    *   1) **-CH3 (methyl):** Activating, ortho-, para-director.\n    *   3) **-Cl (chloro):** Deactivating, but ortho-, para-director.\n    *   5) **-C2H5 (ethyl):** Activating, ortho-, para-director.\n\n2.  **Meta-Directing Groups:** These are deactivating groups that direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. Consequently, the yield of the para-isomer is very low.\n    *   2) **-COOC2H5 (ethoxycarbonyl):** Deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   4) **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   6) **-COOH (carboxyl):** Deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**Ranking the Substances:**\n\n**1. Meta-Directors (Lowest para-yield):**\nFor meta-directing groups, the yield of ortho and para products is inherently very small. The order among them depends on the strength of their deactivating and meta-directing effect.\n*   **4) C6H5-NO2:** The nitro group is one of the strongest deactivating, meta-directing groups. The bromination reaction is very slow and produces almost exclusively the meta-isomer, with only trace amounts of the para-isomer (typically <1%).\n*   **6) C6H5-COOH:** The carboxylic acid group is also a strong deactivator and meta-director. Its deactivating effect is slightly less than the nitro group, leading to a marginally higher, yet still very low, yield of the para-isomer compared to nitrobenzene.\n*   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5:** The ethyl ester group is a deactivator and meta-director, comparable in strength to the carboxylic acid group. Some sources indicate that for nitration, it yields a slightly higher percentage of the para-isomer (~5-8%) compared to other strong deactivators.\n\nBased on the strength of the deactivating effect, the order of increasing para-yield for these three is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**2. Ortho-, Para-Directors (Highest para-yield):**\nFor these groups, both ortho and para products are formed. The ratio between them (and thus the percentage of para-isomer) is primarily determined by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will sterically hinder the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para-product.\n*   **1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The methyl group is relatively small. Bromination of toluene yields a significant amount of both ortho and para products. A typical distribution for bromination is about 33% ortho and 66% para.\n*   **5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance disfavors substitution at the ortho position, resulting in a higher yield of the para-isomer compared to toluene. The para-isomer is strongly favored.\n*   **3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** Halogens are ortho-, para-directors but are deactivating overall. The chlorine atom's steric hindrance is significant, and its electronic effects also favor para substitution. Data for nitration shows chlorobenzene gives about 64-70% para product, which is higher than for toluene's nitration. For bromination, the para-selectivity is even higher, often around 87-89%.\n\nComparing the typical para yields for the ortho-, para-directors:\n*   Toluene (-CH3): ~66% para\n*   Chlorobenzene (-Cl): ~87% para\n*   Ethylbenzene (-C2H5): >90% para (higher than toluene due to sterics)\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-yield for this group is: **1 < 3 < 5**.\n\n**Final Combined Order:**\n\nCombining the two groups, the overall order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield is:\n-NO2 (4) < -COOH (6) < -COOC2H5 (2) < -CH3 (1) < -Cl (3) < -C2H5 (5)\n\nThis corresponds to the order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**.\n\nLet's re-examine the options and the established order. My derived order does not match any of the provided options exactly. Let me re-evaluate the relative positions of -CH3 (1), -C2H5 (5), and -Cl (3).\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** C2H5 > CH3. So, para yield for 5 > 1. This is consistent.\n*   **-Cl vs Alkyl groups:** Comparing -Cl with alkyl groups is nuanced. Data for nitration often shows: Toluene (37% para), Chlorobenzene (70% para). This suggests para yield for 3 > 1.\n*   **-Cl vs -C2H5:** This is the most critical comparison. Steric bulk of ethyl is generally considered greater than chloro, which would suggest para yield for 5 > 3.\n\nLet's reconsider my order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**.\nLet's check the options again.\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nB) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nOption C is **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**. This is very close to my derived order, only differing in the placement of 5 (ethyl) and 3 (chloro). Option C suggests para yield for ethylbenzene is less than for chlorobenzene.\nLet's check literature values again specifically for bromination:\n*   Bromination of Toluene (1): ~66% para.\n*   Bromination of Chlorobenzene (3): ~87% para.\n*   Bromination of Ethylbenzene (5): ~94% para (one source claims this), another suggests it should be simply \"more than toluene\".\n\nIf we strictly follow the steric hindrance argument, the order of bulk is -C2H5 > -CH3. The position of -Cl is complex. If the data holds that Chlorobenzene gives ~87% para and Ethylbenzene gives more than Toluene (66%) but potentially less than Chlorobenzene, then option C might be correct. However, most sources point to increasing steric hindrance of the alkyl chain leading to progressively higher para-selectivity (Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Isopropylbenzene). This would make the order 1 < 3 < 5 or 1 < 5 < 3 depending on where Cl fits.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the meta-directors in option C: 4 < 6 < 2. This part is consistent with our analysis.\nLet's re-evaluate the ortho-para directors in option C: 1 < 5 < 3.\nThis means: Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\nPara %: ~66% < (more than 66%) < ~87%. This is plausible. It suggests that the para-directing effect of chlorine (combination of electronic and steric factors) results in a higher para yield than the purely steric argument for the ethyl group relative to the methyl group.\n\nLet's consider another possibility. Is it possible that the order is 4 < 2 < 6? This would mean Benzoic Acid (-COOH) gives more para-isomer than Ethyl Benzoate (-COOC2H5). This is unlikely, as the bulkier ester group might slightly favor para over ortho compared to the COOH group, even in the trace amounts formed. So the 4 < 6 < 2 order is the most chemically sound for the meta-directors.\n\nGiven the options, C: **4<6<2<1<5<3** seems the most plausible, although the relative order of ethylbenzene (5) and chlorobenzene (3) can be debated. However, the order among the meta-directors (4<6<2) and the fact that toluene (1) has the lowest para-yield among the o,p-directors is firm. The high para-selectivity of halogens is also a well-established fact. The question then hinges on whether ethylbenzene's para-yield surpasses that of chlorobenzene. Without definitive, directly comparable experimental data for bromination under identical conditions, and given the multiple-choice format, we must choose the best fit. Option C aligns well with the majority of the chemical principles.\n\nFinal Check:\n*   Lowest para yield: -NO2 (4). Correct.\n*   Order of meta-directors: -NO2 (4) < -COOH (6) < -COOC2H5 (2). Correct.\n*   Lowest yield among o,p directors: -CH3 (1). Correct.\n*   Order of highest yields: The question is between (1 < 5 < 3) and (1 < 3 < 5). Both are plausible depending on exact conditions. Option C presents 1 < 5 < 3. This means Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene. This is a reasonable ranking.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### Step 1: Classify the substituents\nFirst, we need to classify the substituent on each benzene ring (C6H5-) as either *ortho, para*-directing or *meta*-directing. This classification determines the primary positions of substitution.\n\n*   **Activating groups** are *ortho, para*-directing.\n*   **Deactivating groups** are *meta*-directing (with the exception of halogens).\n*   **Halogens** are deactivating but *ortho, para*-directing.\n\nLet's classify the substituents for substances 1-6:\n1.  **-CH3 (in Toluene)**: An alkyl group. It is **activating** and ***ortho, para*-directing**.\n2.  **-COOC2H5 (in Ethyl benzoate)**: An ester group. The carbonyl (C=O) makes it electron-withdrawing. It is **deactivating** and ***meta*-directing**.\n3.  **-Cl (in Chlorobenzene)**: A halogen. It is **deactivating** but ***ortho, para*-directing**.\n4.  **-NO2 (in Nitrobenzene)**: A nitro group. It is strongly electron-withdrawing. It is a **strong deactivator** and ***meta*-directing**.\n5.  **-C2H5 (in Ethylbenzene)**: An alkyl group. It is **activating** and ***ortho, para*-directing**.\n6.  **-COOH (in Benzoic acid)**: A carboxylic acid group. The carbonyl (C=O) makes it electron-withdrawing. It is **deactivating** and ***meta*-directing**.\n\nSo we have two groups of substances:\n*   **Meta-directors**: 4 (-NO2), 2 (-COOC2H5), 6 (-COOH)\n*   **Ortho, para-directors**: 1 (-CH3), 5 (-C2H5), 3 (-Cl)\n\n### Step 2: Order the substances within each group\n\n**A. Meta-directors (4, 2, 6)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the main product is the meta-isomer. The yield of the ortho and para isomers is very low. We need to arrange them in order of increasing para-isomer yield. A stronger deactivating and meta-directing group will lead to a higher proportion of the meta product and consequently a lower proportion of the para product.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength (and thus meta-directing strength) for these groups is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n\n*   **-NO2 (4)** is the strongest deactivator, so it will give the lowest yield of the para-isomer (typically <1%).\n*   **-COOH (6)** is a strong deactivator, stronger than the ester group. It will give a very low yield of the para-isomer (typically 1-2%).\n*   **-COOC2H5 (2)** is also a strong deactivator, but generally considered slightly weaker than -COOH. It will give a low, but slightly higher, yield of the para-isomer compared to -COOH (typically ~5%).\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for the meta-directors is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**B. Ortho, para-directors (1, 3, 5)**\n\nFor ortho, para-directors, the substitution occurs primarily at the ortho and para positions. The ratio of para to ortho product (p/o ratio) determines the percentage yield of the para-isomer. The p/o ratio is influenced by:\n*   **Steric Hindrance**: Larger substituents will block the ortho positions, leading to a higher yield of the para product. The size of the incoming electrophile (bromine) is also significant.\n*   **Electronic Effects**: For halogens like -Cl, the strong deactivating inductive effect is felt more at the ortho position than the para position, which also increases the p/o ratio.\n\nLet's compare the three groups:\n*   **-CH3 (1, Toluene)**: This is a relatively small group. It gives a significant amount of both ortho and para products. For bromination, the para-isomer yield is typically around 67%.\n*   **-C2H5 (5, Ethylbenzene)**: This group is bulkier than -CH3. The increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions leads to a higher proportion of the para product compared to toluene.\n*   **-Cl (3, Chlorobenzene)**: This group's size is comparable to a methyl group, but its electronic properties are different. The deactivating inductive effect of chlorine disfavors the ortho positions more than the para position, leading to a high p/o ratio.\n\nComparing the para-yields is complex and can depend on reaction conditions. However, a common trend observed for nitration (a similar electrophilic substitution) is that the electronic effect in chlorobenzene leads to a very high para percentage, while the steric effect of the ethyl group also increases the para percentage relative to toluene. The established order of para-isomer yield for nitration is: Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene. While bromination involves a larger electrophile (making sterics more important), this established chemical trend is likely what the question is based on.\n\nIf we assume this order, we get: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### Step 3: Combine the groups\n\nThe para-isomer yield for any *meta*-director will be significantly lower than for any *ortho, para*-director. So, we place the ordered list of meta-directors before the ordered list of ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Meta-director order: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Ortho, para-director order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nCombining these gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Reaction and the Goal**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a series of monosubstituted benzene rings. The goal is to arrange the starting substances in order of *increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer*. The yield of the para-isomer depends on two main factors:\n1.  The directing effect of the substituent (ortho/para vs. meta).\n2.  The steric and electronic properties of the substituent, which influence the ortho-to-para ratio for ortho/para directors.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\n\nFirst, we classify each substituent based on its directing effect.\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups**: These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer yield will be significant.\n    *   1) -CH3 (Toluene): Activating, ortho/para-directing.\n    *   5) -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene): Activating, ortho/para-directing.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating, but ortho/para-directing.\n*   **Meta-directing groups**: These groups direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. The yield of the para-isomer will be very low.\n    *   4) -NO2 (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid): Deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating, meta-directing.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Groups**\n\nFor meta-directors, the ortho and para positions are strongly deactivated. Therefore, they will produce the smallest amount of the para-isomer. The amount of para-product formed is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group; the more deactivating the group, the lower the yield of the para-isomer.\n\nLet's rank the deactivating strength of these meta-directing groups:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n(Nitro is one of the strongest deactivators, followed by carboxylic acid, and then the ester group).\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for these substances is:\nNitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n\nThis establishes the beginning of our sequence: **4 < 6 < 2 ...**\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Groups**\n\nThese substances will produce a much higher yield of the para-isomer compared to the meta-directors. To order them, we need to compare their para-selectivity (the ratio of para to ortho product).\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The primary difference affecting the ortho/para ratio is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk sterically hinders attack at the two adjacent ortho positions, thus favoring attack at the more accessible para position. Therefore, ethylbenzene is expected to give a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   Order: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5).\n\n*   **Comparing alkyl groups with -Cl (3):** Halogens like chlorine (-Cl) are a special case. While they are deactivating overall due to their strong inductive electron withdrawal (-I effect), they are ortho/para-directing due to resonance electron donation (+M effect). A well-known characteristic of halogen substituents in electrophilic substitution is that they show very high selectivity for the para position, partly due to sterics and electronic factors. Experimental data confirms this; for example, the bromination of chlorobenzene yields about 87% para-isomer, which is significantly higher than for toluene (around 67%).\n    *   Order: Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\nCombining the order for the ortho/para directors, we get:\nToluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\nThis establishes the end of our sequence: **... 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the two groups**\n\nWe combine the sequence for the meta-directors and the ortho/para-directors. The para yield for any ortho/para-director will be substantially higher than for any meta-director.\n\n*   Meta-directors order: 4 < 6 < 2\n*   Ortho/para-directors order: 1 < 5 < 3\n\nThe complete sequence in order of increasing yield of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**Step 6: Match with the given options**\n\nLet's compare our derived sequence with the choices provided:\nA) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nB) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nOur derived sequence, 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3, perfectly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents based on their directing effects.**\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, the substituent already on the benzene ring determines where the new group will be added. We can classify them into two main categories:\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (bromine) to the positions ortho and para to themselves. They typically have lone pairs on the atom attached to the ring or are alkyl groups.\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the positions meta to themselves. They typically have a partial or full positive charge on the atom attached to the ring.\n\nLet's classify each substance:\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** -CH3 is an alkyl group. It is an **ortho, para-director**.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** -COOC2H5 is an ester group. The carbonyl carbon has a partial positive charge, making it electron-withdrawing. It is a **meta-director**.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl is a halogen. It is an **ortho, para-director**.\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** -NO2 is a strongly electron-withdrawing group. It is a **meta-director**.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** -C2H5 is an alkyl group. It is an **ortho, para-director**.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** -COOH is a carboxylic acid group. The carbonyl carbon has a partial positive charge. It is a **meta-director**.\n\n**Step 2: Separate the substances into two groups.**\nBased on the directing effects, we can form two groups. The meta-directors will have a very low yield of the para-isomer, while the ortho, para-directors will have a significantly higher yield.\n*   **Low Para Yield Group (Meta-directors):**\n    *   4) Nitrobenzene (C6H5-NO2)\n    *   6) Benzoic acid (C6H5-COOH)\n    *   2) Ethyl benzoate (C6H5-COOC2H5)\n*   **High Para Yield Group (Ortho, para-directors):**\n    *   1) Toluene (C6H5-CH3)\n    *   5) Ethylbenzene (C6H5-C2H5)\n    *   3) Chlorobenzene (C6H5-Cl)\n\nThe final correct sequence must have the meta-directors first, followed by the ortho, para-directors.\n\n**Step 3: Order the meta-directing substances.**\nFor meta-directors, the para-isomer is a minor product. The yield of this minor product is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para isomer. The established order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n(Nitro > Carboxylic Acid > Ester)\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse:\nYield(para-NO2) < Yield(para-COOH) < Yield(para-COOC2H5)\nThis corresponds to the substance order: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the ortho, para-directing substances.**\nFor this group, the para-isomer is a major product. The ratio of para to ortho product depends mainly on steric hindrance and electronic factors.\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) vs. -C2H5 (5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size blocks the adjacent ortho positions, making the less hindered para position a more likely site for substitution. Therefore, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. This gives us the order: **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1, 5) vs. -Cl (3):** The chloro group, while deactivating overall, is known to be highly para-selective. This is because its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more strongly than the distant para position. This electronic factor typically results in a higher para/ortho ratio for halogens compared to alkyl groups. Thus, chlorobenzene will produce the highest percentage of para-isomer in this group. This gives us the order: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the orders into the final answer.**\nBy combining the results from Steps 3 and 4, we place the ordered meta-directing group before the ordered ortho, para-directing group.\n\n*   Meta-directors order: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Ortho, para-directors order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe complete sequence for increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning for the arrangement:\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents.**\nSubstituents on a benzene ring determine the position of incoming electrophiles. They are classified as either ortho, para-directing or meta-directing.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br+) to the positions ortho and para to themselves.\n    *   -CH3 (Toluene, 1): Activating group\n    *   -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene, 5): Activating group\n    *   -Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3): Deactivating group, but directs ortho/para\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They will have a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   -NO2 (Nitrobenzene, 4): Strongly deactivating group\n    *   -COOH (Benzoic acid, 6): Deactivating group\n    *   -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate, 2): Deactivating group\n\n**Step 2: Order the substances with meta-directing groups.**\nMeta-directing groups result in the lowest yields of para-isomers. The yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group will more strongly direct to the meta position, leaving an even smaller percentage for the para position.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing yield of the para-isomer is the reverse of this:\nC6H5-NO2 < C6H5-COOH < C6H5-COOC2H5\nThis corresponds to the substance numbers: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the substances with ortho, para-directing groups.**\nThese groups will have the highest yields of the para-isomer. The ratio of para to ortho product is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions. As a result, substitution at the less hindered para position is favored more in ethylbenzene than in toluene.\n    *   Therefore, the para-isomer yield is higher for ethylbenzene. Order: **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing -Cl (3) with the alkyl groups:** The chlorine atom is an ortho, para-director due to the resonance effect of its lone pairs. However, it has a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect), which is most pronounced at the ortho positions. This deactivates the ortho positions more than the para position, leading to a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is significantly higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para yield is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the two groups.**\nThe substances with meta-directing groups will have lower para-isomer yields than those with ortho, para-directing groups. Combining the two ordered sets gives the final sequence.\n\n(Lowest para yield) **4 < 6 < 2** < **1 < 5 < 3** (Highest para yield)\n\nThis complete order matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield from electrophilic bromination, we must first classify the substituents on the benzene ring and then analyze their directing effects and the steric hindrance they impose.\n\n### **Step 1: Classify the Substituents**\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents as either ortho-, para-directing or meta-directing. This determines where the bromine atom is most likely to substitute.\n\n*   **Ortho-, para-directing groups:** These groups activate or weakly deactivate the ring and direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho (positions 2 and 6) and para (position 4) positions.\n    *   **-CH3 (in Toluene, 1):** Activating, ortho-, para-directing.\n    *   **-C2H5 (in Ethylbenzene, 5):** Activating, ortho-, para-directing.\n    *   **-Cl (in Chlorobenzene, 3):** Deactivating, but ortho-, para-directing.\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups deactivate the ring and direct incoming electrophiles to the meta (positions 3 and 5) positions.\n    *   **-NO2 (in Nitrobenzene, 4):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   **-COOH (in Benzoic acid, 6):** Deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   **-COOC2H5 (in Ethyl benzoate, 2):** Deactivating, meta-directing.\n\n### **Step 2: Compare Para-Isomer Yields Within Each Group**\n\n**Meta-Directing Substances (Lowest Para Yield)**\n\nSubstances with meta-directing groups will produce very low yields of the para-isomer. Bromination of these compounds predominantly yields the meta-product. The small amount of para-isomer formed is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent.\n\n*   **Nitrobenzene (4, -NO2):** The nitro group is one of the strongest deactivating groups. Bromination yields almost exclusively the meta-isomer, with only trace amounts of the para-isomer (around 1% or less).\n*   **Benzoic acid (6, -COOH) and Ethyl benzoate (2, -COOC2H5):** These are also strong deactivators, though generally less so than the nitro group. They will produce slightly more para-isomer than nitrobenzene but still in very small quantities. For similar reactions like nitration, ethyl benzoate yields around 5% para-isomer. Comparing -COOH and -COOC2H5, they have similar deactivating strengths, but the trend generally places -COOH as slightly more deactivating than -COOR.\n\nThus, for the meta-directors, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is:\n**Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**\n\n**Ortho-, Para-Directing Substances (Highest Para Yield)**\n\nSubstances with ortho-, para-directing groups will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer. The ratio of the para to ortho isomer is primarily governed by two factors: electronics and sterics.\n\n*   **-Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3):** Halogens are a unique case. While they are deactivating overall due to their strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I), they direct ortho-para because of their electron-donating resonance effect (+R). The inductive effect deactivates the adjacent ortho positions more strongly than the more distant para position. This leads to a strong preference for para substitution. For instance, nitration of chlorobenzene gives about 70% para product. For bromination, the para-isomer is also heavily favored, often around 89%.\n*   **-CH3 (Toluene, 1) and -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene, 5):** Alkyl groups are activating and direct ortho-para. The key factor determining the ortho/para ratio between them is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size makes it more difficult for the incoming electrophile (the bulky bromine) to attack the ortho positions, thus favoring the less hindered para position to a greater extent. Therefore, ethylbenzene will have a higher para/ortho ratio than toluene.\n    *   The bromination of toluene yields about 67% para-isomer.\n    *   The bromination of ethylbenzene is expected to yield an even higher percentage of the para-isomer due to increased steric hindrance at the ortho position.\n\nSo, for the ortho-, para-directors, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is:\n**Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**\n\n### **Step 3: Combine the Rankings**\n\nBy combining the two groups, we establish the final order from the lowest percentage of para-isomer to the highest:\n\n**4 (-NO2) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC2H5) < 1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl)**\n\nThis sequence matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nTo arrange the given substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we must consider the directing effects and steric properties of each substituent on the benzene ring. The yield of the para-isomer is influenced by whether the substituent is ortho-, para-directing or meta-directing, and by the steric hindrance around the ortho positions.\n\n### Analysis of Substituents:\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents into two main categories:\n*   **Ortho-, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the positions ortho (adjacent) and para (opposite) to themselves. All activating groups and halogens fall into this category.\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta positions. Deactivating groups (except for halogens) are meta-directors.\n\nThe substances are:\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** -CH3 is an activating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** -COOC2H5 is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl is a deactivating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** -NO2 is a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** -C2H5 is an activating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** -COOH is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n\n### Ranking the Substances:\n\nThe substances with meta-directing groups will produce very low yields of the para-isomer, while those with ortho-, para-directing groups will produce significantly higher yields.\n\n**1. Meta-Directors (lowest para-yield):**\nFor substances 4, 6, and 2, the primary product is the meta-isomer. The para-isomer is formed in very small quantities.\n*   **4) C6H5-NO2:** The -NO2 group is a powerful deactivator. During nitration (a similar electrophilic substitution), it yields only a trace (0-5%) of the para-isomer. Bromination is expected to be similar, yielding predominantly the meta-isomer.\n*   **6) C6H5-COOH:** The -COOH group is also a meta-director. Its deactivating effect leads to low yields of ortho and para products.\n*   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5:** The -COOC2H5 group is a meta-director, similar to -COOH. Data for the nitration of ethyl benzoate shows it yields predominantly the meta-isomer (73%), with about 5% being the para-isomer.\n\nComparing these three, the order of deactivating strength is generally -NO2 > -COOH ≈ -COOR. This correlates with the very low amounts of para-product. Based on available data for similar reactions, the para-isomer yield increases in the order: Nitrobenzene < Benzoic Acid < Ethyl Benzoate.\n*   **Order of increasing para-yield for meta-directors: 4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**2. Ortho-, Para-Directors (highest para-yield):**\nFor substances 1, 5, and 3, the major products are the ortho- and para-isomers. The ratio between para and ortho products is largely determined by steric hindrance; bulkier groups hinder attack at the ortho position, thus favoring the para position.\n*   **1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The -CH3 group is relatively small. Bromination gives a substantial amount of both ortho and para products, with the para-isomer being favored. For example, sulfonation of toluene yields about 60-65% para-isomer. Nitration gives about 37% para-isomer. For bromination, the para-isomer is the major product over the ortho-isomer.\n*   **5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The -C2H5 group is bulkier than the -CH3 group. This increased steric hindrance further disfavors ortho-substitution, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer compared to toluene.\n*   **3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The -Cl atom, while deactivating overall, is an ortho-, para-director. Halogens often lead to a high percentage of the para-isomer. For example, the nitration of chlorobenzene yields 70% of the para-product. This high para-selectivity is due to a combination of steric effects and the strong inductive electron withdrawal that deactivates the ortho position more than the para position.\n\nComparing these three, the steric bulk increases from -CH3 to -C2H5, so the para-yield of ethylbenzene (5) is greater than that of toluene (1). Chlorobenzene (3) is known to give a very high proportion of the para-isomer in electrophilic substitutions.\n*   **Order of increasing para-yield for ortho-, para-directors: 1 < 5 < 3**\n\n### Final Order:\n\nCombining the two groups, the overall order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is obtained by placing the meta-directors before the ortho-, para-directors.\n\nFinal sequence: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nTo determine the order of substances by the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction, we must analyze the directing effects of each substituent on the benzene ring. The reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution, where a bromine atom replaces a hydrogen atom on the ring. The substituent already present on the ring dictates the position (ortho, meta, or para) where the new bromine atom will attach.\n\nThe six substances are:\n1.  **С6H5-CH3** (Toluene)\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5** (Ethyl benzoate)\n3.  **C6H5-Cl** (Chlorobenzene)\n4.  **C6H5-NO2** (Nitrobenzene)\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5** (Ethylbenzene)\n6.  **C6H5-COOH** (Benzoic acid)\n\nThese substituents can be classified into two main groups based on their directing effects:\n\n**1. Meta-directing groups:** These groups are deactivating, meaning they make the benzene ring less reactive towards electrophilic substitution. They direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position, resulting in very low yields of the ortho and para isomers. The stronger the deactivating effect, the lower the yield of the para-isomer.\n*   **-NO2 (4)**: This is a very strong deactivating group. Bromination of nitrobenzene yields almost exclusively the meta-isomer, with the para-isomer yield being extremely low, typically around 1%.\n*   **-COOH (6)**: This is a deactivating group, directing incoming substituents to the meta position. Its para-isomer yield is very small.\n*   **-COOC2H5 (2)**: Similar to the carboxylic acid group, the ethyl ester group is also a deactivating, meta-director. The para-isomer yield is minimal, though typically slightly higher than for nitrobenzene. For nitration, which follows similar principles, ethyl benzoate yields about 5% para product.\n\nAmong these three, the nitro group is the strongest deactivator, leading to the lowest para yield. The carboxylic acid and ethyl ester groups are also strong deactivators. Based on typical isomer distributions, the order of increasing para-yield for these meta-directors is: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n\n**2. Ortho, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. For these substances, the para-isomer is a significant product. The ratio of para to ortho product is largely influenced by steric hindrance; bulkier groups hinder substitution at the adjacent ortho positions, thus increasing the proportion of the para-isomer.\n*   **-CH3 (1)**: The methyl group is an activating, ortho, para-director. In bromination, toluene yields a significant amount of para-isomer, typically around 62-67%.\n*   **-C2H5 (5)**: The ethyl group is also an activating, ortho, para-director. It is sterically bulkier than the methyl group. This increased bulk hinders the ortho positions more, leading to a higher yield of the para-isomer compared to toluene. The para product can be as high as 94%.\n*   **-Cl (3)**: The chloro group is deactivating overall but is an ortho, para-director. Due to electronic factors and its size, it directs a very high proportion of the product to the para position, typically around 89% in bromination.\n\nComparing these three, toluene (1) has the lowest para yield. Comparing chlorobenzene (3) and ethylbenzene (5), literature data suggests that the larger steric bulk of the ethyl group leads to a slightly higher para-selectivity (around 94%) than the chloro group (around 89%). Thus, the order of increasing para yield is: Toluene (1) < Chlorobenzene (3) < Ethylbenzene (5).\n\n**Combined Ranking:**\n\nBy combining the two groups, we can establish the overall order from the lowest para-isomer yield to the highest:\n\n{Meta-directors} < {Ortho, para-directors}\n\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 3 < 5)\n\nThis gives the final sequence: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**.\n\nUpon reviewing the provided options, this exact sequence is not available. However, option C is the closest match, differing only in the final two positions.\n\nMy analysis: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**\nOption C:      **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe discrepancy lies in the relative para-isomer yield of chlorobenzene (3) versus ethylbenzene (5). While most data suggest ethylbenzene gives a slightly higher para yield due to sterics, the values are close (89% vs 94%), and slight variations in reaction conditions could potentially alter this order. Given the options, Option C correctly identifies the meta-directors as having the lowest para yields in the order 4 < 6 < 2, and correctly identifies toluene (1) as having the lowest para yield among the o,p-directors. The distinction between chlorobenzene and ethylbenzene is the most subtle point. Considering the provided choices, option C is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order:\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction and Substituent Effects**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination). The substituent already on the benzene ring (C₆H₅-X) determines two things:\n*   **Reactivity:** Activating groups increase the reaction rate, while deactivating groups decrease it.\n*   **Directing Effect (Regioselectivity):** Substituents direct the incoming electrophile (Br⁺) to specific positions.\n    *   **Ortho/Para Directors:** These direct the electrophile to the positions ortho (adjacent) and para (opposite) to the substituent. This group includes activators (like alkyl groups) and weak deactivators (halogens).\n    *   **Meta Directors:** These direct the electrophile to the meta position. This group includes moderate and strong deactivators.\n\nThe question asks to arrange the substances in order of *increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer*.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\n\nFirst, let's classify the six substituents based on their directing effects.\n\n*   **Substances that will give a high yield of the para-isomer (Ortho/Para Directors):**\n    *   1) -CH₃ (Methyl): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   5) -C₂H₅ (Ethyl): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chloro): Deactivating, but o,p-director.\n\n*   **Substances that will give a very low yield of the para-isomer (Meta Directors):**\n    *   4) -NO₂ (Nitro): Strongly deactivating, m-director.\n    *   2) -COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl ester): Deactivating, m-director.\n    *   6) -COOH (Carboxylic acid): Deactivating, m-director.\n\nThis means that the three meta-directing substances (4, 2, 6) will have the lowest yields of the para-isomer and will come first in the ordered list. The three ortho/para-directing substances (1, 5, 3) will have the highest yields of the para-isomer and will come last.\n\n**3. Rank the Meta Directors (Lowest Para Yield)**\n\nFor the meta-directing groups (-NO₂, -COOC₂H₅, -COOH), the para-isomer is a very minor product. The absolute yield of any product (including the para-isomer) depends on the overall reactivity of the benzene ring. The more deactivated the ring, the lower the overall yield of products.\n\n*   We need to rank them by their deactivating strength. Stronger deactivation means lower reactivity and thus a lower yield of the para-isomer.\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid group because the ethyl group (+I effect) donates a small amount of electron density, which slightly counteracts the withdrawal effect.\n*   Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will increase in the reverse order of deactivating strength: **-NO₂ < -COOH < -COOC₂H₅**.\n*   In terms of substance numbers, the order is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**4. Rank the Ortho/Para Directors (Highest Para Yield)**\n\nFor the o,p-directing groups (-CH₃, -C₂H₅, -Cl), we are comparing the relative amounts of the para-isomer produced. This is determined by the ratio of para to ortho products, which is influenced by both steric and electronic effects.\n\n*   **-CH₃ vs. -C₂H₅ (Substances 1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased bulk hinders the approach of the electrophile to the ortho positions more significantly, leading to a higher proportion of the para product. Therefore, the para-isomer yield from ethylbenzene will be higher than from toluene. Order: **-CH₃ < -C₂H₅** (or **1 < 5**).\n*   **-Cl vs. the Alkyl Groups (Substance 3 vs. 1 & 5):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is small, but it has a powerful electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I). This -I effect deactivates the ortho position more strongly than the more distant para position. This electronic effect strongly favors substitution at the para position, leading to a very high para/ortho ratio. For many electrophilic substitutions, chlorobenzene gives a higher percentage of the para isomer than toluene and even ethylbenzene.\n*   Based on common experimental data (e.g., nitration is a good proxy), the typical percentage of the para product increases in the order: **-CH₃ < -C₂H₅ < -Cl**.\n*   In terms of substance numbers, the order is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**5. Combine the Rankings**\n\nNow we combine the two groups. The meta-directors have the lowest para yield, and the ortho/para directors have the highest.\n\n*   Order of m-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of o,p-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nCombining these gives the final order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence matches option C.\n\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nThe correct order is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a breakdown of the isomer distribution for the electrophilic bromination of the given substances to determine the increasing order of the weight fraction of the para-isomer yield. The weight fraction is equivalent to the molar percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n### 1. Classification of Substituents\n\n*   **-NO₂ (Nitro group in substance 4):** This is a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group. It significantly reduces the reactivity of the benzene ring and directs the incoming electrophile to the meta position. Consequently, the yield of the para-isomer is extremely low.\n*   **-COOH (Carboxyl group in substance 6):** This is a deactivating, meta-directing group. The yield of the para-isomer is very low, but generally slightly higher than for the nitro group.\n*   **-COOC₂H₅ (Ester group in substance 2):** This is also a deactivating, meta-directing group. Textbooks generally place its deactivating strength as slightly less than the carboxylic acid group. This would suggest a slightly higher para yield than for benzoic acid. However, some data for nitration reactions shows ethyl benzoate gives 5% para product, while other sources imply a very low yield for benzoic acid. There is some ambiguity in the relative order of these two.\n*   **-Cl (Chloro group in substance 3):** This is a deactivating, ortho-, para-directing group. The inductive effect deactivates the ring, but resonance directs incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. Halogens typically yield a high percentage of the para isomer. For example, nitration of chlorobenzene yields about 70% para-isomer.\n*   **-CH₃ (Methyl group in substance 1):** This is an activating, ortho-, para-directing group. Due to its relatively small size, it allows for a significant amount of ortho substitution. For bromination, the para isomer yield is typically around 67%.\n*   **-C₂H₅ (Ethyl group in substance 5):** This is an activating, ortho-, para-directing group. It is bulkier than the methyl group, which causes greater steric hindrance at the ortho positions. This leads to a higher proportion of the para-isomer compared to toluene. For bromination, the para-isomer yield is about 62%. However, some studies on bromination kinetics suggest that under certain conditions, ethylbenzene can be less para-selective than other alkylbenzenes.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Para-Isomer Yield\n\nThe order of increasing para-isomer yield can be established by considering the directing effects and steric hindrance.\n\n1.  **Meta-directing groups (-NO₂, -COOH, -COOC₂H₅):** These will produce the lowest yields of the para-isomer. The stronger the deactivating effect, the lower the proportion of ortho and para products. The order of deactivation is generally considered to be -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅. This means the para-isomer yield should increase in the order: NO₂ < COOH < COOC₂H₅. This corresponds to substance order: 4 < 6 < 2.\n\n2.  **Ortho-, para-directing groups (-Cl, -CH₃, -C₂H₅):** These produce significantly more para-isomer. The ratio of para to ortho product is largely determined by steric hindrance. A bulkier group will favor substitution at the less hindered para position.\n    *   The steric bulk increases in the order: -Cl < -CH₃ < -C₂H₅.\n    *   Therefore, the preference for the para position, and thus the yield of the para-isomer, should increase in this order: 3 (-Cl) < 1 (-CH₃) < 5 (-C₂H₅).\n\n### 3. Combining the Ranks\n\nCombining the two groups gives a predicted order. However, the provided options suggest a specific ordering that may reflect nuanced experimental realities not captured by simple rules. Let's analyze the most plausible option based on available data.\n\n*   **Lowest Yield:** Nitrobenzene (4) is the most deactivated and gives the least para product.\n*   **Next Lowest:** The other meta-directors, ethyl benzoate (2) and benzoic acid (6), will follow. While textbook deactivating trends suggest 4 < 6 < 2, some data for similar reactions (nitration) indicates ethyl benzoate (2) yields 5% para while benzoic acid's para yield is lower, around 1-2%. Let's re-evaluate based on the option C, which places (2) before (6), suggesting para-yield(2) < para-yield(6). This would imply -COOC₂H₅ is more strongly deactivating towards the para position than -COOH, which is contrary to general rules but could arise under specific reaction conditions.\n*   **Ortho, Para Directors:** The order among these is determined by a balance of electronic and steric effects. My steric argument suggested the order of increasing para yield as 3 < 1 < 5. This is consistent with option C. Let's look at the data again:\n    *   **Chlorobenzene (3):** Bromination gives a high para/ortho ratio, with some sources stating an o/p ratio of 0.1 to 1, meaning para is the major product, up to ~90%. However, other substitutions like nitration give ~70% para.\n    *   **Toluene (1):** Bromination yields are reported as 33% ortho and 67% para.\n    *   **Ethylbenzene (5):** Bromination data shows 38% ortho and 62% para.\n\nThis new data suggests the order of increasing para-yield for the o,p-directors is **5 (-C₂H₅, 62%) < 1 (-CH₃, 67%) < 3 (-Cl, ~70-90%)**. This contradicts my initial steric bulk argument and the order in option C.\n\nLet's re-examine Option C: `4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5`. This suggests the para yield order is: `NO₂ < COOC₂H₅ < COOH < Cl < CH₃ < C₂H₅`.\n*   The right side `Cl < CH₃ < C₂H₅` aligns with the steric hindrance argument.\n*   The left side `NO₂ < COOC₂H₅ < COOH` contradicts the standard deactivating order.\n\nThere appears to be conflicting information between simple textbook rules and specific experimental data, and even among different data sources. However, let's re-evaluate the premise. The key is the steric effect on the *o,p*-directors. The common understanding is that increasing steric bulk of the substituent increases the proportion of the para-isomer.\n*   Order of steric bulk: -Cl < -CH₃ < -C₂H₅\n*   This leads to increasing para yield: **3 < 1 < 5**\n\nNow for the *meta*-directors. The yield of the para-isomer is minimal. Stronger deactivation correlates with less ortho/para product.\n*   Order of deactivating strength: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅\n*   This leads to increasing para yield: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\nCombining these two established orders gives: **4 < 6 < 2 < 3 < 1 < 5**.\n\nLet's re-check the options. This sequence does not match any of the options perfectly. Let's look closely at option C again: **4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**. This option has the o,p-directors in the order I deduced from sterics (`3 < 1 < 5`). The only discrepancy with my reasoning is the relative order of (2) and (6). It is possible that under the specific reaction conditions, the ester group (-COOC₂H₅) leads to a lower para yield than the carboxylic acid group (-COOH), possibly due to complexation with the Lewis acid catalyst. Given that the order for the o,p-directors (`3 < 1 < 5`) is chemically sound based on sterics and aligns with option C, and the placement of the meta-directors (4, 2, 6) at the beginning is correct, option C appears to be the most plausible choice, despite the small ambiguity between substances 2 and 6.\n\nFinal arrangement based on this analysis:\n**4 (-NO₂) < 2 (-COOC₂H₅) < 6 (-COOH) < 3 (-Cl) < 1 (-CH₃) < 5 (-C₂H₅)**\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring and how they influence the product distribution in an electrophilic substitution reaction (bromination). The goal is to arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. The weight fraction is directly proportional to the molar percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Classify Substituents**: We will classify each substituent (-CH3, -COOC2H5, -Cl, -NO2, -C2H5, -COOH) as either ortho,para-directing or meta-directing.\n2.  **Estimate Para Yield**:\n    *   Substituents that are *meta*-directing will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer. We will rank them based on their deactivating strength; stronger deactivators are more selective for the *meta* position, resulting in even less para product.\n    *   Substituents that are *ortho,para*-directing will produce a significant yield of the para-isomer. We will rank them based on factors like steric hindrance and electronic effects, which determine the ratio of para to ortho product.\n3.  **Combine and Sort**: We will combine the two groups and create a final sorted list from lowest to highest para-isomer yield.\n4.  **Implement in Python**: A Python script will be used to store these properties, sort the substances according to the para-yield, and print the final ordered list to identify the correct option.\n\n**Step 1 & 2: Analysis of Substituents**\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Low Para Yield)**:\n    *   4) C6H5-NO2: The -NO2 group is a very strong deactivator and meta-director. It will have the lowest para yield (typically <1%).\n    *   6) C6H5-COOH: The -COOH group is a strong deactivator and meta-director. Para yield is very low, but slightly more than for -NO2.\n    *   2) C6H5-COOC2H5: The -COOC2H5 group is also a deactivator and meta-director, generally considered slightly less deactivating than -COOH. It will have a low para yield, but the highest among the meta-directors in this list.\n    *   Order of increasing para yield: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n*   **Ortho,Para-Directors (High Para Yield)**:\n    *   1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene): The -CH3 group is activating and o,p-directing. It produces a substantial amount of both ortho and para isomers. The para isomer is favored, with a typical yield of about 66%.\n    *   5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene): The -C2H5 group is also activating and o,p-directing. It is bulkier than -CH3, which increases steric hindrance at the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para product compared to toluene.\n    *   3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene): The -Cl atom is deactivating but o,p-directing. Due to the combination of chlorine's strong inductive effect (which deactivates the ortho position more than the para) and sterics, the para isomer is highly favored, with a yield of around 87%.\n    *   Order of increasing para yield: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**Step 3: Final Combined Order**\n\nCombining the two groups, we get the complete order of increasing para-isomer yield:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.

The goal is to arrange these compounds in order of the increasing weight fraction (percentage) of the para-isomer formed as the product.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\nSubstituents on a benzene ring determine the position of the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br+). We classify them as either *ortho, para-directing* or *meta-directing*.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups donate electron density to the ring (activating groups) or are halogens. They direct the incoming electrophile to the positions ortho and para to themselves. These will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring (deactivating groups). They direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. For these compounds, the para-isomer is formed in very small, often trace, amounts.\n\nLet's classify the substituent for each substance:\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The -CH3 (methyl) group is an alkyl group. It is an **activating, ortho, para-director**.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** The -COOC2H5 (ester) group is a carbonyl-containing group. It is a **deactivating, meta-director**.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The -Cl (chloro) group is a halogen. It is **deactivating but ortho, para-directing**.\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** The -NO2 (nitro) group is a very strong electron-withdrawing group. It is a **strongly deactivating, meta-director**.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The -C2H5 (ethyl) group is an alkyl group. It is an **activating, ortho, para-director**.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The -COOH (carboxyl) group is a carbonyl-containing group. It is a **deactivating, meta-director**.\n\n**Step 3: Separate into Two Groups**\nBased on the classification, we can separate the compounds into two groups: those that will produce very little para-isomer and those that will produce a lot.\n\n*   **Low Para Yield (meta-directors):** 2 (Ethyl benzoate), 4 (Nitrobenzene), 6 (Benzoic acid).\n*   **High Para Yield (ortho, para-directors):** 1 (Toluene), 3 (Chlorobenzene), 5 (Ethylbenzene).\n\nThis means the final sequence will have compounds 2, 4, and 6 at the beginning (lowest yield) and compounds 1, 3, and 5 at the end (highest yield).\n\n**Step 4: Order the Compounds with Low Para Yield (2, 4, 6)**\nFor meta-directors, the amount of the minor para-product formed is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group makes the ortho and para positions even more electron-poor, thus favoring the meta position more strongly and producing even less para-isomer.\nThe deactivating strength of these groups follows the order:\n-NO2 (strongest) > -COOH > -COOC2H5 (weakest of the three)\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order:\nYield for -NO2 < Yield for -COOH < Yield for -COOC2H5\nThis corresponds to the substance order: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**Step 5: Order the Compounds with High Para Yield (1, 3, 5)**\nFor ortho, para-directors, the yield of the para-isomer depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This ratio is influenced by electronic and steric factors.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The primary difference is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size makes it harder for the incoming bromine to attack the adjacent ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of substitution at the less crowded para position. Thus, the para yield for ethylbenzene is higher than for toluene.\n    *   Order: **1 < 5** (Typical para yields: Toluene ~62%, Ethylbenzene ~66%)\n\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chlorine atom is a halogen. While it directs ortho/para due to its lone pairs (resonance effect), it strongly withdraws electrons inductively (-I effect). This inductive effect is strongest at the nearby ortho positions, making them significantly more deactivated than the distant para position. This strong electronic preference for the para position results in a very high yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   Typical para yield for Chlorobenzene is ~89%.\n\n*   Combining these observations, the order of increasing para yield for this group is: Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\n    *   Substance order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**Step 6: Combine the Orders to Get the Final Answer**\nNow, we combine the two ordered subgroups. The compounds with low para yield come before the compounds with high para yield.\n\n(Order for low-yield group) < (Order for high-yield group)\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer during bromination, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of the substituent on each benzene ring.\n\nThe six substances are:\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** -CH3 is a weakly activating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** -COOC2H5 is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl is a deactivating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** -NO2 is a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** -C2H5 is a weakly activating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** -COOH is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n\n### Step 1: Separate into Ortho-, Para- and Meta-directing Groups\n\nFirst, we can separate the compounds into two categories: those that will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer (ortho-, para-directors) and those that will produce very little (meta-directors).\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These will have the lowest para-isomer yields. They primarily direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. This group includes Nitrobenzene (4), Ethyl benzoate (2), and Benzoic acid (6).\n*   **Ortho-, Para-directors:** These will have the highest para-isomer yields. This group includes Toluene (1), Ethylbenzene (5), and Chlorobenzene (3).\n\n### Step 2: Order the Meta-directors by Para-isomer Yield\n\nFor meta-directing groups, the para-isomer is a very minor product. The yield of the para-isomer generally decreases as the deactivating strength of the substituent increases.\n\n*   **(4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** The -NO2 group is one of the strongest deactivating groups. During nitration (a similar electrophilic substitution), it yields only a trace (0-5%) of the para-isomer. Bromination requires harsh conditions, and it produces the meta-isomer as the chief product. This compound will have the lowest para-yield.\n*   **(2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate) & (6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** Both the ester and carboxylic acid groups are deactivating and meta-directing. For the nitration of ethyl benzoate, the para-isomer yield is about 5%. Data for the bromination of benzoic acid indicates it forms the m-bromobenzoic acid, implying a very low para-yield. In terms of deactivating strength, -COOH is generally considered stronger than -COOR. Therefore, we can expect the para-yield for benzoic acid to be lower than for ethyl benzoate.\n\nThe order of increasing para-yield for the meta-directors is: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n\n### Step 3: Order the Ortho-, Para-directors by Para-isomer Yield\n\nFor ortho-, para-directing groups, both positions are favored, but the ratio between them is affected by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will hinder the approach of the electrophile (bromine) to the adjacent ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **(1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The -CH3 group is relatively small. In bromination, toluene typically yields about 36.8% of the para-isomer.\n*   **(5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The -C2H5 group is bulkier than -CH3. This increased steric hindrance disfavors ortho-substitution, making the para-isomer more predominant compared to toluene. For bromination in trifluoroacetic acid, ethylbenzene gives 83.2% para-isomer.\n*   **(3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The -Cl group, while deactivating overall, is ortho-, para-directing. Halogens are known to produce a very high yield of the para-isomer due to a combination of electronic and steric factors. For example, the nitration of chlorobenzene gives 70% para-product. Bromination of chlorobenzene also shows high para-selectivity, often over 95%.\n\nComparing the ortho-, para-directors:\n*   Para yield (Ethylbenzene) > Para yield (Toluene) due to sterics.\n*   Para yield (Chlorobenzene) is typically very high, exceeding that of simple alkylbenzenes.\n\nThe order of increasing para-yield for the ortho-, para-directors is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Orders\n\nCombining the two groups, we get the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n\n**4 (Nitrobenzene) < 6 (Benzoic acid) < 2 (Ethyl benzoate) < 1 (Toluene) < 5 (Ethylbenzene) < 3 (Chlorobenzene)**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer during electrophilic bromination, we need to consider the directing effects and steric hindrance of the substituents on the benzene ring.\n\n1.  **С₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is an activating, ortho,para-directing group. Due to its relatively small size, it allows for significant substitution at both ortho and para positions. For bromination, this results in a notable amount of the ortho-isomer, thus the para-isomer does not completely dominate. Typical uncatalyzed bromination yields about 67% para-isomer.\n2.  **C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate):** The ethyl carboxylate group (-COOC₂H₅) is a deactivating, meta-directing group. Such groups strongly disfavor substitution at the ortho and para positions. The yield of the para-isomer is very low. For the similar nitration reaction, the para yield is only about 5%.\n3.  **C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group (-Cl) is deactivating but ortho,para-directing. Due to the combination of its inductive withdrawal and resonance donation, it directs incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. Steric hindrance from the chloro group is not excessively large, but the para position is generally favored. For nitration, chlorobenzene gives 70% of the para isomer.\n4.  **C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group (-NO₂) is a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group. It significantly reduces the electron density at the ortho and para positions, making meta-substitution overwhelmingly favorable. Consequently, the yield of the para-isomer is extremely low. Bromination of nitrobenzene primarily yields the meta-isomer.\n5.  **C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is an activating, ortho,para-directing group. It is bulkier than a methyl group. This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions leads to a higher proportion of substitution at the less hindered para position compared to toluene. Therefore, ethylbenzene is expected to give a higher yield of the para-isomer than toluene.\n6.  **C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The carboxyl group (-COOH) is a deactivating, meta-directing group. It makes the formation of the para-isomer unfavorable, similar to the nitro and ethyl carboxylate groups. Its deactivating strength is generally considered to be between that of the nitro and ester groups.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can establish the order:\n\n*   **Lowest para-yield:** The m-directing groups will have the lowest yields of the para-isomer. Among -NO₂, -COOC₂H₅, and -COOH, the nitro group is one of the strongest deactivators, leading to the least amount of para product. The carboxyl and ester groups are also strongly deactivating. Let's assume the order of para-isomer yield among meta-directors is -NO₂ < -COOC₂H₅ < -COOH. This gives us the sequence: 4 < 2 < 6.\n*   **Highest para-yield:** The o,p-directing groups will produce the highest yields of the para-isomer. These are -CH₃, -C₂H₅, and -Cl. The proportion of the para-isomer is influenced by steric hindrance. The bulkier the group, the more the para isomer is favored. The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group, so ethylbenzene (5) will give a higher para yield than toluene (1). The chloro group (-Cl) also strongly favors the para position, often more so than small alkyl groups. Typical yields for chlorination of chlorobenzene show a high preference for para-substitution (e.g., 90% para for bromination with certain catalysts). Comparing the three, the steric hindrance and electronic effects lead to an order of increasing para-yield as: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n*   **Combining the groups:** The ortho,para-directors will have a significantly higher yield of para-isomer than the meta-directors.\n\nTherefore, the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\nNitrobenzene (4) < Ethyl benzoate (2) < Benzoic acid (6) < Chlorobenzene (3) < Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5).\n\nRevisiting the ortho,para-directors: Standard bromination of toluene yields about 62% para-product. Chlorobenzene gives a higher percentage (around 90%), and due to greater steric hindrance, ethylbenzene also yields a very high percentage of para-isomer (around 94%). Therefore, the order should be Toluene < Chlorobenzene < Ethylbenzene.\n\nLet's refine the final sequence:\n**4 (-NO₂) < 2 (-COOC₂H₅) < 6 (-COOH) < 1 (-CH₃) < 3 (-Cl) < 5 (-C₂H₅)**.\n\nHowever, another analysis considering the balance between electronic and steric effects for ortho,para directors might place chlorobenzene's para yield above ethylbenzene's. Also, the exact order among the meta-directors can be subtle.\n\nLet's re-examine the options provided against our derived principles.\n\nA) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nB) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nC) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nD) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nLet's re-evaluate the order of o,p directors based on known data for similar reactions like nitration, where the para percentages are: Toluene (37%), Chlorobenzene (70%), tert-Butylbenzene (75%, for steric reference). This suggests Toluene (1) < Chlorobenzene (3). Comparing -C₂H₅ and -Cl, the ethyl group's steric hindrance is significant, pushing the para percentage very high, likely exceeding that of toluene. Some data suggests p-selectivity for ethylbenzene bromination is very high, potentially making the order 1 (-CH₃) < 3 (-Cl) < 5 (-C₂H₅) plausible.\n\nLet's check our derived order: 4 < 2 < 6 < 1 < 3 < 5. This does not match any of the options perfectly.\n\nLet's re-examine option D: **4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**\nThis ordering suggests:\n- Lowest para yield: Nitrobenzene (4), then Ethyl Benzoate (2), then Benzoic Acid (6). This is a plausible ranking for meta-directors.\n- Highest para yield: Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5) have higher para yields than Chlorobenzene (3). This contradicts the principle that greater steric hindrance (-C₂H₅ > -CH₃) leads to more para isomer. It also seems to contradict that halogens often give high para yields.\n\nHowever, let's carefully reconsider the literature. Conventional bromination of toluene (FeBr₃ catalyst) gives about 33% para-bromotoluene and 66% ortho. Chlorination of chlorobenzene gives 64% para product. Nitration of toluene gives 37% para, while nitration of chlorobenzene gives 70% para. Nitration of ethyl benzoate gives 5% para. Bromination of nitrobenzene gives almost exclusively meta. For ethylbenzene, the ethyl group is an o,p-director, and steric hindrance makes the para isomer the major product.\n\nGiven these values (even from mixed reaction types):\n- Nitrobenzene (4): ~0% para\n- Ethyl benzoate (2): ~5% para\n- Toluene (1): ~33-37% para\n- Chlorobenzene (3): ~64-70% para\n- Ethylbenzene (5): The para isomer is the major product, likely >60-70% due to sterics.\n- Benzoic acid (6): meta-director, low para yield, probably slightly more than nitrobenzene.\n\nLet's re-rank based on these approximate percentages:\n4 (-NO₂) < 2 (-COOC₂H₅) ≈ 6 (-COOH) < 1 (-CH₃) < 3 (-Cl) < 5 (-C₂H₅)\n\nLet's reconsider option D: **4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**\nThis implies an order of para yield: NO₂ < COOC₂H₅ < COOH < Cl < CH₃ < C₂H₅.\nThis ranking places the para yield for Toluene (1) higher than for Chlorobenzene (3). This contradicts several sources.\n\nThere seems to be a discrepancy between standard textbook values and the provided options. Let's assume there is a specific condition or interpretation intended by the question. Let's focus on the relative strengths.\n- Meta directors (-NO₂, -COOH, -COOC₂H₅) will be the lowest. Order of deactivation strength is generally -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOR. A stronger deactivator would suppress para substitution more. So, 4 < 6 < 2 seems plausible.\n- Ortho, para directors (-Cl, -CH₃, -C₂H₅) will be highest. For alkyl groups, steric hindrance increases with size, increasing the para/ortho ratio. So, 1 < 5. -Cl is deactivating by induction but o,p-directing by resonance. Its para/ortho ratio is typically high.\n\nLet's assume the order D is correct and try to rationalize it.\n**4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5** means the para yield increases in the order:\nNitrobenzene < Ethyl Benzoate < Benzoic Acid < Chlorobenzene < Toluene < Ethylbenzene.\n\nThis order is consistent with:\n1.  Meta-directors having the lowest para yields.\n2.  Among meta-directors: NO₂ < COOC₂H₅ < COOH. This order of increasing para yield (or decreasing meta-directing strength for the para position) is reasonable.\n3.  Ortho,para-directors having the highest yields.\n4.  Among ortho,para-directors: Cl < CH₃ < C₂H₅. The Cl being the lowest among o,p directors is plausible since it's a deactivator overall. The order CH₃ < C₂H₅ is correct based on sterics.\n\nThis rationalization seems consistent.\n\nFinal Check:\n- Lowest three: 4, 2, 6 are all meta-directors. Correct.\n- Highest three: 3, 1, 5 are all ortho,para-directors. Correct.\n- Order within meta-directors: 4 < 2 < 6. Plausible, all are very low.\n- Order within o,p-directors: 3 < 1 < 5. This implies Toluene gives more para than Chlorobenzene. This contradicts some data, but might be true under specific conditions. However, the order of alkylbenzenes 1 < 5 is solid. The question is whether 3 is less than 1. Given the conflicting data points in the search results (some showing high para for toluene, some low), this is the most uncertain part. But if we must choose from the options, option D presents the most internally consistent logic based on general principles, despite the ambiguity around Toluene vs. Chlorobenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nTo determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we need to analyze the directing effects of each substituent on the benzene ring. Substituents can be classified as activating or deactivating, and as ortho/para-directing or meta-directing.\n\n### **Analysis of Substituents**\n\nFirst, let's categorize each substituent:\n1.  **-CH3 (in Toluene):** An alkyl group, which is activating and an ortho, para-director.\n2.  **-COOC2H5 (in Ethyl benzoate):** A deactivating group and a meta-director.\n3.  **-Cl (in Chlorobenzene):** A halogen, which is deactivating but an ortho, para-director.\n4.  **-NO2 (in Nitrobenzene):** A strongly deactivating group and a meta-director.\n5.  **-C2H5 (in Ethylbenzene):** An alkyl group, which is activating and an ortho, para-director.\n6.  **-COOH (in Benzoic acid):** A deactivating group and a meta-director.\n\n### **Ordering Based on Director Type**\n\nThe yield of the para-isomer is significant only for ortho, para-directing substituents. For meta-directing substituents, the para-isomer is formed in very small, often negligible amounts.\n\n*   **Lowest Para Yield (Meta-Directors):**\n    *   Substances 4 (C6H5-NO2), 2 (C6H5-COOC2H5), and 6 (C6H5-COOH) are all meta-directors. The electrophilic attack is strongly directed to the meta position, meaning the para-isomer yield is extremely low. For the nitration of a benzoic ester, which is chemically similar to ethyl benzoate, the para isomer yield is about 5%, while the meta isomer is 73%. Bromination of nitrobenzene primarily yields the meta-bromo isomer. For these strongly deactivating, meta-directing groups, the para yield is minimal. The order among them is based on the strength of their deactivating and meta-directing nature. The generally accepted order of deactivating strength is -NO2 > -COOH > -COOR. A stronger deactivating group leads to an even smaller percentage of the para product. Thus, the order of increasing para yield is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n*   **Highest Para Yield (Ortho, Para-Directors):**\n    *   Substances 1 (C6H5-CH3), 5 (C6H5-C2H5), and 3 (C6H5-Cl) are all ortho, para-directors. They will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer.\n    *   The ratio of para to ortho product is heavily influenced by **steric hindrance**. A bulkier substituent will sterically hinder the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para product.\n    *   Comparing the ortho, para-directors:\n        *   **Toluene (-CH3):** The methyl group is relatively small. The bromination of toluene yields about 66.8% para-isomer. Other sources suggest a para-yield of around 56%.\n        *   **Ethylbenzene (-C2H5):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance disfavors ortho substitution, resulting in a higher yield of the para-isomer. For example, in nitration, moving from toluene to tert-butylbenzene (a very bulky group) increases the para-isomer yield from 37% to 75%. The bromination of ethylbenzene is expected to give a very high para yield.\n        *   **Chlorobenzene (-Cl):** Halogens are an exception; they are deactivating but ortho, para-directing. Despite being deactivating, the para-isomer is strongly favored. Nitration of chlorobenzene, for instance, gives about 70% para-product.\n\n*   **Refined Order of Ortho, Para-Directors:**\n    *   To establish the precise order, we compare the para-yields.\n    *   **Toluene (1):** Para yield is significant but the lowest among the three due to the relatively small size of the methyl group. (~56-67%)\n    *   **Ethylbenzene (5):** The larger ethyl group leads to more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, thus a higher para yield than toluene.\n    *   **Chlorobenzene (3):** The bromination of chlorobenzene yields ortho and para isomers in a ratio of about 0.1 to 1, which means the para isomer can be up to ~90% of the o/p mixture. Comparing this with the ~56-67% for toluene, chlorobenzene gives a higher para yield. When comparing ethylbenzene and chlorobenzene, ethylbenzene's larger size typically leads to an even greater preference for the para position than chlorine. However, the options provided place -Cl after the alkyl groups. Let's re-examine this. For nitration, ethylbenzene yields 49% para. In another source for nitration, chlorobenzene gives 70% para and toluene gives 37% para. The data can vary with reaction conditions, but the general trend related to sterics holds: a larger group increases the para ratio. The steric order is C2H5 > CH3. The electronic and steric balance for Cl results in a high para yield, often intermediate between small and large alkyl groups.\n    *   Let's follow the most cited trend: Steric hindrance increases the para/ortho ratio. The steric bulk is C2H5 > CH3. Chlorine's size is comparable to a methyl group but its electronic effects also strongly favor the para position. Looking at the options, a common pattern tested in chemistry is the steric effect on alkylbenzenes.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para yield for the o,p-directors is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3). *Correction based on typical data*: Chlorobenzene (~70-90% para) and Ethylbenzene (~49% para for nitration, expected to be higher but perhaps not as high as for Cl for bromination) have yields that need careful comparison. However, all options end with `1<5<3` or `1<5`. Option A ends in `...<3<1<5`, B `...<1<6<2<4`, C `...<5<1<3`, and D `...<1<5<3`. Options D seems most plausible for the ortho-para directors based on common textbook examples where steric hindrance is the dominant factor shown for alkyl groups, and halogens give very high para yields.\n\n### **Final Assembly**\n\nCombining the two groups, we get the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n\n1.  **Meta-Directors (lowest yield):** Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic Acid (6) < Ethyl Benzoate (2).\n2.  **Ortho, Para-Directors (highest yield):** Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\nThe complete sequence is **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nB) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nC) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nD) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nThe derived sequence matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Reaction and Substituent Effects\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a substituted benzene ring. The substituent already on the ring determines the position (regioselectivity) of the incoming bromine atom.\n\nSubstituents are classified into two main types:\n1.  **Activating Groups (Ortho, Para-directing):** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive than benzene. They direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. Examples here are -CH3 (methyl) and -C2H5 (ethyl).\n2.  **Deactivating Groups:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive than benzene.\n    *   **Meta-directing Deactivators:** Most deactivating groups direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position. This is because the ortho and para positions are more strongly deactivated than the meta position. Examples here are -NO2 (nitro), -COOH (carboxyl), and -COOC2H5 (ethyl carboxylate). The yield of the para-isomer for these substances will be very low.\n    *   **Ortho, Para-directing Deactivators:** Halogens are the main exception. They are deactivating due to their strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect but are ortho, para-directing due to electron donation via resonance. The example here is -Cl (chloro).\n\n### Step 2: Separate Meta-directors from Ortho, Para-directors\n\nBased on the expected major products, we can split the substances into two groups:\n\n*   **Group 1 (Low para-yield):** Meta-directors.\n    *   2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n*   **Group 2 (High para-yield):** Ortho, para-directors.\n    *   1) С6H5-CH3 (Toluene)\n    *   3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n    *   5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n\nThe final order will have all substances from Group 1 followed by all substances from Group 2.\n\n### Step 3: Order the Substances within Group 1 (Meta-directors)\n\nFor meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is very small but not necessarily zero. The order depends on the strength of the deactivating/meta-directing effect. A stronger deactivating group leads to a higher proportion of the meta-isomer and consequently, a lower proportion of the ortho and para isomers.\n\nWe need to rank the deactivating strength of -NO2, -COOH, and -COOC2H5.\n*   The **-NO2** group is one of the strongest deactivating groups. It will give the highest percentage of meta product and the lowest percentage of para product.\n*   The **-COOH** and **-COOC2H5** groups are also strongly deactivating, but less so than -NO2. Between them, the -COOH group is generally considered slightly more deactivating than the -COOC2H5 group. Therefore, the ester will allow for a slightly higher proportion of non-meta products compared to the carboxylic acid.\n\nSo, the order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\nThis means the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse: C6H5-NO2 < C6H5-COOH < C6H5-COOC2H5.\nIn terms of substance numbers, the order is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### Step 4: Order the Substances within Group 2 (Ortho, Para-directors)\n\nFor ortho, para-directing groups, we need to compare the ratio of para to ortho product. A higher para/ortho ratio results in a higher overall percentage yield of the para-isomer. This ratio is primarily influenced by two factors: steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n1.  **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):**\n    *   Both -CH3 and -C2H5 are activating alkyl groups.\n    *   The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   This increased bulk hinders the attack of the electrophile (bromine) at the adjacent ortho positions more significantly.\n    *   Therefore, ethylbenzene will produce a higher proportion of the para-isomer compared to toluene.\n    *   Order: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5).\n\n2.  **Comparing Ethylbenzene (5) and Chlorobenzene (3):**\n    *   The -Cl group is deactivating but ortho, para-directing. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect) deactivates the ortho positions (which are closer) more strongly than the para position.\n    *   This electronic effect strongly favors substitution at the para position, leading to a very high para/ortho ratio for halobenzenes.\n    *   This effect is typically stronger than the steric effect of alkyl groups. Experimental data confirms that bromination of chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer (around 88-89%). This percentage is generally higher than for toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene (which is expected to be higher than toluene, e.g., ~75-80%, though some data sources vary).\n    *   Therefore, chlorobenzene is expected to give the highest yield of para-isomer among these three.\n    *   Order: Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\nCombining the order for Group 2: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### Step 5: Combine the Orders of Both Groups\n\nNow, we combine the sorted groups to get the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield.\n\nGroup 1 order: **4 < 6 < 2**\nGroup 2 order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nCombined full order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is the reasoning process to determine the order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction and Substituent Effects**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a substituted benzene ring. The substituent already on the ring (C6H5-X) directs the incoming bromine atom to certain positions (ortho, meta, or para). This is known as the directing effect of the substituent.\n\nWe need to classify the substituents based on their effect on the benzene ring:\n\n*   **Activating, Ortho-, Para-directing groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive. They direct new substituents to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) -CH3 (Toluene)\n    *   5) -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-directing groups:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive. They direct new substituents to the meta position.\n    *   4) -NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n*   **Deactivating, Ortho-, Para-directing groups:** Halogens are an exception. They withdraw electron density (deactivating) but direct to ortho and para positions due to resonance.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\n**2. Separate into Low and High Para-Yield Groups**\n\nThe question asks for the order of increasing yield of the *para-isomer*.\n\n*   **Low Para-Yield:** The meta-directing groups (4, 6, 2) will produce very little para-isomer, as their primary product is the meta-isomer.\n*   **High Para-Yield:** The ortho-, para-directing groups (1, 5, 3) will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer.\n\nTherefore, the final ordered list will have the meta-directing compounds first, followed by the ortho-, para-directing compounds.\n\n**(Low Yield Group: 4, 6, 2) < (High Yield Group: 1, 5, 3)**\n\n**3. Order the Meta-Directing Groups (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor these groups, the para-isomer is a very minor product. The yield of the para-isomer will be inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A more strongly deactivating group will result in a lower yield of the (already unfavored) para product.\n\n*   **-NO2 (4):** This is one of the strongest electron-withdrawing and deactivating groups. It will give the lowest yield of the para-isomer. (Typical para yield is <1%).\n*   **-COOH (6) and -COOC2H5 (2):** Both are strongly deactivating due to the carbonyl group. Comparing them, the -COOH group is generally considered slightly more deactivating than the -COOR group. Furthermore, experimental data for bromination shows that benzoic acid gives a slightly lower para yield (~2%) compared to ethyl benzoate (~5%).\n\nSo, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\nOrder: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**4. Order the Ortho-, Para-Directing Groups (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these groups, both ortho and para products are formed. The ratio of para to ortho product (p/o ratio) depends on two factors:\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** A larger substituent will block the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para product.\n*   **Electronic Effects:** The inductive effect of a substituent is distance-dependent and affects the ortho position more strongly than the para position.\n\nLet's compare them:\n*   **-CH3 (1) vs. -C2H5 (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is larger than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased steric bulk hinders attack at the ortho position more effectively, resulting in a higher yield of the para-isomer for ethylbenzene compared to toluene.\n    *   Yield(para-C6H4Br-C2H5) > Yield(para-C6H4Br-CH3)\n    *   Order: **1 < 5**\n*   **-Cl (3):** Chlorine is deactivating overall due to its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I), but it is ortho-, para-directing because of its electron-donating resonance effect (+R). The strong -I effect deactivates the nearby ortho position more than the distant para position. This electronic factor leads to a very high preference for para substitution. Experimental data shows that the p/o ratio for chlorobenzene is significantly higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n    *   Yield(para-C6H4Br-Cl) > Yield(para-C6H4Br-C2H5)\n    *   Order: **5 < 3**\n\nCombining the ortho-, para-directors, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\nOrder: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**5. Combine the Groups to Get the Final Order**\n\nNow, we combine the ordered subgroups:\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete sequence in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence:\nNitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate < Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene\n\n**6. Match with the Given Options**\n\nLet's check the options provided:\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nOur derived order, **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**, matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nThis problem requires ranking substituted benzenes by the increasing yield of their *para*-brominated product after an electrophilic substitution reaction. The yield of the para-isomer is determined by the electronic and steric properties of the substituent already on the benzene ring.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Classify Substituents as Ortho, Para-Directors or Meta-Directors**\n\nFirst, we divide the substituents into two main groups based on where they direct the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br+).\n\n*   **Group 1: Meta-Directors (Low Para Yield)**\n    These are electron-withdrawing groups (deactivators) that direct the new substituent to the *meta* position. They will produce a very small amount of the *para*-isomer.\n    *   **4) C6H5-NO2:** The nitro group (-NO2) is a very strong deactivator and a strong *meta*-director.\n    *   **6) C6H5-COOH:** The carboxyl group (-COOH) is a deactivator and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5:** The ester group (-COOC2H5) is a deactivator and a *meta*-director.\n\n*   **Group 2: Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para Yield)**\n    These are groups that direct the new substituent to the *ortho* and *para* positions. They will produce a significant amount of the *para*-isomer.\n    *   **1) С6H5-CH3:** The methyl group (-CH3) is an activator and an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **5) C6H5-C2H5:** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is an activator and an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **3) C6H5-Cl:** The chloro group (-Cl) is a deactivator but is an *ortho, para*-director.\n\nThis initial sorting tells us that the final sequence will have all substances from Group 1 (4, 6, 2) before all substances from Group 2 (1, 5, 3).\n\n**Step 2: Rank the Substances Within Each Group**\n\n*   **Ranking the Meta-Directors (Group 1):**\n    The stronger the deactivating effect, the more strongly the group directs *meta*, and therefore the *less* *para*-isomer is formed. The order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n    Therefore, the order of increasing *para*-isomer yield is the reverse: C6H5-NO2 < C6H5-COOH < C6H5-COOC2H5.\n    This gives the order: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n*   **Ranking the Ortho, Para-Directors (Group 2):**\n    For this group, the yield of the *para*-product depends on the ratio of *para* to *ortho* isomers formed. This is primarily influenced by steric hindrance.\n    *   Comparing **1 (-CH3)** and **5 (-C2H5)**: The ethyl group is larger (bulkier) than the methyl group. This increased steric bulk makes it harder for the bromine to attack the nearby *ortho* positions, favoring attack at the more accessible *para* position. Thus, ethylbenzene produces a higher proportion of the *para*-isomer than toluene. Order: **1 < 5**.\n    *   Comparing with **3 (-Cl)**: Halogens are known to be highly *para*-directing, often yielding the *para*-isomer as the major product by a large margin (e.g., ~87% for chlorobenzene). This is a stronger *para*-directing effect than that of simple alkyl groups.\n    Therefore, the order of increasing *para*-isomer yield for this group is: Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\n    This gives the order: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the Ranked Groups**\n\nBy combining the two ranked lists, we get the final overall order from the lowest *para* yield to the highest *para* yield:\n\n(Group 1 order) < (Group 2 order)\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis order matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nThe correct answer is derived by analyzing the directing effects and steric properties of the substituents on the benzene ring.\n\n1.  **Categorize Substituents:**\n    *   **Meta-directors (strongly deactivating):** These groups direct the incoming bromine primarily to the meta position, resulting in a very low yield of the para-isomer. The substances in this category are:\n        *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n        *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n        *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a high yield of the para-isomer. The substances in this category are:\n        *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n        *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n        *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\n2.  **Rank the Meta-Directors:**\n    The yield of the para-isomer is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more effective at directing to the meta position, thus yielding less para product.\n    *   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para yield is: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n\n3.  **Rank the Ortho, Para-Directors:**\n    The yield of the para-isomer depends on the para/ortho ratio, which is heavily influenced by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent blocks the ortho positions more, favoring para substitution.\n    *   Comparing -CH₃ (in 1) and -C₂H₅ (in 5): The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance leads to a higher yield of the para-isomer for ethylbenzene than for toluene. So, the order is **1 < 5**.\n    *   Comparing with -Cl (in 3): The chloro substituent gives an exceptionally high para-to-ortho ratio due to a combination of steric and electronic factors. It produces the highest percentage of para-isomer in this group.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para yield is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\n4.  **Combine the Rankings:**\n    Combining the two groups, the meta-directors will always have lower para yields than the ortho, para-directors.\n    *   The complete order is: **(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**.\n\nThis matches the sequence derived by the code: `4<6<2<1<5<3`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nBased on the principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution and analysis of experimental data, the correct order can be determined.\n\n### Analysis of Substituents\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents on the benzene ring:\n\n*   **Substances with Meta-Directing Groups:** These are deactivating groups that direct the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br⁺) primarily to the meta position. The yield of the para-isomer is consequently very low.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene): -NO₂ is a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group.\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid): -COOH is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate): -COOC₂H₅ is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n\n*   **Substances with Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The yield of the para-isomer is significant.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene): -CH₃ is an activating, ortho, para-directing group.\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene): -C₂H₅ is an activating, ortho, para-directing group.\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene): -Cl is a deactivating, but ortho, para-directing group.\n\n### Ranking the Substances\n\n#### **Part 1: The Meta-Directors (Lowest Para-Yield)**\n\nSubstances 4, 6, and 2 will have the lowest yields of the para-isomer because they are meta-directors. For these groups, electrophilic attack at the ortho and para positions is highly disfavored. Data from nitration reactions (which follow similar principles to bromination) show the para isomer yields for these types of compounds are very small. For example, the nitration of nitrobenzene (4) yields only about 2% of the para-isomer. The nitration of ethyl benzoate (2) gives about 5% para-product. The nitration of benzoic acid (6) yields about 2% para-product. The order of deactivating strength is generally -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅, which correlates with very low para yields. Based on available data for similar reactions, we can establish their low position in the overall ranking. Looking at the options provided, they all correctly place combinations of 2, 4, and 6 at the beginning. The precise order among these three is nuanced, but data for nitration shows para-yields as: -NO₂ (7%/2%), -CO₂H (22%/2%), -CO₂Et (28%/5%). The numbers vary but consistently show very low para yield. Let's look at option D's order: 4 < 2 < 6. This corresponds to para yield: NO₂ < COOC₂H₅ < COOH.\n\n#### **Part 2: The Ortho, Para-Directors (Highest Para-Yield)**\n\nFor substances 1, 3, and 5, the yield of the para-isomer is primarily determined by steric hindrance. A larger substituent group will sterically block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of the para-product.\n\n*   **Substituent Sizes:** The steric bulk of the groups increases in the order: -Cl < -CH₃ < -C₂H₅.\n    *   The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is significantly bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   A methyl group is generally considered sterically larger than a single chlorine atom.\n\n*   **Predicted Para-Yield Order:** Based on steric hindrance, the fraction of para-isomer should increase as the substituent size increases. Therefore, we expect the order of increasing para-yield to be:\n    Chlorobenzene (3) < Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5).\n\nThis prediction is supported by experimental data for similar reactions. For instance, in nitration, the para product percentages are approximately: Chlorobenzene (~70%), Toluene (~37%), and t-butylbenzene (a bulky alkyl group) (~75%). Note that the reaction conditions can influence these ratios, but the general trend related to sterics holds. The increased bulk of an alkyl group strongly favors para-substitution.\n\n### Combining the Rankings\n\nCombining the two groups, the meta-directors will have the lowest para-yields, followed by the ortho, para-directors in order of increasing steric hindrance.\n\nThe full sequence should start with the meta-directors and end with the ortho, para-directors arranged by steric effect (3 < 1 < 5).\n\nLet's examine the given options:\n*   A) 4<6<2<**1<5<3** - The order for o,p-directors is incorrect.\n*   B) 6<2<4<**5<1<3** - The order for o,p-directors is incorrect.\n*   C) **3<5<1**... - Starts with an o,p-director, which is incorrect.\n*   D) 4<2<6<**3<1<5** - This option correctly places the meta-directors first and then correctly orders the ortho, para-directors based on increasing steric hindrance leading to a higher yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThus, the final order is determined by grouping the substances into meta- and ortho/para-directors and then arranging the latter based on the steric effect of the substituent.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer during electrophilic bromination, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n1.  **Substituent Classification and Directing Effects:**\n    *   **-CH₃ (Toluene, 1)** and **-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene, 5)** are alkyl groups. They are activating and ortho-, para-directing.\n    *   **-Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3)** is a halogen. It is deactivating but ortho-, para-directing.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene, 4)**, **-COOH (Benzoic acid, 6)**, and **-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate, 2)** are deactivating, meta-directing groups.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Meta-Directing Groups (Low Para Yield):**\n    These substituents direct the incoming electrophile (Br⁺) primarily to the meta position, resulting in very low yields of the para-isomer.\n    *   **Nitrobenzene (-NO₂):** The nitro group is one of the strongest deactivating groups. It makes the ortho and para positions highly electron-deficient, leading to a very high preference for meta-substitution. For bromination, the para-isomer yield is extremely low, often less than 1%.\n    *   **Benzoic acid (-COOH):** The carboxylic acid group is also a strong deactivator. Bromination yields predominantly the meta-isomer. The para yield is very low, around 1-2%.\n    *   **Ethyl benzoate (-COOC₂H₅):** The ester group is a deactivator, similar to the carboxylic acid group. Its deactivating strength is slightly less than -COOH. Data for nitration of ethyl benzoate shows a para yield of about 5%, which suggests the para yield for bromination would also be low but likely slightly higher than for benzoic acid.\n\n    Therefore, the order of increasing para yield for this subset is: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n\n3.  **Analysis of Ortho, Para-Directing Groups (High Para Yield):**\n    These substituents direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The ratio between the ortho and para isomers is influenced by steric effects and electronic factors.\n    *   **Ethylbenzene (-C₂H₅):** The ethyl group is an o,p-director. One might expect the bulkier ethyl group to sterically hinder the ortho position more than a methyl group, leading to a higher para yield. However, experimental data for bromination often shows the opposite. For example, one source indicates the product distribution is about 29.6% ortho and 70.4% para. Another source cites 24.6% ortho and 75.4% para.\n    *   **Toluene (-CH₃):** The methyl group is an o,p-director. Typical bromination product distributions are around 33% ortho and 67% para. While some conditions show slightly different ratios, the para yield is consistently high.\n    *   **Chlorobenzene (-Cl):** The chloro group is o,p-directing but deactivating. The inductive electron-withdrawing effect deactivates the ring, but resonance directs substitution to the o,p positions. For halogens, the para-isomer is highly favored over the ortho-isomer due to the combination of inductive and steric effects. Bromination of chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer, approximately 90%.\n\n    Comparing the three, the experimental data shows that the para-isomer yield generally follows this order: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3). It is worth noting that the exact ortho/para ratio for toluene and ethylbenzene can vary with reaction conditions, but the para-selectivity for chlorobenzene is consistently the highest among these three. Some sources might show ethylbenzene giving a slightly higher para yield than toluene, but chlorobenzene's para-selectivity is distinctly superior. Let's re-examine the order of toluene and ethylbenzene. A catalyst system with ZnBr₂ on K-10 clay gave 75.4% para-bromoethylbenzene versus 65.1% para-bromotoluene, suggesting ethylbenzene can give a higher para yield. The key factor is that the para position is generally less sterically hindered. Given the options, let's re-establish the most likely order. Alkyl groups (-CH₃, -C₂H₅) are less para-directing than halogens (-Cl). The larger size of the ethyl group compared to the methyl group increases steric hindrance at the ortho positions, favouring para substitution more. Therefore, the para yield should be higher for ethylbenzene than for toluene.\n\n    So, the revised order for this subset is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\n4.  **Final Arrangement:**\n    Combining the two groups gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n\n    **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\n    This corresponds to:\n    Nitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate < Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene\n\n    This order aligns with option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic substitution reaction with bromine, we need to analyze the directing effects of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\nFirst, let's classify the substituents on each molecule:\n\n*   **Substances 4, 6, and 2** have meta-directing groups:\n    *   4) **C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group (-NO₂) is a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group.\n    *   6) **C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The carboxyl group (-COOH) is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n    *   2) **C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate):** The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is also a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n    For these substances, the primary product will be the meta-isomer. The yield of the para-isomer will be very low. The order of para-isomer yield among these is determined by the group's deactivating strength; stronger deactivation leads to a more pronounced meta-direction and thus an even lower para yield. The deactivating strength follows the order: -NO₂ > -COOR > -COOH. However, for practical purposes in this context, all produce minimal para product. Data for the nitration of ethyl benzoate shows only about 5% para-product formation, and it's expected to be similarly low for bromination. For nitrobenzene, the para product is often negligible. Therefore, these three will have the lowest para-isomer yields. Based on deactivating strength, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is generally: nitrobenzene < ethyl benzoate < benzoic acid. So, 4 < 2 < 6.\n\n*   **Substances 3, 1, and 5** have ortho,para-directing groups:\n    *   3) **C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group (-Cl) is deactivating but directs incoming groups to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) **C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is an activating, ortho,para-directing group.\n    *   5) **C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is also an activating, ortho,para-directing group.\n\nFor these ortho,para-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is influenced by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will sterically hinder the ortho positions, making the para position more accessible to the incoming electrophile.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased steric hindrance in ethylbenzene leads to a higher proportion of the para-isomer compared to toluene. For bromination, ethylbenzene can yield over 80% para-isomer, while toluene yields significantly less (around 37-40% para-isomer). Therefore, the para-yield for ethylbenzene is greater than for toluene (1 < 5).\n\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** Halogens like chlorine also direct to the ortho and para positions. Due to a combination of electronic and steric effects, chlorobenzene typically gives a high yield of the para-isomer upon halogenation, often higher than toluene but lower than more sterically hindered groups. For nitration, chlorobenzene gives about 70% para-product. In bromination, this trend holds, placing it between toluene and ethylbenzene in terms of para yield.\n\n**Final Ordering:**\n\n1.  **Lowest para-yields (meta-directors):** The order among the meta-directors based on the general strength of deactivation and the resulting preference for meta-substitution is 4 (-NO₂) < 2 (-COOC₂H₅) < 6 (-COOH).\n2.  **Higher para-yields (ortho,para-directors):** The order among the o,p-directors is determined by steric effects favouring para substitution. The increasing bulkiness of the substituent (and other electronic factors for Cl) gives the order: 1 (-CH₃) < 3 (-Cl) < 5 (-C₂H₅).\n\nCombining these two groups gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n**4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**\n\nLooking at the options provided, none perfectly match this derived order. Let's re-evaluate the ortho-para directors. While the steric argument is strong, sometimes the order of -CH₃ and -Cl can be debated based on specific reaction conditions. However, the order of meta-directors is quite certain to be at the beginning of the sequence, and the order of the alkyl groups (-CH₃ < -C₂H₅) is also well-established.\n\nLet's re-examine the provided options against our established facts:\n*   Meta directors (4, 2, 6) must come first.\n*   Ortho-para directors (1, 5, 3) must come last.\n*   Among ortho-para directors, the yield should generally increase with steric hindrance: para yield for Toluene(1) < Ethylbenzene(5).\n\nLet's review the provided options:\n*   A) 6<2<4<5<1<3 -> Incorrectly places o,p directors before a meta-director.\n*   B) 3<5<1<6<2<4 -> Incorrectly places o,p directors before meta-directors.\n*   C) 4<6<2<1<5<3 -> Incorrect start (places 2 after 6), and incorrect end (places 3 last).\n*   D) 4<2<6<3<1<5 -> Incorrectly places 3 before 1. But let's check the data. For nitration, toluene gives ~37% para while chlorobenzene gives ~70% para. This suggests the para yield for chlorobenzene (3) is indeed higher than for toluene (1). The steric hindrance of -C2H5 is greater than -CH3, so para yield for ethylbenzene(5) > toluene(1). A bulky t-butyl group gives ~75% para product in nitration. Bromination of ethylbenzene gives ~83% para-isomer. Bromination of toluene gives ~37% para-isomer. Thus, the order among the o,p directors is **1 < 3 < 5**.\n\nLet's reconsider the meta-directors. While all yield very little para product, their relative deactivating effects are -NO₂ > -COOR > -COOH. Stronger deactivation correlates with a stronger preference for the meta position, and thus a lower yield of the para isomer. Therefore, the order of increasing para yield is **4 < 2 < 6**.\n\nCombining these findings, the correct sequence should be **4 < 2 < 6 < 1 < 3 < 5**.\n\nLet's carefully re-examine the provided options one last time with the established order of **4 < 2 < 6 < 1 < 3 < 5**. None of the options match this order. There might be an error in the question or the options provided. However, let's analyze the most plausible option. Option D starts with 4 < 2 < 6 which is correct for the meta-directors. The second part is 3 < 1 < 5. This implies para yield Cl < CH3 < C2H5. This contradicts the data found.\n\nLet's check another possibility. Perhaps the order of deactivators is different. -NO2 > -COOH > -COOR. This would give 4 < 6 < 2.\nThis would lead to the sequence **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**. This matches the beginning of option C. Let's look at the end of option C: 1 < 5 < 3. This means para yield of chlorobenzene is the highest, which is plausible as halogens are known to give high para-selectivity.\n\nLet's re-verify ortho-para ratios:\n-   Toluene (1, -CH₃): ~37% para (Bromination)\n-   Ethylbenzene (5, -C₂H₅): ~83% para (Bromination)\n-   Chlorobenzene (3, -Cl): ~70% para (Nitration data, bromination expected to be similar or higher, with some sources claiming near 100% para selectivity for bromination under certain conditions).\n\nBased on this data, the order of increasing para yield for o,p directors is definitively **1 < 3 < 5**.\n\nNow let's revisit the meta-directors. Their para yield is very low.\n- Nitrobenzene (4): 0-5%\n- Benzoic acid (6): Bromination mainly gives m-bromobenzoic acid.\n- Ethyl benzoate (2): Nitration gives 5% para. Bromination gives predominantly meta.\n\nThe deactivating strength is -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅. The stronger the deactivator, the more it disfavors o,p substitution, hence the lower the para yield.\nSo, the order of increasing para yield should be: 4 (-NO₂) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC₂H₅).\n\nThis leads to the full order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**.\n\nLet's reconsider the provided choices. There appears to be an inconsistency between established chemical principles/data and the options. However, let's select the \"best fit\" or reconsider if there's an alternative interpretation.\n\nOption D: 4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5\nThis has the meta-directors in the correct starting block. The relative order is 4<2<6. As discussed, 4<6<2 is more likely. The o,p directors are ordered 3<1<5, which contradicts the data.\n\nOption C: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3\nThis has the meta-directors ordered as 4<6<2, which is consistent with their deactivating strength. It has the o,p directors ordered as 1<5<3. This suggests the para yield from chlorobenzene is the highest, which is plausible under some conditions, and the yield from ethylbenzene is higher than toluene, which is correct. This seems the most chemically sound option despite potential nuances with chlorobenzene's yield vs ethylbenzene's.\n\nLet's commit to the order based on the most consistent rules:\n1. Meta-directors have the lowest para yield. Order of increasing yield is based on decreasing deactivation strength: -NO₂ < -COOH < -COOR. So: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n2. Ortho,para-directors have higher para yield. Order is based on steric hindrance and electronic factors: -CH₃ < -C₂H₅. -Cl also gives high para yield. Data suggests: -CH₃ < -Cl < -C₂H₅. So: **1 < 3 < 5**.\n\nThis gives a combined order of **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**. Since this is not an option, let's reconsider the ortho, para order. Could the para yield of chlorobenzene (3) be the highest? Let's assume so. Then 1 < 5 < 3. This would make the overall order **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**. This matches option C.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
