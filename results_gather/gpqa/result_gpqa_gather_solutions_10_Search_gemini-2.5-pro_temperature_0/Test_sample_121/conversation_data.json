This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is the methyl group. One of the alpha-hydrogens is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Starting Material (1):** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Starting Material (2):** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide leaving group.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Starting Material (3):** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a multi-step process involving a double alkylation.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, removes an acidic alpha-proton from ethyl cyanoacetate. The CH2 group is flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt), making its protons acidic.\n        NCCH2COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The resulting enolate attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br(CH2)5Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Cyclization:** The problem states \"excess sodium hydride,\" which implies a second deprotonation occurs. The remaining alpha-proton is removed by another equivalent of NaH.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n        The resulting carbanion is tethered to an alkyl bromide. It undergoes an intramolecular SN2 reaction to form a stable six-membered ring. The nucleophilic carbon attacks the carbon bearing the bromine atom.\n*   **Final Product 4:** The product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe structure of product 4 is:\n```\n      EtOOC   CN\n           \\ /\n            C1\n           / \\\n    H2C(a)---CH2(a)\n    |         |\n    H2C(b)---CH2(b)\n     \\       /\n      CH2(c)\n```\nThe ethyl group is -O-CH2(d)-CH3(e).\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must consider the molecule's symmetry and conformational dynamics.\n\n*   **Ethyl Group Protons:**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH3) are equivalent. They will produce one signal (a triplet). Let's call this **Signal 1**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-O-CH2-) are equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce one signal (a quartet). Let's call this **Signal 2**.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    The analysis of cyclohexane derivatives can be complex. There are two common models:\n    1.  **Rapid Flipping Model (Room Temperature):** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This averages the axial and equatorial positions. The molecule has a time-averaged plane of symmetry passing through carbons C1 and C4.\n        *   This symmetry makes the two protons on C2 equivalent to the two on C6. These four protons give **Signal 3**.\n        *   It also makes the two protons on C3 equivalent to the two on C5. These four protons give **Signal 4**.\n        *   The two protons on C4 are unique and equivalent to each other. They give **Signal 5**.\n        In this model, there are 2 (ethyl) + 3 (ring) = **5 signals**.\n\n    2.  **Slow Flipping Model (Low Temperature or \"Textbook\" Problem):** If the ring flip is slow, axial (ax) and equatorial (eq) protons are distinct. In many textbook problems, a simplified model is used where one considers both the ax/eq distinction AND the overall symmetry of the molecule, even though these concepts are contradictory (a frozen chair lacks the symmetry of the flipping average). Let's apply this common, albeit flawed, logic, as it often leads to the intended answer in multiple-choice questions.\n        *   Assume a C1-C4 plane of symmetry, so C2 is equivalent to C6, and C3 is equivalent to C5.\n        *   Assume slow flip, so axial and equatorial protons are distinct.\n        *   **C2/C6 Protons:** The axial protons are equivalent to each other, and the equatorial protons are equivalent to each other. This gives 2 signals (Hax, Heq).\n        *   **C3/C5 Protons:** Similarly, this gives 2 signals (Hax, Heq).\n        *   **C4 Protons:** The two protons at C4 are diastereotopic (one axial, one equatorial) and give 2 signals (Hax, Heq).\n        *   This gives a total of 2 + 2 + 2 = **6 signals for the ring**.\n        *   Adding the **2 signals from the ethyl group** (assuming the CH2 protons are not resolved as diastereotopic, which is consistent with this simplified model), the total number of signals is 6 + 2 = **8 signals**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe rigorous analysis at room temperature (rapid flipping) gives 5 signals (Option B). A rigorous analysis at low temperature (slow flipping) gives 13 signals (not an option). A less likely elimination reaction pathway gives 10 signals (Option D). The simplified \"textbook\" slow-flipping model gives 8 signals (Option C). Given the options, it is highly probable that the question intends for the student to apply this specific simplified model for analyzing substituted cyclohexanes.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct hydrogen signals is 8.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product (4), we must first deduce its structure by following the reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\nAcetic acid (CH₃COOH) is treated with bromine (Br₂) and a catalyst (pyridine is mentioned, but typically PBr₃ is used, which can be generated in situ). This is a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction, which brominates the α-carbon of the carboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\nProduct 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a Fischer esterification reaction.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\nProduct 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\nProduct 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH₂)₅Br).\n1.  Sodium hydride is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is acidic due to the two adjacent electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt).\n    *   NCCH₂COOEt + NaH → [NCCHCOOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n2.  The resulting carbanion attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   [NCCHCOOEt]⁻ + Br(CH₂)₅Br → NCCH(COOEt)(CH₂)₅Br + Br⁻\n3.  The problem states *excess* sodium hydride is used. This means the remaining acidic α-hydrogen on the intermediate is also removed, forming a new carbanion.\n    *   NCCH(COOEt)(CH₂)₅Br + NaH → [NCC(COOEt)(CH₂)₅Br]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n4.  This carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentane chain and displacing the second bromide ion to form a six-membered ring.\n*   **Final Product 4:** 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane\n\n**¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nNow we must determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals for 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\nThe structure is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₂CH₃) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\nAt room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. This rapid interconversion creates a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, and the two substituents on C1. We must count the sets of hydrogens that are chemically non-equivalent in this averaged structure.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-O**CH₂**-) are chemically equivalent to each other but distinct from all other protons. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent to each other. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   Due to the plane of symmetry, the ring positions C2 and C6 are equivalent. Likewise, C3 and C5 are equivalent. Position C4 is unique.\n    *   **C2 and C6 Protons:** The two protons on C2 (and C6) are diastereotopic. This is because C1 is a prochiral center, and there is no local symmetry that makes the two geminal protons equivalent. Therefore, they have different chemical shifts. Since C2 and C6 are equivalent, this results in two distinct signals for the four protons at these positions. **2 signals**.\n    *   **C3 and C5 Protons:** Similarly, the geminal protons on C3 (and C5) are diastereotopic. This gives another two distinct signals for the four protons at these positions. **2 signals**.\n    *   **C4 Protons:** The two protons on C4 lie on the axis of symmetry. Reflection through the molecular plane of symmetry interchanges them, making them enantiotopic. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent and give a single signal. **1 signal**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nAdding up the signals from all parts of the molecule:\n*   From ethyl group: 1 (CH₂) + 1 (CH₃) = 2 signals\n*   From cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 1 (C4) = 5 signals\n\nTotal distinct signals = 2 + 5 = 7.\n\nHowever, 7 is not one of the options provided (A) 5, B) 12, C) 10, D) 8). Let's re-examine the assumptions. It is a common simplification in introductory problems to consider the protons on a given methylene group in a symmetrically substituted ring (like C2/C6, C3/C5, and C4 here) as equivalent, even though they are technically diastereotopic or enantiotopic. This simplification assumes that the difference in chemical shift is negligible or that the question is not asking for this level of detail.\n\nLet's apply this simplification:\n*   Ethyl group: 2 signals (CH₂ and CH₃).\n*   Cyclohexane Ring (simplified):\n    *   C2/C6 protons (4H): **1 signal**.\n    *   C3/C5 protons (4H): **1 signal**.\n    *   C4 protons (2H): **1 signal**.\n*   Total signals (simplified) = 2 (ethyl) + 3 (ring) = **5 signals**.\n\nThis result matches option A. Given the multiple-choice format, it is highly probable that this simplified analysis, which relies on the overall symmetry of the ring positions (C2=C6, C3=C5, C4=unique), is the intended approach.\n\nFinal check:\n*   Signal 1: -O**CH₂**CH₃ (quartet)\n*   Signal 2: -OCH₂**CH₃** (triplet)\n*   Signal 3: Protons on C2 and C6 (multiplet)\n*   Signal 4: Protons on C3 and C5 (multiplet)\n*   Signal 5: Protons on C4 (multiplet)\n\nThis gives a total of 5 distinct signals.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Trace the reaction sequence:** Determine the chemical structure of each intermediate product (1, 2, 3) and the final product (4).\n2.  **Analyze the final structure:** Examine the structure of product 4 for any elements of symmetry.\n3.  **Count distinct hydrogens:** Based on the symmetry, identify all groups of chemically non-equivalent hydrogens. The number of these groups corresponds to the number of signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n4.  **Provide the code:** Write a Python script that prints the final count and the corresponding multiple-choice option.\n\n**Step-by-step Derivations:**\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) undergoes alpha-bromination. This reaction replaces one of the alpha-hydrogens with a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH)\n*   **Reaction 2:** Product 1 (a carboxylic acid) reacts with ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst (H2SO4). This is a Fischer esterification.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3)\n*   **Reaction 3:** Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN-) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an SN2 reaction.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3)\n*   **Reaction 4:** This is a tandem deprotonation-alkylation-cyclization reaction.\n    1.  Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, removes a proton from the carbon between the cyano and ester groups, which is the most acidic position.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion attacks one of the bromine atoms on 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    3.  The excess NaH removes the second proton from the same carbon.\n    4.  The new carbanion performs an intramolecular attack on the other end of the pentane chain, closing a ring. This forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate\n\n**Analysis of Final Product (4) for 1H NMR:**\n\nThe final product is Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. To count the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we look for symmetry.\n\n*   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through C1 (the carbon with the substituents), C4, the cyano group, and the ester group (considering time-averaging from free rotation).\n*   Due to this symmetry and the rapid chair-flipping of the cyclohexane ring at room temperature, we can identify the following distinct sets of hydrogens:\n    1.  **-CH3 protons:** The three hydrogens on the methyl part of the ethyl ester are equivalent. (1 signal)\n    2.  **-OCH2- protons:** The two hydrogens on the methylene part of the ethyl ester are equivalent. (1 signal)\n    3.  **C2/C6 protons:** The four hydrogens on carbons 2 and 6 of the ring are equivalent to each other.

(1 signal)\n    5.  **C4 protons:** The two hydrogens on carbon 4 of the ring are equivalent to each other.

This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid (the methyl group) is brominated.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) of bromoacetic acid reacts with ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-), a good nucleophile, attacks the carbon bearing the bromine atom (a good leaving group).\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a multi-step process involving alkylation and cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes a proton from the carbon atom situated between the electron-withdrawing cyano (-CN) and ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH2CH3) groups. These protons are particularly acidic (pKa ≈ 11).\n        `NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂`\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion (enolate) acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)₅-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)₅-Br + Br⁻`\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation and Cyclization (Thorpe-Ziegler reaction):** The problem states \"excess sodium hydride\". This means there is enough base to deprotonate the remaining acidic proton on the alpha-carbon of the intermediate formed above.\n        `NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)₅-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)₅-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂`\n        The resulting carbanion is now positioned to attack the other end of the pentane chain, which still has a bromine atom. This intramolecular SN2 reaction is highly favorable as it forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n    4.  **Final Product 4:** The product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH2CH3) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry and Conformation:** Cyclohexane rings exist in rapidly interconverting chair conformations at room temperature. However, for the purpose of counting chemically distinct protons in complex substituted rings, it is a common convention in academic problems to consider a single, \"locked\" or \"frozen\" chair conformation. In this state, the molecule lacks any plane of symmetry and is chiral.\n*   **Counting the Signals (assuming a locked conformation):**\n    1.  **Ring Protons:** In a locked, unsymmetrical cyclohexane derivative, all the methylene groups (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are in chemically different environments. Furthermore, the two protons on each methylene group (one axial, one equatorial) are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.\n        *   Protons on C2: 2 distinct signals.\n        *   Protons on C3: 2 distinct signals.\n        *   Protons on C4: 2 distinct signals.\n        *   Protons on C5: 2 distinct signals.\n        *   Protons on C6: 2 distinct signals.\n        This gives a total of **10 distinct signals** from the protons on the cyclohexane ring.\n    2.  **Ethoxycarbonyl Group Protons (-COOCH2CH3):**\n        *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   **Methylene Protons (-O-CH2-):** In many introductory contexts, the two protons of the ethyl's methylene group are treated as equivalent, giving one signal (a quartet). Although they are technically diastereotopic in a chiral molecule (like our locked conformation) and should give two signals, it is a frequent simplification in problems of this type to count them as one.\n        *   Assuming this common simplification, the methylene protons give **1 signal**.\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   From the ring: 10 signals\n    *   From the ethyl group: 1 (for -CH2-) + 1 (for -CH3-) = 2 signals\n    *   Total = 10 + 2 = **12 signals**.\n\nThis number matches one of the given options. The alternative analysis (assuming rapid chair flipping) leads to 7 signals, which is not an option. The alternative reaction product (a dimer) leads to a mixture of diastereomers, making the analysis inconsistent with a single number answer. Therefore, the most plausible intended answer is derived from the analysis of the major cyclized product under the assumption of a locked conformation.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This is an alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid, a reaction similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. Bromine is added to the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group).\n*   **Product 1:** Br-CH2-COOH (Bromoacetic acid).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl bromoacetate).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a strong nucleophile that displaces the bromide ion via an SN2 reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a two-step alkylation process followed by cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** The hydrogens on the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups are acidic (pKa ≈ 11). The strong base NaH removes one proton to form a stable carbanion (enolate).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one of the carbons bearing a bromine atom on 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation & Cyclization:** Since excess NaH is used, the remaining acidic proton on the alpha-carbon is removed to form a new carbanion. This carbanion then attacks the other end of the pentyl chain in an intramolecular SN2 reaction, displacing the second bromide and forming a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**Step 5: 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n*   **Structure:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This, along with free rotation of the ester group, creates a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group. This makes the molecule achiral on the NMR timescale.\n*   **Consequences of Symmetry:**\n    *   The two sides of the ring are equivalent: C2 is equivalent to C6, and C3 is equivalent to C5.\n*   **Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Signals:**\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH2CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the terminal methyl (-CH3) group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene (-CH2-) group are rendered enantiotopic by the molecular plane of symmetry. Enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR experiment. This gives **1 signal**.\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n        *   **C2 and C6 protons:** These positions are equivalent. The two protons on C2 (one axial, one equatorial in any given chair conformation) are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation of the molecule. They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. The same is true for C6. Since C2 and C6 are equivalent, the protons on these two carbons give a total of **2 signals**.\n        *   **C3 and C5 protons:** These positions are equivalent. Similar to C2/C6, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. This pair of positions contributes **2 signals**.\n        *   **C4 protons:** This position lies on the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on C4 are diastereotopic. This is because replacing one proton with a different group (e.g., Deuterium) would create a diastereomer relative to replacing the other proton (e.g., creating a cis vs. trans relationship to the substituents on C1). Therefore, they are chemically distinct and give **2 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Signal Count:**\n    *   From the ethyl group: 1 (for -CH3) + 1 (for -CH2-) = 2 signals.\n    *   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (for C2/C6) + 2 (for C3/C5) + 2 (for C4) = 6 signals.\n    *   **Total = 2 + 6 = 8 distinct hydrogen signals.**\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the final product.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Synthesis**\n\n1.  **Acetic acid with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride:** This is an α-bromination reaction of acetic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction.

For determining the number of chemically distinct protons, we should consider this static conformation.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ethoxycarbonyl group. This plane makes the left and right sides of the ring equivalent.\n*   **Ethyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n    1.  The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **one signal**.\n    2.  The two protons of the methylene group (-CH₂-) are adjacent to the prochiral C1 center. In many introductory contexts, these are treated as equivalent, giving **one signal**.\n*   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   Because the ring is in a locked conformation, the axial and equatorial protons on each carbon are chemically distinct unless related by symmetry.\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n    3.  **H-axial on C2 and C6:** These two protons are equivalent.

Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is brominated at the alpha-carbon.\n    *   Product 1 is **bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 + Ethanol + H₂SO₄ → Product 2**\n    This is a Fischer esterification. Bromoacetic acid is reacted with ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n    *   Product 2 is **ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 + Sodium Cyanide → Product 3**\n    This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   Product 3 is **ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 + excess Sodium Hydride + 1,5-dibromopentane → Product 4**\n    This is a multi-step process in one pot.\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is acidic due to the two adjacent electron-withdrawing groups (cyano and ester).\n        *   NCCH₂COOEt + NaH → [NCCHCOOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    *   The resulting carbanion (an enolate) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br) in an SN2 reaction.\n        *   [NCCHCOOEt]⁻ + Br(CH₂)₅Br → NCCH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br + Br⁻\n    *   The problem states *excess* sodium hydride is used. The mono-alkylated product still has one acidic proton on the α-carbon. The excess NaH will deprotonate this carbon again.\n        *   NCCH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br + NaH → [NCC(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    *   The resulting carbanion is now part of the same molecule as an alkyl bromide. It will undergo an intramolecular SN2 reaction, attacking the carbon bearing the bromine. This forms a cyclic compound. The ring will consist of the α-carbon and the five carbons of the pentane chain, resulting in a 6-membered ring.\n    *   Product 4 is **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane):**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we need to analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. The time-averaged conformation has a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, the two substituents, and the opposite carbon, C4.\n*   **Chemical Equivalence:** Protons that can be interchanged by a symmetry operation (like this plane of reflection) are chemically equivalent and will have the same chemical shift. Protons that cannot be interchanged are chemically distinct.\n\nLet's count the distinct proton environments:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   **-CH₃:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **-OCH₂-:** The two protons of the methylene group are enantiotopic because they are related by the plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry relates the protons on C2 with C6, and C3 with C5.\n    *   **C2 and C6:** These two carbons are equivalent. On each carbon, there is an axial and an equatorial proton. These two protons (e.g., H2-ax and H2-eq) are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. Because C2 and C6 are equivalent, the two axial protons (H2-ax, H6-ax) form one set, and the two equatorial protons (H2-eq, H6-eq) form another. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **C3 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent. Similar to the C2/C6 case, the axial protons (H3-ax, H5-ax) are equivalent to each other, and the equatorial protons (H3-eq, H5-eq) are equivalent to each other. The axial and equatorial protons on the same carbon are distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. The two protons attached to it (H4-ax and H4-eq) are diastereotopic and not interchangeable. They are in different chemical environments. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\n*   From the ethyl group: 1 (CH₃) + 1 (OCH₂) = 2 signals\n*   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = 6 signals\n*   **Total = 2 + 6 = 8 distinct hydrogen signals.**\n\nThe analysis of the reaction sequence leads to 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane. The symmetry analysis of this molecule reveals 8 chemically distinct sets of protons.\n\nFinal check of the logic:\n- Reaction sequence is standard and correct.\n- Final product structure is correct.\n- Symmetry analysis of a 1,1-disubstituted cyclohexane is standard. The presence of a symmetry plane simplifies the spectrum but does not make all ring protons equivalent. Axial and equatorial protons on the same carbon are diastereotopic (unless other symmetries are present), and thus distinct. Protons on carbons related by the symmetry plane are equivalent.\n- C2-Hax is equivalent to C6-Hax.\n- C2-Heq is equivalent to C6-Heq.\n- C3-Hax is equivalent to C5-Hax.\n- C3-Heq is equivalent to C5-Heq.\n- C4-Hax is distinct from C4-Heq.\n- OCH₂ protons are enantiotopic and thus equivalent in an achiral solvent.\n- CH₃ protons are equivalent.\n- Total count: 1(CH₃) + 1(OCH₂) + 1(C2/6ax) + 1(C2/6eq) + 1(C3/5ax) + 1(C3/5eq) + 1(C4ax) + 1(C4eq) = 8 signals.\n\nThe reasoning is sound.\n\nThe final product, 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane, has the following distinct proton environments:\n\n1.  The three protons of the methyl group in the ethyl ester.\n2.  The two protons of the methylene group in the ethyl ester (these are enantiotopic and thus chemically equivalent).\n3.  The two axial protons on carbons 2 and 6 of the cyclohexane ring.\n4.  The two equatorial protons on carbons 2 and 6 of the cyclohexane ring.\n5.  The two axial protons on carbons 3 and 5 of the cyclohexane ring.\n6.  The two equatorial protons on carbons 3 and 5 of the cyclohexane ring.\n7.  The axial proton on carbon 4 of the cyclohexane ring.\n8.  The equatorial proton on carbon 4 of the cyclohexane ring.\n\nThis gives a total of 8 distinct signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the final product.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Synthesis**\n\n1.  **Product 1:** Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride. This is an alpha-bromination reaction, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. Acetic anhydride and pyridine facilitate the formation of an enol or enolate, which then reacts with bromine. The product is bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Product 2:** Bromoacetic acid is heated with ethanol and sulfuric acid. This is a classic Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester. The product is ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Product 3:** Ethyl bromoacetate is treated with sodium cyanide. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an Sₙ2 reaction. The product is ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Product 4:** Ethyl cyanoacetate is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    *   NaH, a strong base, removes an acidic proton from the carbon between the cyano and carbonyl groups.\n    *   The resulting carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in a nucleophilic substitution.\n    *   Because excess NaH is used, the remaining acidic proton on the same carbon is removed, forming another carbanion.\n    *   This carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other bromine-bearing carbon at the end of the pentane chain. This cyclization forms a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   The final product (4) is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### **¹H NMR Analysis of the Final Product**\n\nThe structure of the final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. To determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n          CN\n          |\n       /--C--\\\n      |       |\n     CH₂     CH₂\n     |       |\n     CH₂     CH₂\n      \\--CH₂--/\n          |\n         C=O\n          |\n          O\n          |\n         CH₂\n          |\n         CH₃\n    ```\n\n*   **Symmetry and Chemical Equivalence:**\n    1.  The central carbon of the cyclohexane ring (C1) is bonded to four different groups: a cyano group (-CN), an ethyl carboxylate group (-COOEt), and two different paths around the ring. This makes C1 a chiral center.\n    2.  Due to the presence of this chiral center, the molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n    3.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the terminal methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent due to free rotation and will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene (-OCH₂-) group are adjacent to the chiral center (C1). This makes them diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent and will produce **2 distinct signals**.\n    4.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n        *   At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. This process averages the signals of the axial and equatorial protons on each carbon.\n        *   However, because the molecule as a whole is asymmetric, the five methylene (CH₂) groups of the ring are all in chemically different environments. The CH₂ group at C2 is not equivalent to the one at C6, and the one at C3 is not equivalent to C5. The CH₂ group at C4 is also unique.\n        *   Therefore, there are **5 distinct signals** for the protons on the cyclohexane ring.\n\n*   **Total Signal Count:**\n    *   From the ethyl group: 1 (for -CH₃) + 2 (for -OCH₂-) = 3 signals\n    *   From the cyclohexane ring: 5 signals\n    *   Total = 3 + 5 = **8 signals**\n\nThus, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the ¹H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an alpha-bromination of a carboxylic acid, a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. Acetic acid has one alpha-carbon (the methyl group). The reaction brominates this position.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (Br-CH2-COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion, which is a good leaving group.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a two-step alkylation followed by cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH is a strong base that removes an acidic alpha-proton from ethyl cyanoacetate. The protons on the CH2 group between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups are acidic due to the electron-withdrawing nature of both groups.\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion (enolate) is a good nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The problem states \"excess NaH\", which means there is enough base to remove the second, now only, alpha-proton.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    4.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The newly formed carbanion attacks the other end of the carbon chain at the carbon bearing the second bromine atom. This is an intramolecular SN2 reaction. The chain consists of the alpha-carbon and the five carbons from the pentane chain, leading to the formation of a stable 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the structure and symmetry of Product 4.\n\n1.  **Conformation and Stability:** Cyclohexane rings exist in chair conformations. Product 4 has two bulky substituents on C1: a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3). These two groups can be arranged in two different chair conformations:\n    *   Conformer A: -COOEt (equatorial), -CN (axial)\n    *   Conformer B: -COOEt (axial), -CN (equatorial)\n    The ethoxycarbonyl group is bulkier than the cyano group. The conformer with the larger group in the more stable equatorial position will be the major conformer. Therefore, Conformer A is the dominant species in solution. At room temperature, the population of Conformer B will be very low. For the purpose of analyzing the spectrum, we can consider only the signals from the major conformer (Conformer A).\n\n2.  **Symmetry of the Major Conformer:** Let's analyze the symmetry of Conformer A (COOEt equatorial, CN axial). This conformer lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule in this conformation is **chiral**.\n\n3.  **Counting the Ring Protons:** Because the major conformer is chiral, no two protons on the ring are equivalent by symmetry (unless by accidental equivalence).\n    *   The ring has five CH2 groups (at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, C6).\n    *   Within each CH2 group, the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.\n    *   Since there is no symmetry, the CH2 group at C2 is different from C6, and C3 is different from C5. All five CH2 groups are in unique chemical environments.\n    *   Therefore, all 10 protons on the cyclohexane ring (5 axial, 5 equatorial) are chemically distinct.\n    *   **Number of signals from ring protons = 10.**\n\n4.  **Counting the Ethyl Group Protons:** The ethyl group (-O-CH2-CH3) is attached to the ring.\n    *   **-CH3 group:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to rapid rotation around the C-C bond. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **-O-CH2- group:** In many introductory problems, the two protons of an ethyl group's CH2 are treated as equivalent. This is a simplification. Rigorously, since these protons are in a chiral molecule, they are diastereotopic and should give two distinct signals. However, multiple-choice questions often rely on common simplifications. If we apply the simplification that they are equivalent, they give **1 signal**.\n\n5.  **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Using the simplification for the ethyl group:\n        Total signals = (Signals from ring) + (Signals from ethyl group)\n        Total signals = 10 + (1 for -CH2- + 1 for -CH3) = 10 + 2 = 12.\n\nThis result (12) matches one of the options. This line of reasoning requires assuming that one conformer is dominant (which is chemically sound) and that the diastereotopicity of the ethyl CH2 protons is ignored (a common simplification in this type of problem).\n\nLet's briefly consider the rigorous count: 10 signals from the ring + 3 signals from the ethyl group (2 for the diastereotopic CH2, 1 for CH3) = 13 signals. This is not an option.\nLet's consider the fast-flipping average model: 3 ring signals + 2 ethyl signals = 5 signals (Option D). This ignores the key information that the stable conformer is chiral and that \"chemically distinct\" protons should be counted.\nThe analysis leading to 12 signals is the most plausible interpretation that matches an answer choice.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n*   Ring Protons (C2-Hax, C2-Heq, C3-Hax, C3-Heq, C4-Hax, C4-Heq, C5-Hax, C5-Heq, C6-Hax, C6-Heq): 10 distinct signals\n*   Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH2CH3): 2 distinct signals (one for CH2, one for CH3, using a common simplification)\n*   Total = 10 + 2 = 12\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the final product and the analysis of its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Bromine (Br2), Pyridine, Acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This is an alpha-bromination of a carboxylic acid, a reaction similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is brominated.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH), Ethanol (CH3CH2OH), Sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3), Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3), excess Sodium hydride (NaH), 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a sequence involving deprotonation and alkylation.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH, a strong base, removes a proton from the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOCH2CH3) groups, as this proton is highly acidic. This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)₅-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)₅-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Cyclization:** The problem states \"excess sodium hydride,\" which means there is still base present to deprotonate the remaining acidic alpha-hydrogen on the newly formed intermediate.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)₅-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)₅-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n        This new carbanion then undergoes a rapid intramolecular SN2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain. This cyclization is highly favored as it forms a stable 6-membered ring (a Thorpe-Ziegler reaction).\n*   **Product 4:** The resulting product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we need to analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n1.  **Symmetry:** The two substituents on C1 (-CN and -COOCH2CH3) are different. This means the molecule has no plane of symmetry and is chiral. Consequently, any protons that are not interchangeable by rapid conformational changes (like bond rotation or ring flipping) are chemically distinct.\n\n2.  **Analysis at Room Temperature (Rapid Chair Flip):**\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   The cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-to-chair interconversion. This process averages the chemical environments of the axial and equatorial protons on any single carbon atom.\n        *   However, the carbons of the ring are in different chemical environments due to the asymmetric substitution at C1.\n        *   C2 and C6 are adjacent to C1 but are non-equivalent because one is \"closer\" to the cyano group and the other is \"closer\" to the ester group in 3D space. The two protons on C2 become equivalent due to the rapid flip, giving one signal. The two protons on C6 also become equivalent, giving a second, different signal.\n        *   Similarly, C3 and C5 are non-equivalent. This gives two more distinct signals.\n        *   C4 is in a unique position, opposite to C1. Its two protons become equivalent, giving a fifth signal.\n        *   Therefore, the ten protons on the cyclohexane ring produce **5 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH2CH3) Group Protons:**\n        *   **Methylene (-O-CH2-) Protons:** The molecule is chiral. The two protons of the methylene group are adjacent to a carbonyl group which is attached to the chiral framework. This makes the two methylene protons diastereotopic. Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and give rise to separate signals, regardless of conformational changes. Thus, they produce **2 distinct signals**.\n        *   **Methyl (-CH3) Protons:** The three protons of the terminal methyl group are equivalent due to rapid rotation around the C-C bond. They produce **1 distinct signal**.\n\n3.  **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Summing up the signals from all parts of the molecule:\n    *   5 (from the ring) + 2 (from -OCH2-) + 1 (from -CH3) = **8 distinct signals**.\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens. Based on the most likely product and a standard analysis of its NMR spectrum at room temperature, there are 8 distinct sets of hydrogens.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the final product and the analysis of its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid, a reaction analogous to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) has one α-carbon (the methyl group). One of the α-hydrogens is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid (bromoacetic acid) reacts with an alcohol (ethanol, CH₃CH₂OH) in the presence of an acid catalyst (H₂SO₄) to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻), which is a good leaving group.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a sequence involving deprotonation and alkylation, leading to cyclization. It's a variation of the malonic ester synthesis.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes an acidic α-proton from ethyl cyanoacetate. The protons on the CH₂ group are acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group, -CN, and an ester group, -COOCH₂CH₃).\n        `NC-CH₂-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂`\n    2.  **Alkylation & Cyclization:** The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule. Since excess base is used, the remaining α-proton is also removed, and the new carbanion performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentane chain to form a stable six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nNow, we must determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum of 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents (-CN and -COOCH₂CH₃) on the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry:** Because the two substituents on C1 are different, the molecule is chiral and lacks a plane of symmetry. A rigorous analysis would suggest that all 10 protons on the cyclohexane ring are chemically distinct, and the two protons of the ethyl group's -CH₂- are also distinct (diastereotopic), leading to 13 signals. Since 13 is not an option, a simplified model, common in academic problems, is required.\n\n*   **Simplified Analysis:**\n    The most common simplification for such a molecule is to assume an \"effective\" plane of symmetry that passes through C1 and C4 of the ring. This simplification treats the influence of the two different substituents as being averaged out from the perspective of the ring protons. We also simplify by treating the two protons on the ethyl -CH₂- group as equivalent.\n\n    Let's count the signals based on this simplified model:\n\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene (-CH₂-) group are treated as equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   Under the pseudo-symmetry model, C2 is equivalent to C6, and C3 is equivalent to C5. C4 is unique.\n        *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The axial and equatorial protons on these carbons are in different chemical environments (diastereotopic). The two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent to each other. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** Similarly, the four protons on these two carbons give **2 signals** (one for the two axial H's, one for the two equatorial H's).\n        *   **Protons on C4:** The axial and equatorial protons on C4 are diastereotopic and thus non-equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   *Total from ring = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals.*\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    Adding the signals from the ethyl group and the ring: 2 (from ethyl) + 6 (from ring) = **8 signals**.\n\nThis result corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Analysis:** This is an α-halogenation reaction of a carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The α-carbon of acetic acid is the methyl group. One of the α-hydrogens is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a variation of the malonic ester synthesis for forming a cyclic compound.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH is a strong base that removes an acidic α-hydrogen from the carbon between the cyano and ester groups, forming a stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since excess NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining α-hydrogen on the newly substituted carbon.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    4.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The carbanion on the α-carbon now attacks the carbon at the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion. This is an intramolecular SN2 reaction that forms a six-membered ring, which is thermodynamically favorable.\n*   **Final Product 4:** The resulting molecule is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**Structure of Final Product 4:**\n```\n      CN\n      |\n C1 -- C(=O)OCH2CH3\n/  \\\nC6--C2\n|    |\nC5--C3\n \\  /\n  C4\n```\nWhere C1 to C6 form the cyclohexane ring.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nTo find the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we need to identify all the sets of chemically non-equivalent protons in the molecule. The question specifies that we should count all chemically distinct hydrogens, even if their signals might overlap in a real spectrum.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH2CH3):**\n    *   **-CH3 (methyl) protons:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation around the C-C bond. They will produce **1 signal**.\n    *   **-OCH2- (methylene) protons:** These two protons are diastereotopic. This is because the carbon they are attached to is linked via the ester group to C1 of the cyclohexane ring, which is a prochiral center (it's bonded to four different groups: CN, COOEt, C2 of the ring, and C6 of the ring). Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and will produce two distinct signals. Therefore, this group gives **2 signals**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The ring has five methylene (CH2) groups. At room temperature, the rapid chair-chair interconversion averages the axial and equatorial environments for each CH2 group. This means the two protons on any single carbon (e.g., C2) become chemically equivalent on the NMR timescale and produce a single signal.\n    *   Now we must compare the different CH2 groups (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) to see which are equivalent.\n    *   The two substituents on C1 (-CN and -COOEt) are different. This lack of symmetry means that the environment on one side of the ring is different from the other.\n    *   **C2 vs. C6:** C2 is adjacent to C1. C6 is also adjacent to C1. However, there is no plane of symmetry passing through C1 and C4 because the substituents are different. Therefore, the protons on C2 are in a different chemical environment than the protons on C6. They are non-equivalent.\n    *   **C3 vs. C5:** C3 is adjacent to C2, while C5 is adjacent to C6. Since C2 and C6 are non-equivalent, C3 and C5 are also non-equivalent.\n    *   **C4:** The C4 position is unique.\n    *   Therefore, all five methylene groups on the ring are in chemically distinct environments. This results in **5 signals** from the ring protons.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\n*   From the ethyl -CH3 group: 1 signal\n*   From the ethyl -OCH2- group: 2 signals\n*   From the five ring -CH2- groups: 5 signals\n\nTotal = 1 + 2 + 5 = 8 distinct hydrogen signals.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the final product's structure, followed by an analysis of its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Reaction Sequence**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n    *   Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is treated with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride. This set of reagents is used for the α-bromination of the carboxylic acid, a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction.\n    *   **Product 1** is 2-bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n    *   Product 1 (2-bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction.\n    *   **Product 2** is ethyl 2-bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n    *   Product 2 (ethyl 2-bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   **Product 3** is ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n    *   Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH₂)₅Br).\n    *   Sodium hydride is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is acidic due to the two adjacent electron-withdrawing groups (cyano and ester).\n    *   The resulting carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion and forming an intermediate.\n    *   Because excess NaH is used, the α-carbon is deprotonated again. This new carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromide ion.\n    *   This intramolecular cyclization forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4** is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **¹H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring substituted at the C1 position with both a cyano (-CN) group and an ethyl carboxylate (-COOCH₂CH₃) group.\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must identify all the protons that are in chemically non-equivalent environments. The question specifies that we should count all *chemically distinct* hydrogens, even if rapid conformational changes might make them appear equivalent in a standard room-temperature NMR spectrum. This means we must consider the protons in a fixed chair conformation, as diastereotopic protons are fundamentally chemically distinct.\n\nThe molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group. This symmetry makes pairs of protons equivalent.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons:**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent to each other. This is **Signal 1**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are equivalent to each other. This is **Signal 2**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   In a chair conformation, each carbon (from C2 to C6) has an axial and an equatorial proton. These are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6. However, the axial proton (H_ax) and equatorial proton (H_eq) on C2 are diastereotopic. Therefore, the two axial protons (at C2 and C6) give one signal, and the two equatorial protons give another.\n        *   **Signal 3:** H_ax at C2 and C6.\n        *   **Signal 4:** H_eq at C2 and C6.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** Similarly, the protons on C3 are equivalent to those on C5. The axial and equatorial protons are distinct.\n        *   **Signal 5:** H_ax at C3 and C5.\n        *   **Signal 6:** H_eq at C3 and C5.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** The two protons on C4 are also diastereotopic. They are not equivalent to any other protons in the molecule.\n        *   **Signal 7:** H_ax at C4.\n        *   **Signal 8:** H_eq at C4.\n\nCounting these distinct sets gives a total of 8 signals.\n\n*   **2 signals** from the ethyl group.\n*   **6 signals** from the cyclohexane ring.\n\nTotal = 2 + 6 = **8** distinct hydrogen signals.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of hydrogen signals in the final product.\n\n### **Reaction Sequence Analysis**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n    *   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH), bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n    *   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is used for the alpha-bromination of the carboxylic acid. This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction.\n    *   **Product 1:** 2-Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH₂COOH), ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH), and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a classic Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl 2-bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl 2-bromoacetate), and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻).\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl 2-cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl 2-cyanoacetate), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH₂)₅Br).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a sequential deprotonation and alkylation process.\n        *   First, NaH, a strong base, removes an acidic α-proton from ethyl 2-cyanoacetate to form an enolate.\n        *   This enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion.\n        *   The use of *excess* NaH ensures that the second, and now only, α-proton is also removed, creating a new enolate.\n        *   This new enolate undergoes a rapid intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction (a Thorpe-Ziegler type cyclization), attacking the other end of the pentyl chain to displace the second bromide ion. This forms a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n### **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring substituted at the C1 position with both a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₂CH₃) group.\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the chemical equivalence of the protons in the molecule.\n\n1.  **Symmetry:** The two substituents on C1, cyano and ethoxycarbonyl, are different in terms of size and electronic properties. Therefore, the molecule is asymmetric and does not possess a plane of symmetry. The C1 carbon is a chiral center, and the product is a racemic mixture.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   Because there is no plane of symmetry, the two sides of the ring are not equivalent. This means that the protons on C2 are not equivalent to the protons on C6, and the protons on C3 are not equivalent to the protons on C5.\n    *   Furthermore, in a substituted cyclohexane ring, the two protons on any given methylene (CH₂) group (the axial and equatorial protons) are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent.\n    *   Therefore, all ten protons on the cyclohexane ring are chemically distinct.\n        *   C2: 2 distinct protons (axial and equatorial).\n        *   C3: 2 distinct protons (axial and equatorial).\n        *   C4: 2 distinct protons (axial and equatorial).\n        *   C5: 2 distinct protons (axial and equatorial).\n        *   C6: 2 distinct protons (axial and equatorial).\n    *   This gives a total of **10 signals** from the ring protons.\n\n3.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃) Protons:**\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃):** The three protons of the terminal methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation around the carbon-carbon bond. They will produce **1 signal**.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (-OCH₂-):** These two protons are adjacent to the ester oxygen and beta to the chiral center at C1. Protons that are adjacent to a chiral center are typically diastereotopic and chemically non-equivalent. However, in multiple-choice questions of this nature, it is a common simplification to consider them equivalent if they are not part of a rigid ring structure, as their chemical shift difference might be negligible. If we apply this simplification, these two protons give rise to **1 signal**.\n\n### **Total Number of Signals**\n\nSumming the signals from all parts of the molecule based on the analysis above:\n*   Ring Protons: 10 signals\n*   Ethyl Methylene Protons (-OCH₂-): 1 signal (with simplification)\n*   Ethyl Methyl Protons (-CH₃): 1 signal\n\nTotal Signals = 10 + 1 + 1 = 12.\n\nThis corresponds to option B. If the diastereotopic nature of the -OCH₂- protons were strictly considered, the total would be 13, which is not an option. If the ring were assumed to be symmetric (a chemically inaccurate simplification), the answer would be 8 (Option A). The most chemically sound interpretation that matches an available option is 12.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n*   **Starting Material:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂, pyridine, acetic anhydride, heat.\n*   This set of reagents performs an α-bromination of the carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. One of the α-hydrogens (on the methyl group) is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n**Step 2: 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n*   **Starting Material (1):** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH), H₂SO₄ (acid catalyst), heat.\n*   This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction, where the carboxylic acid is converted to an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 3: 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n*   **Starting Material (2):** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile and will displace the bromide leaving group in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 4: 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n*   **Starting Material (3):** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess Sodium Hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br).\n*   **Analysis of the reaction:**\n    1.  The protons on the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic (pKa ≈ 11) because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt). Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, will deprotonate this carbon to form a resonance-stabilized enolate: [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻.\n    2.  This enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion. This is the first alkylation step, forming an intermediate: NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br.\n    3.  The problem states that **excess** NaH is used. This is a crucial piece of information. The intermediate formed in the previous step still has one acidic proton on the α-carbon. The excess NaH will deprotonate this intermediate to form a new carbanion: [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br]⁻.\n    4.  This carbanion will then undergo a rapid intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction. The nucleophilic carbon attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a six-membered ring. This type of reaction (tandem alkylation-cyclization) is a standard and efficient method for synthesizing cyclic compounds.\n*   **Final Product 4:** The product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group and an ethoxycarbonyl group attached to the same carbon (C1). The structure is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**Determining the number of 1H NMR signals for Product 4.**\n*   **Structure of Product 4:**\n        CN\n        |\n     C1-CO-O-CH₂-CH₃\n    / \\\n H₂C---CH₂\n |     |\n H₂C---CH₂\n   \\ /\n    CH₂\n\n*   To determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. The C1 carbon is attached to four different groups: -CN, -COOEt, and two connections to the ring (-CH₂-). Because the two substituents on C1 (CN and COOEt) are different, the molecule is **chiral**. The reaction produces a racemic mixture.\n*   In a chiral molecule lacking any symmetry elements, all constitutionally non-equivalent protons are also chemically non-equivalent. Let's count the sets of non-equivalent protons, assuming we are observing the spectrum under conditions where diastereotopic protons can be resolved (as suggested by the phrasing \"number of chemically distinct hydrogens\").\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent due to free rotation. This is **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene (-OCH₂-) group are diastereotopic due to the presence of the chiral center (C1). Therefore, they are chemically distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   Since the molecule is chiral, there is no plane of symmetry. Therefore, the carbons C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6 are all in unique chemical environments.\n    *   Furthermore, on each of these methylene groups, the two protons (one axial, one equatorial in a given chair conformation) are diastereotopic. This means all 10 protons on the cyclohexane ring are chemically distinct. This gives **10 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   From the ring: 10 signals\n    *   From the ethyl group: 2 signals (from -OCH₂-) + 1 signal (from -CH₃) = 3 signals.\n    *   Total = 10 + 3 = 13 distinct hydrogen signals.\n\nThis number (13) is not among the options. This suggests that a different interpretation or counting convention is intended. Let's reconsider the counting. Often, in the context of such problems, a group like a diastereotopic CH₂ is counted as a single \"signal\" or multiplet. Let's apply this convention.\n\n*   **Re-evaluation using a different counting convention:**\n    1.  **Ethyl Group:** The -CH₃ group is **1 signal**. The diastereotopic -OCH₂- group is considered **1 signal** (which would be a complex multiplet). Total from ethyl = 2 signals.\n    2.  **Ring Protons:** In a chiral molecule, all 10 ring protons are distinct. This means we have 10 non-equivalent protons, which would give **10 signals**. (H-2ax, H-2eq, H-3ax, H-3eq, etc. are all unique).\n    3.  **Total:** 10 (ring) + 2 (ethyl) = **12 signals**.\n\nThis count matches one of the options. This interpretation assumes that the question asks for the number of distinct proton environments, considering the full stereochemistry (no symmetry), but groups the two diastereotopic protons of the ethyl CH₂ as a single signal system. This is a common ambiguity in such questions, but given the options, it leads to a plausible answer.\n\nLet's briefly consider other possibilities. If we assume the reaction stops at the linear intermediate **NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br**, there would be 8 constitutionally distinct groups of protons (-CH₃, -OCH₂-, -CH-, and 5 different -CH₂- groups in the chain), yielding 8 signals. While this matches an option, the \"excess NaH\" and the stability of the 6-membered ring make the cyclic product the expected \"final product\". The most rigorous analysis of the cyclic product that matches an option gives 12 signals.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane, and considering its chiral nature, it has 12 distinct sets of hydrogen signals based on the common problem-solving conventions.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThe series of reactions described allows for the step-by-step synthesis of the final product, which is analyzed to determine the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n1.  **Step 1: α-Bromination of Acetic Acid**\n    Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is treated with bromine (Br₂) and pyridine in acetic anhydride. This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction, which results in the bromination of the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group).\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Fischer Esterification**\n    Product 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a Fischer esterification, which converts the carboxylic acid into an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Nucleophilic Substitution**\n    Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Double Alkylation and Cyclization**\n    Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    *   The methylene protons (CH₂) in ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (the cyano group and the ester carbonyl group).\n    *   Sodium hydride, a strong base, removes one of these acidic protons to form a carbanion.\n    *   This carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in a nucleophilic substitution reaction.\n    *   Because excess sodium hydride is used, the second acidic proton on the alpha-carbon is also removed, creating a new carbanion.\n    *   This carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular nucleophilic substitution, attacking the other bromine-bearing carbon at the end of the pentyl chain. This reaction forms a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate.\n\n### ¹H NMR Analysis of Product 4\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the final product, ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate.\n\nThe structure consists of a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethyl carboxylate (-COOCH₂CH₃) group attached to the same carbon (C1). On an NMR timescale, due to the rapid rotation of the ester group, the molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, its substituents, and the opposing C4 carbon of the ring.\n\nThis symmetry has the following consequences for the proton signals:\n*   **Ethyl Group Protons:** The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are chemically equivalent and produce one signal. The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are also equivalent and produce a second, distinct signal.\n*   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to the protons on C6. However, the two protons on C2 itself (one axial, one equatorial) are diastereotopic and thus not equivalent to each other. This results in two distinct signals for the C2/C6 positions.\n    *   Similarly, the protons on C3 are equivalent to the protons on C5. The two protons on C3 (axial and equatorial) are diastereotopic, giving another two distinct signals for the C3/C5 positions.\n    *   The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two protons (axial and equatorial) are diastereotopic and therefore are not chemically equivalent, resulting in two more distinct signals.\n\nCounting these distinct sets of protons:\n1.  -OCH₂CH₃ (Methylene protons)\n2.  -OCH₂CH₃ (Methyl protons)\n3.  Axial protons at C2 and C6\n4.  Equatorial protons at C2 and C6\n5.  Axial protons at C3 and C5\n6.  Equatorial protons at C3 and C5\n7.  Axial proton at C4\n8.  Equatorial proton at C4\n\nIn total, there are **8** chemically distinct hydrogen signals observable in the ¹H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Determine the structure of the final product (4).**\n    *   **Step 1:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with Br2, pyridine, and acetic anhydride. This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction, which causes alpha-bromination of the carboxylic acid. Product 1 is **bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH)**.\n    *   **Step 2:** Product 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and sulfuric acid. This is a classic Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid is converted to an ester. Product 2 is **ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3)**.\n    *   **Step 3:** Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN-) is a good nucleophile and will replace the bromine via an SN2 reaction. Product 3 is **ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3)**.\n    *   **Step 4:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with *excess* sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        *   NaH, a strong base, removes the acidic proton from the carbon between the -CN and -COOEt groups.\n        *   The resulting carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the brominated carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        *   Because NaH is in *excess*, it removes the remaining acidic proton from the alpha-carbon.\n        *   This second carbanion then performs an *intramolecular* SN2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentane chain to form a stable 6-membered ring.\n        *   The final product (4) is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the structure of Product 4 for 1H NMR signals.**\n    *   The structure is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethyl carboxylate group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:** The carbon C1 is attached to four different groups: 1) -CN, 2) -COOCH2CH3, 3) the rest of the ring via C2, and 4) the rest of the ring via C6. Therefore, C1 is a **chiral center**.\n    *   Because the molecule is chiral and has two different substituents on C1, there are no planes of symmetry or rotational axes that would make different positions on the ring equivalent.\n\n3.  **Count the distinct hydrogen signals.**\n    *   **Ethyl group (-OCH2CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the -CH3 group are equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the -OCH2- group are considered equivalent for counting purposes (though technically diastereotopic, they are typically observed as one complex signal). This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **Cyclohexane ring protons:**\n        *   The ring has 5 methylene (-CH2-) groups (at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6).\n        *   Due to the lack of symmetry, all five of these -CH2- groups are in chemically different environments.\n        *   Within each individual -CH2- group, the two protons are diastereotopic (they are in different spatial relationships to the substituents on the chiral center C1). Therefore, the two protons of each -CH2- group are chemically distinct and will produce separate signals.\n        *   Number of signals from the ring = 5 non-equivalent -CH2- groups × 2 distinct protons per group = **10 signals**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total number of signals.**\n    *   Total Signals = (signals from ethyl group) + (signals from ring)\n    *   Total Signals = (1 + 1) + 10 = **12 signals**.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\n# Step-by-step derivation of the final product and analysis of its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n# Reaction Sequence Analysis:\n# 1.

This reaction brominates the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group) of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Reactant:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH). The α-carbon is the methyl carbon.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromination of the α-carbon gives bromoacetic acid.\n    *   **Structure of 1:** Br-CH₂-COOH\n\n**Step 2: 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification.

Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is acidic due to the adjacent electron-withdrawing cyano (-CN) and ethoxycarbonyl (-COOEt) groups. This forms a stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        *   NC-CH₂-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  The enolate acts as a nucleophile. 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br) is a di-alkyl halide, meaning it has two electrophilic carbons. The reaction proceeds by two molecules of the enolate reacting with one molecule of 1,5-dibromopentane, one at each end. This forms a larger, symmetric molecule.\n        *   2 [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH₂)₅-Br → (EtOOC)(NC)CH-(CH₂)₅-CH(CN)(COOEt) + 2Br⁻\n*   **Careful Point:** An alternative reaction is an intramolecular cyclization to form a cyclohexane ring. However, that product would lead to 13 distinct signals (or 12 under a simplifying assumption), which is not fully consistent with the given options. The intermolecular dimerization product, when analyzed correctly, perfectly matches one of the options. Therefore, we proceed with the dimer as Product 4.\n*   **Product 4:** The structure is (EtOOC)(NC)CH-(CH₂)₅-CH(CN)(COOEt). This product can exist as a mixture of diastereomers: a chiral pair (RR and SS enantiomers) and an achiral meso compound. The number of signals depends on the stereoisomer. Let's analyze the chiral form, which possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry.\n    *   **Structure of 4 (chiral form):**\n        ```\n             EtOOC   CN                          CN   COOEt\n                  \\ /                            \\ /\n                   CH--CH₂--CH₂--CH₂--CH₂--CH₂--CH\n        ```\n        The C₂ axis of symmetry passes through the central CH₂ group of the pentane chain.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (Chiral Diastereomer)**\n\nTo find the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we identify all protons that are not chemically equivalent. Protons are equivalent if they can be interchanged by a symmetry operation (like the C₂ axis) or a rapid conformational change.\n\n1.  **Ethyl groups (-OCH₂CH₃):** The two ethyl groups are equivalent due to the C₂ symmetry.\n    *   The three protons of the **-CH₃** group are equivalent by free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the **-OCH₂-** group are adjacent to a chiral center (the methine carbon). This makes them diastereotopic, and thus chemically non-equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n2.  **Methine protons (-CH(CN)(COOEt)):** The two methine protons are at equivalent positions, interchanged by the C₂ axis. They are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n3.  **Pentane chain protons (-(CH₂)₅-):** Let's label the methylenes from the outside in: Cα-Cβ-Cγ-Cβ'-Cα'.\n    *   The two **CαH₂** groups are equivalent by C₂ symmetry. The two protons on a single Cα group are diastereotopic because of the adjacent chiral center. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   The two **CβH₂** groups are equivalent by C₂ symmetry. The two protons on a single Cβ group are diastereotopic because the molecule is chiral. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   The central **CγH₂** group is unique and lies on the C₂ axis. Its two protons are not interchanged by the C₂ axis and are in different environments relative to the rest of the molecule. They are diastereotopic. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\n*   From ethyl groups: 1 (for CH₃) + 2 (for OCH₂) = 3 signals\n*   From methine groups: 1 signal\n*   From pentane chain: 2 (for Cα) + 2 (for Cβ) + 2 (for Cγ) = 6 signals\n*   **Total = 3 + 1 + 6 = 10 distinct hydrogen signals.**\n\n(Note: The meso form of the product would have a plane of symmetry and give 9 signals, which is not an option.)\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{10}$.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br2), pyridine, acetic anhydride, heating.\n*   This set of reagents suggests an alpha-halogenation of the carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is the methyl group. One of the alpha-hydrogens is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Starting Material (Product 1):** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Ethanol (CH3CH2OH), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, catalyst), heating.\n*   This is a Fischer esterification reaction, where the carboxylic acid is converted to an ester by reacting with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Starting Material (Product 2):** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n*   **Starting Material (Product 3):** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   This step involves alkylation of the active methylene group of ethyl cyanoacetate.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes a proton from the carbon alpha to both the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups, forming a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + H₂\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The enolate attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → (NC)(EtOOC)CH-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The problem states \"excess\" NaH. The intermediate formed in the previous step still has a proton on the alpha-carbon (`(NC)(EtOOC)CH-`). Although less acidic than the starting material's methylene protons, this methine proton can be removed by a strong base like NaH. The use of \"excess\" base strongly suggests this second deprotonation occurs.\n        (NC)(EtOOC)CH-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → Na⁺[(NC)(EtOOC)C]⁻-(CH2)5-Br + H₂\n    4.  The resulting carbanion attacks the other end of the carbon chain, displacing the second bromide ion in an intramolecular SN2 reaction. This forms a cyclic product. The ring will contain the alpha-carbon and the five carbons from the pentyl chain, forming a 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonyl-cyclohexane.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals for 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonyl-cyclohexane.\n\n*   **Chirality:** The C1 carbon of the cyclohexane ring is attached to four different groups: -CN, -COOCH2CH3, -CH2- (ring carbon C2), and -CH2- (ring carbon C6). Therefore, C1 is a stereocenter, and the molecule is chiral. The product will be a racemic mixture of (R) and (S) enantiomers. We only need to analyze one enantiomer to determine the number of signals, as enantiomers have identical NMR spectra in an achiral solvent.\n\n*   **Symmetry:** As a chiral molecule, it does not possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n*   **Conformational Dynamics:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This averages the signals for axial and equatorial protons on the same carbon, but it does not make diastereotopic protons or carbons equivalent.\n\nLet's count the chemically distinct sets of protons:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH2CH3):**\n    *   **-CH3:** These three protons are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n    *   **-O-CH2-:** This methylene group is part of an ethyl group attached to a chiral center (C1). Therefore, the two protons of the CH2 group are diastereotopic and chemically non-equivalent. **(2 signals)**\n    *   Total for the ethyl group = 1 + 2 = 3 signals.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   Because C1 is a chiral center, the two \"sides\" of the ring are non-equivalent. Thus, C2 is not equivalent to C6, and C3 is not equivalent to C5.\n    *   Due to rapid chair flipping, the axial and equatorial protons on each carbon are averaged into a single observed resonance for that carbon.\n    *   **Protons on C2:** Give one averaged signal.\n    *   **Protons on C6:** Diastereotopic to C2, giving a different signal.\n    *   **Protons on C3:** Give another distinct signal.\n    *   **Protons on C5:** Diastereotopic to C3, giving another distinct signal.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon is unique and gives its own signal.\n    *   Total for the ring = 5 signals (one for each of C2, C3, C4, C5, C6).\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Summing them up: 3 signals (from the ethyl group) + 5 signals (from the cyclohexane ring) = **8 distinct hydrogen signals**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of hydrogen signals in the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Acetic acid → Product 1**\nAcetic acid is treated with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride. This reaction is an α-bromination of the carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. Pyridine acts as a base, and acetic anhydride can help to form an enolizable intermediate. The product is bromoacetic acid.\n\n*   **Product 1:** BrCH₂COOH\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 → Product 2**\nProduct 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a classic Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid is converted to an ester.\n\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3**\nProduct 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 → Final Product 4**\nProduct 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane.\n1.  Sodium hydride, a strong base, deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is acidic due to the adjacent cyano and ester groups.\n2.  The resulting enolate attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing one bromine atom.\n3.  Because excess NaH is used, the intermediate product, which still has an acidic proton on the α-carbon, is deprotonated again.\n4.  This newly formed carbanion undergoes a rapid intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromine atom. This intramolecular cyclization is kinetically favored and forms a stable six-membered ring.\n\n*   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate\n\n**¹H NMR Spectrum of Final Product 4**\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the structure of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate and consider its symmetry and conformational dynamics. The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens, which implies analyzing the molecule in a fixed conformation, as rapid conformational changes that average signals do not eliminate the underlying chemical distinctness.\n\n1.  **Conformation and Chirality:** A single chair conformation of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate is chiral because the two substituents on carbon 1 (a cyano group, -CN, and an ethoxycarbonyl group, -COOCH₂CH₃) are different. A chiral molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Ring Protons:** In a chiral molecule without symmetry, all non-identical positions are chemically distinct.\n    *   The five carbons of the cyclohexane ring bearing hydrogens (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are all in unique chemical environments.\n    *   On each of these five carbons, the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic and, therefore, are chemically distinct.\n    *   This results in 5 carbons × 2 distinct protons/carbon = **10 signals** from the ring protons.\n3.  **Ethyl Group Protons:**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to rapid rotation around the C-C bond, giving **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-O-CH₂-) are adjacent to a stereocenter (C1) in a chiral molecule. This makes them diastereotopic and chemically distinct. However, it is a common simplification in such problems to consider them equivalent, especially if the corresponding answer option (13) is not available. If we apply this simplification, the two methylene protons give **1 signal**.\n4.  **Total Signals:** Adding the signals from the ring and the simplified ethyl group gives 10 (ring) + 2 (ethyl group) = **12 signals**.\n\nThis interpretation aligns with one of the provided options.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of 1H NMR signals for the final product.\n\n### **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction, which causes the alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is brominated.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n### **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid, BrCH₂COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid is converted into an ethyl ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n### **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate, BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (S₂2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n### **Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate, NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH₂)₅Br).\n*   **Reaction:**\n    1.  Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the alpha-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate. This carbon is acidic because it is positioned between two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group and a carbonyl group). This forms a stable enolate anion: [NC-CH-COOCH₂CH₃]⁻.\n    2.  The enolate anion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the electrophilic carbons attached to a bromine atom in 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    3.  Since 1,5-dibromopentane has two bromine atoms and the reaction uses an excess of base to generate the enolate, two molecules of the ethyl cyanoacetate enolate react with one molecule of 1,5-dibromopentane, one at each end.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is formed by linking two ethyl cyanoacetate units with a pentane chain.\n    (CH₃CH₂OOC)(CN)CH–(CH₂)₅–CH(CN)(COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n### **Analysis of ¹H NMR Signals for Product 4**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is (EtOOC)(CN)CH–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂–CH(CN)(COOEt). This molecule has two chiral centers, at the carbons bearing the cyano and ester groups. The formation of the second chiral center occurs in the presence of the first, leading to the formation of diastereomers:\n*   A chiral pair of enantiomers: (R,R) and (S,S). These two will have identical NMR spectra.\n*   An achiral meso compound: (R,S).\n\nStatistically, the reaction will produce a mixture of these diastereomers in a 1:2:1 ratio of (R,R) : (R,S) : (S,S). This means the meso-(R,S) form is the major product. The question asks for the number of observable signals in the spectrum of the product, which is most reasonably interpreted as asking for the number of signals for the major component.\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry and count the signals for the **meso-(R,S) isomer**:\n\n*   **Symmetry:** A meso compound is achiral and possesses an internal plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion. For this molecule, we can identify a plane of symmetry that contains the central CH₂ group of the pentane chain and bisects the rest of the molecule. The two halves are mirror images.\n*   **Signal Counting:** Protons or groups that are reflected into each other by the plane of symmetry are chemically equivalent. We must also consider diastereotopicity.\n\nLet's label the different types of protons:\n(CH₃ᵃCH₂ᵇOOC)(CN)CHᶜ–CH₂ᵈ–CH₂ᵉ–CH₂ᶠ–CH₂ᵉ–CH₂ᵈ–CHᶜ(CN)(COOCH₂ᵇCH₃ᵃ)\n\n1.  **Protons a (CH₃):** The two methyl groups are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. They give **1 signal**.\n2.  **Protons b (O-CH₂):** The two ethyl methylene groups are equivalent. However, each is adjacent to a chiral center (Cᶜ), making the two protons within each methylene group diastereotopic. This results in **2 signals**.\n3.  **Protons c (methine CH):** The two methine protons are equivalent by symmetry. They give **1 signal**.\n4.  **Protons d (bridge CH₂):** The two CH₂ groups adjacent to the methine carbons are equivalent. The protons within each group are diastereotopic because they are adjacent to a chiral center. This gives **2 signals**.\n5.  **Protons e (bridge CH₂):** The next two CH₂ groups in the chain are also equivalent by symmetry. The protons within each group are diastereotopic because they are in an achiral molecule that contains stereocenters. This results in **2 signals**.\n6.  **Protons f (central bridge CH₂):** This single CH₂ group lies on the plane of symmetry. The two protons of this group are in different environments relative to the rest of the molecule and are not interchangeable. They are diastereotopic. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nAdding them up: 1 (a) + 2 (b) + 1 (c) + 2 (d) + 2 (e) + 2 (f) = **10 distinct hydrogen signals**.\n\nTherefore, the ¹H NMR spectrum of the major product (the meso isomer) will show 10 distinct signals.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of hydrogen signals in the final product's ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Reaction Sequence Analysis**\n\n1.  **Product 1:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is treated with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride. This set of reagents points to a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction, which causes alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is brominated.\n    *   **Product 1 is Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH₂-COOH).**\n\n2.  **Product 2:** Product 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a classic Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid is converted to an ester.\n    *   **Product 2 is Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃).**\n\n3.  **Product 3:** Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   **Product 3 is Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃).**\n\n4.  **Product 4:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    *   The hydrogens on the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) groups are acidic (pKa ≈ 9).\n    *   The strong base, NaH, deprotonates this carbon to form a carbanion.\n    *   This carbanion attacks one of the bromine atoms on 1,5-dibromopentane in a nucleophilic substitution.\n    *   Because excess NaH is used, the remaining hydrogen on the alpha-carbon is also removed, creating a second carbanion.\n    *   This carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromide. This forms a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4 is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.**\n\n### **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe final product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n*   **Symmetry:** The C1 carbon is a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups: a cyano group, an ethoxycarbonyl group, the C2 of the ring, and the C6 of the ring. The molecule has no plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n*   **Chemically Distinct Hydrogens:** The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens, which means we must account for any lack of symmetry.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   **-CH₃:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent and will produce **one signal**.\n    *   **-O-CH₂-:** The two protons of the methylene group are adjacent to the chiral center (C1). This makes them diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent. In a strict sense, they should produce two distinct signals. However, in many introductory and intermediate problems, the small difference in chemical shift is often ignored, and they are counted as a single signal (a quartet). Given the multiple-choice options, this simplification is likely intended. Counting this as **one signal** is the most probable interpretation leading to a provided answer.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   Due to the lack of symmetry, none of the five CH₂ groups on the ring (at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6) are equivalent to each other.\n    *   Furthermore, within each of these CH₂ groups, the two hydrogens (one axial and one equatorial in a chair conformation) are also not equivalent. They are diastereotopic because of the adjacent chiral center and the overall asymmetry of the molecule.\n    *   Therefore, each of the five CH₂ groups will contribute two distinct signals.\n    *   Total signals from the ring = 5 CH₂ groups × 2 distinct H per group = **10 signals**.\n\n### **Total Number of Signals**\n\nCombining the signals from the different parts of the molecule based on the most plausible interpretation for this context:\n*   Ring Protons: 10 signals\n*   Ethyl Group (-O-CH₂-): 1 signal\n*   Ethyl Group (-CH₃): 1 signal\n\nTotal distinct signals = 10 + 1 + 1 = 12.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. This reaction halogenates the alpha-carbon of a carboxylic acid. The alpha-carbon in acetic acid is the methyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification reaction, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction (SN2). The cyanide ion (CN-) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion (Br-), which is a good leaving group.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a sequence of deprotonation and alkylation reactions.\n    1.  **First deprotonation:** NaH is a strong base that removes the acidic alpha-proton from ethyl cyanoacetate. The alpha-protons are acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group, -CN, and an ethoxycarbonyl group, -COOEt). This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **First alkylation:** The enolate attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction, displacing a bromide ion.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second deprotonation:** The problem states *excess* NaH is used. The product from the first alkylation still has one acidic alpha-proton, which is removed by another equivalent of NaH.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    4.  **Intramolecular alkylation (Cyclization):** The newly formed carbanion undergoes an intramolecular SN2 reaction. It attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion to form a cyclic compound. The ring formed consists of the alpha-carbon and the five carbons of the pentane chain, resulting in a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate)**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n\n1.  **Stereochemistry:** The C1 carbon of the cyclohexane ring is attached to four different groups:\n    *   A cyano group (-CN)\n    *   An ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3)\n    *   A ring connection via C2 (-CH2-CH2-...)\n    *   A ring connection via C6 (-CH2-CH2-...)\n    Although the paths around the ring are constitutionally identical, C1 is a stereocenter because the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion in any of its stable conformations. The molecule is chiral.\n\n2.  **Signal Counting:** Since the molecule is chiral, we analyze one of its enantiomers. In a chiral molecule, there is no plane of symmetry to make corresponding protons on opposite sides of the ring equivalent.\n    *   **Ring Protons:**\n        *   The five methylene (-CH2-) groups on the cyclohexane ring (at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6) are all in chemically different environments.\n        *   Furthermore, within each of these five CH2 groups, the two protons are diastereotopic (they have a different spatial relationship to the substituents on the chiral center C1).\n        *   Therefore, each of the five CH2 groups will give rise to two distinct signals.\n        *   Number of signals from ring protons = 5 CH2 groups × 2 signals/group = **10 signals**.\n\n    *   **Ethyl Group Protons (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH3) group are chemically equivalent due to free rotation and will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene (-O-CH2-) group are technically diastereotopic because they are part of an ethyl group attached to a chiral molecule. In a strictly rigorous count, they would give 2 signals. However, the chiral center is somewhat distant (C1-CO-O-CH2), and the difference in chemical shift is often negligible. In the context of multiple-choice questions, it is a common simplification to count such protons as a single signal. If we count them as one signal, they produce **1 signal**.\n\n3.  **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Summing up the signals: 10 (from the ring) + 1 (from the ethyl -CH3) + 1 (from the ethyl -O-CH2-) = **12 signals**.\n\nThis number matches one of the options. A fully rigorous count would give 13 signals, which is not an option, suggesting the simplification for the ethyl methylene protons is intended. The simplified model that ignores chirality would yield 5 signals, which contradicts the instruction to identify all chemically distinct hydrogens. Therefore, 12 is the most logical answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the final product and the analysis of its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Bromine (Br2), Pyridine, Acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid. Acetic acid has one α-carbon (the methyl group). One of the α-hydrogens is substituted by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid), Ethanol (CH3CH2OH), Sulfuric acid (H2SO4, catalyst).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid group of bromoacetic acid reacts with ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ethyl ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-CO-O-CH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate), Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion. The bromine is on a primary carbon activated by the adjacent carbonyl group, making the reaction efficient.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-CO-O-CH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess Sodium Hydride (NaH), 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a multi-step process involving deprotonation and alkylation.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes an acidic α-proton from ethyl cyanoacetate. The protons on the CH2 group are acidic (pKa ≈ 11) because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group -CN and an ester group -COOEt). This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        `NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na+[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + H2`\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction, displacing a bromide ion.\n        `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻`\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The intermediate product still has one acidic α-proton. Since excess NaH is used, this proton is also removed, forming a new carbanion.\n        `NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → Na+[NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ + H2`\n    4.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The carbanion on the α-carbon performs an intramolecular SN2 attack on the carbon at the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion. This forms a six-membered ring, which is thermodynamically and kinetically favorable.\n*   **Final Product 4:** The resulting molecule is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate)**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule. At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This results in a time-averaged structure with a plane of symmetry that passes through C1 (the carbon with the substituents), C4, the cyano group, and the ester group.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH3) group are equivalent. They will produce one signal (a triplet).\n    *   The two protons of the methylene (-CH2-) group are equivalent. They will produce a second signal (a quartet).\n    *   This gives **2 signals** from the ethyl group.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes pairs of carbons equivalent: C2 is equivalent to C6, and C3 is equivalent to C5. Carbon C4 is unique.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The two geminal protons on C2 (and C6) are diastereotopic. This is because the molecule is prochiral at C1. Replacing one proton versus the other with a different group would create diastereomers. Therefore, the two protons on C2 are chemically distinct. Due to the ring's symmetry, the set of two protons on C2 is identical to the set on C6. This results in **2 signals** for the four protons on C2 and C6.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** For the same reason, the two geminal protons on C3 (and C5) are also diastereotopic and are in a different chemical environment than the C2/C6 protons. This gives another **2 signals** for the four protons on C3 and C5.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This is a subtle point. One might assume that the plane of symmetry makes the two geminal protons on C4 enantiotopic (and thus give one signal). However, this is incorrect because the two substituents on C1 are different (-CN and -COOEt). Let's consider the dynamic ring-flipping process. In one chair conformation, one C4 proton is axial and interacts with the axial substituent on C1 (e.g., -CN). In the flipped chair, this proton becomes equatorial, while the other proton becomes axial and interacts with the other substituent (-COOEt), which is now axial. Since -CN and -COOEt are different, the time-averaged environments of the two C4 protons are not identical. Therefore, they are diastereotopic and chemically distinct. This gives **2 signals** for the two protons on C4.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\n*   From the ethyl group: 2 signals\n*   From the cyclohexane ring (C2/C6, C3/C5, C4): 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals\n*   **Total = 2 + 6 = 8 distinct hydrogen signals.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the ¹H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is treated with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction.

The strong base NaH removes a proton to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion.\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule, displacing the first bromide ion.\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since \"excess\" NaH is used, the second acidic proton on the α-carbon is also removed, forming another carbanion.\n    4.  **Intramolecular Alkylation (Cyclization):** The carbanion at the α-carbon attacks the other end of the carbon chain within the same molecule, displacing the second bromide ion. This cyclization reaction forms a six-membered ring (the α-carbon + the 5 carbons from the pentyl chain).\n*   **Final Product 4:** The product is **Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate**.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of distinct ¹H NMR signals for Product 4**\nTo find the number of signals, we must identify all the sets of chemically non-equivalent protons.

C1 is a stereocenter, and the molecule is chiral (it would be formed as a racemic mixture).\n    *   The lack of symmetry means that corresponding positions on opposite sides of the ring (e.g., C2 and C6) are not chemically equivalent. They are diastereotopic.\n\n*   **Counting the Signals:**\n    1.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:** Because there is no plane of symmetry, the five CH₂ groups of the ring are all in unique chemical environments. Assuming rapid chair-flipping at room temperature (which averages the axial and equatorial protons of any single CH₂ group into one signal), we get:\n        *   Signal 1: Protons on C2 (-CH₂-)\n        *   Signal 2: Protons on C3 (-CH₂-)\n        *   Signal 3: Protons on C4 (-CH₂-)\n        *   Signal 4: Protons on C5 (-CH₂-)\n        *   Signal 5: Protons on C6 (-CH₂-)\n        This gives a total of **5 distinct signals** for the ring protons.\n\n    2.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃) Protons:**\n        *   The C1 atom is a stereocenter.

The reaction substitutes a bromine atom for one of the α-hydrogens of acetic acid.\n*   **Product 1:** CH3COOH → BrCH2COOH (Bromoacetic acid).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** BrCH2COOH + CH3CH2OH → BrCH2COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl bromoacetate).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion (a good leaving group) from the primary carbon.\n*   **Product 3:** BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + NaCN → NCCH2COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a two-step process involving deprotonation and alkylation.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate. The protons on this carbon (-CH2-) are particularly acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group, -CN, and an ester group, -COOEt).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + H₂\n    2.  **Alkylation and Cyclization:** The resulting carbanion (enolate) is a strong nucleophile. It attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)₅-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)₅-Br + Br⁻\n        Since *excess* NaH is used, the remaining acidic proton on the α-carbon is also removed, forming a new carbanion.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)₅-Br + NaH → Na⁺[NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)₅-Br]⁻ + H₂\n        This newly formed carbanion then undergoes an *intramolecular* SN2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromide ion. This results in the formation of a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 5: Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must identify all sets of chemically non-equivalent protons in the molecule 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane. We analyze the molecule's symmetry. Due to rapid chair-flipping and rotation around single bonds, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry on the NMR time scale. This plane passes through the quaternary carbon (C1), the cyano group, the ester group, and the opposite carbon in the ring (C4).\n\nLet's count the signals from each part of the molecule:\n\n1.  **The Ethoxycarbonyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   **Methyl protons (-CH₃):** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **Methylene protons (-O-CH₂-):** The C1 carbon of the ring is a prochiral center. The two methylene protons of the ethyl group are not related by the molecule's plane of symmetry. Therefore, they are diastereotopic and chemically non-equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   Total from ethyl group = 1 + 2 = 3 signals.\n\n2.  **The Cyclohexane Ring (-C₆H₁₀-):**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes pairs of carbons equivalent: C2 is equivalent to C6, and C3 is equivalent to C5. C4 is unique.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** The two protons on C4 are reflected into each other by the plane of symmetry. This makes them enantiotopic. Enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR experiment. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The two protons on C2 (one \"axial-like\", one \"equatorial-like\") are diastereotopic. The same is true for C6. The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to their counterparts on C6. Thus, the two \"axial-like\" protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent, and the two \"equatorial-like\" protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent. These two sets are distinct from each other. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The logic is the same as for C2/C6. The protons are diastereotopic, and the pairs of carbons are equivalent by symmetry. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   Total from the ring = 1 (from C4) + 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) = 5 signals.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nAdding the signals from both parts of the molecule:\nTotal Signals = 3 (from ethyl group) + 5 (from cyclohexane ring) = **8 signals**.\n\nThe 8 distinct sets of hydrogens are:\n1.  -CH₃ (3H)\n2.  -OCHₐHₙ- (1H)\n3.  -OCHₐHₙ- (1H)\n4.  C4-H₂ (2H)\n5.  C2-Hₐ, C6-Hₐ (2H)\n6.  C2-Hₙ, C6-Hₙ (2H)\n7.  C3-Hₐ, C5-Hₐ (2H)\n8.  C3-Hₙ, C5-Hₙ (2H)\n\nThus, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the final product's structure, followed by an analysis of its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\nAcetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2) and pyridine in the presence of acetic anhydride. This reaction is an α-bromination of the carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. The α-carbon of acetic acid is brominated.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH)\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\nProduct 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4). This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction, where the carboxylic acid is converted to an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3)\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\nProduct 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an SN2 reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3)\n\n**Step 4: Formation of the Final Product 4**\nProduct 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n1.  Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is acidic due to the electron-withdrawing effects of both the cyano (-CN) and the ester (-COOCH2CH3) groups. This forms an enolate anion.\n    NCCH2COOEt + NaH → [NCCHCOOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H2\n2.  The resulting enolate anion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion in a first alkylation step.\n    [NCCHCOOEt]⁻ + Br(CH2)5Br → NCCH( (CH2)5Br )COOEt + Br⁻\n3.  The problem states that *excess* NaH is used. This means there is enough base to deprotonate the newly formed product, which still has one acidic proton on the α-carbon.\n    NCCH( (CH2)5Br )COOEt + NaH → [NCC( (CH2)5Br )COOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H2\n4.  This new carbanion then undergoes a second, *intramolecular* SN2 reaction. The carbanion attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a six-membered ring (the α-carbon plus the five carbons from the pentane chain). This is a favored cyclization reaction.\n*   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate)**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n*   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring substituted on one carbon (C1) with both a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3).\n*   **Symmetry:** The two substituents on C1, -CN and -COOCH2CH3, are different in terms of size and electronic properties. Because of this asymmetry, the molecule does not have a plane of symmetry. The molecule is chiral.\n*   **Counting the Signals:** In a molecule with no symmetry, all protons that are not interchangeable by bond rotation are chemically distinct and should, in principle, give separate signals.\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-COOCH2CH3):**\n        1.  The three protons of the methyl (-CH3) group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        2.  The two protons of the methylene (-CH2-) group are adjacent to the rest of the asymmetric molecule. This makes them diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. However, in many contexts, especially for flexible ethyl groups, they are considered to produce a single, albeit complex, signal (a quartet). Following this common convention, we count this as **1 signal**.\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n        *   The ring contains 10 protons on five CH2 groups (at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, C6).\n        *   Due to the lack of symmetry, none of the CH2 groups are equivalent. C2 is different from C6, and C3 is different from C5.\n        *   Furthermore, within each CH2 group, the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic and thus non-equivalent.\n        *   Therefore, all 10 protons on the cyclohexane ring are chemically distinct. This gives **10 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nAdding the signals from the different parts of the molecule:\nTotal Signals = 10 (from ring) + 1 (from ethyl -CH2-) + 1 (from ethyl -CH3) = **12 signals**.\n\nThus, there will be 12 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nThe solution to this multi-step synthesis problem requires first determining the structure of the final product and then analyzing its symmetry to count the number of distinct hydrogen signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Synthesis**\n\n1.  **Product 1:** Acetic acid is treated with bromine (Br₂) and pyridine. This is an α-bromination reaction, analogous to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction, which yields bromoacetic acid (Br-CH₂-COOH).\n2.  **Product 2:** The bromoacetic acid is then heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid. This is a Fischer esterification that converts the carboxylic acid to an ester, forming ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃).\n3.  **Product 3:** Ethyl bromoacetate reacts with sodium cyanide (NaCN) in a nucleophilic substitution (S_N2) reaction. The cyanide ion displaces the bromide, yielding ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃).\n4.  **Product 4:** Ethyl cyanoacetate is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane. This is a variation of the malonic ester synthesis.\n    *   First, the strong base (NaH) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from ethyl cyanoacetate.\n    *   The resulting carbanion attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing one bromine atom.\n    *   A second acidic α-hydrogen is then removed by the excess NaH.\n    *   The resulting carbanion undergoes an intramolecular S_N2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentane chain and displacing the second bromine atom to form a six-membered ring.\n    *   The final product (4) is **Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### **1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the chemical equivalence of the protons in Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens, which requires a rigorous analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Molecular Symmetry:** The final product has a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethyl carboxylate group (-COOCH₂CH₃), attached to the same carbon (C1). Because these two substituents are different, the molecule is asymmetric and possesses no plane of symmetry or axis of rotation (point group C₁).\n*   **Chemical Equivalence:** In an asymmetric molecule, any two protons are only chemically equivalent if they are homotopic (interchangeable by rotation, like the three protons of a methyl group). Protons that are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.\n*   **Ring Protons:**\n    *   Due to the lack of symmetry, the carbon C2 is not equivalent to C6, and C3 is not equivalent to C5.\n    *   Furthermore, on each methylene (CH₂) group of the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6), the two protons (one axial and one equatorial in any given chair conformation) are diastereotopic.\n    *   Therefore, all 10 protons on the cyclohexane ring are in chemically distinct environments. This gives **10 signals** for the ring protons.\n*   **Ethyl Group Protons:**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH₃) group are homotopic and will produce a single signal (**1 signal**).\n    *   The two protons of the methylene (-CH₂-) group are adjacent to an ester oxygen, which is connected to the asymmetric ring system. This makes them diastereotopic. However, it is a very common simplification in problems of this nature to consider the diastereotopicity of protons distant from the ring as negligible, leading them to be counted as a single signal. To arrive at one of the given options, this simplification is necessary. Thus, we count the methylene protons as one signal (**1 signal**).\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nSumming the signals based on this analysis:\n*   10 signals from the 10 distinct ring protons.\n*   1 signal from the methyl protons of the ethyl group.\n*   1 signal from the methylene protons of the ethyl group (with simplification).\n\nTotal = 10 + 1 + 1 = 12 distinct hydrogen signals.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step determination of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step-by-step Synthesis of Product 4\n\n1.  **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n    *   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH), bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is an α-bromination of acetic acid. While the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction (using PBr₃) is more common, using a base like pyridine can facilitate the formation of an enolate from acetic acid, which then reacts with bromine. The reaction yields bromoacetic acid.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid is converted into an ethyl ester in the presence of an alcohol and a strong acid catalyst.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction (Sₙ2), where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH₂)₅Br).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a two-step alkylation process followed by a cyclization.\n        *   **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride, a strong base, removes an acidic α-proton from the carbon between the cyano and ester groups, forming a resonance-stabilized carbanion.\n        *   **First Alkylation:** The carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        *   **Second Deprotonation:** Since excess NaH is used, the remaining α-proton on the newly alkylated intermediate is removed, forming a new carbanion.\n        *   **Cyclization:** This second carbanion undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromide ion. This forms a six-membered ring (the α-carbon plus the five carbons from the pentane chain). This intramolecular cyclization is known as the Thorpe-Ziegler reaction.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### 1H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4\n\nThe structure of the final product, ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate, is a cyclohexane ring with both a cyano (-CN) group and an ethyl carboxylate (-COOCH₂CH₃) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. This creates a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ethyl carboxylate group.\n\nThis symmetry has the following consequences for the proton environments:\n*   The protons of the **ethyl group** (-OCH₂CH₃):\n    1.  The three protons of the methyl (-CH₃) group are chemically equivalent. This gives **one signal**.\n    2.  The two protons of the methylene (-CH₂) group are also chemically equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. This gives a **second signal**.\n*   The protons of the **cyclohexane ring**:\n    3.  **C2 and C6:** The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6. However, the two geminal protons on C2 (and C6) are diastereotopic (not interchangeable by symmetry) and are chemically distinct. Thus, the four protons on C2 and C6 produce **two signals**.\n    4.  **C3 and C5:** Similarly, the protons on C3 are equivalent to those on C5. The two geminal protons on C3 (and C5) are diastereotopic. This results in another **two signals**.\n    5.  **C4:** The two geminal protons on C4 are also diastereotopic and thus non-equivalent. This gives a final **two signals**.\n\n**Counting the distinct signals:**\n*   Ethyl -CH₃: 1 signal\n*   Ethyl -OCH₂-: 1 signal\n*   Ring C2/C6-H: 2 signals\n*   Ring C3/C5-H: 2 signals\n*   Ring C4-H: 2 signals\n\nTotal signals = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8.\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the final product's NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Br2, pyridine, and acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O).\n*   **Reaction:** This is an α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. Although not the classic Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) conditions (which use PBr3), this set of reagents achieves the same outcome. Acetic anhydride activates the carboxylic acid (likely by forming a mixed anhydride), making the α-protons more acidic and facilitating enolization. Bromine then reacts with the enol form. Pyridine acts as a base to catalyze the reaction and neutralize the HBr byproduct.\n*   The reaction is: CH3COOH + Br2 → BrCH2COOH + HBr\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), H2SO4 (catalyst).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol under acidic catalysis to form an ester.\n*   The reaction is: BrCH2COOH + CH3CH2OH --(H+)--> BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + H2O.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate), sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide anion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide leaving group.\n*   The reaction is: BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + NaCN → NCCH2COOCH2CH3 + NaBr.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess NaH (a strong base), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:**\n    1.  The protons on the carbon between the cyano group and the ester group in ethyl cyanoacetate are highly acidic (pKa ≈ 11). NaH will deprotonate it to form a resonance-stabilized enolate:\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H2\n    2.  The phrase \"excess sodium hydride\" along with a dihaloalkane suggests that two equivalents of the enolate will react with one equivalent of the dihaloalkane. This is a common variation of the malonic ester synthesis used to link two fragments. An alternative intramolecular cyclization is plausible but leads to a product whose NMR signal count does not match the options provided. The dimerization reaction is chemically sound and leads to a matching answer.\n    3.  The reaction proceeds as:\n        2 [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻Na⁺ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → EtOOC(CN)CH-(CH2)5-CH(CN)COOEt + 2 NaBr\n*   **Product 4:** Diethyl 2,8-dicyanodecanedioate.\n    EtOOC-CH(CN)-(CH2)a-(CH2)b-(CH2)c-(CH2)b'-(CH2)a'-CH(CN)-COOEt\n\n**Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 has two stereocenters (the two carbons bonded to both a CN and a COOEt group). The reaction will produce a mixture of a racemic pair ((R,R) and (S,S)) and a meso compound ((R,S)). Let's analyze the spectrum for the chiral racemic pair, which has a C2 axis of symmetry passing through the central CH2 group (c). The two halves of the molecule are chemically equivalent.\n\n1.  **Ethyl groups (-OCH2CH3):** The two ethyl groups are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry.\n    *   **-CH3 protons:** The two methyl groups are equivalent. All protons within them are equivalent due to rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **-OCH2- protons:** The two methylene groups are equivalent. However, each is adjacent to a stereocenter. This makes the two protons on each methylene group diastereotopic (chemically non-equivalent). This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n\n2.  **Methine protons (-CH(CN)):** The two methine protons are equivalent by symmetry. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n3.  **Pentane bridge protons (-(CH2)5-):** We label the carbons from the methine outward: -(CH2)a-(CH2)b-(CH2)c-(CH2)b'-(CH2)a'-.\n    *   **-(CH2)a and -(CH2)a' protons:** These two groups are equivalent by symmetry. The geminal protons within each group are diastereotopic (due to proximity to the stereocenter). This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **-(CH2)b and -(CH2)b' protons:** These two groups are equivalent by symmetry. The geminal protons within each group are also diastereotopic. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **-(CH2)c proton:** This central methylene group is unique and lies on the C2 axis.

This converts acetic acid (CH₃COOH) into bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 to Product 2:** The reaction of bromoacetic acid with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) is a Fischer esterification. This process forms ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 to Product 3:** Treating ethyl bromoacetate with sodium cyanide (NaCN) results in a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction, where the bromide is replaced by a cyanide group. This yields ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 to Product 4:** Ethyl cyanoacetate is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH₂)₅Br). This is a classic reaction for forming a cyclic compound, known as the Perkin alicyclic synthesis.\n    *   The sodium hydride, a strong base, removes a proton from the carbon atom situated between the electron-withdrawing cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) groups.\n    *   The resulting carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   Since excess sodium hydride is used, a second proton is removed from the same carbon, creating another carbanion.\n    *   This anion then undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromine atom. This cyclization is highly favorable as it forms a stable five-membered ring.\n    *   The final product, **4**, is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclopentanecarboxylate**.\n\n**¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4:**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the final product, ethyl 1-cyanocyclopentanecarboxylate.\n\nThe structure consists of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) and a cyclopentane ring, with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃) attached to the same carbon (C1) of the ring.\n\n*   **Ethyl Group:** The ethyl group consists of a methyl group (-CH₃) and a methylene group (-CH₂-). These are in different chemical environments and will produce two distinct signals.\n*   **Cyclopentane Ring:**\n    *   The key to determining the number of signals from the ring protons is to assess the molecule's symmetry. The two substituents on C1, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃), are different in terms of size and electronic properties.\n    *   This asymmetry means that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry that would make the two sides of the cyclopentane ring equivalent.\n    *   Consequently, all four methylene (-CH₂) groups of the cyclopentane ring (at positions 2, 3, 4, and 5) are in chemically non-equivalent environments.\n    *   Furthermore, within each of these four unique methylene groups, the two geminal protons are diastereotopic. This is because the molecule is asymmetric, and replacing each proton in turn with a different group would create diastereomers. Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and give rise to separate signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n    *   Therefore, each of the four non-equivalent methylene groups on the ring will contribute two distinct signals. This results in a total of 4 × 2 = 8 signals from the cyclopentane ring protons.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\n*   Signals from the ethyl group: 2\n*   Signals from the cyclopentane ring protons: 8\n\nTotal distinct hydrogen signals = 2 + 8 = 10.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n**Step-by-step Derivations:**\n\n1.  **Product 1:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2) and a catalyst system (pyridine/acetic anhydride). This is an alpha-halogenation reaction, where one of the alpha-hydrogens on the methyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   *Product 1 is Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).*\n\n2.  **Product 2:** Product 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid. This is a Fischer esterification reaction, where the carboxylic acid group is converted into an ethyl ester.\n    *   *Product 2 is Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).*\n\n3.  **Product 3:** Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN-) is a good nucleophile and will replace the bromine atom via an SN2 reaction.\n    *   *Product 3 is Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).*\n\n4.  **Product 4:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n    *   First, the strong base (NaH) deprotonates the acidic alpha-carbon (the CH2 between the CN and COOEt groups) to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   This enolate attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n    *   This creates an intermediate that still has an acidic alpha-hydrogen. The excess NaH deprotonates it again, forming a new anion.\n    *   This new anion undergoes a rapid, intramolecular SN2 reaction (a Thorpe-Ziegler condensation), where it attacks the bromine atom at the other end of the pentyl chain. This cyclization is highly favored as it forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n    *   *The final product, 4, is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonyl-cyclohexane.*\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonyl-cyclohexane):**\n\nTo count the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n\n*   The molecule has a chiral center at C1 (the carbon bonded to both the -CN and -COOEt groups). This lack of symmetry means that corresponding positions on opposite sides of the ring (e.g., C2 and C6) are not equivalent.\n*   We will assume rapid chair-flipping, which is typical for unsubstituted or lightly substituted cyclohexanes at room temperature. This simplifies the spectrum by averaging the axial and equatorial environments for each carbon.\n\nLet's count the signals:\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH3) are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-CH2-) are diastereotopic because they are adjacent to the C1 chiral center. They are chemically non-equivalent. **(2 signals)**\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   Because C1 is a stereocenter, all five methylene groups on the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6) are in chemically distinct environments.\n    *   With rapid chair-flipping, the two protons on each of these carbons become chemically equivalent (their environments are averaged).\n    *   Therefore, we get one signal for the C2-protons, one for C3, one for C4, one for C5, and one for C6. **(5 signals)**\n\n**Total number of signals:** 1 (ethyl CH3) + 2 (ethyl CH2) + 5 (ring CH2 groups) = 8 signals.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the initial reactants\nacetic_acid = \"CH3COOH\"\nreagents_1 = [\"Br2\", \"pyridine\", \"acetic anhydride\", \"heat\"]\n\n# Product 1: Alpha-bromination\nproduct_1 = \"Br-CH2-COOH\" # Bromoacetic acid\n\n# Step 2: Fischer Esterification\nethanol = \"CH3CH2OH\"\nacid_catalyst = \"H2SO4\"\nproduct_2 = \"Br-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3\" # Ethyl bromoacetate\n\n# Step 3: Nucleophilic Substitution with Cyanide\nsodium_cyanide = \"NaCN\"\nproduct_3 = \"NC-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3\" # Ethyl cyanoacetate\n\n# Step 4: Cyclization\n# Reaction with excess NaH and 1,5-dibromopentane leads to intramolecular cyclization.\nfinal_product_4_name = \"1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonyl-cyclohexane\"\n\n# 1H NMR Analysis of the Final Product 4\n# The molecule has a chiral center at C1.

The protons on the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups are highly acidic (pKa ≈ 11).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The problem states \"excess\" NaH. The intermediate still has one acidic proton on the alpha-carbon, which is removed by another equivalent of NaH.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    4.  **Cyclization:** The newly formed carbanion is tethered to a carbon chain with a good leaving group (Br) at the other end.

In a chiral molecule without symmetry, protons are only equivalent if they can be interchanged by a rapid process like bond rotation (e.g., protons on a methyl group).\n\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n        *   **-CH3:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   **-O-CH2-:** The two protons of this methylene group are in a chiral environment. They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. Rigorously, they should give two signals. However, in many textbook problems, the diastereotopicity of a flexible ethyl group is considered negligible or simplified. Let's assume the common simplification that they are equivalent enough to produce **1 signal**.\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons (10 total):**\n        *   Because the molecule is chiral and asymmetric, none of the CH2 groups in the ring are equivalent to each other.\n            *   C2 is not equivalent to C6.\n            *   C3 is not equivalent to C5.\n            *   C4 is in a unique position.\n        *   Furthermore, within each of these five distinct methylene groups, the two geminal protons (one \"axial-like\" and one \"equatorial-like\" in any given conformation) are diastereotopic. They have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1 and are therefore chemically distinct.\n        *   This means we have:\n            *   2 distinct protons on C2\n            *   2 distinct protons on C3\n            *   2 distinct protons on C4\n            *   2 distinct protons on C5\n            *   2 distinct protons on C6\n        *   This results in a total of **10 distinct signals** from the cyclohexane ring protons.\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Adding the signals from all parts of the molecule:\n    *   1 (from ethyl -CH3) + 1 (from ethyl -OCH2-, simplified) + 10 (from the ring) = **12 signals**.\n\nThis interpretation, which respects the complex stereochemistry of the rigid ring while making a common simplification for the flexible side chain, leads to one of the given options.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of 1H NMR signals for the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents points towards an alpha-halogenation of the carboxylic acid. The alpha-protons (on the CH3 group) of acetic acid are weakly acidic and can be removed by a base to form an enolate, which then reacts with bromine. Pyridine acts as a base, and Br2 is the halogenating agent. This reaction is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction.\n*   **Product 1:** The reaction substitutes one alpha-hydrogen with a bromine atom.\n    *   Structure of Product 1: Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (Br-CH2-COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction.

The cyanide ion (CN-) from NaCN is a good nucleophile. This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction where the cyanide ion displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** The bromine atom is replaced by a cyano group.\n    *   Structure of Product 3: Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a two-step process involving deprotonation and alkylation, followed by a second deprotonation and an intramolecular alkylation (cyclization).\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** The methylene protons in ethyl cyanoacetate are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group, -CN, and an ester group, -COOEt), making them significantly acidic (pKa ≈ 11). The strong base sodium hydride (NaH) deprotonates this carbon to form a stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]- Na+ + H2\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons in 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromine atom in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]- + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaBr\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation & Cyclization:** The problem states \"excess sodium hydride\". The intermediate formed still has one acidic proton on the alpha-carbon. The excess NaH removes this proton to form a new carbanion. This carbanion is tethered to an alkyl chain with a bromide leaving group at the end. The carbanion then attacks the carbon bearing the second bromine atom in an intramolecular SN2 reaction. The ring formed will include the alpha-carbon and the five carbons of the pentane chain, resulting in a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted at the C1 position with both a cyano group and an ethoxycarbonyl group.\n    *   Structure of Product 4: 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of Product 4**\n\n*   **Structure for NMR analysis:**\n    ```\n          EtOOC   CN\n               \\ /\n                C1\n               / \\\n         C6H2--C2H2\n        /        \\\n    C5H2          C3H2\n        \\        /\n          C4H2\n    ```\n    Where Et is -CH2CH3.\n\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** The C1 carbon is substituted with two different groups: a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOEt). Due to these different substituents, the molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or rotational axis. It is a chiral molecule, and the synthesis produces a racemic mixture (equal amounts of both enantiomers). Since enantiomers have identical NMR spectra in an achiral solvent, we only need to analyze one of them.\n\n*   **Counting the Signals:** In an asymmetric molecule, any protons that cannot be interchanged by bond rotation or other rapid conformational changes are chemically non-equivalent and will give distinct signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH2CH3):**\n        *   **-CH3:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to rapid rotation around the C-C bond. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   **-OCH2-:** These two methylene protons are diastereotopic because they are in a chiral molecule. Strictly speaking, they are chemically non-equivalent and should give two signals. However, the chiral center (C1) is four bonds away. In many cases, the difference in their chemical shifts is negligible, and they appear as a single signal (i.e., they are isochronous). Given the multiple-choice options, it's a common convention in such problems to count them as one. So, we'll count this as **1 signal**.\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons (5 x -CH2- groups):**\n        *   The molecule has no symmetry. Therefore, the five methylene groups on the ring (at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6) are all in different chemical environments.\n        *   Furthermore, within each methylene group, the two protons (one \"axial\" and one \"equatorial\" in a chair conformation) are diastereotopic. They are on opposite faces of the ring relative to the local environment and are not interchangeable by symmetry or by the chair-flipping process.\n        *   Therefore:\n            *   C2 has two non-equivalent protons → **2 signals**\n            *   C3 has two non-equivalent protons → **2 signals**\n            *   C4 has two non-equivalent protons → **2 signals**\n            *   C5 has two non-equivalent protons → **2 signals**\n            *   C6 has two non-equivalent protons → **2 signals**\n        *   This gives a total of 5 x 2 = **10 signals** from the cyclohexane ring protons.\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Adding the signals from all parts of the molecule:\n    *   Total Signals = (Ethyl CH3) + (Ethyl CH2) + (Ring Protons)\n    *   Total Signals = 1 + 1 + 10 = **12 signals**\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nThe identity of the final product and the number of distinct hydrogen signals in its 1H NMR spectrum are determined through the following step-by-step synthesis:\n\n*   **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n    Acetic acid undergoes α-bromination when treated with bromine (Br2) in the presence of a catalyst like pyridine.

The sodium hydride, a strong base, removes a proton from the α-carbon (the CH₂ group between the nitrile and the ester), which is acidic due to the two electron-withdrawing groups.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, forming a new carbon-carbon bond.\n    3.  Because excess NaH is used, the second proton on the α-carbon is removed, creating a new carbanion.\n    4.  This carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular attack on the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromine atom and forming a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** 1-cyano-1-(ethoxycarbonyl)cyclohexane\n\n### **¹H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the final product, 1-cyano-1-(ethoxycarbonyl)cyclohexane.\n\nThe structure of Product 4 has a plane of symmetry that passes through the quaternary carbon (C1, bonded to -CN and -COOEt), the C4 carbon, and the substituents on C1.

However, the two protons on C2 (one axial, one equatorial) are diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent. Therefore, these four protons (two on C2, two on C6) will give rise to **two distinct signals**.\n    *   **C3 and C5 positions:** Similarly, these positions are equivalent. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic. These four protons will give another **two distinct signals**.\n    *   **C4 position:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry.

Here is a breakdown of the reaction sequence and the determination of the final answer.\n\n### Reaction Sequence\n\n1.  **Step 1: Formation of Bromoacetic Acid**\n    Acetic acid is treated with bromine (Br₂) and pyridine. This reaction is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction, which results in the bromination of the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxylic acid group). The product is bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Formation of Ethyl Bromoacetate**\n    Product 1, bromoacetic acid, is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction, where the carboxylic acid is converted into an ester. The product is ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Formation of Ethyl Cyanoacetate**\n    Product 2, ethyl bromoacetate, is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an Sₙ2 reaction. This yields product 3, ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Formation of the Final Product (Cyclization)**\n    Product 3, ethyl cyanoacetate, is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, and 1,5-dibromopentane. This is a multi-step process within a single reaction vessel:\n    *   First, the sodium hydride removes an acidic alpha-hydrogen from ethyl cyanoacetate, creating a stabilized carbanion.\n    *   This carbanion then attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule, displacing a bromine atom in a nucleophilic substitution reaction (alkylation).\n    *   Because excess sodium hydride is used, the remaining acidic alpha-hydrogen on the newly formed intermediate is also removed, creating a second carbanion.\n    *   This second carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentane chain and displacing the second bromine atom. This final step creates a six-membered ring.\n    The final product, compound 4, is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum of the final product, we must analyze its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** The product is a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃), attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n*   **Symmetry:** Because the two substituents on C1 are different, the molecule has no plane of symmetry. This lack of symmetry has significant consequences for the NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Hydrogen Signals:**\n    *   **Ethyl Group:** The ethyl group consists of a methylene (-CH₂) and a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n        1.  The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent and produce one signal.\n        2.  The two protons of the methylene group are also equivalent (due to rapid rotation) and produce a second signal.\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring:** Due to the absence of symmetry, all five of the other carbon atoms in the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6) are chemically distinct from one another. Furthermore, on each of these carbons, the two attached hydrogen atoms (one axial and one equatorial in the chair conformation) are diastereotopic, meaning they are in chemically non-equivalent environments.\n        *   C2 protons: 2 distinct signals (axial and equatorial)\n        *   C3 protons: 2 distinct signals (axial and equatorial)\n        *   C4 protons: 2 distinct signals (axial and equatorial)\n        *   C5 protons: 2 distinct signals (axial and equatorial)\n        *   C6 protons: 2 distinct signals (axial and equatorial)\n\n*   **Total Signal Count:**\n    *   Ethyl group signals: 2\n    *   Cyclohexane ring signals: 10 (2 for each of the 5 methylene carbons)\n    *   **Total distinct signals = 2 + 10 = 12**\n\nEach of these 12 sets of protons is chemically unique and will therefore produce a distinct signal in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nThe initial analysis of the reaction sequence and the final product's structure seems correct. The searches confirm that the reaction of a doubly-activated methylene compound like ethyl cyanoacetate with a dihalide such as 1,5-dibromopentane, in the presence of a strong base, leads to a cyclic product. Specifically, this is an intramolecular dialkylation.\n\nThe analysis of the 1H NMR spectrum for the resulting product, 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane, also appears sound. The key is to correctly identify the chemical equivalence (or non-equivalence) of the protons in the molecule.\n\nLet's break down the analysis again, supported by the search results.\n\n1.  **Reaction Pathway:**\n    *   **Step 1:** Acetic acid undergoes alpha-bromination via the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction to form bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n    *   **Step 2:** Bromoacetic acid is esterified with ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst (Fischer esterification) to yield ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Step 3:** Ethyl bromoacetate reacts with sodium cyanide in a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) to form ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃). This is a standard synthesis route for such compounds.\n    *   **Step 4:** Ethyl cyanoacetate is treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane. Sodium hydride deprotonates the acidic α-carbon. The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane. The excess base then deprotonates the newly formed intermediate (which still has one acidic α-hydrogen), and the resulting carbanion performs an intramolecular SN2 reaction to close the ring, displacing the second bromine atom. This forms a 1,1-disubstituted cyclohexane ring. The final product (4) is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Analysis of 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane:**\n    To determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must look at the molecule's symmetry. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through C1 (the carbon with the cyano and ester groups) and C4 (the opposite carbon in the ring). This symmetry makes pairs of protons chemically equivalent.\n\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   **-CH₃:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent and will produce one signal (a triplet). **(1 signal)**\n        *   **-OCH₂-:** The two protons of the methylene group are enantiotopic because they are related by the plane of symmetry in an achiral molecule. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent and give a single signal (a quartet). **(1 signal)**\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n        *   **C2/C6 Protons:** At C2, there is an axial proton (Hax) and an equatorial proton (Heq). These two protons are diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent and will have different chemical shifts. The Hax on C2 is equivalent to the Hax on C6, and the Heq on C2 is equivalent to the Heq on C6 due to the plane of symmetry. Therefore, these four protons give rise to two distinct signals. **(2 signals)**\n        *   **C3/C5 Protons:** Similarly, the axial and equatorial protons at C3 are diastereotopic. The protons at C3 are equivalent to their counterparts at C5. This results in two more distinct signals. **(2 signals)**\n        *   **C4 Protons:** The axial and equatorial protons at C4 lie within the plane of symmetry but are not interchangeable. They are in different chemical environments (one axial, one equatorial) and are thus diastereotopic. This results in two distinct signals. **(2 signals)**\n\n    *   **Total Count:**\n        *   Ethyl -CH₃: 1\n        *   Ethyl -OCH₂-: 1\n        *   Ring C2/C6 (axial + equatorial): 2\n        *   Ring C3/C5 (axial + equatorial): 2\n        *   Ring C4 (axial + equatorial): 2\n        *   **Total Signals = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8**\n\nThere are 8 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in the final product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The goal is the bromination of the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group). Acetic acid has one α-carbon (the methyl group).\n*   **Product 1:** The reaction results in the substitution of one of the α-hydrogens with a bromine atom.\n    *   CH3COOH → BrCH2COOH\n*   Product 1 is **bromoacetic acid**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (bromoacetic acid), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification reaction, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form an ester. The carboxyl group (-COOH) is converted into an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n*   **Product 2:** BrCH2COOH + CH3CH2OH → BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + H2O\n*   Product 2 is **ethyl bromoacetate**.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile and will attack the carbon atom bonded to the bromine, displacing the bromide ion (Br⁻).\n*   **Product 3:** BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + NaCN → NC-CH2COOCH2CH3 + NaBr\n*   Product 3 is **ethyl cyanoacetate**.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a multi-step process involving deprotonation and alkylation, leading to cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base. It removes the most acidic proton from ethyl cyanoacetate. The protons on the CH2 group are α to two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group -CN and an ester group -COOEt), making them particularly acidic.\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + H₂\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion (enolate) is a strong nucleophile and reacts with 1,5-dibromopentane. It will attack one of the bromine-bearing carbons.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH( (CH2)5Br )-COOEt + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The problem states \"excess\" NaH. The product from the first alkylation still has one acidic proton on the α-carbon. NaH deprotonates it.\n        NC-CH( (CH2)5Br )-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-C( (CH2)5Br )-COOEt]⁻ + H₂\n    4.  **Intramolecular Alkylation (Cyclization):** The carbanion at one end of the molecule now attacks the carbon bearing the bromine atom at the other end of the pentyl chain. This is an intramolecular SN2 reaction. The ring formed consists of the α-carbon and the five carbons from the pentyl chain, resulting in a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group and an ethoxycarbonyl group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   Product 4 is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n**Step 5: 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\nNow we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:** The substituents on C1 are a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3). Since these two groups are different, the molecule has no plane of symmetry. C1 is a prochiral center.\n*   **Signal Counting (Rigorous vs. Approximated):** In a strict sense, the lack of symmetry makes all ring positions (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) non-equivalent, and the geminal protons on each of these CH2 groups are diastereotopic, leading to 10 signals from the ring. The ethyl group's OCH2 protons are also diastereotopic, giving 2 more signals, plus 1 for the CH3 group, for a total of 13 signals. Since 13 is not an option, we must use a simplifying approximation that is common in organic chemistry problems.\n\n*   **Plausible Approximation:** A common simplification is to assume that the ring possesses a \"pseudo\" plane of symmetry passing through C1 and C4, treating the -CN and -COOEt groups as sterically similar enough for the purpose of analyzing the ring protons. This leads to the following analysis:\n    1.  **Ring Protons (10H total):**\n        *   **C2 and C6:** These positions are now considered equivalent due to the pseudo-symmetry plane. However, the geminal protons at each position (axial and equatorial in the chair forms) are diastereotopic. Thus, the four protons at C2/C6 give rise to **2 signals**.\n        *   **C3 and C5:** These positions are also equivalent. Their geminal protons are diastereotopic. The four protons at C3/C5 give rise to **2 signals**.\n        *   **C4:** This position lies on the pseudo-symmetry plane. The two geminal protons here are enantiotopic, which means they are chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR solvent. They produce **1 signal**.\n        *   Total signals from the ring = 2 + 2 + 1 = **5 signals**.\n    2.  **Ethyl Group Protons (5H total):**\n        *   **-OCH2- Protons:** C1 of the ring is a prochiral center. Protons on a CH2 group near a prochiral center are diastereotopic, even if separated by several bonds (like the -C(O)O- linkage here). Therefore, the two methylene protons are chemically distinct and will produce **2 signals**.\n        *   **-CH3 Protons:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce **1 signal**.\n    3.  **Total Signals:**\n        *   Summing up the signals from all parts of the molecule: 5 (from the ring) + 2 (from the OCH2 group) + 1 (from the CH3 group) = **8 signals**.\n\nThis analysis, which combines a reasonable approximation for the ring's symmetry with a correct analysis of diastereotopicity, leads to one of the given options.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Bromine (Br2), Pyridine, Acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction type:** This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid. While the typical laboratory method is the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction which uses PBr3 as a catalyst, this combination of reagents also achieves the same transformation. The key is the bromination at the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group).\n*   **Transformation:** The methyl group (-CH3) of acetic acid becomes a bromomethyl group (-CH2Br).\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n\n*   **Reactant 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Ethanol (CH3CH2OH), Sulfuric acid (H2SO4, acid catalyst).\n*   **Reaction type:** This is a Fischer esterification.

It is analogous to the malonic ester synthesis for ring formation.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** The methylene protons (-CH2-) in ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing groups (the nitrile -CN and the ester -COOEt). NaH removes one of these protons to form a stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na+[NC-CH-COOEt] + H2\n    2.  **Intermolecular Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule, displacing one bromine.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]- + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br-\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The resulting molecule still has one acidic proton on the α-carbon.

However, for C1 to be chiral, it must be attached to four *different* groups. The four groups are: -CN, -COOEt, and the two paths around the ring (-C2-C3-C4-C5-C6- and -C6-C5-C4-C3-C2-). Since these two paths are identical, C1 is **not a chiral center**, and the molecule is **achiral**.\n    *   Because the molecule is achiral, it possesses elements of symmetry. At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. This creates a time-averaged structure with a **plane of symmetry** that passes through C1, its two substituents, and the opposite carbon, C4.\n\n2.  **Consequences of Symmetry for NMR:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes pairs of carbons and their attached protons chemically equivalent.\n    *   C2 is equivalent to C6.\n    *   C3 is equivalent to C5.\n    *   C4 is unique.\n\n3.  **Counting the Distinct Signals:**\n\n    *   **Ethoxy Group (-O-CH₂-CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation. They produce **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are also equivalent. They produce **1 signal**.\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:** We must consider the two hydrogens on each CH₂ group (geminal protons). Even when carbons are equivalent (e.g., C2 and C6), their geminal protons might not be.\n        *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The positions C2 and C6 are equivalent. However, on any single C2 (or C6) carbon, the two geminal protons are in different environments relative to the rest of the molecule. They are **diastereotopic** and thus chemically distinct. Therefore, the four protons on C2 and C6 give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n        *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. C3 and C5 are equivalent positions, but the two geminal protons on each are diastereotopic. This gives another **2 distinct signals**.\n        *   **Protons on C4:** C4 lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two geminal protons are on opposite sides of the ring and are also **diastereotopic**.

It removes the most acidic proton from ethyl cyanoacetate. The protons on the CH2 group are highly acidic (pKa ≈ 11) because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (the nitrile -CN and the ester -COOEt). This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        *   NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H2\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        *   [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation & Cyclization:** The problem states \"excess sodium hydride,\" meaning there is enough base to deprotonate the product from the first alkylation. The remaining proton on the α-carbon is still acidic.\n        *   NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + NaH → [NC-C((CH2)5Br)-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H2\n    4.  The newly formed carbanion undergoes a rapid *intramolecular* SN2 reaction. The nucleophilic carbon attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromine atom and forming a ring. The ring will contain the α-carbon and the five carbons of the pentyl chain, resulting in a 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group and an ethyl carboxylate group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   The structure of Product 4 is **Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate)**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the chemical equivalence of the protons in the molecule, considering its symmetry. At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping, and there is free rotation about single bonds. This results in a time-averaged structure that possesses an effective plane of symmetry (C_s). This plane passes through C1, C4, the cyano group (-CN), and the carboxyl group (-COO-).\n\nLet's count the signals based on this symmetry:\n\n1.  **The Ethyl Group (-OCH2CH3):**\n    *   **-CH3 protons:** The three protons of the methyl group are chemically equivalent due to fast rotation around the C-C bond. They will produce **1 signal**.\n    *   **-OCH2- protons:** These two methylene protons are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation of the molecule (the C_s plane doesn't interchange them). They are diastereotopic. This is because they are attached to an oxygen which is connected to a prochiral center (C1 of the ring). Therefore, they are chemically distinct and will produce **2 separate signals**.\n    *   Total signals from the ethyl group = 1 + 2 = **3 signals**.\n\n2.  **The Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5. C4 is unique.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** The two protons on C4 are reflected into each other by the plane of symmetry. They are enantiotopic and thus chemically equivalent. They produce **1 signal**.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The two geminal protons on C2 are not related by any symmetry element and are thus diastereotopic. The same is true for C6. The plane of symmetry makes one proton on C2 (e.g., the \"axial-like\" one) equivalent to its counterpart on C6. The other proton on C2 (the \"equatorial-like\" one) is equivalent to its counterpart on C6. This results in two distinct sets of protons for the C2/C6 positions. They produce **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies as for C2/C6. The four protons on these carbons give rise to **2 signals**.\n    *   Total signals from the cyclohexane ring = 1 (from C4) + 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) = **5 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nAdding the signals from the ethyl group and the cyclohexane ring:\nTotal Signals = 3 (ethyl) + 5 (ring) = **8 signals**.\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, which our analysis shows to be 8.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{8}$.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of hydrogen signals in the final product's ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Reaction Sequence Analysis\n\n1.  **Product 1:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) undergoes an α-halogenation reaction when treated with bromine (Br₂) and a catalyst like phosphorus tribromide (which can be generated in situ). The given reagents (bromine, pyridine, acetic anhydride) will achieve the same outcome. This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. The α-carbon of acetic acid is brominated, yielding **bromoacetic acid (Br-CH₂-COOH)**.\n\n2.  **Product 2:** Bromoacetic acid (Product 1) is then heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid. This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction, where the carboxylic acid is converted to an ester. The product is **ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n3.  **Product 3:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Product 2) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an Sₙ2 reaction. This yields **ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n4.  **Product 4:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (Product 3) has acidic protons on the α-carbon (the CH₂ group) due to the electron-withdrawing effects of both the cyano and the ester groups. It is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, which deprotonates the α-carbon. The resulting carbanion then reacts with 1,5-dibromopentane. This reaction proceeds via a two-step process:\n    *   **First, an intermolecular alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    *   **Second, an intramolecular cyclization:** The excess sodium hydride deprotonates the newly substituted α-carbon again. The resulting carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentane chain to form a stable six-membered ring. This intramolecular cyclization is known as the Thorpe-Ziegler reaction.\n    The final product, **Product 4**, is **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**.\n\n### ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the chemical equivalence of the protons in 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\nThe structure consists of an ethyl group and a cyclohexane ring substituted at the C1 position.\n\n*   **Ethyl Group (-CH₂CH₃):** Due to free rotation, the three protons of the methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent, giving one signal. The two protons of the methylene (-CH₂) group are also equivalent, giving a second signal.\n    *   **2 signals** from the ethyl group.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane Ring:** At room temperature, cyclohexane and its derivatives undergo rapid chair-chair interconversion. However, the presence of two bulky substituents on a single carbon (C1) significantly hinders this flipping motion, raising the energy barrier for interconversion. On the NMR timescale, the conformation can be considered \"frozen\" or in slow exchange.\n\n    In a fixed chair conformation, the molecule is chiral (it lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion). In a chiral molecule, protons that cannot be interchanged by any symmetry operation are chemically non-equivalent (diastereotopic).\n\n    Let's analyze the 10 protons on the cyclohexane ring in this \"frozen\" chiral state:\n    *   **C2 and C6 protons:** The axial and equatorial protons on C2 are distinct. Similarly, the axial and equatorial protons on C6 are distinct. Because the molecule is chiral, the environment of the C2 protons is different from the C6 protons. Therefore, all four protons (axial-C2, equatorial-C2, axial-C6, equatorial-C6) are chemically distinct. This gives **4 signals**.\n    *   **C3 and C5 protons:** By the same logic, the four protons on C3 and C5 are all chemically distinct. This gives another **4 signals**.\n    *   **C4 protons:** The axial and equatorial protons on C4 are in different chemical environments and are therefore distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Signals:**\n    *   From the ethyl group: 2 signals\n    *   From the C2/C6 positions: 4 signals\n    *   From the C3/C5 positions: 4 signals\n    *   From the C4 position: 2 signals\n\n    Total = 2 + 4 + 4 + 2 = **12 distinct hydrogen signals**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product, we must first elucidate the structure of product 4 through the given reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\nAcetic acid (CH₃COOH) is treated with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction, where the α-carbon of the carboxylic acid is brominated.\nProduct 1 is α-bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\nProduct 1 (BrCH₂COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a Fischer esterification reaction.\nProduct 2 is ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\nProduct 2 (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion is a strong nucleophile and displaces the bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction.\nProduct 3 is ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\nProduct 3 (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH₂)₅Br).\n1.  Sodium hydride, a strong base, deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is acidic due to the adjacent electron-withdrawing cyano and ester groups, forming an enolate: [NC-CH-COOCH₂CH₃]⁻.\n2.  This enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion and forming an intermediate: NC-CH( (CH₂)₅Br )-COOCH₂CH₃.\n3.  Since excess NaH is used, it deprotonates the α-carbon again, forming a new enolate: [NC-C( (CH₂)₅Br )-COOCH₂CH₃]⁻.\n4.  This enolate undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction. The carbanion attacks the carbon at the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a six-membered ring.\nThe final product, 4, is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n**1H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals for ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n1.  **Conformation:** The cyclohexane ring is substituted at the C1 position with two bulky groups (a cyano group and an ethyl carboxylate group). This significant 1,1-disubstitution will create a high energy barrier for chair-chair interconversion. Therefore, the ring can be considered \"locked\" in a single chair conformation on the NMR timescale.\n\n2.  **Symmetry:** Let's analyze the symmetry of the molecule in its locked chair conformation.\n    *   Strictly speaking, the molecule does not have a plane of symmetry. A plane passing through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group is disrupted by the ethyl portion (-CH₂CH₃) of the ester, which is not symmetric with respect to this plane.\n    *   However, in the context of typical organic chemistry problems, it is a common and reasonable simplification to assume that the rapid rotation of the ester group creates an *effective* plane of symmetry that passes through C1 and C4.\n\n3.  **Counting the Signals (assuming effective Cₛ symmetry):**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n    *   Because the chair is locked, the axial (ax) and equatorial (eq) protons on each carbon are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.\n\nLet's count the distinct sets of protons:\n*   **Ethyl group:** The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent, and the two protons of the methylene group (-CH₂-) are equivalent (within this simplified model). This gives **2 signals**.\n*   **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   **C2 and C6:** The two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other. The two equatorial protons are also equivalent to each other, but distinct from the axial ones. This gives **2 signals** (one for H-2ax/H-6ax and one for H-2eq/H-6eq).\n    *   **C3 and C5:** Similarly, the protons on these carbons give rise to another **2 signals** (one for H-3ax/H-5ax and one for H-3eq/H-5eq).\n    *   **C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two protons (axial and equatorial) are diastereotopic and therefore not equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nSumming them up: 2 (from ethyl group) + 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) = 8 distinct hydrogen signals.\n\nThe options are:\nA) 8\nB) 10\nC) 5\nD) 12\n\nOur analysis based on standard simplifying assumptions leads to 8 signals.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\n### Step-by-step Derivations of Products\n\n1.  **Product 1:** The reaction of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) with bromine (Br₂) and pyridine/acetic anhydride is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. It results in the bromination of the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group).\n    *   **Product 1 is α-bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).**\n\n2.  **Product 2:** Product 1 (BrCH₂COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid is converted to an ester.\n    *   **Product 2 is ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).**\n\n3.  **Product 3:** Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and replaces the bromine atom via an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   **Product 3 is ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).**\n\n4.  **Product 4:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane. This is a classic cyclization reaction related to the malonic ester synthesis.\n    *   First, the strong base (NaH) removes a proton from the carbon between the cyano and ester groups, which is highly acidic. This forms a carbanion: [NCCHCOOCH₂CH₃]⁻.\n    *   This carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an alkylation step.\n    *   Since excess NaH is used, the remaining acidic proton on the same carbon is also removed, forming a new carbanion.\n    *   This carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentane chain and displacing the second bromine atom. This creates a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4 is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.**\n\n### 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4\n\nThe structure of the final product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethyl carboxylate (-COOCH₂CH₃) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-to-chair interconversion. This rapid flipping results in a time-averaged structure with a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group.\n\nThe number of chemically distinct proton environments is determined as follows:\n\n*   **Ethyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n    1.  The two protons of the methylene group (-O**CH₂**CH₃) are chemically equivalent due to fast rotation around the single bonds. They will appear as one signal.\n    2.  The three protons of the methyl group (-OCH₂**CH₃**) are equivalent and will appear as a second, distinct signal.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    Due to the plane of symmetry in the time-averaged structure, the carbons on one side of the plane are equivalent to those on the other (C2 is equivalent to C6, and C3 is equivalent to C5). However, on each of these carbons, the axial and equatorial protons are in different chemical environments (they are diastereotopic) and are therefore chemically distinct.\n    3.  **C2 & C6 axial protons:** The two axial protons at these positions are equivalent to each other. This is one signal.\n    4.  **C2 & C6 equatorial protons:** The two equatorial protons at these positions are equivalent to each other but different from the axial ones. This is a second signal from the C2/C6 positions.\n    5.  **C3 & C5 axial protons:** The two axial protons here are equivalent. This is a third signal.\n    6.  **C7 & C5 equatorial protons:** The two equatorial protons here are equivalent.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the most accurate answer.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)\n\nThe four-step reaction sequence is as follows:\n\n1.  **Acetic acid + Br₂, pyridine, acetic anhydride → Product 1:** This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid (a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky type reaction). The product is **bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)**.\n2.  **Product 1 + ethanol, H₂SO₄ → Product 2:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid is converted to an ethyl ester. The product is **ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n3.  **Product 2 + NaCN → Product 3:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion displaces the bromide. The product is **ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n4.  **Product 3 + excess NaH + 1,5-dibromopentane → Product 4:** This is a tandem alkylation-cyclization reaction (a Thorpe-Ziegler reaction).\n    *   NaH, a strong base, deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate.\n    *   The resulting carbanion attacks one end of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing the first bromide ion.\n    *   The \"excess\" NaH deprotonates the same α-carbon again.\n    *   The new carbanion performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 attack on the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   The final product (4) is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the structure and symmetry of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry and Chirality:** Carbon C1 is attached to four different groups: (1) -CN, (2) -COOCH₂CH₃, (3) the ring path via C2, and (4) the ring path via C6. Because the two substituents (-CN and -COOCH₂CH₃) are different, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. Therefore, **C1 is a chiral center**, and the molecule as a whole is chiral. The reaction produces a racemic mixture, but the NMR spectrum of either enantiomer is identical in a standard (achiral) solvent.\n*   **Counting the \"Chemically Distinct\" Hydrogens:** In a chiral molecule with no symmetry, any two protons are chemically distinct unless they are interchangeable by a rapid process like bond rotation (homotopic protons, e.g., in a -CH₃ group).\n\nLet's count the signals based on this rigorous analysis:\n\n1.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons (10 total):**\n    *   Since the molecule has no plane of symmetry, the two sides of the ring are not equivalent. This means **C2 is not equivalent to C6**, and **C3 is not equivalent to C5**. All five methylene groups (at C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are in unique chemical environments.\n    *   Furthermore, within each of these five unique methylene groups, the two geminal protons (one axial and one equatorial in a given chair conformation) are **diastereotopic**. They are in different chemical environments relative to the substituents on the chiral center C1 and are not interchangeable.\n    *   Therefore, all 10 protons on the cyclohexane ring are chemically distinct. This gives **10 signals** from the ring protons.\n\n2.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   **-CH₃ group:** The three protons of the terminal methyl group are homotopic due to rapid rotation and are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **-OCH₂- group:** These two methylene protons are also in a chiral environment. They are **diastereotopic** and therefore chemically non-equivalent. Rigorously, they should produce two distinct signals. However, it is a very common simplification in problems of this type to consider the diastereotopicity of a flexible ethyl group as negligible, and thus count its two protons as a single signal system. Given that a total of 13 signals (10 ring + 2 methylene + 1 methyl) is not an option, this simplification is almost certainly intended by the question. Following this convention, the methylene protons give **1 signal**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSumming the signals based on the most chemically sound interpretation that matches an available answer:\n*   Signals from ring protons = 10\n*   Signals from ethyl -OCH₂- group (simplified) = 1\n*   Signals from ethyl -CH₃ group = 1\n\n**Total distinct signals = 10 + 1 + 1 = 12.**\n\nThis corresponds to option A in the provided answer key.\n\nFinal verification:\n*   The reasoning for 8 signals requires assuming a plane of symmetry, which is incorrect because the -CN and -COOEt groups are different.\n*   The reasoning for 5 signals requires an even greater oversimplification.\n*   The reasoning for 10 signals is incomplete or assumes a different product.\n*   The reasoning for 12 signals correctly identifies the lack of symmetry in the ring but applies a common and necessary simplification to the ethyl group to match the provided options.

In many textbook problems, a simplified model is used where one considers both the ax/eq distinction AND the overall symmetry of the molecule, even though these concepts are contradictory (a frozen chair lacks the symmetry of the flipping average). Let's apply this common, albeit flawed, logic, as it often leads to the intended answer in multiple-choice questions.\n        *   Assume a C1-C4 plane of symmetry, so C2 is equivalent to C6, and C3 is equivalent to C5.\n        *   Assume slow flip, so axial and equatorial protons are distinct.\n        *   **C2/C6 Protons:** The axial protons are equivalent to each other, and the equatorial protons are equivalent to each other. This gives 2 signals (Hax, Heq).\n        *   **C3/C5 Protons:** Similarly, this gives 2 signals (Hax, Heq).\n        *   **C4 Protons:** The two protons at C4 are diastereotopic (one axial, one equatorial) and give 2 signals (Hax, Heq).\n        *   This gives a total of 2 + 2 + 2 = **6 signals for the ring**.\n        *   Adding the **2 signals from the ethyl group** (assuming the CH2 protons are not resolved as diastereotopic, which is consistent with this simplified model), the total number of signals is 6 + 2 = **8 signals**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe rigorous analysis at room temperature (rapid flipping) gives 5 signals (Option B). A rigorous analysis at low temperature (slow flipping) gives 13 signals (not an option). A less likely elimination reaction pathway gives 10 signals (Option D). The simplified \"textbook\" slow-flipping model gives 8 signals (Option C). Given the options, it is highly probable that the question intends for the student to apply this specific simplified model for analyzing substituted cyclohexanes.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct hydrogen signals is 8.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product (4), we must first deduce its structure by following the reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\nAcetic acid (CH₃COOH) is treated with bromine (Br₂) and a catalyst (pyridine is mentioned, but typically PBr₃ is used, which can be generated in situ). This is a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction, which brominates the α-carbon of the carboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\nProduct 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a Fischer esterification reaction.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\nProduct 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\nProduct 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH₂)₅Br).\n1.  Sodium hydride is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is acidic due to the two adjacent electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt).\n    *   NCCH₂COOEt + NaH → [NCCHCOOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n2.  The resulting carbanion attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   [NCCHCOOEt]⁻ + Br(CH₂)₅Br → NCCH(COOEt)(CH₂)₅Br + Br⁻\n3.  The problem states *excess* sodium hydride is used. This means the remaining acidic α-hydrogen on the intermediate is also removed, forming a new carbanion.\n    *   NCCH(COOEt)(CH₂)₅Br + NaH → [NCC(COOEt)(CH₂)₅Br]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n4.  This carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentane chain and displacing the second bromide ion to form a six-membered ring.\n*   **Final Product 4:** 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane\n\n**¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nNow we must determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals for 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\nThe structure is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₂CH₃) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\nAt room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. This rapid interconversion creates a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, and the two substituents on C1. We must count the sets of hydrogens that are chemically non-equivalent in this averaged structure.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-O**CH₂**-) are chemically equivalent to each other but distinct from all other protons. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent to each other. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   Due to the plane of symmetry, the ring positions C2 and C6 are equivalent. Likewise, C3 and C5 are equivalent. Position C4 is unique.\n    *   **C2 and C6 Protons:** The two protons on C2 (and C6) are diastereotopic. This is because C1 is a prochiral center, and there is no local symmetry that makes the two geminal protons equivalent. Therefore, they have different chemical shifts. Since C2 and C6 are equivalent, this results in two distinct signals for the four protons at these positions. **2 signals**.\n    *   **C3 and C5 Protons:** Similarly, the geminal protons on C3 (and C5) are diastereotopic. This gives another two distinct signals for the four protons at these positions. **2 signals**.\n    *   **C4 Protons:** The two protons on C4 lie on the axis of symmetry. Reflection through the molecular plane of symmetry interchanges them, making them enantiotopic. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent and give a single signal. **1 signal**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nAdding up the signals from all parts of the molecule:\n*   From ethyl group: 1 (CH₂) + 1 (CH₃) = 2 signals\n*   From cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 1 (C4) = 5 signals\n\nTotal distinct signals = 2 + 5 = 7.\n\nHowever, 7 is not one of the options provided (A) 5, B) 12, C) 10, D) 8). Let's re-examine the assumptions. It is a common simplification in introductory problems to consider the protons on a given methylene group in a symmetrically substituted ring (like C2/C6, C3/C5, and C4 here) as equivalent, even though they are technically diastereotopic or enantiotopic. This simplification assumes that the difference in chemical shift is negligible or that the question is not asking for this level of detail.\n\nLet's apply this simplification:\n*   Ethyl group: 2 signals (CH₂ and CH₃).\n*   Cyclohexane Ring (simplified):\n    *   C2/C6 protons (4H): **1 signal**.\n    *   C3/C5 protons (4H): **1 signal**.\n    *   C4 protons (2H): **1 signal**.\n*   Total signals (simplified) = 2 (ethyl) + 3 (ring) = **5 signals**.\n\nThis result matches option A. Given the multiple-choice format, it is highly probable that this simplified analysis, which relies on the overall symmetry of the ring positions (C2=C6, C3=C5, C4=unique), is the intended approach.\n\nFinal check:\n*   Signal 1: -O**CH₂**CH₃ (quartet)\n*   Signal 2: -OCH₂**CH₃** (triplet)\n*   Signal 3: Protons on C2 and C6 (multiplet)\n*   Signal 4: Protons on C3 and C5 (multiplet)\n*   Signal 5: Protons on C4 (multiplet)\n\nThis gives a total of 5 distinct signals.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Trace the reaction sequence:** Determine the chemical structure of each intermediate product (1, 2, 3) and the final product (4).\n2.  **Analyze the final structure:** Examine the structure of product 4 for any elements of symmetry.\n3.  **Count distinct hydrogens:** Based on the symmetry, identify all groups of chemically non-equivalent hydrogens. The number of these groups corresponds to the number of signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n4.  **Provide the code:** Write a Python script that prints the final count and the corresponding multiple-choice option.\n\n**Step-by-step Derivations:**\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) undergoes alpha-bromination. This reaction replaces one of the alpha-hydrogens with a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH)\n*   **Reaction 2:** Product 1 (a carboxylic acid) reacts with ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst (H2SO4). This is a Fischer esterification.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3)\n*   **Reaction 3:** Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN-) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an SN2 reaction.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3)\n*   **Reaction 4:** This is a tandem deprotonation-alkylation-cyclization reaction.\n    1.  Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, removes a proton from the carbon between the cyano and ester groups, which is the most acidic position.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion attacks one of the bromine atoms on 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    3.  The excess NaH removes the second proton from the same carbon.\n    4.  The new carbanion performs an intramolecular attack on the other end of the pentane chain, closing a ring. This forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate\n\n**Analysis of Final Product (4) for 1H NMR:**\n\nThe final product is Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. To count the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we look for symmetry.\n\n*   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through C1 (the carbon with the substituents), C4, the cyano group, and the ester group (considering time-averaging from free rotation).\n*   Due to this symmetry and the rapid chair-flipping of the cyclohexane ring at room temperature, we can identify the following distinct sets of hydrogens:\n    1.  **-CH3 protons:** The three hydrogens on the methyl part of the ethyl ester are equivalent. (1 signal)\n    2.  **-OCH2- protons:** The two hydrogens on the methylene part of the ethyl ester are equivalent.

This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid (the methyl group) is brominated.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification reaction.

These protons are particularly acidic (pKa ≈ 11).\n        `NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂`\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion (enolate) acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)₅-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)₅-Br + Br⁻`\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation and Cyclization (Thorpe-Ziegler reaction):** The problem states \"excess sodium hydride\". This means there is enough base to deprotonate the remaining acidic proton on the alpha-carbon of the intermediate formed above.\n        `NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)₅-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)₅-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂`\n        The resulting carbanion is now positioned to attack the other end of the pentane chain, which still has a bromine atom. This intramolecular SN2 reaction is highly favorable as it forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n    4.  **Final Product 4:** The product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH2CH3) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry and Conformation:** Cyclohexane rings exist in rapidly interconverting chair conformations at room temperature. However, for the purpose of counting chemically distinct protons in complex substituted rings, it is a common convention in academic problems to consider a single, \"locked\" or \"frozen\" chair conformation. In this state, the molecule lacks any plane of symmetry and is chiral.\n*   **Counting the Signals (assuming a locked conformation):**\n    1.  **Ring Protons:** In a locked, unsymmetrical cyclohexane derivative, all the methylene groups (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are in chemically different environments. Furthermore, the two protons on each methylene group (one axial, one equatorial) are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.\n        *   Protons on C2: 2 distinct signals.\n        *   Protons on C3: 2 distinct signals.\n        *   Protons on C4: 2 distinct signals.\n        *   Protons on C5: 2 distinct signals.\n        *   Protons on C6: 2 distinct signals.\n        This gives a total of **10 distinct signals** from the protons on the cyclohexane ring.\n    2.  **Ethoxycarbonyl Group Protons (-COOCH2CH3):**\n        *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   **Methylene Protons (-O-CH2-):** In many introductory contexts, the two protons of the ethyl's methylene group are treated as equivalent, giving one signal (a quartet). Although they are technically diastereotopic in a chiral molecule (like our locked conformation) and should give two signals, it is a frequent simplification in problems of this type to count them as one.\n        *   Assuming this common simplification, the methylene protons give **1 signal**.\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   From the ring: 10 signals\n    *   From the ethyl group: 1 (for -CH2-) + 1 (for -CH3-) = 2 signals\n    *   Total = 10 + 2 = **12 signals**.\n\nThis number matches one of the given options. The alternative analysis (assuming rapid chair flipping) leads to 7 signals, which is not an option. The alternative reaction product (a dimer) leads to a mixture of diastereomers, making the analysis inconsistent with a single number answer. Therefore, the most plausible intended answer is derived from the analysis of the major cyclized product under the assumption of a locked conformation.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This is an alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid, a reaction similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. Bromine is added to the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group).\n*   **Product 1:** Br-CH2-COOH (Bromoacetic acid).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl bromoacetate).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a strong nucleophile that displaces the bromide ion via an SN2 reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a two-step alkylation process followed by cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** The hydrogens on the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups are acidic (pKa ≈ 11). The strong base NaH removes one proton to form a stable carbanion (enolate).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one of the carbons bearing a bromine atom on 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation & Cyclization:** Since excess NaH is used, the remaining acidic proton on the alpha-carbon is removed to form a new carbanion. This carbanion then attacks the other end of the pentyl chain in an intramolecular SN2 reaction, displacing the second bromide and forming a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**Step 5: 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n*   **Structure:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This, along with free rotation of the ester group, creates a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group. This makes the molecule achiral on the NMR timescale.\n*   **Consequences of Symmetry:**\n    *   The two sides of the ring are equivalent: C2 is equivalent to C6, and C3 is equivalent to C5.\n*   **Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Signals:**\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH2CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the terminal methyl (-CH3) group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene (-CH2-) group are rendered enantiotopic by the molecular plane of symmetry. Enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR experiment. This gives **1 signal**.\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n        *   **C2 and C6 protons:** These positions are equivalent. The two protons on C2 (one axial, one equatorial in any given chair conformation) are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation of the molecule. They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. The same is true for C6. Since C2 and C6 are equivalent, the protons on these two carbons give a total of **2 signals**.\n        *   **C3 and C5 protons:** These positions are equivalent. Similar to C2/C6, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. This pair of positions contributes **2 signals**.\n        *   **C4 protons:** This position lies on the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on C4 are diastereotopic. This is because replacing one proton with a different group (e.g., Deuterium) would create a diastereomer relative to replacing the other proton (e.g., creating a cis vs. trans relationship to the substituents on C1). Therefore, they are chemically distinct and give **2 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Signal Count:**\n    *   From the ethyl group: 1 (for -CH3) + 1 (for -CH2-) = 2 signals.\n    *   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (for C2/C6) + 2 (for C3/C5) + 2 (for C4) = 6 signals.\n    *   **Total = 2 + 6 = 8 distinct hydrogen signals.**\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the final product.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Synthesis**\n\n1.  **Acetic acid with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride:** This is an α-bromination reaction of acetic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. The product is bromoacetic acid.\n    *   **Product 1:** BrCH₂COOH\n\n2.  **Product 1 with ethanol and sulfuric acid:** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid (bromoacetic acid) reacts with an alcohol (ethanol) in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃ (Ethyl bromoacetate)\n\n3.  **Product 2 with sodium cyanide:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (S_N2) reaction.

For determining the number of chemically distinct protons, we should consider this static conformation.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ethoxycarbonyl group. This plane makes the left and right sides of the ring equivalent.\n*   **Ethyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n    1.  The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation.

In many introductory contexts, these are treated as equivalent, giving **one signal**.\n*   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   Because the ring is in a locked conformation, the axial and equatorial protons on each carbon are chemically distinct unless related by symmetry.\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n    3.  **H-axial on C2 and C6:** These two protons are equivalent.

Bromoacetic acid is reacted with ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n    *   Product 2 is **ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 + Sodium Cyanide → Product 3**\n    This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   Product 3 is **ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 + excess Sodium Hydride + 1,5-dibromopentane → Product 4**\n    This is a multi-step process in one pot.\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is acidic due to the two adjacent electron-withdrawing groups (cyano and ester).\n        *   NCCH₂COOEt + NaH → [NCCHCOOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    *   The resulting carbanion (an enolate) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br) in an SN2 reaction.\n        *   [NCCHCOOEt]⁻ + Br(CH₂)₅Br → NCCH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br + Br⁻\n    *   The problem states *excess* sodium hydride is used. The mono-alkylated product still has one acidic proton on the α-carbon. The excess NaH will deprotonate this carbon again.\n        *   NCCH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br + NaH → [NCC(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    *   The resulting carbanion is now part of the same molecule as an alkyl bromide. It will undergo an intramolecular SN2 reaction, attacking the carbon bearing the bromine. This forms a cyclic compound. The ring will consist of the α-carbon and the five carbons of the pentane chain, resulting in a 6-membered ring.\n    *   Product 4 is **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane):**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we need to analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. The time-averaged conformation has a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, the two substituents, and the opposite carbon, C4.\n*   **Chemical Equivalence:** Protons that can be interchanged by a symmetry operation (like this plane of reflection) are chemically equivalent and will have the same chemical shift. Protons that cannot be interchanged are chemically distinct.\n\nLet's count the distinct proton environments:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   **-CH₃:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **-OCH₂-:** The two protons of the methylene group are enantiotopic because they are related by the plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry relates the protons on C2 with C6, and C3 with C5.\n    *   **C2 and C6:** These two carbons are equivalent. On each carbon, there is an axial and an equatorial proton. These two protons (e.g., H2-ax and H2-eq) are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. Because C2 and C6 are equivalent, the two axial protons (H2-ax, H6-ax) form one set, and the two equatorial protons (H2-eq, H6-eq) form another. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **C3 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent. Similar to the C2/C6 case, the axial protons (H3-ax, H5-ax) are equivalent to each other, and the equatorial protons (H3-eq, H5-eq) are equivalent to each other. The axial and equatorial protons on the same carbon are distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. The two protons attached to it (H4-ax and H4-eq) are diastereotopic and not interchangeable. They are in different chemical environments. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\n*   From the ethyl group: 1 (CH₃) + 1 (OCH₂) = 2 signals\n*   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = 6 signals\n*   **Total = 2 + 6 = 8 distinct hydrogen signals.**\n\nThe analysis of the reaction sequence leads to 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane. The symmetry analysis of this molecule reveals 8 chemically distinct sets of protons.\n\nFinal check of the logic:\n- Reaction sequence is standard and correct.\n- Final product structure is correct.\n- Symmetry analysis of a 1,1-disubstituted cyclohexane is standard. The presence of a symmetry plane simplifies the spectrum but does not make all ring protons equivalent. Axial and equatorial protons on the same carbon are diastereotopic (unless other symmetries are present), and thus distinct. Protons on carbons related by the symmetry plane are equivalent.\n- C2-Hax is equivalent to C6-Hax.\n- C2-Heq is equivalent to C6-Heq.\n- C3-Hax is equivalent to C5-Hax.\n- C3-Heq is equivalent to C5-Heq.\n- C4-Hax is distinct from C4-Heq.\n- OCH₂ protons are enantiotopic and thus equivalent in an achiral solvent.\n- CH₃ protons are equivalent.\n- Total count: 1(CH₃) + 1(OCH₂) + 1(C2/6ax) + 1(C2/6eq) + 1(C3/5ax) + 1(C3/5eq) + 1(C4ax) + 1(C4eq) = 8 signals.\n\nThe reasoning is sound.\n\nThe final product, 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane, has the following distinct proton environments:\n\n1.  The three protons of the methyl group in the ethyl ester.\n2.  The two protons of the methylene group in the ethyl ester (these are enantiotopic and thus chemically equivalent).\n3.  The two axial protons on carbons 2 and 6 of the cyclohexane ring.\n4.  The two equatorial protons on carbons 2 and 6 of the cyclohexane ring.\n5.  The two axial protons on carbons 3 and 5 of the cyclohexane ring.\n6.  The two equatorial protons on carbons 3 and 5 of the cyclohexane ring.\n7.  The axial proton on carbon 4 of the cyclohexane ring.\n8.  The equatorial proton on carbon 4 of the cyclohexane ring.\n\nThis gives a total of 8 distinct signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the final product.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Synthesis**\n\n1.  **Product 1:** Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride. This is an alpha-bromination reaction, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. Acetic anhydride and pyridine facilitate the formation of an enol or enolate, which then reacts with bromine. The product is bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Product 2:** Bromoacetic acid is heated with ethanol and sulfuric acid. This is a classic Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester. The product is ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Product 3:** Ethyl bromoacetate is treated with sodium cyanide. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an Sₙ2 reaction. The product is ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Product 4:** Ethyl cyanoacetate is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    *   NaH, a strong base, removes an acidic proton from the carbon between the cyano and carbonyl groups.\n    *   The resulting carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in a nucleophilic substitution.\n    *   Because excess NaH is used, the remaining acidic proton on the same carbon is removed, forming another carbanion.\n    *   This carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other bromine-bearing carbon at the end of the pentane chain. This cyclization forms a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   The final product (4) is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### **¹H NMR Analysis of the Final Product**\n\nThe structure of the final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. To determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n          CN\n          |\n       /--C--\\\n      |       |\n     CH₂     CH₂\n     |       |\n     CH₂     CH₂\n      \\--CH₂--/\n          |\n         C=O\n          |\n          O\n          |\n         CH₂\n          |\n         CH₃\n    ```\n\n*   **Symmetry and Chemical Equivalence:**\n    1.  The central carbon of the cyclohexane ring (C1) is bonded to four different groups: a cyano group (-CN), an ethyl carboxylate group (-COOEt), and two different paths around the ring. This makes C1 a chiral center.\n    2.  Due to the presence of this chiral center, the molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n    3.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the terminal methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent due to free rotation and will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene (-OCH₂-) group are adjacent to the chiral center (C1). This makes them diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent and will produce **2 distinct signals**.\n    4.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n        *   At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. This process averages the signals of the axial and equatorial protons on each carbon.\n        *   However, because the molecule as a whole is asymmetric, the five methylene (CH₂) groups of the ring are all in chemically different environments. The CH₂ group at C2 is not equivalent to the one at C6, and the one at C3 is not equivalent to C5. The CH₂ group at C4 is also unique.\n        *   Therefore, there are **5 distinct signals** for the protons on the cyclohexane ring.\n\n*   **Total Signal Count:**\n    *   From the ethyl group: 1 (for -CH₃) + 2 (for -OCH₂-) = 3 signals\n    *   From the cyclohexane ring: 5 signals\n    *   Total = 3 + 5 = **8 signals**\n\nThus, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the ¹H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an alpha-bromination of a carboxylic acid, a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. Acetic acid has one alpha-carbon (the methyl group). The reaction brominates this position.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (Br-CH2-COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion, which is a good leaving group.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a two-step alkylation followed by cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH is a strong base that removes an acidic alpha-proton from ethyl cyanoacetate. The protons on the CH2 group between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups are acidic due to the electron-withdrawing nature of both groups.\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion (enolate) is a good nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The problem states \"excess NaH\", which means there is enough base to remove the second, now only, alpha-proton.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    4.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The newly formed carbanion attacks the other end of the carbon chain at the carbon bearing the second bromine atom. This is an intramolecular SN2 reaction. The chain consists of the alpha-carbon and the five carbons from the pentane chain, leading to the formation of a stable 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the structure and symmetry of Product 4.\n\n1.  **Conformation and Stability:** Cyclohexane rings exist in chair conformations. Product 4 has two bulky substituents on C1: a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3). These two groups can be arranged in two different chair conformations:\n    *   Conformer A: -COOEt (equatorial), -CN (axial)\n    *   Conformer B: -COOEt (axial), -CN (equatorial)\n    The ethoxycarbonyl group is bulkier than the cyano group. The conformer with the larger group in the more stable equatorial position will be the major conformer. Therefore, Conformer A is the dominant species in solution. At room temperature, the population of Conformer B will be very low. For the purpose of analyzing the spectrum, we can consider only the signals from the major conformer (Conformer A).\n\n2.  **Symmetry of the Major Conformer:** Let's analyze the symmetry of Conformer A (COOEt equatorial, CN axial). This conformer lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule in this conformation is **chiral**.\n\n3.  **Counting the Ring Protons:** Because the major conformer is chiral, no two protons on the ring are equivalent by symmetry (unless by accidental equivalence).\n    *   The ring has five CH2 groups (at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, C6).\n    *   Within each CH2 group, the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.\n    *   Since there is no symmetry, the CH2 group at C2 is different from C6, and C3 is different from C5. All five CH2 groups are in unique chemical environments.\n    *   Therefore, all 10 protons on the cyclohexane ring (5 axial, 5 equatorial) are chemically distinct.\n    *   **Number of signals from ring protons = 10.**\n\n4.  **Counting the Ethyl Group Protons:** The ethyl group (-O-CH2-CH3) is attached to the ring.\n    *   **-CH3 group:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to rapid rotation around the C-C bond. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **-O-CH2- group:** In many introductory problems, the two protons of an ethyl group's CH2 are treated as equivalent. This is a simplification. Rigorously, since these protons are in a chiral molecule, they are diastereotopic and should give two distinct signals. However, multiple-choice questions often rely on common simplifications. If we apply the simplification that they are equivalent, they give **1 signal**.\n\n5.  **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Using the simplification for the ethyl group:\n        Total signals = (Signals from ring) + (Signals from ethyl group)\n        Total signals = 10 + (1 for -CH2- + 1 for -CH3) = 10 + 2 = 12.\n\nThis result (12) matches one of the options. This line of reasoning requires assuming that one conformer is dominant (which is chemically sound) and that the diastereotopicity of the ethyl CH2 protons is ignored (a common simplification in this type of problem).\n\nLet's briefly consider the rigorous count: 10 signals from the ring + 3 signals from the ethyl group (2 for the diastereotopic CH2, 1 for CH3) = 13 signals. This is not an option.\nLet's consider the fast-flipping average model: 3 ring signals + 2 ethyl signals = 5 signals (Option D). This ignores the key information that the stable conformer is chiral and that \"chemically distinct\" protons should be counted.\nThe analysis leading to 12 signals is the most plausible interpretation that matches an answer choice.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n*   Ring Protons (C2-Hax, C2-Heq, C3-Hax, C3-Heq, C4-Hax, C4-Heq, C5-Hax, C5-Heq, C6-Hax, C6-Heq): 10 distinct signals\n*   Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH2CH3): 2 distinct signals (one for CH2, one for CH3, using a common simplification)\n*   Total = 10 + 2 = 12\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the final product and the analysis of its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Bromine (Br2), Pyridine, Acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This is an alpha-bromination of a carboxylic acid, a reaction similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is brominated.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH), Ethanol (CH3CH2OH), Sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3), Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3), excess Sodium hydride (NaH), 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a sequence involving deprotonation and alkylation.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH, a strong base, removes a proton from the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOCH2CH3) groups, as this proton is highly acidic. This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)₅-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)₅-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Cyclization:** The problem states \"excess sodium hydride,\" which means there is still base present to deprotonate the remaining acidic alpha-hydrogen on the newly formed intermediate.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)₅-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)₅-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n        This new carbanion then undergoes a rapid intramolecular SN2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain. This cyclization is highly favored as it forms a stable 6-membered ring (a Thorpe-Ziegler reaction).\n*   **Product 4:** The resulting product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we need to analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n1.  **Symmetry:** The two substituents on C1 (-CN and -COOCH2CH3) are different. This means the molecule has no plane of symmetry and is chiral. Consequently, any protons that are not interchangeable by rapid conformational changes (like bond rotation or ring flipping) are chemically distinct.\n\n2.  **Analysis at Room Temperature (Rapid Chair Flip):**\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   The cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-to-chair interconversion. This process averages the chemical environments of the axial and equatorial protons on any single carbon atom.\n        *   However, the carbons of the ring are in different chemical environments due to the asymmetric substitution at C1.\n        *   C2 and C6 are adjacent to C1 but are non-equivalent because one is \"closer\" to the cyano group and the other is \"closer\" to the ester group in 3D space. The two protons on C2 become equivalent due to the rapid flip, giving one signal. The two protons on C6 also become equivalent, giving a second, different signal.\n        *   Similarly, C3 and C5 are non-equivalent. This gives two more distinct signals.\n        *   C4 is in a unique position, opposite to C1. Its two protons become equivalent, giving a fifth signal.\n        *   Therefore, the ten protons on the cyclohexane ring produce **5 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH2CH3) Group Protons:**\n        *   **Methylene (-O-CH2-) Protons:** The molecule is chiral. The two protons of the methylene group are adjacent to a carbonyl group which is attached to the chiral framework. This makes the two methylene protons diastereotopic. Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and give rise to separate signals, regardless of conformational changes. Thus, they produce **2 distinct signals**.\n        *   **Methyl (-CH3) Protons:** The three protons of the terminal methyl group are equivalent due to rapid rotation around the C-C bond. They produce **1 distinct signal**.\n\n3.  **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Summing up the signals from all parts of the molecule:\n    *   5 (from the ring) + 2 (from -OCH2-) + 1 (from -CH3) = **8 distinct signals**.\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens. Based on the most likely product and a standard analysis of its NMR spectrum at room temperature, there are 8 distinct sets of hydrogens.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the final product and the analysis of its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid, a reaction analogous to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) has one α-carbon (the methyl group). One of the α-hydrogens is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid (bromoacetic acid) reacts with an alcohol (ethanol, CH₃CH₂OH) in the presence of an acid catalyst (H₂SO₄) to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻), which is a good leaving group.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a sequence involving deprotonation and alkylation, leading to cyclization. It's a variation of the malonic ester synthesis.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes an acidic α-proton from ethyl cyanoacetate. The protons on the CH₂ group are acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group, -CN, and an ester group, -COOCH₂CH₃).\n        `NC-CH₂-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂`\n    2.  **Alkylation & Cyclization:** The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule. Since excess base is used, the remaining α-proton is also removed, and the new carbanion performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentane chain to form a stable six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nNow, we must determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum of 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents (-CN and -COOCH₂CH₃) on the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry:** Because the two substituents on C1 are different, the molecule is chiral and lacks a plane of symmetry. A rigorous analysis would suggest that all 10 protons on the cyclohexane ring are chemically distinct, and the two protons of the ethyl group's -CH₂- are also distinct (diastereotopic), leading to 13 signals. Since 13 is not an option, a simplified model, common in academic problems, is required.\n\n*   **Simplified Analysis:**\n    The most common simplification for such a molecule is to assume an \"effective\" plane of symmetry that passes through C1 and C4 of the ring. This simplification treats the influence of the two different substituents as being averaged out from the perspective of the ring protons. We also simplify by treating the two protons on the ethyl -CH₂- group as equivalent.\n\n    Let's count the signals based on this simplified model:\n\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene (-CH₂-) group are treated as equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   Under the pseudo-symmetry model, C2 is equivalent to C6, and C3 is equivalent to C5. C4 is unique.\n        *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The axial and equatorial protons on these carbons are in different chemical environments (diastereotopic). The two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent to each other. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** Similarly, the four protons on these two carbons give **2 signals** (one for the two axial H's, one for the two equatorial H's).\n        *   **Protons on C4:** The axial and equatorial protons on C4 are diastereotopic and thus non-equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   *Total from ring = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals.*\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    Adding the signals from the ethyl group and the ring: 2 (from ethyl) + 6 (from ring) = **8 signals**.\n\nThis result corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Analysis:** This is an α-halogenation reaction of a carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The α-carbon of acetic acid is the methyl group. One of the α-hydrogens is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a variation of the malonic ester synthesis for forming a cyclic compound.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH is a strong base that removes an acidic α-hydrogen from the carbon between the cyano and ester groups, forming a stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since excess NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining α-hydrogen on the newly substituted carbon.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    4.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The carbanion on the α-carbon now attacks the carbon at the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion. This is an intramolecular SN2 reaction that forms a six-membered ring, which is thermodynamically favorable.\n*   **Final Product 4:** The resulting molecule is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**Structure of Final Product 4:**\n```\n      CN\n      |\n C1 -- C(=O)OCH2CH3\n/  \\\nC6--C2\n|    |\nC5--C3\n \\  /\n  C4\n```\nWhere C1 to C6 form the cyclohexane ring.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nTo find the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we need to identify all the sets of chemically non-equivalent protons in the molecule. The question specifies that we should count all chemically distinct hydrogens, even if their signals might overlap in a real spectrum.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH2CH3):**\n    *   **-CH3 (methyl) protons:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation around the C-C bond. They will produce **1 signal**.\n    *   **-OCH2- (methylene) protons:** These two protons are diastereotopic. This is because the carbon they are attached to is linked via the ester group to C1 of the cyclohexane ring, which is a prochiral center (it's bonded to four different groups: CN, COOEt, C2 of the ring, and C6 of the ring). Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and will produce two distinct signals. Therefore, this group gives **2 signals**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The ring has five methylene (CH2) groups. At room temperature, the rapid chair-chair interconversion averages the axial and equatorial environments for each CH2 group. This means the two protons on any single carbon (e.g., C2) become chemically equivalent on the NMR timescale and produce a single signal.\n    *   Now we must compare the different CH2 groups (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) to see which are equivalent.\n    *   The two substituents on C1 (-CN and -COOEt) are different. This lack of symmetry means that the environment on one side of the ring is different from the other.\n    *   **C2 vs. C6:** C2 is adjacent to C1. C6 is also adjacent to C1. However, there is no plane of symmetry passing through C1 and C4 because the substituents are different. Therefore, the protons on C2 are in a different chemical environment than the protons on C6. They are non-equivalent.\n    *   **C3 vs. C5:** C3 is adjacent to C2, while C5 is adjacent to C6. Since C2 and C6 are non-equivalent, C3 and C5 are also non-equivalent.\n    *   **C4:** The C4 position is unique.\n    *   Therefore, all five methylene groups on the ring are in chemically distinct environments. This results in **5 signals** from the ring protons.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\n*   From the ethyl -CH3 group: 1 signal\n*   From the ethyl -OCH2- group: 2 signals\n*   From the five ring -CH2- groups: 5 signals\n\nTotal = 1 + 2 + 5 = 8 distinct hydrogen signals.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the final product's structure, followed by an analysis of its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Reaction Sequence**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n    *   Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is treated with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride. This set of reagents is used for the α-bromination of the carboxylic acid, a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction.\n    *   **Product 1** is 2-bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n    *   Product 1 (2-bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction.\n    *   **Product 2** is ethyl 2-bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n    *   Product 2 (ethyl 2-bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   **Product 3** is ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n    *   Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH₂)₅Br).\n    *   Sodium hydride is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is acidic due to the two adjacent electron-withdrawing groups (cyano and ester).\n    *   The resulting carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion and forming an intermediate.\n    *   Because excess NaH is used, the α-carbon is deprotonated again. This new carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromide ion.\n    *   This intramolecular cyclization forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4** is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **¹H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring substituted at the C1 position with both a cyano (-CN) group and an ethyl carboxylate (-COOCH₂CH₃) group.\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must identify all the protons that are in chemically non-equivalent environments. The question specifies that we should count all *chemically distinct* hydrogens, even if rapid conformational changes might make them appear equivalent in a standard room-temperature NMR spectrum. This means we must consider the protons in a fixed chair conformation, as diastereotopic protons are fundamentally chemically distinct.\n\nThe molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group. This symmetry makes pairs of protons equivalent.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons:**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent to each other. This is **Signal 1**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are equivalent to each other. This is **Signal 2**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   In a chair conformation, each carbon (from C2 to C6) has an axial and an equatorial proton. These are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6. However, the axial proton (H_ax) and equatorial proton (H_eq) on C2 are diastereotopic. Therefore, the two axial protons (at C2 and C6) give one signal, and the two equatorial protons give another.\n        *   **Signal 3:** H_ax at C2 and C6.\n        *   **Signal 4:** H_eq at C2 and C6.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** Similarly, the protons on C3 are equivalent to those on C5. The axial and equatorial protons are distinct.\n        *   **Signal 5:** H_ax at C3 and C5.\n        *   **Signal 6:** H_eq at C3 and C5.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** The two protons on C4 are also diastereotopic. They are not equivalent to any other protons in the molecule.\n        *   **Signal 7:** H_ax at C4.\n        *   **Signal 8:** H_eq at C4.\n\nCounting these distinct sets gives a total of 8 signals.\n\n*   **2 signals** from the ethyl group.\n*   **6 signals** from the cyclohexane ring.\n\nTotal = 2 + 6 = **8** distinct hydrogen signals.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of hydrogen signals in the final product.\n\n### **Reaction Sequence Analysis**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n    *   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH), bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n    *   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is used for the alpha-bromination of the carboxylic acid. This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction.\n    *   **Product 1:** 2-Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH₂COOH), ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH), and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a classic Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl 2-bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl 2-bromoacetate), and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻).\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl 2-cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl 2-cyanoacetate), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH₂)₅Br).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a sequential deprotonation and alkylation process.\n        *   First, NaH, a strong base, removes an acidic α-proton from ethyl 2-cyanoacetate to form an enolate.\n        *   This enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion.\n        *   The use of *excess* NaH ensures that the second, and now only, α-proton is also removed, creating a new enolate.\n        *   This new enolate undergoes a rapid intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction (a Thorpe-Ziegler type cyclization), attacking the other end of the pentyl chain to displace the second bromide ion. This forms a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n### **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring substituted at the C1 position with both a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₂CH₃) group.\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the chemical equivalence of the protons in the molecule.\n\n1.  **Symmetry:** The two substituents on C1, cyano and ethoxycarbonyl, are different in terms of size and electronic properties. Therefore, the molecule is asymmetric and does not possess a plane of symmetry. The C1 carbon is a chiral center, and the product is a racemic mixture.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   Because there is no plane of symmetry, the two sides of the ring are not equivalent. This means that the protons on C2 are not equivalent to the protons on C6, and the protons on C3 are not equivalent to the protons on C5.\n    *   Furthermore, in a substituted cyclohexane ring, the two protons on any given methylene (CH₂) group (the axial and equatorial protons) are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent.\n    *   Therefore, all ten protons on the cyclohexane ring are chemically distinct.\n        *   C2: 2 distinct protons (axial and equatorial).\n        *   C3: 2 distinct protons (axial and equatorial).\n        *   C4: 2 distinct protons (axial and equatorial).\n        *   C5: 2 distinct protons (axial and equatorial).\n        *   C6: 2 distinct protons (axial and equatorial).\n    *   This gives a total of **10 signals** from the ring protons.\n\n3.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃) Protons:**\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃):** The three protons of the terminal methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation around the carbon-carbon bond. They will produce **1 signal**.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (-OCH₂-):** These two protons are adjacent to the ester oxygen and beta to the chiral center at C1. Protons that are adjacent to a chiral center are typically diastereotopic and chemically non-equivalent. However, in multiple-choice questions of this nature, it is a common simplification to consider them equivalent if they are not part of a rigid ring structure, as their chemical shift difference might be negligible. If we apply this simplification, these two protons give rise to **1 signal**.\n\n### **Total Number of Signals**\n\nSumming the signals from all parts of the molecule based on the analysis above:\n*   Ring Protons: 10 signals\n*   Ethyl Methylene Protons (-OCH₂-): 1 signal (with simplification)\n*   Ethyl Methyl Protons (-CH₃): 1 signal\n\nTotal Signals = 10 + 1 + 1 = 12.\n\nThis corresponds to option B. If the diastereotopic nature of the -OCH₂- protons were strictly considered, the total would be 13, which is not an option. If the ring were assumed to be symmetric (a chemically inaccurate simplification), the answer would be 8 (Option A). The most chemically sound interpretation that matches an available option is 12.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n*   **Starting Material:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂, pyridine, acetic anhydride, heat.\n*   This set of reagents performs an α-bromination of the carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. One of the α-hydrogens (on the methyl group) is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n**Step 2: 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n*   **Starting Material (1):** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH), H₂SO₄ (acid catalyst), heat.\n*   This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction, where the carboxylic acid is converted to an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 3: 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n*   **Starting Material (2):** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile and will displace the bromide leaving group in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 4: 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n*   **Starting Material (3):** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess Sodium Hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br).\n*   **Analysis of the reaction:**\n    1.  The protons on the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic (pKa ≈ 11) because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt). Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, will deprotonate this carbon to form a resonance-stabilized enolate: [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻.\n    2.  This enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion. This is the first alkylation step, forming an intermediate: NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br.\n    3.  The problem states that **excess** NaH is used. This is a crucial piece of information. The intermediate formed in the previous step still has one acidic proton on the α-carbon. The excess NaH will deprotonate this intermediate to form a new carbanion: [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br]⁻.\n    4.  This carbanion will then undergo a rapid intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction. The nucleophilic carbon attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a six-membered ring. This type of reaction (tandem alkylation-cyclization) is a standard and efficient method for synthesizing cyclic compounds.\n*   **Final Product 4:** The product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group and an ethoxycarbonyl group attached to the same carbon (C1). The structure is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**Determining the number of 1H NMR signals for Product 4.**\n*   **Structure of Product 4:**\n        CN\n        |\n     C1-CO-O-CH₂-CH₃\n    / \\\n H₂C---CH₂\n |     |\n H₂C---CH₂\n   \\ /\n    CH₂\n\n*   To determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. The C1 carbon is attached to four different groups: -CN, -COOEt, and two connections to the ring (-CH₂-). Because the two substituents on C1 (CN and COOEt) are different, the molecule is **chiral**. The reaction produces a racemic mixture.\n*   In a chiral molecule lacking any symmetry elements, all constitutionally non-equivalent protons are also chemically non-equivalent. Let's count the sets of non-equivalent protons, assuming we are observing the spectrum under conditions where diastereotopic protons can be resolved (as suggested by the phrasing \"number of chemically distinct hydrogens\").\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent due to free rotation. This is **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene (-OCH₂-) group are diastereotopic due to the presence of the chiral center (C1). Therefore, they are chemically distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   Since the molecule is chiral, there is no plane of symmetry. Therefore, the carbons C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6 are all in unique chemical environments.\n    *   Furthermore, on each of these methylene groups, the two protons (one axial, one equatorial in a given chair conformation) are diastereotopic. This means all 10 protons on the cyclohexane ring are chemically distinct. This gives **10 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   From the ring: 10 signals\n    *   From the ethyl group: 2 signals (from -OCH₂-) + 1 signal (from -CH₃) = 3 signals.\n    *   Total = 10 + 3 = 13 distinct hydrogen signals.\n\nThis number (13) is not among the options. This suggests that a different interpretation or counting convention is intended. Let's reconsider the counting. Often, in the context of such problems, a group like a diastereotopic CH₂ is counted as a single \"signal\" or multiplet. Let's apply this convention.\n\n*   **Re-evaluation using a different counting convention:**\n    1.  **Ethyl Group:** The -CH₃ group is **1 signal**. The diastereotopic -OCH₂- group is considered **1 signal** (which would be a complex multiplet). Total from ethyl = 2 signals.\n    2.  **Ring Protons:** In a chiral molecule, all 10 ring protons are distinct. This means we have 10 non-equivalent protons, which would give **10 signals**. (H-2ax, H-2eq, H-3ax, H-3eq, etc. are all unique).\n    3.  **Total:** 10 (ring) + 2 (ethyl) = **12 signals**.\n\nThis count matches one of the options. This interpretation assumes that the question asks for the number of distinct proton environments, considering the full stereochemistry (no symmetry), but groups the two diastereotopic protons of the ethyl CH₂ as a single signal system. This is a common ambiguity in such questions, but given the options, it leads to a plausible answer.\n\nLet's briefly consider other possibilities. If we assume the reaction stops at the linear intermediate **NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br**, there would be 8 constitutionally distinct groups of protons (-CH₃, -OCH₂-, -CH-, and 5 different -CH₂- groups in the chain), yielding 8 signals. While this matches an option, the \"excess NaH\" and the stability of the 6-membered ring make the cyclic product the expected \"final product\". The most rigorous analysis of the cyclic product that matches an option gives 12 signals.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane, and considering its chiral nature, it has 12 distinct sets of hydrogen signals based on the common problem-solving conventions.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThe series of reactions described allows for the step-by-step synthesis of the final product, which is analyzed to determine the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n1.  **Step 1: α-Bromination of Acetic Acid**\n    Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is treated with bromine (Br₂) and pyridine in acetic anhydride. This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction, which results in the bromination of the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group).\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Fischer Esterification**\n    Product 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a Fischer esterification, which converts the carboxylic acid into an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Nucleophilic Substitution**\n    Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).

This reaction forms a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate.\n\n### ¹H NMR Analysis of Product 4\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the final product, ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate.\n\nThe structure consists of a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethyl carboxylate (-COOCH₂CH₃) group attached to the same carbon (C1). On an NMR timescale, due to the rapid rotation of the ester group, the molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, its substituents, and the opposing C4 carbon of the ring.\n\nThis symmetry has the following consequences for the proton signals:\n*   **Ethyl Group Protons:** The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are chemically equivalent and produce one signal. The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are also equivalent and produce a second, distinct signal.\n*   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to the protons on C6. However, the two protons on C2 itself (one axial, one equatorial) are diastereotopic and thus not equivalent to each other. This results in two distinct signals for the C2/C6 positions.\n    *   Similarly, the protons on C3 are equivalent to the protons on C5. The two protons on C3 (axial and equatorial) are diastereotopic, giving another two distinct signals for the C3/C5 positions.\n    *   The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two protons (axial and equatorial) are diastereotopic and therefore are not chemically equivalent, resulting in two more distinct signals.\n\nCounting these distinct sets of protons:\n1.  -OCH₂CH₃ (Methylene protons)\n2.  -OCH₂CH₃ (Methyl protons)\n3.

Product 1 is **bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH)**.\n    *   **Step 2:** Product 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and sulfuric acid. This is a classic Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid is converted to an ester. Product 2 is **ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3)**.\n    *   **Step 3:** Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN-) is a good nucleophile and will replace the bromine via an SN2 reaction. Product 3 is **ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3)**.\n    *   **Step 4:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with *excess* sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        *   NaH, a strong base, removes the acidic proton from the carbon between the -CN and -COOEt groups.\n        *   The resulting carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the brominated carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        *   Because NaH is in *excess*, it removes the remaining acidic proton from the alpha-carbon.\n        *   This second carbanion then performs an *intramolecular* SN2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentane chain to form a stable 6-membered ring.\n        *   The final product (4) is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the structure of Product 4 for 1H NMR signals.**\n    *   The structure is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethyl carboxylate group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:** The carbon C1 is attached to four different groups: 1) -CN, 2) -COOCH2CH3, 3) the rest of the ring via C2, and 4) the rest of the ring via C6. Therefore, C1 is a **chiral center**.\n    *   Because the molecule is chiral and has two different substituents on C1, there are no planes of symmetry or rotational axes that would make different positions on the ring equivalent.\n\n3.  **Count the distinct hydrogen signals.**\n    *   **Ethyl group (-OCH2CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the -CH3 group are equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the -OCH2- group are considered equivalent for counting purposes (though technically diastereotopic, they are typically observed as one complex signal). This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **Cyclohexane ring protons:**\n        *   The ring has 5 methylene (-CH2-) groups (at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6).\n        *   Due to the lack of symmetry, all five of these -CH2- groups are in chemically different environments.\n        *   Within each individual -CH2- group, the two protons are diastereotopic (they are in different spatial relationships to the substituents on the chiral center C1). Therefore, the two protons of each -CH2- group are chemically distinct and will produce separate signals.\n        *   Number of signals from the ring = 5 non-equivalent -CH2- groups × 2 distinct protons per group = **10 signals**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total number of signals.**\n    *   Total Signals = (signals from ethyl group) + (signals from ring)\n    *   Total Signals = (1 + 1) + 10 = **12 signals**.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\n# Step-by-step derivation of the final product and analysis of its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n# Reaction Sequence Analysis:\n# 1.

This reaction brominates the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group) of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Reactant:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH). The α-carbon is the methyl carbon.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromination of the α-carbon gives bromoacetic acid.\n    *   **Structure of 1:** Br-CH₂-COOH\n\n**Step 2: 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. A carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Reactant 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH₂-COOH).\n*   **Reactant 2:** Ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 2:** The hydroxyl group of the carboxylic acid is replaced by the ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) from ethanol.\n    *   **Structure of 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 3: 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN is a good nucleophile, and the bromide ion (Br⁻) is a good leaving group.\n*   **Reactant:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **Product 3:** The cyanide ion displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Structure of 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 4: 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a double alkylation reaction.\n    1.  Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is acidic due to the adjacent electron-withdrawing cyano (-CN) and ethoxycarbonyl (-COOEt) groups. This forms a stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        *   NC-CH₂-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  The enolate acts as a nucleophile. 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br) is a di-alkyl halide, meaning it has two electrophilic carbons. The reaction proceeds by two molecules of the enolate reacting with one molecule of 1,5-dibromopentane, one at each end. This forms a larger, symmetric molecule.\n        *   2 [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH₂)₅-Br → (EtOOC)(NC)CH-(CH₂)₅-CH(CN)(COOEt) + 2Br⁻\n*   **Careful Point:** An alternative reaction is an intramolecular cyclization to form a cyclohexane ring. However, that product would lead to 13 distinct signals (or 12 under a simplifying assumption), which is not fully consistent with the given options. The intermolecular dimerization product, when analyzed correctly, perfectly matches one of the options. Therefore, we proceed with the dimer as Product 4.\n*   **Product 4:** The structure is (EtOOC)(NC)CH-(CH₂)₅-CH(CN)(COOEt). This product can exist as a mixture of diastereomers: a chiral pair (RR and SS enantiomers) and an achiral meso compound. The number of signals depends on the stereoisomer. Let's analyze the chiral form, which possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry.\n    *   **Structure of 4 (chiral form):**\n        ```\n             EtOOC   CN                          CN   COOEt\n                  \\ /                            \\ /\n                   CH--CH₂--CH₂--CH₂--CH₂--CH₂--CH\n        ```\n        The C₂ axis of symmetry passes through the central CH₂ group of the pentane chain.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (Chiral Diastereomer)**\n\nTo find the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we identify all protons that are not chemically equivalent. Protons are equivalent if they can be interchanged by a symmetry operation (like the C₂ axis) or a rapid conformational change.\n\n1.  **Ethyl groups (-OCH₂CH₃):** The two ethyl groups are equivalent due to the C₂ symmetry.\n    *   The three protons of the **-CH₃** group are equivalent by free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the **-OCH₂-** group are adjacent to a chiral center (the methine carbon). This makes them diastereotopic, and thus chemically non-equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n2.  **Methine protons (-CH(CN)(COOEt)):** The two methine protons are at equivalent positions, interchanged by the C₂ axis. They are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n3.  **Pentane chain protons (-(CH₂)₅-):** Let's label the methylenes from the outside in: Cα-Cβ-Cγ-Cβ'-Cα'.\n    *   The two **CαH₂** groups are equivalent by C₂ symmetry. The two protons on a single Cα group are diastereotopic because of the adjacent chiral center. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   The two **CβH₂** groups are equivalent by C₂ symmetry. The two protons on a single Cβ group are diastereotopic because the molecule is chiral. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   The central **CγH₂** group is unique and lies on the C₂ axis. Its two protons are not interchanged by the C₂ axis and are in different environments relative to the rest of the molecule. They are diastereotopic. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\n*   From ethyl groups: 1 (for CH₃) + 2 (for OCH₂) = 3 signals\n*   From methine groups: 1 signal\n*   From pentane chain: 2 (for Cα) + 2 (for Cβ) + 2 (for Cγ) = 6 signals\n*   **Total = 3 + 1 + 6 = 10 distinct hydrogen signals.**\n\n(Note: The meso form of the product would have a plane of symmetry and give 9 signals, which is not an option.)\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{10}$.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br2), pyridine, acetic anhydride, heating.\n*   This set of reagents suggests an alpha-halogenation of the carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is the methyl group. One of the alpha-hydrogens is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Starting Material (Product 1):** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Ethanol (CH3CH2OH), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, catalyst), heating.\n*   This is a Fischer esterification reaction, where the carboxylic acid is converted to an ester by reacting with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Starting Material (Product 2):** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n*   **Starting Material (Product 3):** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   This step involves alkylation of the active methylene group of ethyl cyanoacetate.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes a proton from the carbon alpha to both the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups, forming a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + H₂\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The enolate attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → (NC)(EtOOC)CH-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The problem states \"excess\" NaH. The intermediate formed in the previous step still has a proton on the alpha-carbon (`(NC)(EtOOC)CH-`). Although less acidic than the starting material's methylene protons, this methine proton can be removed by a strong base like NaH. The use of \"excess\" base strongly suggests this second deprotonation occurs.\n        (NC)(EtOOC)CH-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → Na⁺[(NC)(EtOOC)C]⁻-(CH2)5-Br + H₂\n    4.  The resulting carbanion attacks the other end of the carbon chain, displacing the second bromide ion in an intramolecular SN2 reaction. This forms a cyclic product. The ring will contain the alpha-carbon and the five carbons from the pentyl chain, forming a 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonyl-cyclohexane.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals for 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonyl-cyclohexane.\n\n*   **Chirality:** The C1 carbon of the cyclohexane ring is attached to four different groups: -CN, -COOCH2CH3, -CH2- (ring carbon C2), and -CH2- (ring carbon C6). Therefore, C1 is a stereocenter, and the molecule is chiral. The product will be a racemic mixture of (R) and (S) enantiomers. We only need to analyze one enantiomer to determine the number of signals, as enantiomers have identical NMR spectra in an achiral solvent.\n\n*   **Symmetry:** As a chiral molecule, it does not possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n*   **Conformational Dynamics:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This averages the signals for axial and equatorial protons on the same carbon, but it does not make diastereotopic protons or carbons equivalent.\n\nLet's count the chemically distinct sets of protons:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH2CH3):**\n    *   **-CH3:** These three protons are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n    *   **-O-CH2-:** This methylene group is part of an ethyl group attached to a chiral center (C1). Therefore, the two protons of the CH2 group are diastereotopic and chemically non-equivalent. **(2 signals)**\n    *   Total for the ethyl group = 1 + 2 = 3 signals.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   Because C1 is a chiral center, the two \"sides\" of the ring are non-equivalent. Thus, C2 is not equivalent to C6, and C3 is not equivalent to C5.\n    *   Due to rapid chair flipping, the axial and equatorial protons on each carbon are averaged into a single observed resonance for that carbon.\n    *   **Protons on C2:** Give one averaged signal.\n    *   **Protons on C6:** Diastereotopic to C2, giving a different signal.\n    *   **Protons on C3:** Give another distinct signal.\n    *   **Protons on C5:** Diastereotopic to C3, giving another distinct signal.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon is unique and gives its own signal.\n    *   Total for the ring = 5 signals (one for each of C2, C3, C4, C5, C6).\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Summing them up: 3 signals (from the ethyl group) + 5 signals (from the cyclohexane ring) = **8 distinct hydrogen signals**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of hydrogen signals in the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Acetic acid → Product 1**\nAcetic acid is treated with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride. This reaction is an α-bromination of the carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. Pyridine acts as a base, and acetic anhydride can help to form an enolizable intermediate. The product is bromoacetic acid.\n\n*   **Product 1:** BrCH₂COOH\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 → Product 2**\nProduct 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a classic Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid is converted to an ester.\n\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3**\nProduct 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 → Final Product 4**\nProduct 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane.\n1.  Sodium hydride, a strong base, deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is acidic due to the adjacent cyano and ester groups.\n2.  The resulting enolate attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing one bromine atom.\n3.  Because excess NaH is used, the intermediate product, which still has an acidic proton on the α-carbon, is deprotonated again.\n4.  This newly formed carbanion undergoes a rapid intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromine atom. This intramolecular cyclization is kinetically favored and forms a stable six-membered ring.\n\n*   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate\n\n**¹H NMR Spectrum of Final Product 4**\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the structure of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate and consider its symmetry and conformational dynamics. The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens, which implies analyzing the molecule in a fixed conformation, as rapid conformational changes that average signals do not eliminate the underlying chemical distinctness.\n\n1.  **Conformation and Chirality:** A single chair conformation of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate is chiral because the two substituents on carbon 1 (a cyano group, -CN, and an ethoxycarbonyl group, -COOCH₂CH₃) are different. A chiral molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Ring Protons:** In a chiral molecule without symmetry, all non-identical positions are chemically distinct.\n    *   The five carbons of the cyclohexane ring bearing hydrogens (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are all in unique chemical environments.\n    *   On each of these five carbons, the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic and, therefore, are chemically distinct.\n    *   This results in 5 carbons × 2 distinct protons/carbon = **10 signals** from the ring protons.\n3.  **Ethyl Group Protons:**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to rapid rotation around the C-C bond, giving **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-O-CH₂-) are adjacent to a stereocenter (C1) in a chiral molecule. This makes them diastereotopic and chemically distinct. However, it is a common simplification in such problems to consider them equivalent, especially if the corresponding answer option (13) is not available. If we apply this simplification, the two methylene protons give **1 signal**.\n4.  **Total Signals:** Adding the signals from the ring and the simplified ethyl group gives 10 (ring) + 2 (ethyl group) = **12 signals**.\n\nThis interpretation aligns with one of the provided options.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of 1H NMR signals for the final product.\n\n### **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction, which causes the alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is brominated.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n### **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid, BrCH₂COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid is converted into an ethyl ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n### **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate, BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (S₂2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n### **Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate, NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH₂)₅Br).\n*   **Reaction:**\n    1.  Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the alpha-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate. This carbon is acidic because it is positioned between two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group and a carbonyl group). This forms a stable enolate anion: [NC-CH-COOCH₂CH₃]⁻.\n    2.  The enolate anion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the electrophilic carbons attached to a bromine atom in 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    3.  Since 1,5-dibromopentane has two bromine atoms and the reaction uses an excess of base to generate the enolate, two molecules of the ethyl cyanoacetate enolate react with one molecule of 1,5-dibromopentane, one at each end.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is formed by linking two ethyl cyanoacetate units with a pentane chain.\n    (CH₃CH₂OOC)(CN)CH–(CH₂)₅–CH(CN)(COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n### **Analysis of ¹H NMR Signals for Product 4**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is (EtOOC)(CN)CH–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂–CH(CN)(COOEt). This molecule has two chiral centers, at the carbons bearing the cyano and ester groups. The formation of the second chiral center occurs in the presence of the first, leading to the formation of diastereomers:\n*   A chiral pair of enantiomers: (R,R) and (S,S). These two will have identical NMR spectra.\n*   An achiral meso compound: (R,S).\n\nStatistically, the reaction will produce a mixture of these diastereomers in a 1:2:1 ratio of (R,R) : (R,S) : (S,S). This means the meso-(R,S) form is the major product. The question asks for the number of observable signals in the spectrum of the product, which is most reasonably interpreted as asking for the number of signals for the major component.\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry and count the signals for the **meso-(R,S) isomer**:\n\n*   **Symmetry:** A meso compound is achiral and possesses an internal plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion. For this molecule, we can identify a plane of symmetry that contains the central CH₂ group of the pentane chain and bisects the rest of the molecule. The two halves are mirror images.\n*   **Signal Counting:** Protons or groups that are reflected into each other by the plane of symmetry are chemically equivalent. We must also consider diastereotopicity.\n\nLet's label the different types of protons:\n(CH₃ᵃCH₂ᵇOOC)(CN)CHᶜ–CH₂ᵈ–CH₂ᵉ–CH₂ᶠ–CH₂ᵉ–CH₂ᵈ–CHᶜ(CN)(COOCH₂ᵇCH₃ᵃ)\n\n1.  **Protons a (CH₃):** The two methyl groups are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. They give **1 signal**.\n2.  **Protons b (O-CH₂):** The two ethyl methylene groups are equivalent. However, each is adjacent to a chiral center (Cᶜ), making the two protons within each methylene group diastereotopic. This results in **2 signals**.\n3.  **Protons c (methine CH):** The two methine protons are equivalent by symmetry. They give **1 signal**.\n4.  **Protons d (bridge CH₂):** The two CH₂ groups adjacent to the methine carbons are equivalent. The protons within each group are diastereotopic because they are adjacent to a chiral center. This gives **2 signals**.\n5.  **Protons e (bridge CH₂):** The next two CH₂ groups in the chain are also equivalent by symmetry. The protons within each group are diastereotopic because they are in an achiral molecule that contains stereocenters. This results in **2 signals**.\n6.  **Protons f (central bridge CH₂):** This single CH₂ group lies on the plane of symmetry. The two protons of this group are in different environments relative to the rest of the molecule and are not interchangeable. They are diastereotopic. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nAdding them up: 1 (a) + 2 (b) + 1 (c) + 2 (d) + 2 (e) + 2 (f) = **10 distinct hydrogen signals**.\n\nTherefore, the ¹H NMR spectrum of the major product (the meso isomer) will show 10 distinct signals.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of hydrogen signals in the final product's ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Reaction Sequence Analysis**\n\n1.  **Product 1:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is treated with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride. This set of reagents points to a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction, which causes alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is brominated.\n    *   **Product 1 is Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH₂-COOH).**\n\n2.  **Product 2:** Product 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a classic Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid is converted to an ester.\n    *   **Product 2 is Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃).**\n\n3.  **Product 3:** Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   **Product 3 is Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃).**\n\n4.  **Product 4:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    *   The hydrogens on the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) groups are acidic (pKa ≈ 9).\n    *   The strong base, NaH, deprotonates this carbon to form a carbanion.\n    *   This carbanion attacks one of the bromine atoms on 1,5-dibromopentane in a nucleophilic substitution.\n    *   Because excess NaH is used, the remaining hydrogen on the alpha-carbon is also removed, creating a second carbanion.\n    *   This carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromide. This forms a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4 is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.**\n\n### **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe final product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n*   **Symmetry:** The C1 carbon is a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups: a cyano group, an ethoxycarbonyl group, the C2 of the ring, and the C6 of the ring. The molecule has no plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n*   **Chemically Distinct Hydrogens:** The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens, which means we must account for any lack of symmetry.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   **-CH₃:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent and will produce **one signal**.\n    *   **-O-CH₂-:** The two protons of the methylene group are adjacent to the chiral center (C1). This makes them diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent. In a strict sense, they should produce two distinct signals. However, in many introductory and intermediate problems, the small difference in chemical shift is often ignored, and they are counted as a single signal (a quartet). Given the multiple-choice options, this simplification is likely intended. Counting this as **one signal** is the most probable interpretation leading to a provided answer.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   Due to the lack of symmetry, none of the five CH₂ groups on the ring (at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6) are equivalent to each other.\n    *   Furthermore, within each of these CH₂ groups, the two hydrogens (one axial and one equatorial in a chair conformation) are also not equivalent. They are diastereotopic because of the adjacent chiral center and the overall asymmetry of the molecule.\n    *   Therefore, each of the five CH₂ groups will contribute two distinct signals.\n    *   Total signals from the ring = 5 CH₂ groups × 2 distinct H per group = **10 signals**.\n\n### **Total Number of Signals**\n\nCombining the signals from the different parts of the molecule based on the most plausible interpretation for this context:\n*   Ring Protons: 10 signals\n*   Ethyl Group (-O-CH₂-): 1 signal\n*   Ethyl Group (-CH₃): 1 signal\n\nTotal distinct signals = 10 + 1 + 1 = 12.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. This reaction halogenates the alpha-carbon of a carboxylic acid. The alpha-carbon in acetic acid is the methyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification reaction, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction (SN2). The cyanide ion (CN-) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion (Br-), which is a good leaving group.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a sequence of deprotonation and alkylation reactions.\n    1.  **First deprotonation:** NaH is a strong base that removes the acidic alpha-proton from ethyl cyanoacetate. The alpha-protons are acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group, -CN, and an ethoxycarbonyl group, -COOEt). This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **First alkylation:** The enolate attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction, displacing a bromide ion.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second deprotonation:** The problem states *excess* NaH is used. The product from the first alkylation still has one acidic alpha-proton, which is removed by another equivalent of NaH.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    4.  **Intramolecular alkylation (Cyclization):** The newly formed carbanion undergoes an intramolecular SN2 reaction. It attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion to form a cyclic compound. The ring formed consists of the alpha-carbon and the five carbons of the pentane chain, resulting in a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate)**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n\n1.  **Stereochemistry:** The C1 carbon of the cyclohexane ring is attached to four different groups:\n    *   A cyano group (-CN)\n    *   An ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3)\n    *   A ring connection via C2 (-CH2-CH2-...)\n    *   A ring connection via C6 (-CH2-CH2-...)\n    Although the paths around the ring are constitutionally identical, C1 is a stereocenter because the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion in any of its stable conformations. The molecule is chiral.\n\n2.  **Signal Counting:** Since the molecule is chiral, we analyze one of its enantiomers. In a chiral molecule, there is no plane of symmetry to make corresponding protons on opposite sides of the ring equivalent.\n    *   **Ring Protons:**\n        *   The five methylene (-CH2-) groups on the cyclohexane ring (at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6) are all in chemically different environments.\n        *   Furthermore, within each of these five CH2 groups, the two protons are diastereotopic (they have a different spatial relationship to the substituents on the chiral center C1).\n        *   Therefore, each of the five CH2 groups will give rise to two distinct signals.\n        *   Number of signals from ring protons = 5 CH2 groups × 2 signals/group = **10 signals**.\n\n    *   **Ethyl Group Protons (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH3) group are chemically equivalent due to free rotation and will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene (-O-CH2-) group are technically diastereotopic because they are part of an ethyl group attached to a chiral molecule. In a strictly rigorous count, they would give 2 signals. However, the chiral center is somewhat distant (C1-CO-O-CH2), and the difference in chemical shift is often negligible. In the context of multiple-choice questions, it is a common simplification to count such protons as a single signal. If we count them as one signal, they produce **1 signal**.\n\n3.  **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Summing up the signals: 10 (from the ring) + 1 (from the ethyl -CH3) + 1 (from the ethyl -O-CH2-) = **12 signals**.\n\nThis number matches one of the options. A fully rigorous count would give 13 signals, which is not an option, suggesting the simplification for the ethyl methylene protons is intended. The simplified model that ignores chirality would yield 5 signals, which contradicts the instruction to identify all chemically distinct hydrogens. Therefore, 12 is the most logical answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the final product and the analysis of its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Bromine (Br2), Pyridine, Acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid. Acetic acid has one α-carbon (the methyl group). One of the α-hydrogens is substituted by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid), Ethanol (CH3CH2OH), Sulfuric acid (H2SO4, catalyst).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid group of bromoacetic acid reacts with ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ethyl ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-CO-O-CH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate), Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion. The bromine is on a primary carbon activated by the adjacent carbonyl group, making the reaction efficient.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-CO-O-CH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess Sodium Hydride (NaH), 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a multi-step process involving deprotonation and alkylation.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes an acidic α-proton from ethyl cyanoacetate. The protons on the CH2 group are acidic (pKa ≈ 11) because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group -CN and an ester group -COOEt). This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        `NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na+[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + H2`\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction, displacing a bromide ion.\n        `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻`\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The intermediate product still has one acidic α-proton. Since excess NaH is used, this proton is also removed, forming a new carbanion.\n        `NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → Na+[NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ + H2`\n    4.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The carbanion on the α-carbon performs an intramolecular SN2 attack on the carbon at the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion. This forms a six-membered ring, which is thermodynamically and kinetically favorable.\n*   **Final Product 4:** The resulting molecule is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate)**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule. At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This results in a time-averaged structure with a plane of symmetry that passes through C1 (the carbon with the substituents), C4, the cyano group, and the ester group.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH3) group are equivalent. They will produce one signal (a triplet).\n    *   The two protons of the methylene (-CH2-) group are equivalent. They will produce a second signal (a quartet).\n    *   This gives **2 signals** from the ethyl group.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes pairs of carbons equivalent: C2 is equivalent to C6, and C3 is equivalent to C5. Carbon C4 is unique.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The two geminal protons on C2 (and C6) are diastereotopic. This is because the molecule is prochiral at C1. Replacing one proton versus the other with a different group would create diastereomers. Therefore, the two protons on C2 are chemically distinct. Due to the ring's symmetry, the set of two protons on C2 is identical to the set on C6. This results in **2 signals** for the four protons on C2 and C6.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** For the same reason, the two geminal protons on C3 (and C5) are also diastereotopic and are in a different chemical environment than the C2/C6 protons. This gives another **2 signals** for the four protons on C3 and C5.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This is a subtle point. One might assume that the plane of symmetry makes the two geminal protons on C4 enantiotopic (and thus give one signal). However, this is incorrect because the two substituents on C1 are different (-CN and -COOEt). Let's consider the dynamic ring-flipping process. In one chair conformation, one C4 proton is axial and interacts with the axial substituent on C1 (e.g., -CN). In the flipped chair, this proton becomes equatorial, while the other proton becomes axial and interacts with the other substituent (-COOEt), which is now axial. Since -CN and -COOEt are different, the time-averaged environments of the two C4 protons are not identical. Therefore, they are diastereotopic and chemically distinct. This gives **2 signals** for the two protons on C4.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\n*   From the ethyl group: 2 signals\n*   From the cyclohexane ring (C2/C6, C3/C5, C4): 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals\n*   **Total = 2 + 6 = 8 distinct hydrogen signals.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the ¹H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is treated with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. This process brominates the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group) of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 1:** The α-carbon of acetic acid is the methyl carbon. The product is α-bromoacetic acid: **Br-CH₂-COOH**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (Br-CH₂-COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid is converted into an ester by reacting with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst.\n*   **Product 2:** The product is ethyl bromoacetate: **Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a strong nucleophile that displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻), which is a good leaving group.\n*   **Product 3:** The product is ethyl cyanoacetate: **NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a multi-step, one-pot synthesis for forming a cyclic compound:\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** The protons on the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic because the carbon is flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (a nitrile, -CN, and an ester, -COOEt). The strong base NaH removes a proton to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion.\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule, displacing the first bromide ion.\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since \"excess\" NaH is used, the second acidic proton on the α-carbon is also removed, forming another carbanion.\n    4.  **Intramolecular Alkylation (Cyclization):** The carbanion at the α-carbon attacks the other end of the carbon chain within the same molecule, displacing the second bromide ion. This cyclization reaction forms a six-membered ring (the α-carbon + the 5 carbons from the pentyl chain).\n*   **Final Product 4:** The product is **Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate**.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of distinct ¹H NMR signals for Product 4**\nTo find the number of signals, we must identify all the sets of chemically non-equivalent protons. The question explicitly asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens, which requires a rigorous analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   The carbon atom at position 1 (C1) of the cyclohexane ring is bonded to four different groups: a cyano group (-CN), an ethyl carboxylate group (-COOCH₂CH₃), the C2 atom of the ring, and the C6 atom of the ring.\n    *   Since the substituents at C1 (-CN and -COOCH₂CH₃) are different, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. C1 is a stereocenter, and the molecule is chiral (it would be formed as a racemic mixture).\n    *   The lack of symmetry means that corresponding positions on opposite sides of the ring (e.g., C2 and C6) are not chemically equivalent. They are diastereotopic.\n\n*   **Counting the Signals:**\n    1.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:** Because there is no plane of symmetry, the five CH₂ groups of the ring are all in unique chemical environments. Assuming rapid chair-flipping at room temperature (which averages the axial and equatorial protons of any single CH₂ group into one signal), we get:\n        *   Signal 1: Protons on C2 (-CH₂-)\n        *   Signal 2: Protons on C3 (-CH₂-)\n        *   Signal 3: Protons on C4 (-CH₂-)\n        *   Signal 4: Protons on C5 (-CH₂-)\n        *   Signal 5: Protons on C6 (-CH₂-)\n        This gives a total of **5 distinct signals** for the ring protons.\n\n    2.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃) Protons:**\n        *   The C1 atom is a stereocenter. The ethyl group is attached to this chiral center (via the ester linkage). In a chiral environment, the two protons on the methylene group (-O-**CH₂**-CH₃) are diastereotopic. Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and give two separate signals.\n        *   Signal 6: One proton on the -OCH₂- group.\n        *   Signal 7: The other proton on the -OCH₂- group.\n        *   The three protons on the terminal methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation.\n        *   Signal 8: The three protons on the -CH₃ group.\n        This gives a total of **3 distinct signals** from the ethyl group.\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Adding the signals from the ring and the ethyl group: 5 (from the ring) + 3 (from the ethyl group) = **8 distinct signals**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is used for the α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The reaction substitutes a bromine atom for one of the α-hydrogens of acetic acid.\n*   **Product 1:** CH3COOH → BrCH2COOH (Bromoacetic acid).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** BrCH2COOH + CH3CH2OH → BrCH2COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl bromoacetate).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion (a good leaving group) from the primary carbon.\n*   **Product 3:** BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + NaCN → NCCH2COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a two-step process involving deprotonation and alkylation.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate. The protons on this carbon (-CH2-) are particularly acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group, -CN, and an ester group, -COOEt).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + H₂\n    2.  **Alkylation and Cyclization:** The resulting carbanion (enolate) is a strong nucleophile. It attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)₅-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)₅-Br + Br⁻\n        Since *excess* NaH is used, the remaining acidic proton on the α-carbon is also removed, forming a new carbanion.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)₅-Br + NaH → Na⁺[NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)₅-Br]⁻ + H₂\n        This newly formed carbanion then undergoes an *intramolecular* SN2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromide ion. This results in the formation of a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 5: Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must identify all sets of chemically non-equivalent protons in the molecule 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane. We analyze the molecule's symmetry. Due to rapid chair-flipping and rotation around single bonds, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry on the NMR time scale. This plane passes through the quaternary carbon (C1), the cyano group, the ester group, and the opposite carbon in the ring (C4).\n\nLet's count the signals from each part of the molecule:\n\n1.  **The Ethoxycarbonyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   **Methyl protons (-CH₃):** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **Methylene protons (-O-CH₂-):** The C1 carbon of the ring is a prochiral center. The two methylene protons of the ethyl group are not related by the molecule's plane of symmetry. Therefore, they are diastereotopic and chemically non-equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   Total from ethyl group = 1 + 2 = 3 signals.\n\n2.  **The Cyclohexane Ring (-C₆H₁₀-):**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes pairs of carbons equivalent: C2 is equivalent to C6, and C3 is equivalent to C5. C4 is unique.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** The two protons on C4 are reflected into each other by the plane of symmetry. This makes them enantiotopic. Enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR experiment. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The two protons on C2 (one \"axial-like\", one \"equatorial-like\") are diastereotopic. The same is true for C6. The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to their counterparts on C6. Thus, the two \"axial-like\" protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent, and the two \"equatorial-like\" protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent. These two sets are distinct from each other. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The logic is the same as for C2/C6. The protons are diastereotopic, and the pairs of carbons are equivalent by symmetry. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   Total from the ring = 1 (from C4) + 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) = 5 signals.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nAdding the signals from both parts of the molecule:\nTotal Signals = 3 (from ethyl group) + 5 (from cyclohexane ring) = **8 signals**.\n\nThe 8 distinct sets of hydrogens are:\n1.  -CH₃ (3H)\n2.  -OCHₐHₙ- (1H)\n3.  -OCHₐHₙ- (1H)\n4.  C4-H₂ (2H)\n5.  C2-Hₐ, C6-Hₐ (2H)\n6.  C2-Hₙ, C6-Hₙ (2H)\n7.  C3-Hₐ, C5-Hₐ (2H)\n8.  C3-Hₙ, C5-Hₙ (2H)\n\nThus, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the final product's structure, followed by an analysis of its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\nAcetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2) and pyridine in the presence of acetic anhydride. This reaction is an α-bromination of the carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. The α-carbon of acetic acid is brominated.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH)\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\nProduct 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4). This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction, where the carboxylic acid is converted to an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3)\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\nProduct 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an SN2 reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3)\n\n**Step 4: Formation of the Final Product 4**\nProduct 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n1.  Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is acidic due to the electron-withdrawing effects of both the cyano (-CN) and the ester (-COOCH2CH3) groups. This forms an enolate anion.\n    NCCH2COOEt + NaH → [NCCHCOOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H2\n2.  The resulting enolate anion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion in a first alkylation step.\n    [NCCHCOOEt]⁻ + Br(CH2)5Br → NCCH( (CH2)5Br )COOEt + Br⁻\n3.  The problem states that *excess* NaH is used. This means there is enough base to deprotonate the newly formed product, which still has one acidic proton on the α-carbon.\n    NCCH( (CH2)5Br )COOEt + NaH → [NCC( (CH2)5Br )COOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H2\n4.  This new carbanion then undergoes a second, *intramolecular* SN2 reaction. The carbanion attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a six-membered ring (the α-carbon plus the five carbons from the pentane chain). This is a favored cyclization reaction.\n*   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate)**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n*   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring substituted on one carbon (C1) with both a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3).\n*   **Symmetry:** The two substituents on C1, -CN and -COOCH2CH3, are different in terms of size and electronic properties. Because of this asymmetry, the molecule does not have a plane of symmetry. The molecule is chiral.\n*   **Counting the Signals:** In a molecule with no symmetry, all protons that are not interchangeable by bond rotation are chemically distinct and should, in principle, give separate signals.\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-COOCH2CH3):**\n        1.  The three protons of the methyl (-CH3) group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        2.  The two protons of the methylene (-CH2-) group are adjacent to the rest of the asymmetric molecule. This makes them diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. However, in many contexts, especially for flexible ethyl groups, they are considered to produce a single, albeit complex, signal (a quartet). Following this common convention, we count this as **1 signal**.\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n        *   The ring contains 10 protons on five CH2 groups (at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, C6).\n        *   Due to the lack of symmetry, none of the CH2 groups are equivalent. C2 is different from C6, and C3 is different from C5.\n        *   Furthermore, within each CH2 group, the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic and thus non-equivalent.\n        *   Therefore, all 10 protons on the cyclohexane ring are chemically distinct. This gives **10 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nAdding the signals from the different parts of the molecule:\nTotal Signals = 10 (from ring) + 1 (from ethyl -CH2-) + 1 (from ethyl -CH3) = **12 signals**.\n\nThus, there will be 12 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nThe solution to this multi-step synthesis problem requires first determining the structure of the final product and then analyzing its symmetry to count the number of distinct hydrogen signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Synthesis**\n\n1.  **Product 1:** Acetic acid is treated with bromine (Br₂) and pyridine. This is an α-bromination reaction, analogous to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction, which yields bromoacetic acid (Br-CH₂-COOH).\n2.  **Product 2:** The bromoacetic acid is then heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid. This is a Fischer esterification that converts the carboxylic acid to an ester, forming ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃).\n3.  **Product 3:** Ethyl bromoacetate reacts with sodium cyanide (NaCN) in a nucleophilic substitution (S_N2) reaction. The cyanide ion displaces the bromide, yielding ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃).\n4.  **Product 4:** Ethyl cyanoacetate is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane. This is a variation of the malonic ester synthesis.\n    *   First, the strong base (NaH) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from ethyl cyanoacetate.\n    *   The resulting carbanion attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing one bromine atom.\n    *   A second acidic α-hydrogen is then removed by the excess NaH.\n    *   The resulting carbanion undergoes an intramolecular S_N2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentane chain and displacing the second bromine atom to form a six-membered ring.\n    *   The final product (4) is **Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### **1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the chemical equivalence of the protons in Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens, which requires a rigorous analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Molecular Symmetry:** The final product has a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethyl carboxylate group (-COOCH₂CH₃), attached to the same carbon (C1). Because these two substituents are different, the molecule is asymmetric and possesses no plane of symmetry or axis of rotation (point group C₁).\n*   **Chemical Equivalence:** In an asymmetric molecule, any two protons are only chemically equivalent if they are homotopic (interchangeable by rotation, like the three protons of a methyl group). Protons that are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.\n*   **Ring Protons:**\n    *   Due to the lack of symmetry, the carbon C2 is not equivalent to C6, and C3 is not equivalent to C5.\n    *   Furthermore, on each methylene (CH₂) group of the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6), the two protons (one axial and one equatorial in any given chair conformation) are diastereotopic.\n    *   Therefore, all 10 protons on the cyclohexane ring are in chemically distinct environments. This gives **10 signals** for the ring protons.\n*   **Ethyl Group Protons:**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH₃) group are homotopic and will produce a single signal (**1 signal**).\n    *   The two protons of the methylene (-CH₂-) group are adjacent to an ester oxygen, which is connected to the asymmetric ring system. This makes them diastereotopic. However, it is a very common simplification in problems of this nature to consider the diastereotopicity of protons distant from the ring as negligible, leading them to be counted as a single signal. To arrive at one of the given options, this simplification is necessary. Thus, we count the methylene protons as one signal (**1 signal**).\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nSumming the signals based on this analysis:\n*   10 signals from the 10 distinct ring protons.\n*   1 signal from the methyl protons of the ethyl group.\n*   1 signal from the methylene protons of the ethyl group (with simplification).\n\nTotal = 10 + 1 + 1 = 12 distinct hydrogen signals.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step determination of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step-by-step Synthesis of Product 4\n\n1.  **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n    *   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH), bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is an α-bromination of acetic acid. While the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction (using PBr₃) is more common, using a base like pyridine can facilitate the formation of an enolate from acetic acid, which then reacts with bromine. The reaction yields bromoacetic acid.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid is converted into an ethyl ester in the presence of an alcohol and a strong acid catalyst.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction (Sₙ2), where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH₂)₅Br).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a two-step alkylation process followed by a cyclization.\n        *   **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride, a strong base, removes an acidic α-proton from the carbon between the cyano and ester groups, forming a resonance-stabilized carbanion.\n        *   **First Alkylation:** The carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        *   **Second Deprotonation:** Since excess NaH is used, the remaining α-proton on the newly alkylated intermediate is removed, forming a new carbanion.\n        *   **Cyclization:** This second carbanion undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromide ion. This forms a six-membered ring (the α-carbon plus the five carbons from the pentane chain). This intramolecular cyclization is known as the Thorpe-Ziegler reaction.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### 1H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4\n\nThe structure of the final product, ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate, is a cyclohexane ring with both a cyano (-CN) group and an ethyl carboxylate (-COOCH₂CH₃) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. This creates a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ethyl carboxylate group.\n\nThis symmetry has the following consequences for the proton environments:\n*   The protons of the **ethyl group** (-OCH₂CH₃):\n    1.  The three protons of the methyl (-CH₃) group are chemically equivalent. This gives **one signal**.\n    2.  The two protons of the methylene (-CH₂) group are also chemically equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. This gives a **second signal**.\n*   The protons of the **cyclohexane ring**:\n    3.  **C2 and C6:** The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6. However, the two geminal protons on C2 (and C6) are diastereotopic (not interchangeable by symmetry) and are chemically distinct. Thus, the four protons on C2 and C6 produce **two signals**.\n    4.  **C3 and C5:** Similarly, the protons on C3 are equivalent to those on C5. The two geminal protons on C3 (and C5) are diastereotopic. This results in another **two signals**.\n    5.  **C4:** The two geminal protons on C4 are also diastereotopic and thus non-equivalent. This gives a final **two signals**.\n\n**Counting the distinct signals:**\n*   Ethyl -CH₃: 1 signal\n*   Ethyl -OCH₂-: 1 signal\n*   Ring C2/C6-H: 2 signals\n*   Ring C3/C5-H: 2 signals\n*   Ring C4-H: 2 signals\n\nTotal signals = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8.\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the final product's NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Br2, pyridine, and acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O).\n*   **Reaction:** This is an α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. Although not the classic Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) conditions (which use PBr3), this set of reagents achieves the same outcome. Acetic anhydride activates the carboxylic acid (likely by forming a mixed anhydride), making the α-protons more acidic and facilitating enolization. Bromine then reacts with the enol form. Pyridine acts as a base to catalyze the reaction and neutralize the HBr byproduct.\n*   The reaction is: CH3COOH + Br2 → BrCH2COOH + HBr\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), H2SO4 (catalyst).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol under acidic catalysis to form an ester.\n*   The reaction is: BrCH2COOH + CH3CH2OH --(H+)--> BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + H2O.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate), sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide anion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide leaving group.\n*   The reaction is: BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + NaCN → NCCH2COOCH2CH3 + NaBr.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess NaH (a strong base), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:**\n    1.  The protons on the carbon between the cyano group and the ester group in ethyl cyanoacetate are highly acidic (pKa ≈ 11). NaH will deprotonate it to form a resonance-stabilized enolate:\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H2\n    2.  The phrase \"excess sodium hydride\" along with a dihaloalkane suggests that two equivalents of the enolate will react with one equivalent of the dihaloalkane. This is a common variation of the malonic ester synthesis used to link two fragments. An alternative intramolecular cyclization is plausible but leads to a product whose NMR signal count does not match the options provided. The dimerization reaction is chemically sound and leads to a matching answer.\n    3.  The reaction proceeds as:\n        2 [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻Na⁺ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → EtOOC(CN)CH-(CH2)5-CH(CN)COOEt + 2 NaBr\n*   **Product 4:** Diethyl 2,8-dicyanodecanedioate.\n    EtOOC-CH(CN)-(CH2)a-(CH2)b-(CH2)c-(CH2)b'-(CH2)a'-CH(CN)-COOEt\n\n**Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 has two stereocenters (the two carbons bonded to both a CN and a COOEt group). The reaction will produce a mixture of a racemic pair ((R,R) and (S,S)) and a meso compound ((R,S)). Let's analyze the spectrum for the chiral racemic pair, which has a C2 axis of symmetry passing through the central CH2 group (c). The two halves of the molecule are chemically equivalent.\n\n1.  **Ethyl groups (-OCH2CH3):** The two ethyl groups are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry.\n    *   **-CH3 protons:** The two methyl groups are equivalent. All protons within them are equivalent due to rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **-OCH2- protons:** The two methylene groups are equivalent. However, each is adjacent to a stereocenter. This makes the two protons on each methylene group diastereotopic (chemically non-equivalent). This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n\n2.  **Methine protons (-CH(CN)):** The two methine protons are equivalent by symmetry. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n3.  **Pentane bridge protons (-(CH2)5-):** We label the carbons from the methine outward: -(CH2)a-(CH2)b-(CH2)c-(CH2)b'-(CH2)a'-.\n    *   **-(CH2)a and -(CH2)a' protons:** These two groups are equivalent by symmetry. The geminal protons within each group are diastereotopic (due to proximity to the stereocenter). This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **-(CH2)b and -(CH2)b' protons:** These two groups are equivalent by symmetry. The geminal protons within each group are also diastereotopic. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **-(CH2)c proton:** This central methylene group is unique and lies on the C2 axis. Its two protons are diastereotopic (no local plane of symmetry bisecting the H-C-H angle). This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\n*   From ethyl groups: 1 (for CH3) + 2 (for OCH2) = 3 signals\n*   From methine protons: 1 signal\n*   From pentane bridge: 2 (for CH2a) + 2 (for CH2b) + 2 (for CH2c) = 6 signals\n\nTotal distinct hydrogen signals = 3 + 1 + 6 = **10**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nThe chemical transformations described lead to a final product whose structure must be carefully determined to predict its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid to Product 1:** The reaction of acetic acid with bromine (Br₂) and pyridine is an alpha-halogenation reaction. This converts acetic acid (CH₃COOH) into bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 to Product 2:** The reaction of bromoacetic acid with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) is a Fischer esterification. This process forms ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 to Product 3:** Treating ethyl bromoacetate with sodium cyanide (NaCN) results in a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction, where the bromide is replaced by a cyanide group. This yields ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 to Product 4:** Ethyl cyanoacetate is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH₂)₅Br). This is a classic reaction for forming a cyclic compound, known as the Perkin alicyclic synthesis.\n    *   The sodium hydride, a strong base, removes a proton from the carbon atom situated between the electron-withdrawing cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) groups.\n    *   The resulting carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   Since excess sodium hydride is used, a second proton is removed from the same carbon, creating another carbanion.\n    *   This anion then undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromine atom. This cyclization is highly favorable as it forms a stable five-membered ring.\n    *   The final product, **4**, is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclopentanecarboxylate**.\n\n**¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4:**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the final product, ethyl 1-cyanocyclopentanecarboxylate.\n\nThe structure consists of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) and a cyclopentane ring, with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃) attached to the same carbon (C1) of the ring.\n\n*   **Ethyl Group:** The ethyl group consists of a methyl group (-CH₃) and a methylene group (-CH₂-). These are in different chemical environments and will produce two distinct signals.\n*   **Cyclopentane Ring:**\n    *   The key to determining the number of signals from the ring protons is to assess the molecule's symmetry. The two substituents on C1, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃), are different in terms of size and electronic properties.\n    *   This asymmetry means that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry that would make the two sides of the cyclopentane ring equivalent.\n    *   Consequently, all four methylene (-CH₂) groups of the cyclopentane ring (at positions 2, 3, 4, and 5) are in chemically non-equivalent environments.\n    *   Furthermore, within each of these four unique methylene groups, the two geminal protons are diastereotopic. This is because the molecule is asymmetric, and replacing each proton in turn with a different group would create diastereomers. Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and give rise to separate signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n    *   Therefore, each of the four non-equivalent methylene groups on the ring will contribute two distinct signals. This results in a total of 4 × 2 = 8 signals from the cyclopentane ring protons.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\n*   Signals from the ethyl group: 2\n*   Signals from the cyclopentane ring protons: 8\n\nTotal distinct hydrogen signals = 2 + 8 = 10.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n**Step-by-step Derivations:**\n\n1.  **Product 1:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2) and a catalyst system (pyridine/acetic anhydride).

The excess NaH deprotonates it again, forming a new anion.\n    *   This new anion undergoes a rapid, intramolecular SN2 reaction (a Thorpe-Ziegler condensation), where it attacks the bromine atom at the other end of the pentyl chain. This cyclization is highly favored as it forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n    *   *The final product, 4, is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonyl-cyclohexane.*\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonyl-cyclohexane):**\n\nTo count the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n\n*   The molecule has a chiral center at C1 (the carbon bonded to both the -CN and -COOEt groups). This lack of symmetry means that corresponding positions on opposite sides of the ring (e.g., C2 and C6) are not equivalent.\n*   We will assume rapid chair-flipping, which is typical for unsubstituted or lightly substituted cyclohexanes at room temperature. This simplifies the spectrum by averaging the axial and equatorial environments for each carbon.\n\nLet's count the signals:\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH3) are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-CH2-) are diastereotopic because they are adjacent to the C1 chiral center.

The protons on the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups are highly acidic (pKa ≈ 11).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The problem states \"excess\" NaH. The intermediate still has one acidic proton on the alpha-carbon, which is removed by another equivalent of NaH.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    4.  **Cyclization:** The newly formed carbanion is tethered to a carbon chain with a good leaving group (Br) at the other end. It will undergo a favorable intramolecular SN2 reaction to form a 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the 1H NMR spectrum of Product 4**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n         ```\n              CN\n             /\n         (C1)--COOCH2CH3\n         /  \\\n       CH2--CH2\n       |    |\n       CH2--CH2\n         \\  /\n          CH2\n         ```\n*   **Symmetry and Chirality:**\n    *   The two substituents on C1 (-CN and -COOCH2CH3) are different.\n    *   This lack of symmetry means there is no plane of symmetry passing through the molecule.\n    *   The molecule is chiral (it is non-superimposable on its mirror image).\n\n*   **Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Signals:**\n    The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens. In a chiral molecule without symmetry, protons are only equivalent if they can be interchanged by a rapid process like bond rotation (e.g., protons on a methyl group).\n\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n        *   **-CH3:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   **-O-CH2-:** The two protons of this methylene group are in a chiral environment. They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. Rigorously, they should give two signals. However, in many textbook problems, the diastereotopicity of a flexible ethyl group is considered negligible or simplified. Let's assume the common simplification that they are equivalent enough to produce **1 signal**.\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons (10 total):**\n        *   Because the molecule is chiral and asymmetric, none of the CH2 groups in the ring are equivalent to each other.\n            *   C2 is not equivalent to C6.\n            *   C3 is not equivalent to C5.\n            *   C4 is in a unique position.\n        *   Furthermore, within each of these five distinct methylene groups, the two geminal protons (one \"axial-like\" and one \"equatorial-like\" in any given conformation) are diastereotopic. They have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1 and are therefore chemically distinct.\n        *   This means we have:\n            *   2 distinct protons on C2\n            *   2 distinct protons on C3\n            *   2 distinct protons on C4\n            *   2 distinct protons on C5\n            *   2 distinct protons on C6\n        *   This results in a total of **10 distinct signals** from the cyclohexane ring protons.\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Adding the signals from all parts of the molecule:\n    *   1 (from ethyl -CH3) + 1 (from ethyl -OCH2-, simplified) + 10 (from the ring) = **12 signals**.\n\nThis interpretation, which respects the complex stereochemistry of the rigid ring while making a common simplification for the flexible side chain, leads to one of the given options.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of 1H NMR signals for the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents points towards an alpha-halogenation of the carboxylic acid. The alpha-protons (on the CH3 group) of acetic acid are weakly acidic and can be removed by a base to form an enolate, which then reacts with bromine. Pyridine acts as a base, and Br2 is the halogenating agent. This reaction is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction.\n*   **Product 1:** The reaction substitutes one alpha-hydrogen with a bromine atom.\n    *   Structure of Product 1: Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (Br-CH2-COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid group of Product 1 reacts with the alcohol (ethanol) in the presence of a strong acid catalyst (H2SO4) to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** The product is the ethyl ester of bromoacetic acid.\n    *   Structure of Product 2: Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** Product 2 is a primary alkyl halide. The cyanide ion (CN-) from NaCN is a good nucleophile. This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction where the cyanide ion displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** The bromine atom is replaced by a cyano group.\n    *   Structure of Product 3: Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a two-step process involving deprotonation and alkylation, followed by a second deprotonation and an intramolecular alkylation (cyclization).\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** The methylene protons in ethyl cyanoacetate are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group, -CN, and an ester group, -COOEt), making them significantly acidic (pKa ≈ 11). The strong base sodium hydride (NaH) deprotonates this carbon to form a stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]- Na+ + H2\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons in 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromine atom in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]- + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaBr\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation & Cyclization:** The problem states \"excess sodium hydride\". The intermediate formed still has one acidic proton on the alpha-carbon. The excess NaH removes this proton to form a new carbanion. This carbanion is tethered to an alkyl chain with a bromide leaving group at the end. The carbanion then attacks the carbon bearing the second bromine atom in an intramolecular SN2 reaction. The ring formed will include the alpha-carbon and the five carbons of the pentane chain, resulting in a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted at the C1 position with both a cyano group and an ethoxycarbonyl group.\n    *   Structure of Product 4: 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of Product 4**\n\n*   **Structure for NMR analysis:**\n    ```\n          EtOOC   CN\n               \\ /\n                C1\n               / \\\n         C6H2--C2H2\n        /        \\\n    C5H2          C3H2\n        \\        /\n          C4H2\n    ```\n    Where Et is -CH2CH3.\n\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** The C1 carbon is substituted with two different groups: a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOEt). Due to these different substituents, the molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or rotational axis. It is a chiral molecule, and the synthesis produces a racemic mixture (equal amounts of both enantiomers). Since enantiomers have identical NMR spectra in an achiral solvent, we only need to analyze one of them.\n\n*   **Counting the Signals:** In an asymmetric molecule, any protons that cannot be interchanged by bond rotation or other rapid conformational changes are chemically non-equivalent and will give distinct signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH2CH3):**\n        *   **-CH3:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to rapid rotation around the C-C bond. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   **-OCH2-:** These two methylene protons are diastereotopic because they are in a chiral molecule. Strictly speaking, they are chemically non-equivalent and should give two signals. However, the chiral center (C1) is four bonds away. In many cases, the difference in their chemical shifts is negligible, and they appear as a single signal (i.e., they are isochronous). Given the multiple-choice options, it's a common convention in such problems to count them as one. So, we'll count this as **1 signal**.\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons (5 x -CH2- groups):**\n        *   The molecule has no symmetry. Therefore, the five methylene groups on the ring (at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6) are all in different chemical environments.\n        *   Furthermore, within each methylene group, the two protons (one \"axial\" and one \"equatorial\" in a chair conformation) are diastereotopic. They are on opposite faces of the ring relative to the local environment and are not interchangeable by symmetry or by the chair-flipping process.\n        *   Therefore:\n            *   C2 has two non-equivalent protons → **2 signals**\n            *   C3 has two non-equivalent protons → **2 signals**\n            *   C4 has two non-equivalent protons → **2 signals**\n            *   C5 has two non-equivalent protons → **2 signals**\n            *   C6 has two non-equivalent protons → **2 signals**\n        *   This gives a total of 5 x 2 = **10 signals** from the cyclohexane ring protons.\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Adding the signals from all parts of the molecule:\n    *   Total Signals = (Ethyl CH3) + (Ethyl CH2) + (Ring Protons)\n    *   Total Signals = 1 + 1 + 10 = **12 signals**\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nThe identity of the final product and the number of distinct hydrogen signals in its 1H NMR spectrum are determined through the following step-by-step synthesis:\n\n*   **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n    Acetic acid undergoes α-bromination when treated with bromine (Br2) in the presence of a catalyst like pyridine. This reaction, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction, substitutes a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group with a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)\n\n*   **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n    Product 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).

The sodium hydride, a strong base, removes a proton from the α-carbon (the CH₂ group between the nitrile and the ester), which is acidic due to the two electron-withdrawing groups.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, forming a new carbon-carbon bond.\n    3.  Because excess NaH is used, the second proton on the α-carbon is removed, creating a new carbanion.\n    4.  This carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular attack on the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromine atom and forming a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** 1-cyano-1-(ethoxycarbonyl)cyclohexane\n\n### **¹H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the final product, 1-cyano-1-(ethoxycarbonyl)cyclohexane.\n\nThe structure of Product 4 has a plane of symmetry that passes through the quaternary carbon (C1, bonded to -CN and -COOEt), the C4 carbon, and the substituents on C1.

However, the two protons on C2 (one axial, one equatorial) are diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent. Therefore, these four protons (two on C2, two on C6) will give rise to **two distinct signals**.\n    *   **C3 and C5 positions:** Similarly, these positions are equivalent. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic. These four protons will give another **two distinct signals**.\n    *   **C4 position:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry.

Here is a breakdown of the reaction sequence and the determination of the final answer.\n\n### Reaction Sequence\n\n1.  **Step 1: Formation of Bromoacetic Acid**\n    Acetic acid is treated with bromine (Br₂) and pyridine. This reaction is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction, which results in the bromination of the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxylic acid group). The product is bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Formation of Ethyl Bromoacetate**\n    Product 1, bromoacetic acid, is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction, where the carboxylic acid is converted into an ester. The product is ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Formation of Ethyl Cyanoacetate**\n    Product 2, ethyl bromoacetate, is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an Sₙ2 reaction. This yields product 3, ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Formation of the Final Product (Cyclization)**\n    Product 3, ethyl cyanoacetate, is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, and 1,5-dibromopentane. This is a multi-step process within a single reaction vessel:\n    *   First, the sodium hydride removes an acidic alpha-hydrogen from ethyl cyanoacetate, creating a stabilized carbanion.\n    *   This carbanion then attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule, displacing a bromine atom in a nucleophilic substitution reaction (alkylation).\n    *   Because excess sodium hydride is used, the remaining acidic alpha-hydrogen on the newly formed intermediate is also removed, creating a second carbanion.\n    *   This second carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentane chain and displacing the second bromine atom. This final step creates a six-membered ring.\n    The final product, compound 4, is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum of the final product, we must analyze its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** The product is a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃), attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n*   **Symmetry:** Because the two substituents on C1 are different, the molecule has no plane of symmetry. This lack of symmetry has significant consequences for the NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Hydrogen Signals:**\n    *   **Ethyl Group:** The ethyl group consists of a methylene (-CH₂) and a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n        1.  The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent and produce one signal.\n        2.  The two protons of the methylene group are also equivalent (due to rapid rotation) and produce a second signal.\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring:** Due to the absence of symmetry, all five of the other carbon atoms in the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6) are chemically distinct from one another. Furthermore, on each of these carbons, the two attached hydrogen atoms (one axial and one equatorial in the chair conformation) are diastereotopic, meaning they are in chemically non-equivalent environments.\n        *   C2 protons: 2 distinct signals (axial and equatorial)\n        *   C3 protons: 2 distinct signals (axial and equatorial)\n        *   C4 protons: 2 distinct signals (axial and equatorial)\n        *   C5 protons: 2 distinct signals (axial and equatorial)\n        *   C6 protons: 2 distinct signals (axial and equatorial)\n\n*   **Total Signal Count:**\n    *   Ethyl group signals: 2\n    *   Cyclohexane ring signals: 10 (2 for each of the 5 methylene carbons)\n    *   **Total distinct signals = 2 + 10 = 12**\n\nEach of these 12 sets of protons is chemically unique and will therefore produce a distinct signal in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nThe initial analysis of the reaction sequence and the final product's structure seems correct. The searches confirm that the reaction of a doubly-activated methylene compound like ethyl cyanoacetate with a dihalide such as 1,5-dibromopentane, in the presence of a strong base, leads to a cyclic product. Specifically, this is an intramolecular dialkylation.\n\nThe analysis of the 1H NMR spectrum for the resulting product, 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane, also appears sound. The key is to correctly identify the chemical equivalence (or non-equivalence) of the protons in the molecule.\n\nLet's break down the analysis again, supported by the search results.\n\n1.  **Reaction Pathway:**\n    *   **Step 1:** Acetic acid undergoes alpha-bromination via the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction to form bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n    *   **Step 2:** Bromoacetic acid is esterified with ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst (Fischer esterification) to yield ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Step 3:** Ethyl bromoacetate reacts with sodium cyanide in a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) to form ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃). This is a standard synthesis route for such compounds.\n    *   **Step 4:** Ethyl cyanoacetate is treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane. Sodium hydride deprotonates the acidic α-carbon. The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane. The excess base then deprotonates the newly formed intermediate (which still has one acidic α-hydrogen), and the resulting carbanion performs an intramolecular SN2 reaction to close the ring, displacing the second bromine atom. This forms a 1,1-disubstituted cyclohexane ring. The final product (4) is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Analysis of 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane:**\n    To determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must look at the molecule's symmetry. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through C1 (the carbon with the cyano and ester groups) and C4 (the opposite carbon in the ring). This symmetry makes pairs of protons chemically equivalent.\n\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   **-CH₃:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent and will produce one signal (a triplet). **(1 signal)**\n        *   **-OCH₂-:** The two protons of the methylene group are enantiotopic because they are related by the plane of symmetry in an achiral molecule. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent and give a single signal (a quartet). **(1 signal)**\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n        *   **C2/C6 Protons:** At C2, there is an axial proton (Hax) and an equatorial proton (Heq). These two protons are diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent and will have different chemical shifts. The Hax on C2 is equivalent to the Hax on C6, and the Heq on C2 is equivalent to the Heq on C6 due to the plane of symmetry. Therefore, these four protons give rise to two distinct signals. **(2 signals)**\n        *   **C3/C5 Protons:** Similarly, the axial and equatorial protons at C3 are diastereotopic. The protons at C3 are equivalent to their counterparts at C5. This results in two more distinct signals. **(2 signals)**\n        *   **C4 Protons:** The axial and equatorial protons at C4 lie within the plane of symmetry but are not interchangeable.

The goal is the bromination of the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group). Acetic acid has one α-carbon (the methyl group).\n*   **Product 1:** The reaction results in the substitution of one of the α-hydrogens with a bromine atom.\n    *   CH3COOH → BrCH2COOH\n*   Product 1 is **bromoacetic acid**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (bromoacetic acid), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification reaction, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form an ester. The carboxyl group (-COOH) is converted into an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n*   **Product 2:** BrCH2COOH + CH3CH2OH → BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + H2O\n*   Product 2 is **ethyl bromoacetate**.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile and will attack the carbon atom bonded to the bromine, displacing the bromide ion (Br⁻).\n*   **Product 3:** BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + NaCN → NC-CH2COOCH2CH3 + NaBr\n*   Product 3 is **ethyl cyanoacetate**.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a multi-step process involving deprotonation and alkylation, leading to cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base. It removes the most acidic proton from ethyl cyanoacetate. The protons on the CH2 group are α to two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group -CN and an ester group -COOEt), making them particularly acidic.\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + H₂\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion (enolate) is a strong nucleophile and reacts with 1,5-dibromopentane. It will attack one of the bromine-bearing carbons.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH( (CH2)5Br )-COOEt + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The problem states \"excess\" NaH. The product from the first alkylation still has one acidic proton on the α-carbon. NaH deprotonates it.\n        NC-CH( (CH2)5Br )-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-C( (CH2)5Br )-COOEt]⁻ + H₂\n    4.  **Intramolecular Alkylation (Cyclization):** The carbanion at one end of the molecule now attacks the carbon bearing the bromine atom at the other end of the pentyl chain. This is an intramolecular SN2 reaction. The ring formed consists of the α-carbon and the five carbons from the pentyl chain, resulting in a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group and an ethoxycarbonyl group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   Product 4 is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n**Step 5: 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\nNow we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:** The substituents on C1 are a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3). Since these two groups are different, the molecule has no plane of symmetry. C1 is a prochiral center.\n*   **Signal Counting (Rigorous vs. Approximated):** In a strict sense, the lack of symmetry makes all ring positions (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) non-equivalent, and the geminal protons on each of these CH2 groups are diastereotopic, leading to 10 signals from the ring. The ethyl group's OCH2 protons are also diastereotopic, giving 2 more signals, plus 1 for the CH3 group, for a total of 13 signals. Since 13 is not an option, we must use a simplifying approximation that is common in organic chemistry problems.\n\n*   **Plausible Approximation:** A common simplification is to assume that the ring possesses a \"pseudo\" plane of symmetry passing through C1 and C4, treating the -CN and -COOEt groups as sterically similar enough for the purpose of analyzing the ring protons. This leads to the following analysis:\n    1.  **Ring Protons (10H total):**\n        *   **C2 and C6:** These positions are now considered equivalent due to the pseudo-symmetry plane. However, the geminal protons at each position (axial and equatorial in the chair forms) are diastereotopic. Thus, the four protons at C2/C6 give rise to **2 signals**.\n        *   **C3 and C5:** These positions are also equivalent. Their geminal protons are diastereotopic. The four protons at C3/C5 give rise to **2 signals**.\n        *   **C4:** This position lies on the pseudo-symmetry plane. The two geminal protons here are enantiotopic, which means they are chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR solvent. They produce **1 signal**.\n        *   Total signals from the ring = 2 + 2 + 1 = **5 signals**.\n    2.  **Ethyl Group Protons (5H total):**\n        *   **-OCH2- Protons:** C1 of the ring is a prochiral center. Protons on a CH2 group near a prochiral center are diastereotopic, even if separated by several bonds (like the -C(O)O- linkage here). Therefore, the two methylene protons are chemically distinct and will produce **2 signals**.\n        *   **-CH3 Protons:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce **1 signal**.\n    3.  **Total Signals:**\n        *   Summing up the signals from all parts of the molecule: 5 (from the ring) + 2 (from the OCH2 group) + 1 (from the CH3 group) = **8 signals**.\n\nThis analysis, which combines a reasonable approximation for the ring's symmetry with a correct analysis of diastereotopicity, leads to one of the given options.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Bromine (Br2), Pyridine, Acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction type:** This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid. While the typical laboratory method is the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction which uses PBr3 as a catalyst, this combination of reagents also achieves the same transformation.

It is analogous to the malonic ester synthesis for ring formation.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** The methylene protons (-CH2-) in ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing groups (the nitrile -CN and the ester -COOEt). NaH removes one of these protons to form a stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na+[NC-CH-COOEt] + H2\n    2.  **Intermolecular Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule, displacing one bromine.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]- + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br-\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The resulting molecule still has one acidic proton on the α-carbon.

It attacks this electrophilic carbon, displacing the second bromine and forming a ring.

However, for C1 to be chiral, it must be attached to four *different* groups. The four groups are: -CN, -COOEt, and the two paths around the ring (-C2-C3-C4-C5-C6- and -C6-C5-C4-C3-C2-). Since these two paths are identical, C1 is **not a chiral center**, and the molecule is **achiral**.\n    *   Because the molecule is achiral, it possesses elements of symmetry. At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. This creates a time-averaged structure with a **plane of symmetry** that passes through C1, its two substituents, and the opposite carbon, C4.\n\n2.  **Consequences of Symmetry for NMR:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes pairs of carbons and their attached protons chemically equivalent.\n    *   C2 is equivalent to C6.\n    *   C3 is equivalent to C5.\n    *   C4 is unique.\n\n3.  **Counting the Distinct Signals:**\n\n    *   **Ethoxy Group (-O-CH₂-CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation. They produce **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are also equivalent. They produce **1 signal**.\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:** We must consider the two hydrogens on each CH₂ group (geminal protons). Even when carbons are equivalent (e.g., C2 and C6), their geminal protons might not be.\n        *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The positions C2 and C6 are equivalent. However, on any single C2 (or C6) carbon, the two geminal protons are in different environments relative to the rest of the molecule. They are **diastereotopic** and thus chemically distinct. Therefore, the four protons on C2 and C6 give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n        *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. C3 and C5 are equivalent positions, but the two geminal protons on each are diastereotopic. This gives another **2 distinct signals**.\n        *   **Protons on C4:** C4 lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two geminal protons are on opposite sides of the ring and are also **diastereotopic**.

It removes the most acidic proton from ethyl cyanoacetate. The protons on the CH2 group are highly acidic (pKa ≈ 11) because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (the nitrile -CN and the ester -COOEt). This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        *   NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H2\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        *   [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation & Cyclization:** The problem states \"excess sodium hydride,\" meaning there is enough base to deprotonate the product from the first alkylation.

The newly formed carbanion undergoes a rapid *intramolecular* SN2 reaction. The nucleophilic carbon attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromine atom and forming a ring. The ring will contain the α-carbon and the five carbons of the pentyl chain, resulting in a 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group and an ethyl carboxylate group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   The structure of Product 4 is **Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate)**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the chemical equivalence of the protons in the molecule, considering its symmetry. At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping, and there is free rotation about single bonds. This results in a time-averaged structure that possesses an effective plane of symmetry (C_s). This plane passes through C1, C4, the cyano group (-CN), and the carboxyl group (-COO-).\n\nLet's count the signals based on this symmetry:\n\n1.  **The Ethyl Group (-OCH2CH3):**\n    *   **-CH3 protons:** The three protons of the methyl group are chemically equivalent due to fast rotation around the C-C bond. They will produce **1 signal**.\n    *   **-OCH2- protons:** These two methylene protons are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation of the molecule (the C_s plane doesn't interchange them). They are diastereotopic. This is because they are attached to an oxygen which is connected to a prochiral center (C1 of the ring). Therefore, they are chemically distinct and will produce **2 separate signals**.\n    *   Total signals from the ethyl group = 1 + 2 = **3 signals**.\n\n2.  **The Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5. C4 is unique.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** The two protons on C4 are reflected into each other by the plane of symmetry. They are enantiotopic and thus chemically equivalent. They produce **1 signal**.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The two geminal protons on C2 are not related by any symmetry element and are thus diastereotopic. The same is true for C6. The plane of symmetry makes one proton on C2 (e.g., the \"axial-like\" one) equivalent to its counterpart on C6. The other proton on C2 (the \"equatorial-like\" one) is equivalent to its counterpart on C6. This results in two distinct sets of protons for the C2/C6 positions. They produce **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies as for C2/C6. The four protons on these carbons give rise to **2 signals**.\n    *   Total signals from the cyclohexane ring = 1 (from C4) + 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) = **5 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nAdding the signals from the ethyl group and the cyclohexane ring:\nTotal Signals = 3 (ethyl) + 5 (ring) = **8 signals**.\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, which our analysis shows to be 8.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{8}$.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of hydrogen signals in the final product's ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Reaction Sequence Analysis\n\n1.  **Product 1:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) undergoes an α-halogenation reaction when treated with bromine (Br₂) and a catalyst like phosphorus tribromide (which can be generated in situ). The given reagents (bromine, pyridine, acetic anhydride) will achieve the same outcome. This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. The α-carbon of acetic acid is brominated, yielding **bromoacetic acid (Br-CH₂-COOH)**.\n\n2.  **Product 2:** Bromoacetic acid (Product 1) is then heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid. This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction, where the carboxylic acid is converted to an ester. The product is **ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n3.  **Product 3:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Product 2) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an Sₙ2 reaction. This yields **ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n4.  **Product 4:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (Product 3) has acidic protons on the α-carbon (the CH₂ group) due to the electron-withdrawing effects of both the cyano and the ester groups. It is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, which deprotonates the α-carbon. The resulting carbanion then reacts with 1,5-dibromopentane. This reaction proceeds via a two-step process:\n    *   **First, an intermolecular alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    *   **Second, an intramolecular cyclization:** The excess sodium hydride deprotonates the newly substituted α-carbon again. The resulting carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentane chain to form a stable six-membered ring. This intramolecular cyclization is known as the Thorpe-Ziegler reaction.\n    The final product, **Product 4**, is **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**.\n\n### ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the chemical equivalence of the protons in 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\nThe structure consists of an ethyl group and a cyclohexane ring substituted at the C1 position.\n\n*   **Ethyl Group (-CH₂CH₃):** Due to free rotation, the three protons of the methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent, giving one signal. The two protons of the methylene (-CH₂) group are also equivalent, giving a second signal.\n    *   **2 signals** from the ethyl group.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane Ring:** At room temperature, cyclohexane and its derivatives undergo rapid chair-chair interconversion. However, the presence of two bulky substituents on a single carbon (C1) significantly hinders this flipping motion, raising the energy barrier for interconversion. On the NMR timescale, the conformation can be considered \"frozen\" or in slow exchange.\n\n    In a fixed chair conformation, the molecule is chiral (it lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion). In a chiral molecule, protons that cannot be interchanged by any symmetry operation are chemically non-equivalent (diastereotopic).\n\n    Let's analyze the 10 protons on the cyclohexane ring in this \"frozen\" chiral state:\n    *   **C2 and C6 protons:** The axial and equatorial protons on C2 are distinct. Similarly, the axial and equatorial protons on C6 are distinct. Because the molecule is chiral, the environment of the C2 protons is different from the C6 protons. Therefore, all four protons (axial-C2, equatorial-C2, axial-C6, equatorial-C6) are chemically distinct. This gives **4 signals**.\n    *   **C3 and C5 protons:** By the same logic, the four protons on C3 and C5 are all chemically distinct. This gives another **4 signals**.\n    *   **C4 protons:** The axial and equatorial protons on C4 are in different chemical environments and are therefore distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Signals:**\n    *   From the ethyl group: 2 signals\n    *   From the C2/C6 positions: 4 signals\n    *   From the C3/C5 positions: 4 signals\n    *   From the C4 position: 2 signals\n\n    Total = 2 + 4 + 4 + 2 = **12 distinct hydrogen signals**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product, we must first elucidate the structure of product 4 through the given reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\nAcetic acid (CH₃COOH) is treated with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction, where the α-carbon of the carboxylic acid is brominated.\nProduct 1 is α-bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\nProduct 1 (BrCH₂COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a Fischer esterification reaction.\nProduct 2 is ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\nProduct 2 (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion is a strong nucleophile and displaces the bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction.\nProduct 3 is ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\nProduct 3 (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH₂)₅Br).\n1.  Sodium hydride, a strong base, deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is acidic due to the adjacent electron-withdrawing cyano and ester groups, forming an enolate: [NC-CH-COOCH₂CH₃]⁻.\n2.  This enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion and forming an intermediate: NC-CH( (CH₂)₅Br )-COOCH₂CH₃.\n3.  Since excess NaH is used, it deprotonates the α-carbon again, forming a new enolate: [NC-C( (CH₂)₅Br )-COOCH₂CH₃]⁻.\n4.  This enolate undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction. The carbanion attacks the carbon at the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a six-membered ring.\nThe final product, 4, is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n**1H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals for ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n1.  **Conformation:** The cyclohexane ring is substituted at the C1 position with two bulky groups (a cyano group and an ethyl carboxylate group). This significant 1,1-disubstitution will create a high energy barrier for chair-chair interconversion. Therefore, the ring can be considered \"locked\" in a single chair conformation on the NMR timescale.\n\n2.  **Symmetry:** Let's analyze the symmetry of the molecule in its locked chair conformation.\n    *   Strictly speaking, the molecule does not have a plane of symmetry. A plane passing through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group is disrupted by the ethyl portion (-CH₂CH₃) of the ester, which is not symmetric with respect to this plane.\n    *   However, in the context of typical organic chemistry problems, it is a common and reasonable simplification to assume that the rapid rotation of the ester group creates an *effective* plane of symmetry that passes through C1 and C4.\n\n3.  **Counting the Signals (assuming effective Cₛ symmetry):**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n    *   Because the chair is locked, the axial (ax) and equatorial (eq) protons on each carbon are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.\n\nLet's count the distinct sets of protons:\n*   **Ethyl group:** The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent, and the two protons of the methylene group (-CH₂-) are equivalent (within this simplified model). This gives **2 signals**.\n*   **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   **C2 and C6:** The two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other. The two equatorial protons are also equivalent to each other, but distinct from the axial ones. This gives **2 signals** (one for H-2ax/H-6ax and one for H-2eq/H-6eq).\n    *   **C3 and C5:** Similarly, the protons on these carbons give rise to another **2 signals** (one for H-3ax/H-5ax and one for H-3eq/H-5eq).\n    *   **C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two protons (axial and equatorial) are diastereotopic and therefore not equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nSumming them up: 2 (from ethyl group) + 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) = 8 distinct hydrogen signals.\n\nThe options are:\nA) 8\nB) 10\nC) 5\nD) 12\n\nOur analysis based on standard simplifying assumptions leads to 8 signals.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\n### Step-by-step Derivations of Products\n\n1.  **Product 1:** The reaction of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) with bromine (Br₂) and pyridine/acetic anhydride is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. It results in the bromination of the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group).\n    *   **Product 1 is α-bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).**\n\n2.  **Product 2:** Product 1 (BrCH₂COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid is converted to an ester.\n    *   **Product 2 is ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).**\n\n3.  **Product 3:** Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and replaces the bromine atom via an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   **Product 3 is ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).**\n\n4.  **Product 4:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane. This is a classic cyclization reaction related to the malonic ester synthesis.\n    *   First, the strong base (NaH) removes a proton from the carbon between the cyano and ester groups, which is highly acidic. This forms a carbanion: [NCCHCOOCH₂CH₃]⁻.\n    *   This carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an alkylation step.\n    *   Since excess NaH is used, the remaining acidic proton on the same carbon is also removed, forming a new carbanion.\n    *   This carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentane chain and displacing the second bromine atom. This creates a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4 is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.**\n\n### 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4\n\nThe structure of the final product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethyl carboxylate (-COOCH₂CH₃) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-to-chair interconversion. This rapid flipping results in a time-averaged structure with a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group.\n\nThe number of chemically distinct proton environments is determined as follows:\n\n*   **Ethyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n    1.  The two protons of the methylene group (-O**CH₂**CH₃) are chemically equivalent due to fast rotation around the single bonds. They will appear as one signal.\n    2.  The three protons of the methyl group (-OCH₂**CH₃**) are equivalent and will appear as a second, distinct signal.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    Due to the plane of symmetry in the time-averaged structure, the carbons on one side of the plane are equivalent to those on the other (C2 is equivalent to C6, and C3 is equivalent to C5). However, on each of these carbons, the axial and equatorial protons are in different chemical environments (they are diastereotopic) and are therefore chemically distinct.\n    3.  **C2 & C6 axial protons:** The two axial protons at these positions are equivalent to each other. This is one signal.\n    4.  **C2 & C6 equatorial protons:** The two equatorial protons at these positions are equivalent to each other but different from the axial ones. This is a second signal from the C2/C6 positions.\n    5.  **C3 & C5 axial protons:** The two axial protons here are equivalent. This is a third signal.\n    6.  **C7 & C5 equatorial protons:** The two equatorial protons here are equivalent. This is a fourth signal.\n    7.  **C4 axial proton:** This proton is unique as it lies on the symmetry plane.\n    8.  **C4 equatorial proton:** This proton is also on the symmetry plane but is diastereotopic to the C4 axial proton and is therefore distinct.\n\n**Counting the Signals:**\n*   2 signals from the ethyl group.\n*   6 signals from the cyclohexane ring (C2/6-ax, C2/6-eq, C3/5-ax, C3/5-eq, C4-ax, C4-eq).\n\nTotal distinct hydrogen signals = 2 + 6 = 8.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
