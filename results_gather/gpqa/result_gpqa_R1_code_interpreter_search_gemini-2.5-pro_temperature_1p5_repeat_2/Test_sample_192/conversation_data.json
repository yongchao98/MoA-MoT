    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars, which we'll denote as `N`, varies with parallax (`plx`) according to the relation:\n    `N ∝ 1 / plx^5`\n    This means `N` is proportional to `plx` raised to the power of -5. The term \"number of stars\" in this context typically refers to the cumulative number of stars observed with a parallax greater than a certain value, which corresponds to stars being closer than a certain distance.\n\n2.  **Relate Parallax and Distance:**\n    Parallax is the apparent shift in a star's position due to the Earth's orbit. It is inversely proportional to the star's distance (`r`). For standard units (parallax in arcseconds, distance in parsecs), the relationship is:\n    `plx = 1 / r`\n    Or, in terms of proportionality:\n    `plx ∝ 1 / r`\n\n3.  **Express the Number of Stars in Terms of Distance:**\n    Now, we can substitute the relationship between parallax and distance into the given formula for the number of stars.\n    Since `N ∝ 1 / plx^5` and `plx ∝ 1 / r`, we have:\n    `N ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n    `N ∝ 1 / (1/r^5)`\n    `N ∝ r^5`\n    This tells us that the cumulative number of stars out to a distance `r` is proportional to `r^5`. We can write this as an equation `N = k * r^5`, where `k` is a constant of proportionality.\n\n4.  **Determine the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:**\n    The question asks how the number of stars changes \"per unit range of distance, r\". This quantity is the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance, which is mathematically represented by the derivative `dN/dr`.\n    We need to differentiate our expression for `N` with respect to `r`:\n    `N = k * r^5`\n    `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r^5)`\n    Using the power rule for differentiation (`d/dx (x^n) = n * x^(n-1)`), we get:\n    `dN/dr = k * 5 * r^(5-1)`\n    `dN/dr = (5k) * r^4`\n\n5.  **Find the Final Proportionality:**\n    Since `5k` is just another constant, the relationship simplifies to:\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^4`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The number of stars per unit range of distance varies as the fourth power of the distance. Comparing this result with the given options:\n    A) ~ r^3\n    B) ~ r^5\n    C) ~ r^4\n    D) ~ r^2\n\n    The correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
