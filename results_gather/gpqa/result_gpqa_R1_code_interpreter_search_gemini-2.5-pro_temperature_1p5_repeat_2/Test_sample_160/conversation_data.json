    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **λ1 (Lambda-1):** This is the mean free path of the residual gas molecules colliding with *each other*. This is the standard definition from the kinetic theory of gases. The system is in thermal equilibrium, and all particles (the gas molecules) are of similar mass and are moving.\n*   **λ2 (Lambda-2):** This is the mean free path of the high-energy electrons from the beam as they travel through the residual gas. The \"collision\" event here is an electron scattering off a gas molecule.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Formula for Mean Free Path (λ)**\n\nThe general concept for mean free path is:\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles.\n*   `σ` is the collision cross-section (the effective \"area\" a target presents for a collision).\n\nHowever, a crucial refinement is needed when the target particles are also in motion, as is the case for λ1.\n\n### **3. Calculating λ1 (Gas Molecule - Gas Molecule)**\n\nFor a gas where all particles are identical and in thermal motion, we must account for their relative velocities. The standard formula from the Boltzmann kinetic theory is:\n\nλ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n\n*   `n` is the number density of gas molecules.\n*   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section between two gas molecules. If we model the molecules as hard spheres with diameter `d`, then `σ_gg = πd²`.\n*   The `√2` factor accounts for the fact that the target molecules are also moving, which increases the probability of collision compared to a stationary target scenario.\n\n### **4. Calculating λ2 (Electron - Gas Molecule)**\n\nFor the electrons in the beam, the situation is different:\n*   **Target Motion:** The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, making them relativistic and extremely fast. Their velocity is many orders of magnitude greater than the thermal velocity of the residual gas molecules. Therefore, the gas molecules can be considered effectively stationary targets. When targets are stationary, the `√2` factor is not used.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section:** The collision is between a tiny, point-like electron and a gas molecule. The collision cross-section, `σ_eg`, is primarily determined by the size of the gas molecule. Using the same hard-sphere model, a point projectile hitting a sphere of radius `r = d/2` gives a cross-section of `σ_eg = πr² = π(d/2)² = (πd²)/4`.\n*   **High Energy Effect:** In reality, the scattering of very high-energy electrons is a quantum mechanical and relativistic process (Mott scattering). The effective cross-section for high-energy electrons (`σ_eg`) is known to be significantly *smaller* than the kinetic cross-section between two neutral molecules (`σ_gg`).\n\nCombining these points, the formula for the electron's mean free path is:\n\nλ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n\n### **5. Comparing λ2 and λ1**\n\nLet's find the ratio λ2 / λ1:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = [ 1 / (n * σ_eg) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) ]\n\nλ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n\nλ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\n\nNow, let's analyze the two factors in this ratio:\n1.  **The √2 factor:** This is approximately 1.414. This factor alone makes λ2 larger than λ1. It means that even if an electron had the same collision cross-section as a gas molecule, its mean free path would be about 41% longer simply because its targets are stationary.\n2.  **The cross-section ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg):**\n    *   From our simple hard-sphere model: `σ_gg = πd²` and `σ_eg = πd²/4`. This gives a ratio of `σ_gg / σ_eg = 4`.\n    *   From more advanced physics, the high energy of the electron makes its scattering cross-section `σ_eg` even smaller relative to `σ_gg`. So the ratio `σ_gg / σ_eg` is expected to be significantly greater than 1.\n\nTherefore, the total ratio is:\nλ2 / λ1 = √2 * (a number greater than 1)\n\nAt a minimum, even if we incorrectly assumed `σ_gg = σ_eg`, we would have:\nλ2 / λ1 = √2 ≈ 1.414\n\nThis means that λ2 must be at least 1.414 times larger than λ1.\n\n### **6. Conclusion**\n\nWe have firmly established that `λ2 > 1.414 * λ1`. Let's examine the options:\n*   A) λ2 < λ1  (Incorrect)\n*   B) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation (Incorrect)\n*   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 (Correct. Since λ2 is at least 1.414*λ1, it is certainly greater than or equal to 1.22*λ1)\n*   D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 (Incorrect. This sets an upper bound that is violated by the physics)\n\nThe physical reality dictates that the electron mean free path (λ2) is significantly longer than the molecule-molecule mean free path (λ1). Option C is the only one consistent with this conclusion.\n\n<<<C>>>"
