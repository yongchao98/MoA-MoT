    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify Compound X:\n\n**1. Analyze the Product's Spectroscopic Data**\n\nFirst, we must deduce the structure of the product formed in the reaction. The product has the same molecular formula as the starting material, Compound X, which is C11H12O, since the reaction is a rearrangement.\n\n*   **¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The signal at **δ 197.7 ppm** is highly characteristic of a **carbonyl carbon (C=O)**, specifically from a ketone or an aldehyde.\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** The two doublets at **δ 7.08 (2H, d)** and **δ 7.71 (2H, d)** are a classic A₂B₂ pattern. This pattern is indicative of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Methyl Groups:** There are two sharp singlets, each integrating to 3 protons: **δ 2.28 (3H, s)** and **δ 2.31 (3H, s)**. This means there are two methyl groups in environments with no adjacent protons.\n        *   One of these singlets, likely **δ 2.31**, is in the typical range for a methyl group attached to an aromatic ring (an aryl-CH₃). This confirms the presence of a **p-tolyl group (p-CH₃C₆H₄-)**.\n        *   The other singlet at **δ 2.28** is in the typical range for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (an acetyl group, -C(=O)CH₃). This fits with the ketone identified from the ¹³C NMR.\n    *   **Alkene Region:** The two doublets at **δ 6.75 (1H, d)** and **δ 7.68 (1H, d)** indicate two protons on a double bond that are coupled to each other. This points to a **-CH=CH- moiety**.\n\n**2. Assemble the Product Structure**\n\nBy combining the pieces identified from the NMR data, we can construct the product's structure:\n*   A p-tolyl group: `p-CH₃C₆H₄-`\n*   An acetyl group: `-C(=O)CH₃`\n*   A trans double bond: `-CH=CH-`\n\nConnecting these fragments logically gives the structure **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**, also known as **4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\nStructure: `(p-CH₃C₆H₄)-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃`\n\nLet's verify this structure against the molecular formula: C₇H₇ (tolyl) + C₂H₂ (alkene) + CO (carbonyl) + CH₃ (methyl) = **C₁₁H₁₂O**. This matches perfectly.\n\n**3. Identify the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe reaction is an isomerization of Compound X into 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. This means Compound X must contain the same atoms arranged differently. Critically, it must contain a **p-tolyl group** to form the p-tolyl group in the product.\n\nLet's examine the given options for Compound X:\n\n*   **A) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** `C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(O)CH(CH₃)`\n    *   This compound contains a **phenyl group (C₆H₅-)**, not a p-tolyl group. It cannot be Compound X.\n*   **B) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** `(p-CH₃C₆H₄)-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`\n    *   This compound contains a **4-methylstyryl group**, which includes a **p-tolyl group**. This is a plausible candidate for Compound X.\n*   **C) 2-styrylepoxide:** `C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`\n    *   This compound has the wrong molecular formula (C₁₀H₁₀O) and contains a phenyl group. It cannot be Compound X.\n*   **D) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** `C₆H₅-CH=C(CH₃)-CH(O)CH₂`\n    *   This compound contains a **phenyl group**, not a p-tolyl group. It cannot be Compound X.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the process of elimination, the only starting material that contains the necessary p-tolyl structural element to form the identified product is **2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**. The reaction is a known, though mechanistically complex, base-promoted rearrangement of a vinyl epoxide to an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n\n<<<B>>>"
