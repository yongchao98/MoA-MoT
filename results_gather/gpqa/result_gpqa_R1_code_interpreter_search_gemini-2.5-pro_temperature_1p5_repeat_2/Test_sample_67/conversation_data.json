    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State:**\n    *   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle. Its spin angular momentum is described by the spin operator $\\vec{S} = (S_x, S_y, S_z)$. The magnetic moment is given by $\\vec{\\mu} = \\gamma \\vec{S}$, where $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   Initially, there is a magnetic field $\\vec{B}_{init} = B\\hat{z}$. The interaction Hamiltonian is $H_{init} = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}_{init} = -\\gamma B S_z$.\n    *   The particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the field. This means the particle is in its lowest energy state. The eigenvalues of $S_z$ are $+\\hbar/2$ (for the spin-up state $|\\uparrow\\rangle_z$) and $-\\hbar/2$ (for the spin-down state $|\\downarrow\\rangle_z$).\n    *   The energies are $E = -\\gamma B (\\pm \\hbar/2)$. To minimize the energy (assuming $\\gamma$ and $B$ are positive, which is standard), we must maximize the eigenvalue of $S_z$. Thus, the particle is in the spin-up state along the z-axis.\n    *   So, the state of the system at time $t=0$ is $|\\psi(0)\\rangle = |\\uparrow\\rangle_z$. The expectation value of the spin is purely in the z-direction: $\\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle_0 = \\langle\\uparrow|_z \\vec{S} |\\uparrow\\rangle_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\hat{z}$.\n\n2.  **Understand the Dynamics after the Change:**\n    *   At $t=0$, the magnetic field is suddenly changed to $\\vec{B}_{new} = B\\hat{y}$.\n    *   For $t > 0$, the system evolves according to the new Hamiltonian, $H = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}_{new} = -\\gamma B S_y$.\n    *   The time evolution of the state vector is given by the Schrödinger equation: $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{-iHt/\\hbar} |\\psi(0)\\rangle$.\n    *   Substituting the new Hamiltonian and the initial state, we get:\n        $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{-i(-\\gamma B S_y)t/\\hbar} |\\uparrow\\rangle_z = e^{i\\gamma B S_y t/\\hbar} |\\uparrow\\rangle_z$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Expectation Value:**\n    *   We want to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle$.\n    *   $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle\\psi(t)|S_z|\\psi(t)\\rangle$.\n    *   Let's calculate $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle$. There are a few ways to do this.\n\n    **Method 1: Larmor Precession (Semi-classical approach)**\n    *   The equation of motion for the expectation value of the spin vector is $\\frac{d\\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle}{dt} = \\langle\\vec{\\mu}\\rangle \\times \\vec{B}_{new} = \\gamma \\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle \\times \\vec{B}_{new}$.\n    *   This equation describes the precession of the vector $\\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle$ around the magnetic field axis ($\\hat{y}$) with an angular frequency $\\omega_L = \\gamma B$. This frequency is known as the Larmor frequency.\n    *   The initial spin vector is $\\langle\\vec{S}(0)\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\hat{z}$. This vector will precess in the x-z plane around the y-axis.\n    *   The z-component of the precessing vector is given by $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = |\\langle\\vec{S}(0)\\rangle| \\cos(\\omega_L t) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t)$.\n    *   The expectation value of the magnetic moment's z-component is then $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\frac{\\gamma\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t)$.\n    *   The expression for $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle$ is a cosine function of time. The argument of the cosine is $\\omega t = \\gamma B t$.\n    *   Therefore, the angular oscillation frequency is $\\omega = \\gamma B$.\n\n    **Method 2: Full Quantum Mechanical Calculation**\n    *   We need to compute $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{i\\gamma B S_y t/\\hbar} |\\uparrow\\rangle_z$. Let $\\omega_L = \\gamma B$. The time evolution operator is $U(t) = e^{i\\omega_L t S_y/\\hbar}$.\n    *   The operator $e^{i\\theta S_y/\\hbar}$ represents a rotation about the y-axis by an angle $\\theta$. Here, $\\theta = \\omega_L t = \\gamma B t$.\n    *   We are rotating the initial state $|\\uparrow\\rangle_z$ around the y-axis. In terms of state vectors:\n        $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\cos(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) |\\uparrow\\rangle_z - \\sin(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) |\\downarrow\\rangle_z$.\n        (Note: The angle in the spinor rotation formula is half the angle of the vector rotation).\n    *   Now, we compute the expectation value:\n        $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\langle\\psi(t)| S_z |\\psi(t)\\rangle$\n        $= \\left( \\cos(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) \\langle\\uparrow|_z - \\sin(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) \\langle\\downarrow|_z \\right) S_z \\left( \\cos(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) |\\uparrow\\rangle_z - \\sin(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) |\\downarrow\\rangle_z \\right)$\n    *   Since $S_z|\\uparrow\\rangle_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}|\\uparrow\\rangle_z$ and $S_z|\\downarrow\\rangle_z = -\\frac{\\hbar}{2}|\\downarrow\\rangle_z$, this becomes:\n        $= \\left( \\cos(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) \\langle\\uparrow|_z - \\sin(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) \\langle\\downarrow|_z \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\cos(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) |\\uparrow\\rangle_z + \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sin(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) |\\downarrow\\rangle_z \\right)$\n    *   Using the orthogonality of the spin states ($\\langle\\uparrow|\\uparrow\\rangle = 1$, $\\langle\\downarrow|\\downarrow\\rangle=1$, $\\langle\\uparrow|\\downarrow\\rangle=0$), we get:\n        $= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\cos^2(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) - \\sin^2(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) \\right)$\n    *   Using the double-angle identity $\\cos(2\\theta) = \\cos^2\\theta - \\sin^2\\theta$:\n        $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\omega_L t) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t)$.\n    *   This gives the same result as the Larmor precession method. The average of the z-component of the moment is $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\frac{\\gamma\\hbar}{2}\\cos(\\gamma B t)$.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates as $\\cos(\\gamma B t)$. The angular frequency of this oscillation is $\\omega = \\gamma B$.\n    Comparing this result with the given options:\n    A) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n    B) gamma*B/2\n    C) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n    D) gamma*B\n\n    The correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
