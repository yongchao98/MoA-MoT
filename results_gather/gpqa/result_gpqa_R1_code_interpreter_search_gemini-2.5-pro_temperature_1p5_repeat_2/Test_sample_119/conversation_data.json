    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the relationship between parallax and distance.**\n    Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) of a star. We can write this relationship as:\n    `plx ∝ 1/d` or `d ∝ 1/plx`.\n    For simplicity, let's use the standard definition where `d = 1/plx` (with `d` in parsecs and `plx` in arcseconds).\n\n2.  **Use the assumption of uniform star distribution.**\n    The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number density of stars (`ρ`), which is the number of stars per unit volume, is constant everywhere in space.\n    `ρ = constant`\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of stars within a certain distance.**\n    The number of stars (`N`) within a spherical volume of radius `d` is the density `ρ` multiplied by the volume `V`.\n    The volume of a sphere is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    So, the number of stars out to a distance `d` is:\n    `N(d) = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`\n\n4.  **Express the number of stars as a function of parallax.**\n    Now, substitute the relationship `d = 1/plx` into the equation for `N(d)`. This will give us `N(plx)`, the total number of stars with a parallax *greater than or equal to* `plx` (which corresponds to stars with a distance *less than or equal to* `d`).\n    `N(plx) = ρ * (4/3)π * (1/plx)³ = (4/3)πρ * plx⁻³`\n\n5.  **Determine the number of stars per unit range of parallax.**\n    The question asks for how the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\" changes with `plx`. This quantity is the differential number count, which can be found by differentiating `N(plx)` with respect to `plx`. Let's call this distribution `n(plx)`. The number of stars in a small parallax interval `d(plx)` is `dN = n(plx) * d(plx)`.\n    So, `n(plx) = |dN/d(plx)|`. We take the absolute value because the number of stars must be a positive quantity, and the derivative will be negative (since `N(plx)` decreases as `plx` increases).\n\n    Let's perform the differentiation:\n    `dN/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [ (4/3)πρ * plx⁻³ ]`\n    `dN/d(plx) = (4/3)πρ * (-3 * plx⁻⁴)`\n    `dN/d(plx) = -4πρ * plx⁻⁴`\n\n    Now, taking the absolute value:\n    `n(plx) = |dN/d(plx)| = 4πρ * plx⁻⁴ = (4πρ) / plx⁴`\n\n6.  **Analyze the final relationship.**\n    The number of stars per unit range of parallax, `n(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx⁴`, since `4πρ` is a constant.\n    `n(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
