    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the RV Method and Doppler Shift\n\nThe Radial Velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The star wobbles as it orbits the common center of mass with the planet. This wobble causes its light to be blueshifted when it moves towards us and redshifted when it moves away.\n\nThe observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is related to the star's radial velocity ($v_{star}$) by the Doppler formula:\n$\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_{star}}{c}$\nwhere $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe maximum observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, known as the RV semi-amplitude, $K$. Since $c$ and $\\lambda_0$ are constants, the semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n\n$K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$\n\nGiven the data for the two planets:\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms\n\nThe ratio of their RV semi-amplitudes is:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n### 2. Relate RV Semi-Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P)\n\nThe formula for the RV semi-amplitude for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n$K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p} \\sin(i)}{M_{*}^{2/3}}$\nwhere:\n*   $P$ is the orbital period.\n*   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n*   $m_{p}$ is the mass of the planet.\n*   $M_{*}$ is the mass of the star.\n*   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight ($i=90^\\circ$ is edge-on).\n\nThe problem states:\n*   The stars have the same masses ($M_{*1} = M_{*2}$).\n*   The planets have masses similar to Neptune. In the context of RV detection, this usually implies that the measured minimum mass, $m_{p} \\sin(i)$, is similar for both planets. We will assume $m_{p1} \\sin(i_1) = m_{p2} \\sin(i_2)$.\n\nUnder these assumptions, all terms in the formula for $K$ are the same for both systems except for the period $P$. The formula can be simplified to show the proportionality:\n\n$K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\nThis inverse relationship means that a planet with a larger RV semi-amplitude ($K$) must have a shorter orbital period ($P$). Since $K_2 > K_1$, we expect $P_2 < P_1$, so the ratio $P_2/P_1$ must be less than 1.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods\n\nWe can write the relationship for both planets:\n$K_1 \\propto P_1^{-1/3}$\n$K_2 \\propto P_2^{-1/3}$\n\nNow, let's form a ratio:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{P_2^{-1/3}}{P_1^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nWe want to find the ratio $P_2/P_1$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n$\\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^3$\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n\nNow, substitute the ratio of the semi-amplitudes we found in step 1:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n\n### 4. Compute the Final Value\n\nLet's compute the numerical value for the ratio.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is the ratio of the wavelength shifts.\nK1_over_K2_ratio = 5 / 7\n\n# The ratio of the orbital periods is the cube of the inverse ratio of the semi-amplitudes.\nP2_over_P1_ratio = math.pow(K1_over_K2_ratio, 3)\n\nprint(P2_over_P1_ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.3644314868804665\n</execute_code>\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.364. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here's the detailed thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Technique:** Radial Velocity (RV) method. This method measures the star's \"wobble\" caused by an orbiting planet.\n    *   **Data:** Periodic shift of a spectral line. This is the Doppler shift.\n    *   **Star 1 / Planet 1:**\n        *   Star mass: $M_{*1} \\approx M_{Sun}$\n        *   Planet mass: $m_{p1} \\approx M_{Neptune}$\n        *   Orbit: Circular\n        *   Maximum wavelength shift: $\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 1} = 5$ miliangstroms\n    *   **Star 2 / Planet 2:**\n        *   Star mass: $M_{*2} \\approx M_{Sun}$\n        *   Planet mass: $m_{p2} \\approx M_{Neptune}$\n        *   Orbit: Circular\n        *   Maximum wavelength shift: $\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 2} = 7$ miliangstroms\n    *   **Key Equalities:**\n        *   $M_{*1} = M_{*2}$ (The problem states the stars have \"exactly the same masses\").\n        *   The RV method measures the *minimum mass* of a planet, which is $m_p \\sin(i)$. Since the planets are described as having \"masses similar to that of Neptune,\" a standard assumption in such problems is that the detected signals correspond to similar *minimum masses*, i.e., $m_{p1} \\sin(i_1) \\approx m_{p2} \\sin(i_2)$.\n    *   **Question:** How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? This asks for the ratio $P_2 / P_1$.\n\n2.  **Relate Observations to Physical Quantities:**\n    *   The RV method's observable is the Doppler shift, which gives the star's radial velocity. The maximum wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, $K$.\n    *   Doppler formula: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$, where $v_r$ is the radial velocity.\n    *   Therefore, the semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift: $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n    *   We can establish the ratio of the semi-amplitudes:\n        $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 2}}{\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 1}} = \\frac{7 \\text{ miliangstroms}}{5 \\text{ miliangstroms}} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n3.  **Find the Relevant Physics Formula:**\n    *   We need the formula that connects the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) to the orbital period ($P$) and other system parameters.\n    *   For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula for the star's RV semi-amplitude is:\n        $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{*}^{2/3}}$\n    *   Where:\n        *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n        *   $P$ is the orbital period.\n        *   $m_p$ is the planet's mass.\n        *   $M_*$ is the star's mass.\n        *   $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Formula Based on the Problem's Conditions:**\n    *   We are comparing two systems. Let's look at what is constant and what is changing between them.\n    *   $G$ and $2\\pi$ are physical constants.\n    *   $M_*$ is the same for both stars ($M_{*1} = M_{*2}$).\n    *   $m_p \\sin(i)$ is assumed to be the same for both planets ($m_{p1}\\sin(i_1) = m_{p2}\\sin(i_2)$).\n    *   This means all parts of the formula are constant except for $K$ and $P$. We can express this as a proportionality:\n        $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$ or $K = \\frac{\\text{Constant}}{P^{1/3}}$\n\n5.  **Set up a Ratio to Solve for the Unknown:**\n    *   We want to find the ratio $P_2/P_1$.\n    *   From the proportionality $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$, we can write:\n        $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{P_2^{-1/3}}{P_1^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    *   We need to solve for $P_2/P_1$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n        *   First, cube both sides: $\\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n        *   Then, take the reciprocal of both sides to get the desired ratio: $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   Substitute the known ratio of the semi-amplitudes ($K_1/K_2 = 5/7$) into the equation.\n        $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n    *   Now, perform the calculation.\n    ```python\n    # Calculate the ratio (5/7)^3\n    ratio = (5/7)**3\n    print(ratio)\n    ```\n    *   The calculation `(5/7)^3 = 125 / 343` results in approximately `0.3644`.\n    *   This value corresponds to option A, which is `~ 0.36`.\n\n7.  **Final Check:**\n    *   The reasoning seems sound. Star 2 causes a larger wobble (larger $K$). For a given planet and star mass, a larger wobble implies a stronger gravitational pull on the star. This happens when the planet is closer to the star. According to Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit means a shorter period.\n    *   Therefore, since $K_2 > K_1$, we must have $P_2 < P_1$. The ratio $P_2/P_1$ must be less than 1.\n    *   Our calculated value of ~0.36 is less than 1, which is consistent with the physics.\n    *   The options are: A) ~0.36, B) ~1.40, C) ~0.85, D) ~1.96. Only option A is less than 1 (and matches our calculation).\n\nThis detailed process confirms that A is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
