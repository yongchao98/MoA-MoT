    "This problem requires the application of the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of particles over various energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Principle:** The problem states that the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This is the key condition that allows us to use the Boltzmann distribution to describe the population of atomic energy levels.\n\n2.  **State the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited energy state (level `b`) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (level `a`):\n\n    N_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)]\n\n    Where:\n    *   `N_b` and `N_a` are the number of atoms in states `b` and `a`.\n    *   `g_b` and `g_a` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the states.\n    *   `E_b - E_a` is the energy difference between the states, which we'll call `ΔE`.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Apply the Equation to Both Stars:** We have two stars, star_1 with temperature `T_1` and star_2 with temperature `T_2`. Let's write the population ratio for each:\n\n    *   For star_1:  (N_b / N_a)_1 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n    *   For star_2:  (N_b / N_a)_2 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n    The term `(g_b / g_a)` and `ΔE` are properties of the iron atom's energy levels, so they are the same for both stars.\n\n4.  **Use the Information from the Problem:** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2.\" This translates to:\n\n    (N_b / N_a)_1 = 2 * (N_b / N_a)_2\n\n5.  **Set up the Equation:** Substitute the Boltzmann expressions into the relationship from step 4:\n\n    (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * [ (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] ]\n\n6.  **Simplify the Equation:**\n    *   Cancel the common term `(g_b / g_a)` from both sides:\n        exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n    *   Isolate the constant '2' by dividing:\n        2 = exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n    *   Use the exponent rule `exp(x) / exp(y) = exp(x - y)`:\n        2 = exp[ (-ΔE / (k * T_1)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]\n        2 = exp[ ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) ]\n\n7.  **Solve for the Temperatures:**\n    *   Take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides to remove the exponential:\n        ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)\n\n    *   Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n        ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\n    *   Combine the fractions inside the parentheses using a common denominator (`T_1 * T_2`):\n        ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n8.  **Evaluate the `ΔE / k` Term:** The problem provides the energy difference `ΔE` and implies we should use the value of the Boltzmann constant `k`.\n    *   Given: `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`\n    *   Known value: Boltzmann constant, `k ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`\n\n    Now, calculate the ratio:\n    ΔE / k = (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) = 1 K\n\n    The numerical value of the `ΔE / k` term is 1. The fact that the given energy value so closely matches the Boltzmann constant is the crucial hint to solve the problem.\n\n9.  **Finalize the Equation:** Substitute `ΔE / k = 1` into the equation from step 7:\n\n    ln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n10. **Compare with Options:** This final derived equation matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
