    "This problem is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, specifically the energy-time uncertainty relation. This principle states that for a quantum state with a finite lifetime, its energy cannot be known with perfect precision.\n\n1.  **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The relationship between the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is given by:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n2.  **Linewidth of an Energy Level:** For an unstable quantum state, the lifetime (τ) of the state can be taken as the uncertainty in time (Δt = τ). The uncertainty in its energy, ΔE, is often called the \"natural linewidth\" (Γ) of the energy level. We can approximate the minimum uncertainty as:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy Uncertainty for Each State:**\n    *   **State 1:** Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   **State 2:** Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n4.  **Condition for Resolution:** To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their central energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be larger than their combined energy uncertainties. A common criterion is that the energy difference must be at least as large as the sum of the individual linewidths. A less strict but still valid criterion is that the difference must be larger than the broader of the two linewidths.\n\n    The broader linewidth corresponds to the shorter lifetime, so ΔE₁ is the dominant uncertainty.\n    *   Larger uncertainty: ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   Sum of uncertainties: ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ (6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.66 x 10⁻⁷ eV) ≈ 7.3 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    Therefore, the energy difference between the two levels, let's call it ΔE_diff, must satisfy:\n    ΔE_diff > 7.3 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:** We need to find the option that is greater than ~7.3 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   A) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much greater than 7.3 x 10⁻⁷ eV. (10⁻⁴ = 1000 x 10⁻⁷)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is much smaller than 7.3 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than 7.3 x 10⁻⁷ eV. (10⁻⁸ = 0.1 x 10⁻⁷)\n    *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much smaller than 7.3 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option A provides an energy separation large enough to clearly resolve the two states, as it is the only value greater than the calculated total energy uncertainty.\n\nTo confirm the calculations:\n```python\n# hbar in eV.s\nhbar_evs = 6.582e-16\n\n# lifetimes\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# energy uncertainties (linewidths)\ndelta_E1 = hbar_evs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_evs / tau2\n\n# The required energy difference must be greater than the sum of the linewidths\nrequired_energy_diff = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Linewidth of state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Linewidth of state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Required energy separation for clear resolution must be > {required_energy_diff:.3e} eV\")\n\n# Check the options\noptions = {'A': 1e-4, 'B': 1e-9, 'C': 1e-8, 'D': 1e-11}\nfor key, value in options.items():\n    if value > required_energy_diff:\n        print(f\"Option {key} ({value:.1e} eV) is a valid separation.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {key} ({value:.1e} eV) is NOT a valid separation.\")\n```\n<<<A>>>",
    "The reasoning and the python code both point to the same conclusion.\n\n**Summary of Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle (Energy-Time):**  ΔE⋅Δt ≥ ħ/2. This principle implies that a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt = τ) will have a fundamental uncertainty or \"spread\" in its energy (ΔE). We approximate this as ΔE ≈ ħ/τ. This energy spread is also called the natural linewidth.\n\n2.  **Calculate Linewidth for Each State:**\n    *   State 1 has a shorter lifetime (τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s), so it will have a larger energy uncertainty (a broader linewidth).\n        ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   State 2 has a longer lifetime (τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s), resulting in a smaller energy uncertainty (a narrower linewidth).\n        ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n\n3.  **Resolution Condition:** To clearly resolve two energy levels, the energy difference between them, |E₂ - E₁|, must be larger than their energy uncertainties. A common criterion for \"clear resolution\" is that the separation must be greater than the sum of their individual linewidths.\n    *   Total Linewidth = ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV + 0.658 x 10⁻⁷ eV ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Options:** We need to find the energy difference from the options that is significantly larger than the total linewidth of ~7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV:**  1 x 10⁻⁴ eV is much larger than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   **B) 10⁻⁹ eV:**  This is smaller than the required separation.\n    *   **C) 10⁻⁸ eV:**  This is smaller than the required separation.\n    *   **D) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is much smaller than the required separation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The only energy difference that is large enough to ensure the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished is 10⁻⁴ eV. The code output confirms this calculation, showing that the required separation must be greater than 7.240e-07 eV, and only option A (1.0e-04 eV) satisfies this condition.\n\n<<<A>>>"
