    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Potential and Change Coordinates:**\n    The given potential is in polar coordinates (r, θ):\n    V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n\n    This potential form is not immediately recognizable as a standard separable potential in polar coordinates. Let's convert it to Cartesian coordinates (x, y) to see if it takes a simpler form. The standard transformation rules are:\n    x = r cos(θ)\n    y = r sin(θ)\n    From these, we can derive:\n    r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n    x^2 = r^2 cos^2(θ)\n\n    Now, substitute these expressions back into the potential V:\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k(x^2)\n\n2.  **Simplify the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    Combine the terms in the expression for V(x, y):\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2 + 3/2 kx^2\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 k + 3/2 k)x^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n    V(x, y) = (4/2 k)x^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n    V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\n3.  **Identify the System:**\n    The potential is now in the form:\n    V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\n    where V_x(x) = 2kx^2 and V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2.\n    This is the potential of a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The motion is separable into two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators, one in the x-direction and one in the y-direction.\n\n4.  **Solve the Schrödinger Equation:**\n    The time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system is separable. The total energy E is the sum of the energies from the x and y components:\n    E = E_x + E_y\n\n    We need to find the energy eigenvalues for each one-dimensional harmonic oscillator. The standard energy for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator with potential V(q) = 1/2 mω^2 q^2 is E_n = (n + 1/2)ℏω.\n\n    *   **For the x-direction:**\n        The potential is V_x(x) = 2kx^2. We equate this to the standard form 1/2 mω_x^2 x^2:\n        1/2 mω_x^2 = 2k\n        ω_x^2 = 4k/m\n        ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n        The energy eigenvalues for the x-component are:\n        E_nx = (n_x + 1/2)ℏω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ℏ * (2 * sqrt(k/m))\n\n    *   **For the y-direction:**\n        The potential is V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2. We equate this to the standard form 1/2 mω_y^2 y^2:\n        1/2 mω_y^2 = 1/2 k\n        ω_y^2 = k/m\n        ω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n        The energy eigenvalues for the y-component are:\n        E_ny = (n_y + 1/2)ℏω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum:**\n    The total energy E is the sum E_nx + E_ny:\n    E = (n_x + 1/2)ℏ * (2 * sqrt(k/m)) + (n_y + 1/2)ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n    Now, let's simplify this expression by factoring out the common term ℏ*sqrt(k/m):\n    E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n    Here, n_x and n_y are the quantum numbers for the x and y oscillators, respectively, and they can be any non-negative integer (n_x, n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m).\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    B) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n    C) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    D) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\n    Our result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
