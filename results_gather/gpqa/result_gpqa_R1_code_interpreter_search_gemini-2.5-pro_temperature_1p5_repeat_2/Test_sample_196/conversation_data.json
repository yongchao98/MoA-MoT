    "*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze the structure of the starting material (Compound X) from the provided spectral data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **3400–2500 cm-1 (broad):** This very broad signal is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, which forms hydrogen-bonded dimers.\n        *   **1720 cm-1:** This is a strong absorption typical for the C=O stretching of a carbonyl group, specifically in a carboxylic acid.\n        *   **1610 cm-1, 1450 cm-1:** These absorptions are in the region for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This chemical shift and broad singlet (bs) nature is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The presence of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggests a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are more deshielded (further downfield), indicating they are adjacent (ortho) to an electron-withdrawing group, which is the carboxylic acid (-COOH). The protons at 7.2 ppm are less deshielded, so they are adjacent to the other substituent, which must be an electron-donating or weakly activating group (an alkyl group).\n        *   **Alkyl Group Proton Analysis:** Let's assemble the structure of the alkyl chain from the remaining signals.\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) next to a methylene group (-CH2-). Fragment: -CH2-CH3.\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) next to a methine group (-CH-). Fragment: -CH(CH3)-.\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons suggests a methylene group (-CH2-) with different neighbors on each side. It is likely coupled to both a CH and a CH3 group.\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton in the benzylic region (attached to the aromatic ring) suggests a methine proton (-CH-) with several neighbors.\n        *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** We can combine the fragments. The benzylic proton (2.9 ppm) is the -CH- that is bonded to the ring. This CH is also bonded to the methyl group from the 1.4 ppm signal (-CH(CH3)-) and the ethyl group's methylene part from the 0.9 and 1.7 ppm signals (-CH2CH3). Therefore, the complete alkyl group is a sec-butyl group: -CH(CH3)CH2CH3.\n        *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. This is option (B), which is the starting material.\n\n2.  **Determine the reaction and the final product.**\n\n    *   **Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is treated with red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reagents Function:** The combination of red phosphorus and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH3). The rest of the molecule, the aromatic ring and the stable sec-butyl group, will remain unchanged under these conditions.\n    *   **Transformation:**\n        *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n        *   The -COOH group at position 1 is reduced to a -CH3 group.\n        *   The sec-butyl group at position 4 is unaffected.\n    *   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n3.  **Identify the final product from the given choices.**\n\n    *   A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: This matches the product we deduced.\n    *   B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material, Compound X.\n    *   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: This would have a different alkyl group isomer (isobutyl), which is inconsistent with the NMR data of the starting material.\n    *   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: This structure is inconsistent with the starting material's spectral data.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
