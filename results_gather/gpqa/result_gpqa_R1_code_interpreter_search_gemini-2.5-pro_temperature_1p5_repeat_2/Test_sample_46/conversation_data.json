    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   First, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) to determine the number of rings and/or double/triple bonds.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    *   A DoU of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (e.g., a C=O bond).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two medium to strong intensity bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂). This rules out structures with secondary amines (-NH-), amides, or nitro groups.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. The frequency is typical for an ester group (C=O), especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring. It's a bit high for a typical conjugated ketone or amide.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal corresponds to 3 protons, and its splitting pattern is a triplet (t). This indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is characteristic of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal corresponds to 2 protons, and its splitting is a quartet (q). This indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). The downfield chemical shift (~4.5 ppm) is highly indicative of this methylene group being attached to an electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (R-COO-CH₂-). This, combined with the triplet at 1.20 ppm, confirms the presence of an ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) as part of an ester.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2 protons. Its chemical shift and broadness are characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂) attached to an aromatic ring. The broadening is due to quàdrupole coupling with the nitrogen atom and potential hydrogen bonding. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets (d) in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm), each integrating to 2 protons. This symmetrical pattern is the classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents on the ring must be different, causing the two sets of aromatic protons to have different chemical shifts. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is ortho to an electron-donating group (the -NH₂), while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is ortho to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester's carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure**\n    1.  We have a benzene ring with two substituents at the 1 and 4 (para) positions.\n    2.  One substituent is a primary amine group (-NH₂).\n    3.  The other substituent is an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n    Putting these pieces together gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Verifying the Options**\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the data (formula C9H11NO2, IR, and all NMR signals).\n    *   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Has a secondary amide (-NH-), which would show only one N-H band in the IR, not two. Incorrect.\n    *   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Is 1,3-disubstituted (meta), which would give a more complex NMR splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two doublets. Incorrect.\n    *   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer of A. Its structure is CH₃CH₂COO-Ar-NH₂. The NMR would show a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl, with a chemical shift around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. The NMR data clearly shows an ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃), not a propionyl group (CH₃CH₂CO-). Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only compound that fits all the provided spectroscopic data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
