    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem\n\nWe have a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held at zero (`V_sphere = 0`). We need to find the total potential energy of this configuration.\n\n### 2. The Method of Images\n\nThis problem is a classic application of the \"method of images.\" To satisfy the boundary condition that the potential is zero on the surface of the sphere, we can replace the sphere with an \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location `d'` inside the sphere. The electric field outside the sphere is then the superposition of the fields from the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\nFor a grounded conducting sphere, the image charge `q'` and its position `d'` are given by:\n*   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   Image charge position: `d' = R^2 / d` (measured from the center, on the same line as the original charge `q`)\n\nThe negative sign of `q'` indicates that the force between the real charge `q` and the induced charge on the sphere is attractive.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy `U` of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n#### Method 1: Integrating the Force\n\nThe work `U` is the integral of the external force required to move the charge, which is the negative of the electric force `F(x)` exerted by the sphere on the charge `q`.\n`U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F(x) dx`\n\nAs we bring the charge `q` from a position `x` to `d`, the image charge `q'` and its position `d'` also change depending on `x`. At any given position `x`, the force on charge `q` due to the sphere is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'(x)` at position `d'(x)`.\n\n*   `q'(x) = -q * R/x`\n*   `d'(x) = R^2 / x`\n\nThe distance between the charge `q` at `x` and its image `q'(x)` at `d'(x)` is `x - d'(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n\nThe force on `q` is given by Coulomb's law:\n`F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - d'(x))^2`\n`F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n`F(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nNow, we integrate to find the work done (potential energy):\n`U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F(x) dx = - ∫(from ∞ to d) [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n`U = k * q^2 * R * ∫(from ∞ to d) [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use u-substitution. Let `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`, and `x dx = du/2`.\n`∫ [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx = ∫ (1/u^2) * (du/2) = (1/2) * (-1/u) = -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))`\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral:\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2)) ] (from ∞ to d)`\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ (-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2(∞^2 - R^2))) ]`\nThe term with `∞` in the denominator goes to zero.\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(d^2 - R^2)) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n#### Method 2: Using Potential (Shortcut)\n\nThe potential energy of a charge `q` in the presence of conductors is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges on the conductors. The factor of `1/2` is crucial and arises because the induced charges are not fixed but are themselves established by `q`.\n\n1.  **Find the potential at the location of `q` due to the image charge `q'`.**\n    The real charge `q` is at distance `d`. The image charge `q' = -qR/d` is at distance `d' = R^2/d`.\n    The distance between `q` and `q'` is `Δx = d - d' = d - R^2/d`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the potential `V_induced`:**\n    The potential at position `d` due to the image charge is:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / Δx = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n    `V_induced = -k * qR / d * (1 / ((d^2 - R^2)/d))`\n    `V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n3.  **Calculate the potential energy `U`:**\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The net potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
