    "This problem involves the concepts of special relativity (specifically time dilation) and radioactive decay.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Particle Decay Law:** The number of unstable particles `N` decreases over time `t` according to the exponential decay law:\n    `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ_effective)`\n    where `N₀` is the initial number of particles and `τ_effective` is the mean lifetime of the particles in the frame of reference where time `t` is measured (in this case, the lab frame).\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** The mean lifetime of the particles in their own rest frame is the proper lifetime, `τ`. Due to time dilation, an observer in the lab frame measures a longer lifetime, `τ_lab`, which is related to the proper lifetime by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `τ_lab = γ * τ`\n    So, the effective lifetime in our decay equation is `τ_lab`.\n\n3.  **Survival Fraction:** The fraction of particles that reach the detector is `f = N(t_flight) / N₀`. The time `t_flight` is the time it takes for the particles to travel from the center to the detector wall in the lab frame.\n    `t_flight = R / v`\n    where `R` is the detector radius (30 m) and `v` is the particle's velocity.\n    Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. So, we can approximate `t_flight ≈ R / c`.\n\n4.  **Combining the Concepts:** We can now write the formula for the fraction of surviving particles `f`:\n    `f = exp(-t_flight / τ_lab)`\n    Substituting the expressions for `t_flight` and `τ_lab`:\n    `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γτ))`\n    We can group the constants `R`, `c`, and `τ` into a single constant `K = R / (cτ)`. This constant depends on the experimental setup and the type of particle but not on the Lorentz factor.\n    `f(γ) = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n5.  **Using the Given Information (Scenario 1):**\n    We are given that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, the survival fraction `f₁ = 1/3`. We can use this to find the value of our constant `K`.\n    `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n    `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n    `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n6.  **Solving for the Unknown (Scenario 2):**\n    We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, for which the survival fraction `f₂ = 2/3`.\n    `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n    Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n    `ln(2) - ln(3) = -K / γ₂`\n    `-(ln(3) - ln(2)) = -K / γ₂`\n    `ln(3/2) = K / γ₂`\n    Now we can solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = K / ln(3/2)`\n\n7.  **Calculation:**\n    Substitute the expression for `K` that we found in step 5:\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n    To get a numerical value, we can use a calculator or a short script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We are solving for gamma_2 in the equation: gamma_2 = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)\ngamma_2 = (20 * math.log(3)) / math.log(3/2)\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n```output\n54.19139158913926\n```\n\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 54\nB) 68\nC) 28\nD) 40\n\nThe closest option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The code execution confirms the calculation.\n\n*   From the initial conditions (`γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`), we derived the relationship:\n    `ln(1/f₁) = K / γ₁`\n    `ln(3) = K / 20`\n    `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n*   For the second scenario (`f₂ = 2/3`), we need to find `γ₂`:\n    `ln(1/f₂) = K / γ₂`\n    `ln(3/2) = K / γ₂`\n    `γ₂ = K / ln(3/2)`\n\n*   Substituting the value of `K`:\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\n*   The Python script calculated this value:\n    `gamma_2 = (20 * math.log(3)) / math.log(3/2)`\n    The output was approximately `54.19`.\n\n*   Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) 54\n    B) 68\n    C) 28\n    D) 40\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor `γ₂ ≈ 54.2` is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
