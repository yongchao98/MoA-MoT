    "Answering this question requires understanding the sources of solar neutrinos and their energy spectra.\n\n### 1. Identify Neutrino Sources and their Energies\n\nThe Sun produces neutrinos through several nuclear reactions, primarily the proton-proton (pp) chain, which has three main branches (pp-I, pp-II, pp-III), and the CNO cycle. Each reaction produces neutrinos with a characteristic energy or energy spectrum:\n\n*   **pp neutrinos (pp-I):** Continuous spectrum up to 420 keV.\n*   **⁷Be neutrinos (pp-II):** A sharp, monoenergetic line at **861 keV** (and a much weaker one at 383 keV).\n*   **⁸B neutrinos (pp-III):** A continuous, broad spectrum with high energies up to ~15 MeV.\n*   **CNO neutrinos:** Continuous spectra from the decay of ¹³N (up to 1.20 MeV) and ¹⁵O (up to 1.73 MeV).\n*   **pep neutrinos:** A sharp line at 1.44 MeV.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Hypothetical Scenario\n\nThe problem states that the **pp-III branch stops**. The key reaction in the pp-III branch is `⁷Be + p -> ⁸B + γ`, which leads to the decay of Boron-8 (`⁸B`) and the production of `⁸B` neutrinos.\n*   **Effect:** If the pp-III branch stops, the production of `⁸B` neutrinos ceases immediately.\n*   **Assumption:** All other reactions proceed as normal. This means the pp-II branch, which produces the 861 keV ⁷Be neutrinos, continues. The CNO cycle also continues.\n*   **Timing:** The change happened ~8.5 minutes ago, which is the travel time for neutrinos from the Sun to Earth. Therefore, we are observing the consequences of this change right now.\n\n### 3. Determine the Flux in Each Energy Band After the Change\n\nWe need to find the neutrino sources that contribute to the two energy bands:\n*   **Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n    *   `pp` neutrinos (max 420 keV): No contribution.\n    *   `⁷Be` neutrinos (line at 861 keV): No contribution.\n    *   `⁸B` neutrinos (stopped): No contribution.\n    *   `CNO` neutrinos (up to 1.73 MeV): **Yes, this is the only remaining source in this band.**\n*   **Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n    *   `pp` neutrinos: No contribution.\n    *   `⁷Be` neutrinos (line at 861 keV): **Yes, the 861 keV line falls directly in this band.**\n    *   `⁸B` neutrinos (stopped): No contribution.\n    *   `CNO` neutrinos: **Yes, the CNO continuous spectrum also contributes here.**\n\nSo, after the pp-III branch stops:\n*   Flux (Band 1) = Flux from CNO neutrinos.\n*   Flux (Band 2) = Flux from ⁷Be line neutrinos + Flux from CNO neutrinos.\n\nThe ratio is:\n`Ratio = Flux_CNO(700-800 keV) / (Flux_⁷Be(861 keV line) + Flux_CNO(800-900 keV))`\n\n### 4. Compare the Magnitudes of the Fluxes\n\nNow we must compare the sizes of these fluxes.\n1.  **⁷Be Flux:** This is a very intense, single-energy line. The Standard Solar Model (SSM) predicts a total flux of about **~5 x 10⁹ neutrinos / (cm²·s)** for the 861 keV line.\n2.  **CNO Flux:** This is a continuous spectrum. The total integrated flux from the relevant CNO reactions is about **~1 x 10⁹ / (cm²·s)**, spread out over an energy range of ~1.7 MeV.\n\nThe flux in a narrow 100 keV band from the CNO spectrum will only be a small fraction of its total flux. Let's make an order-of-magnitude estimate:\n*   Assuming the CNO flux is roughly spread out, the flux in a 100 keV (0.1 MeV) window is approximately `(Total CNO Flux / Total Energy Range) * Window Width`.\n*   Flux_CNO(in 100 keV band) ≈ (1 x 10⁹ / 1.7 MeV) * 0.1 MeV ≈ **6 x 10⁷ / (cm²·s)**.\n\nNow, let's compute the ratio:\n*   **Numerator:** Flux (Band 1) = Flux_CNO(in 100 keV band) ≈ 6 x 10⁷\n*   **Denominator:** Flux (Band 2) = Flux_⁷Be_line + Flux_CNO(in 100 keV band) ≈ (5 x 10⁹) + (6 x 10⁷)\n\nThe CNO contribution in the denominator (6 x 10⁷) is negligible compared to the ⁷Be line flux (5 x 10⁹).\nSo, the denominator is dominated by the ⁷Be flux.\n\nRatio ≈ (6 x 10⁷) / (5 x 10⁹) = 6 / 500 = **0.012**\n\nThis value is very close to 0.01.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe flux in Band 1 is determined by a small slice of the continuous CNO spectrum. The flux in Band 2 is overwhelmingly dominated by the intense monoenergetic ⁷Be line. The ratio of the two is on the order of 10⁻², as the CNO flux in that narrow band is about 1-2% of the ⁷Be line flux.\n\n<<<D>>>"
