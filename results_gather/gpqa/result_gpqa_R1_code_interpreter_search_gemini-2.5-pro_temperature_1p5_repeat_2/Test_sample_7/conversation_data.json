    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Phenotypes of Single Mutants**\nThe goal is to understand the individual contribution of each gene to the resistance pathway. The wild-type (WT) plant has 100% resistance. We can measure the contribution of a gene by the amount of resistance lost when it's knocked out.\n\n*   **Wild-Type (Control):** 100% resistance (baseline).\n*   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. This means the loss of gene G1 causes a 25% drop in resistance (100% - 75%). So, G1 is responsible for about 25% of the plant's resistance.\n*   **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. The loss of gene G2 causes a 100% drop in resistance. This is a critical gene; without it, the entire resistance mechanism fails.\n*   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. The loss of gene G3 causes a 50% drop in resistance (100% - 50%). So, G3 is responsible for about 50% of the plant's resistance.\n\n**2. Analyze the Role of G2 using Double Mutants**\nWe use double mutants to understand how genes interact, specifically to identify epistasis. Epistasis occurs when the effect of one gene masks the effect of another.\n\n*   **g1g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. The phenotype of this double mutant is identical to the phenotype of the g2 single mutant (0% resistance). The severe effect of the g2 mutation completely masks the milder effect of the g1 mutation (75% resistance). Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**.\n*   **g2g3 mutant:** 0% resistance. Similarly, the phenotype of the g2g3 double mutant is identical to the g2 single mutant. The effect of the g2 mutation masks the effect of the g3 mutation (50% resistance). Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G3**.\n\nSince G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and its knockout completely abolishes resistance, it strongly suggests G2 acts \"upstream\" of both G1 and G3. The problem states that at least one gene is an upstream transcription factor. G2 is the prime candidate for this role, as a master transcription factor would be required to activate the entire downstream pathway (which includes G1 and G3).\n\n**3. Analyze the Interaction between G1 and G3**\nNow we look at the g1g3 double mutant to understand the relationship between these two genes.\n\n*   **g1g3 mutant:** 10% resistance.\n*   Let's predict what would happen if G1 and G3 acted independently and their effects were simply additive. The loss from g1 is 25%, and the loss from g3 is 50%. The total expected loss would be 25% + 50% = 75%. The expected remaining resistance would be 100% - 75% = 25%.\n*   However, the observed resistance is only 10%. The observed resistance loss (90%) is much greater than the sum of the individual losses (75%). This phenomenon is called **synergistic epistasis** or a synergistic interaction. It implies that the two genes do not act independently. A common reason for such a strong synergistic effect is **gene redundancy**, where two genes perform similar or overlapping functions. While losing one gene is partially compensated by the other, losing both causes a near-total collapse of their shared function.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options based on the Analysis**\n\nLet's review our main conclusions:\n*   G2 is the most likely upstream transcription factor and is epistatic to G1 and G3.\n*   G1 and G3 interact synergistically, which is well described as gene redundancy.\n\nNow we evaluate each option:\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n    *   `G1 and G3 show pleiotropy`: Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. We only have data on one trait (resistance), so we cannot conclude this.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: Incorrect. For G1 to be epistatic, the g1g3 phenotype (10%) should be the same as the g1 phenotype (75%).\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n    *   `G1 and G3 has the same promoter`: This is a specific molecular mechanism we cannot confirm from phenotypic data alone.\n    *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: Incorrect. For G3 to be epistatic, the g1g3 phenotype (10%) should be the same as the g3 phenotype (50%).\n\n*   **C) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G1 is a transcription factor`: Incorrect. G2 is the much stronger candidate due to its 0% resistance phenotype.\n    *   `G2 is epistatic towards G1`: This part is correct, as shown in step 2. However, the first premise is wrong.\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct. This fits the data perfectly.\n    *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: Correct. This is the best explanation for the strong synergistic interaction observed in the g1g3 double mutant.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: This statement, by the classic definition, is incorrect. However, this option contains two strongly supported, correct conclusions.\n\n**Conclusion**\nOption D provides the two most accurate descriptions of the gene interactions based on the experimental data: that G2 is the likely transcription factor and that G1 and G3 exhibit redundancy. While the third clause about epistasis between G1 and G3 is technically incorrect based on the standard definition, Option D is by far the best and most comprehensive conclusion among the choices provided. The flaw in the third clause is likely an error in the question's construction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
