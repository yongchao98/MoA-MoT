    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material (Substrate):**\n    *   The substrate is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n    *   Let's break down the name:\n        *   `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`: This describes a cyclohexane ring (6 carbons) fused with a three-membered ring containing an oxygen atom, which is an epoxide. The bridging atom is Oxygen (atom 7), and it connects carbons 1 and 6 of the cyclohexane ring. The `[4.1.0]` nomenclature implies a cis-fusion of the epoxide to the cyclohexane ring.\n        *   `1,3,4-trimethyl`: There are three methyl groups attached to the cyclohexane ring at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n        *   `(1R,3R,4R,6S)`: This defines the absolute stereochemistry at the four chiral centers (C1, C3, C4, C6).\n\n2.  **Visualize the Structure of the Substrate:**\n    *   We can draw a planar representation of the cyclohexane ring and use wedges (bonds coming out of the plane) and dashes (bonds going into the plane) to represent the 3D structure.\n    *   The cis-fused epoxide means the C1-O and C6-O bonds are on the same side of the ring. Let's assume they are \"up\" (wedged).\n    *   We can determine the orientation of the substituents from the given R/S configurations.\n        *   At **C1 (1R)**: The substituents are -O- (part of epoxide), -C6, -C2, and a methyl group. The Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority order is O > C6 > C2 > Me. For the configuration to be (R), the lowest priority group (Me) must be wedged (cis to the epoxide).\n        *   At **C6 (6S)**: The substituents are -O-, -C1, -C5, and -H. The CIP priority order is O > C1 > C5 > H. For the configuration to be (S), the lowest priority group (H) must be dashed (trans to the epoxide).\n        *   At **C3 (3R)**: The substituents are -C2, -C4, -Me, and -H. The methyl group must be wedged for a (3R) configuration.\n        *   At **C4 (4R)**: The substituents are -C3, -C5, -Me, and -H. The methyl group must be wedged for a (4R) configuration.\n    *   **Key structural feature for the reaction:** The epoxide has two carbons, C1 and C6. C1 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group). C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and H).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reagent and Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi is lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of the soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n    *   **Reaction:** Organocuprates react with epoxides via an SN2-type mechanism.\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** The problem states that the nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n        *   Comparing the two epoxide carbons, C1 and C6:\n            *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group.\n            *   C6 is substituted with a hydrogen atom.\n        *   Therefore, **C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon**. The nucleophilic attack will occur at C6.\n    *   **Stereoselectivity:** The attack occurs with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. This is a backside attack, meaning the nucleophile approaches from the side opposite to the C-O bond.\n\n4.  **Predict the Product Structure:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Attack):** The Me⁻ nucleophile attacks C6. Since the C6-O bond is wedged (\"up\"), the attack occurs from the dashed (\"down\") side.\n    *   **Step 2 (Bond Breaking):** The C6-O bond breaks, and the electrons move to the oxygen atom, forming a lithium alkoxide at C1.\n    *   **Step 3 (Stereochemical outcome):**\n        *   A new C-Me bond is formed at C6. This new methyl group will be **dashed**.\n        *   The configuration at C6 inverts. The original H atom at C6 was dashed; it will now be **wedged**.\n        *   The stereocenters at C1, C3, and C4 are not involved in the reaction, so their configurations are retained.\n    *   **Step 4 (Workup):** The reaction is followed by a workup (e.g., adding water or dilute acid) that protonates the alkoxide, yielding a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1.\n\n5.  **Determine the IUPAC Name and Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   **Connectivity:** The product is a cyclohexanol. It has a hydroxyl group at C1 (original). It has methyl groups at C1 (original), C3 (original), C4 (original), and a new one at C6 (original). Thus, it is a tetramethylcyclohexanol.\n    *   **Numbering:** According to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the primary functional group (-OH) is designated as C1. This corresponds to the original C1. To give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants, we number the ring counter-clockwise from C1.\n        *   Product C1 ← Original C1 (has -OH and -Me)\n        *   Product C2 ← Original C6 (has new -Me)\n        *   Product C3 ← Original C5\n        *   Product C4 ← Original C4 (has -Me)\n        *   Product C5 ← Original C3 (has -Me)\n        *   Product C6 ← Original C2\n    *   The methyl groups are at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and C.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** We need to find the configuration at the chiral centers C1, C2, C4, and C5 of the product.\n        *   **At C1:** The configuration is retained from the starting material. Original C1 was (R). So, product C1 is **(1R)**.\n        *   **At C2:** This was original C6. It started as (6S) and underwent inversion. We must determine the new R/S designation.\n            *   Starting C6: (S). O(wedged), H(dashed).\n            *   Product C2: Me(dashed), H(wedged).\n            *   Priorities: C1 > C3 > Me > H.\n            *   The lowest priority group, H, is wedged (in front). We determine the configuration from the remaining groups (C1→C3→Me) and reverse it. The sequence C1→C3→Me is clockwise (R). Reversing it gives **(2S)**.\n        *   **At C4:** This was original C4. The configuration is retained. It was (4R). So, product C4 is **(4R)**.\n        *   **At C5:** This was original C3. The configuration is retained. It was (3R). We must check the R/S designation with the new numbering and priorities.\n            *   Priorities at C5 (orig C3): C4(prod) > C6(prod) > Me > H.\n            *   The original C3-Me was wedged, and C3-H was dashed. H is in the back.\n            *   The sequence C4→C6→Me is clockwise, so the configuration is **(5R)**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
