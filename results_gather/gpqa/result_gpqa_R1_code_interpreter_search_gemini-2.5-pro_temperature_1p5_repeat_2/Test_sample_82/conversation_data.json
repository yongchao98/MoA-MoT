    "This problem requires a two-part calculation for a titration process.\n\n**Part 1: pH at 25% Titration**\n\n1.  **Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n    *   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M1) = 0.05 M\n    *   Initial volume of acetic acid (V1) = 20.00 cm³\n    *   Final volume after adding water (V2) = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n    *   Using the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2:\n        (0.05 M) * (20.00 cm³) = M2 * (40.00 cm³)\n        M2 = (0.05 * 20.00) / 40.00 = 0.025 M.\n    *   The concentration of the acetic acid solution to be titrated is 0.025 M.\n\n2.  **Apply the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the buffer region.**\n    *   The reaction is CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O.\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻). This means 75% of the acetic acid remains.\n    *   The ratio of the concentrations [A⁻]/[HA] is therefore 25/75 = 1/3.\n    *   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]).\n    *   First, calculate pKa from the given Ka:\n        pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n    *   Now, calculate the pH:\n        pH = pKa + log(1/3) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) - log(3)\n\n**Part 2: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n1.  **Determine the conditions at the equivalence point.**\n    *   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form sodium acetate (NaCH₃COO).

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for the solution:\n\n**Part 1: pH at 25% Titration**\n\n1.  **Calculate the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n    The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³ and its concentration is 0.05 M. It is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n    *   Initial Moles of Acetic Acid (HA): `moles = M * V = 0.05 M * 0.020 L = 0.001 mol`\n    *   Total Volume after dilution: `V_total = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.040 L`\n    *   Concentration of Acetic Acid after dilution: `[HA] = moles / V_total = 0.001 mol / 0.040 L = 0.025 M`\n\n2.  **Determine the state of the solution at 25% titration.**\n    At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with the NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This means 75% of the acetic acid remains unreacted. The solution now acts as a buffer.\n    The reaction is: `CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O`\n    *   The ratio of the concentration of the conjugate base ([A⁻]) to the acid ([HA]) is `[A⁻]/[HA] = 25% / 75% = 1/3`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.**\n    The pH of a buffer solution can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    `pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])`\n    *   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n        `pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733`\n    *   Now, calculate the pH:\n        `pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256`\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n**Part 2: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n1.  **Determine the conditions at the equivalence point.**\n    At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. The solution now contains only sodium acetate (the conjugate base).\n    *   Moles of acetic acid to be titrated: `0.001 mol` (from Part 1).\n    *   At equivalence, `moles of NaOH added = moles of acetic acid = 0.001 mol`.\n    *   Volume of 0.1 M NaOH added: `V = moles / M = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³`.\n    *   Total volume of the solution at the equivalence point: `V_final = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L`.\n    *   Moles of acetate (A⁻) formed = `0.001 mol`.\n    *   Concentration of acetate: `[A⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the pH of the weak base solution.**\n    The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water, producing hydroxide ions (OH⁻), making the solution basic.\n    Reaction: `CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻`\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for the acetate ion, which can be found from the acid dissociation constant (Ka) and the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴).\n        `Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰`\n    *   Now, we set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis, but we can use the approximation `[OH⁻] = √(Kb * [A⁻])` because Kb is very small.\n        `[OH⁻] = √(5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ * 0.02) = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M`\n    *   Calculate the pOH:\n        `pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483`\n    *   Finally, calculate the pH:\n        `pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517`\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH = 4.26 at 25% titration and pH = 8.52 at the equivalence point.\n\n<<<A>>>"
