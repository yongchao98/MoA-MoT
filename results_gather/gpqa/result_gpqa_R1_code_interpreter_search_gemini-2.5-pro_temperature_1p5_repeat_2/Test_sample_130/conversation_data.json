    "*   **Step 1: Identify the reactants.**\n    *   **The Dienophile:** We start with a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. Dehydration of this acid yields an anhydride.\n        *   The anhydride's 1H NMR spectrum shows a single peak at 7.0 ppm. This indicates that all protons in the molecule are chemically equivalent. A chemical shift of 7.0 ppm is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond). The fact that they are equivalent suggests a high degree of symmetry.\n        *   The anhydride's 13C NMR spectrum shows two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon region) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon region). This indicates there are only two types of carbon atoms.\n        *   The only structure that fits all this data is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed by dehydrating maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). It has two equivalent vinylic protons (which give the singlet at ~7 ppm) and two types of carbons: two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons.\n    *   **The Diene:** The problem states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n        *   This is a five-membered ring with two conjugated double bonds (a cyclopentadiene core).\n        *   Methyl groups are attached to all four carbons involved in the double bonds (positions 1, 2, 3, and 4).\n        *   The fifth carbon of the ring is a CH2 group.\n        *   The structure is symmetrical.\n\n*   **Step 2: The Reaction and Products.**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n    *   This [4+2] cycloaddition typically produces two stereoisomeric products: the ***endo*** adduct and the ***exo*** adduct.\n    *   According to the Alder-endo rule, the *endo* product is formed faster and is usually the **major product** under kinetic control. The *exo* product is more thermodynamically stable and would be the minor product.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C13H16O3, which is consistent with the sum of the reactants' formulas (Diene C9H14 + Dienophile C4H2O3 = C13H16O3).\n    *   Both the *endo* and *exo* products are bicyclic compounds (specifically, they are derivatives of bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene). Both products possess a plane of symmetry, making them achiral (meso compounds).\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of the Products.**\n    *   Due to the plane of symmetry in both products, the number of distinct proton signals is reduced. We expect four signals:\n        1.  **H_anhydride:** The two protons on the part of the structure derived from maleic anhydride. They are equivalent. Expected signal: a **2H singlet**. Based on similar structures, their chemical shift should be downfield, around **~3.5 ppm**.\n        2.  **Me_alkene:** The two methyl groups attached to the double bond of the bicyclic system. They are equivalent. Expected signal: a **6H singlet**. Their chemical shift should be typical for vinylic methyls, around **~1.7 ppm**.\n        3.  **Me_bridgehead:** The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons. They are equivalent. Expected signal: a **6H singlet**. They are on quaternary saturated carbons and should be relatively upfield, around ~1.0 ppm.\n        4.  **CH2_bridge:** The two protons of the CH2 bridge. They are enantiotopic due to the plane of symmetry and thus are NMR-equivalent. Expected signal: a **2H singlet**, likely between 1.5-2.0 ppm.\n\n*   **Step 4: Interpret the NOESY Spectrum.**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Ã…), regardless of whether they are connected by bonds.\n    *   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product. This must be due to a difference in spatial proximity between the *endo* (major) and *exo* (minor) isomers.\n    *   Let's visualize the stereochemistry:\n        *   In the ***endo*** **(major) product**, the anhydride ring is tucked *under* the newly formed six-membered ring, on the same side as the C7-CH2 bridge. In this orientation, the `H_anhydride` protons are brought into close proximity with the methyl groups on the double bond (`Me_alkene`).\n        *   In the ***exo*** **(minor) product**, the anhydride ring points *away* from the C7-CH2 bridge. In this orientation, the `H_anhydride` protons are far from the `Me_alkene` groups.\n    *   Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak that is strong in the major product and weak/absent in the minor product must be the one connecting the `H_anhydride` protons and the `Me_alkene` protons.\n\n*   **Step 5: Match the Resonances to the Options.**\n    *   The key NOE is between the `H_anhydride` protons (a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) and the `Me_alkene` protons (a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm).\n    *   Let's examine the choices:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm - Incorrect signal types and resonances.\n        *   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - Incorrect signal type.\n        *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm - This would be an NOE between `Me_bridgehead` and `Me_alkene`. This proximity exists in both isomers, so it wouldn't be the differentiating peak.\n        *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - This corresponds exactly to the `Me_alkene` and `H_anhydride` protons. The chemical shifts are reasonable, the signal types match our analysis, and this NOE is characteristic of the major (*endo*) product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
