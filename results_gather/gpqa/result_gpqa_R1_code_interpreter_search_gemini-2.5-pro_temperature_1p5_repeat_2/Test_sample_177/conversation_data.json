    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Determine the Mass Dimension of Each Component in the Lagrangian\n\nWe are working in natural units where `ħ = c = 1`. In these units, mass, energy, and inverse length all have the same dimension, which we will denote as `[M]`.\n\n*   **Action (`S`)**: The action `S = ∫ d⁴x L` is a dimensionless quantity. Therefore, its mass dimension is `[S] = [M]⁰`.\n\n*   **Spacetime Volume Element (`d⁴x`)**: Since `x` has the dimension of length, its mass dimension is `[x] = [M]⁻¹`. Consequently, `[d⁴x] = [M]⁻⁴`.\n\n*   **Lagrangian Density (`L`)**: From `[S] = [d⁴x][L] = [M]⁰`, we can deduce the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density `L`.\n    `[M]⁻⁴ [L] = [M]⁰`\n    `[L] = [M]⁴`\n    Any term in the Lagrangian, including our interaction term `L_int`, must have a mass dimension of 4.\n\n*   **Fermion Field (`ψ`)**: The kinetic term for a fermion field is `L_fermion = iψ̄γ^μ∂_μψ`.\n    `[L_fermion] = [M]⁴`\n    The derivative `∂_μ` has a mass dimension `[∂_μ] = [M]¹`.\n    The gamma matrices `γ^μ` are dimensionless.\n    So, `[ψ̄][γ^μ][∂_μ][ψ] = [ψ̄][ψ][∂_μ] = [M]⁴`.\n    Since `[ψ̄] = [ψ]`, we have `[ψ]²[M]¹ = [M]⁴`.\n    `[ψ]² = [M]³`, which gives `[ψ] = [M]^(3/2)`.\n\n*   **Field Strength Tensor (`F^{μν}`)**: The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is `L_EM = -1/4 F_{μν}F^{μν}`.\n    `[L_EM] = [M]⁴`.\n    So, `[F^{μν}]² = [M]⁴`.\n    This implies `[F^{μν}] = [M]²`.\n\n*   **Sigma Matrix (`σ_{μν}`)**: The matrix `σ_{μν} = (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]` is constructed from the gamma matrices `γ_μ` and `γ_ν`, which are dimensionless. Therefore, `σ_{μν}` is also dimensionless: `[σ_{μν}] = [M]⁰`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant `κ`\n\nNow we analyze the given interaction term:\n`L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}`\n\nThe mass dimension of this term must be 4:\n`[L_int] = [κ] [ψ̄] [σ_{μν}] [ψ] [F^{μν}] = [M]⁴`\n\nSubstitute the dimensions we found for each component:\n`[κ] * [M]^(3/2) * [M]⁰ * [M]^(3/2) * [M]² = [M]⁴`\n\nCombine the exponents for `[M]`:\n`[κ] * [M]^(3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2) = [M]⁴`\n`[κ] * [M]^(3 + 2) = [M]⁴`\n`[κ] * [M]⁵ = [M]⁴`\n\nSolve for `[κ]`:\n`[κ] = [M]⁴ / [M]⁵ = [M]⁻¹`\n\nSo, the mass dimension of `κ` is -1.\n\n### 3. Determine if the Theory is Renormalizable\n\nA key criterion for determining if a quantum field theory is renormalizable by power-counting is the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n\n*   If a coupling constant `g` has a **positive** mass dimension (`[g] > 0`), the interaction is called **super-renormalizable**.\n*   If a coupling constant `g` has a **zero** mass dimension (`[g] = 0`), the interaction is called **renormalizable**.\n*   If a coupling constant `g` has a **negative** mass dimension (`[g] < 0`), the interaction is called **non-renormalizable**.\n\nIn our case, the coupling constant `κ` has a mass dimension of -1, which is negative. Interactions with negative mass dimension coupling constants lead to ultraviolet divergences in loop calculations that become progressively worse at higher orders of perturbation theory. These divergences cannot be absorbed by redefining a finite number of parameters, making the theory non-renormalizable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mass dimension of `κ` is -1, and because it is negative, the theory described by this interaction is not renormalizable.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
