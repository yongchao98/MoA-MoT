    "*   **Analysis of the options:**\n\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is our baseline. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. Let's call this density ρ_earth.\n\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is given as ~5.5 g/cm³, which is almost identical to Earth's density.\n\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** A planet's density is determined by its composition and the compression caused by its own gravity. Since this planet has the same composition as Earth but is five times more massive, its internal gravitational pressure will be much higher. This increased pressure will compress the material (rock and iron) to a greater degree, resulting in a higher overall density. Therefore, its density will be significantly greater than Earth's density ( > 5.51 g/cm³).\n\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Following the same logic as in (c), this planet is less massive than Earth. With less mass, there is less gravitational force to compress its materials. Consequently, it will be less dense than Earth (< 5.51 g/cm³).\n\n*   **Comparison:**\n\n    *   Density(a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density(b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   Density(c) > 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density(d) < 5.51 g/cm³\n\n    By comparing the values, it is clear that the planet in option (c) will have the highest density. The intense gravity from its large mass (5 Earth masses) compacts its Earth-like composition into a very dense state.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n\n    The planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times the mass will be the most dense due to gravitational compression.\n\nThe question asks which option has the highest density.\n- a) ~5.51 g/cm³\n- b) ~5.5 g/cm³\n- c) >5.51 g/cm³\n- d) <5.51 g/cm³\n\nTherefore, option (c) describes the planet with the highest density. The corresponding letter for the final answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
