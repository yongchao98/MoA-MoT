    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understanding the problem:**\nThe goal is to compare the magnitude of two energy values:\n*   The energy of the paramagnetic coupling term ($\\langle H \\rangle$), also known as the Zeeman energy splitting, in a magnetic field.\n*   The energy of an atomic transition ($\\Delta E$) in a Hydrogen atom, given the wavelength of the emitted/absorbed photon.\n\n**2. Calculating the transition energy ($\\Delta E$):**\nThe energy of a photon is related to its wavelength ($\\lambda$) by the formula:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\nwhere:\n*   $h$ is Planck's constant.\n*   $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe given wavelength is $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu m = 486.1 \\times 10^{-9} \\, m = 486.1 \\, nm$.\nA convenient formula for calculations in atomic physics is $\\Delta E (eV) = \\frac{1240 \\, eV \\cdot nm}{\\lambda (nm)}$.\n\nUsing this formula:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{1240}{486.1} \\approx 2.55 \\, eV$\n\nThis energy corresponds to the Balmer series transition (n=4 to n=2) in the Hydrogen atom, which is a typical optical transition energy, on the order of a few electron-volts (eV).\n\n**3. Calculating the paramagnetic coupling energy ($\\langle H \\rangle$):**\nThe Hamiltonian for the paramagnetic interaction (the orbital Zeeman effect) is given by:\n$H = - \\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B}$\nwhere $\\vec{\\mu}_L$ is the orbital magnetic moment and $\\vec{B}$ is the external magnetic field.\n\nThe orbital magnetic moment is related to the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ by:\n$\\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L} = -\\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar}\\vec{L}$\nwhere $\\mu_B = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$ is the Bohr magneton.\n\nSubstituting this into the Hamiltonian:\n$H = \\left(-\\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar}\\vec{L}\\right) \\cdot \\vec{B} = \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} \\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nThe problem states that the magnetic field is parallel to the Oz axis, so $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{z}$.\n$H = \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} L_z B$\n\nThe energy contribution is the expectation value of this Hamiltonian. The eigenvalues of the $L_z$ operator are $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Therefore, the energy shift is:\n$\\langle H \\rangle = \\frac{\\mu_B B}{\\hbar} (m\\hbar) = m \\mu_B B$\n\nThe problem provides:\n*   $B = 1 \\, T$\n*   \"small values of m\". We can take $m=1$ to evaluate the order of magnitude of the interaction energy.\n\nThe value of the Bohr magneton is $\\mu_B \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, eV/T$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy:\n$\\langle H \\rangle = (1) \\times (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, eV/T) \\times (1 \\, T) = 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, eV$\n\n**4. Comparing the two energies:**\nWe need to compare the order of magnitude of $\\Delta E$ and $\\langle H \\rangle$.\n\n*   $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\, eV$\n*   $\\langle H \\rangle \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\, eV$\n\nLet's find their ratio:\n$\\frac{\\langle H \\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\, eV}{2.55 \\, eV} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nThis ratio is extremely small ($ \\ll 1$), which clearly shows that the paramagnetic coupling energy is many orders of magnitude smaller than the optical transition energy.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe paramagnetic coupling energy $\\langle H \\rangle$ is on the order of $10^{-5} \\, eV$, while the atomic transition energy $\\Delta E$ is on the order of $1 \\, eV$. Therefore, we can conclude that $\\langle H \\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$. This aligns with the physical reality where Zeeman splitting is a very small perturbation compared to the principal energy levels of an atom.\n\nLet's confirm with a quick python script.\n```python\n# Constants\nh_eVs = 4.135667696e-15  # Planck constant in eV*s\nc_ms = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\nlambda_m = 0.4861e-6  # Wavelength in meters\nmu_B_eVT = 5.7883818012e-5  # Bohr magneton in eV/T\nB_T = 1.0  # Magnetic field in Tesla\nm = 1  # A small integer value for the magnetic quantum number\n\n# Calculate the transition energy Delta E in eV\ndelta_E = (h_eVs * c_ms) / lambda_m\n\n# Calculate the paramagnetic coupling term <H> in eV\nH_coupling = m * mu_B_eVT * B_T\n\nprint(f\"Transition energy Delta E = {delta_E:.4f} eV\")\nprint(f\"Paramagnetic coupling energy <H> = {H_coupling:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"The ratio <H> / Delta E is {H_coupling / delta_E:.4e}\")\n\nif H_coupling < delta_E/100: # Check if H is much smaller than Delta E\n    print(\"Conclusion: <H> << Delta E\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "An analysis of the physical quantities involved leads to the following conclusion:\n\n1.  **Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$) Calculation:**\n    The energy of a photon corresponding to a transition is given by the formula $E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$, where $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\lambda$ is the wavelength.\n    Given:\n    *   $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu m = 4.861 \\times 10^{-7} \\, m$\n    *   $h \\approx 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, J \\cdot s$\n    *   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^{8} \\, m/s$\n    *   $1 \\, eV \\approx 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, J$\n\n    The calculation performed by the Python script gives:\n    $\\Delta E = \\frac{(4.136 \\times 10^{-15} \\, eV \\cdot s)(3 \\times 10^8 \\, m/s)}{4.861 \\times 10^{-7} \\, m} \\approx 2.55 \\, eV$\n\n    This is a typical energy for a transition in the visible spectrum of the Hydrogen atom (specifically, the Balmer series n=4 to n=2).\n\n2.  **Paramagnetic Coupling Energy ($\\langle H \\rangle$) Calculation:**\n    The energy shift due to the interaction of the orbital magnetic moment with an external magnetic field (Zeeman effect) is given by:\n    $\\langle H \\rangle = m \\mu_B B$\n    where $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number, $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton, and $B$ is the magnetic field strength.\n    Given:\n    *   $B = 1 \\, T$\n    *   $m$ is a small integer (we use $m=1$ for the order of magnitude)\n    *   $\\mu_B \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, eV/T$ (Bohr magneton)\n\n    The calculation performed by the Python script gives:\n    $\\langle H \\rangle = 1 \\times (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, eV/T) \\times 1 \\, T \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\, eV$\n\n3.  **Comparison:**\n    We compare the two energy values:\n    *   $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\, eV$\n    *   $\\langle H \\rangle \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\, eV$\n\n    It is clear that the transition energy is many orders of magnitude larger than the paramagnetic coupling energy. The ratio is:\n    $\\frac{\\langle H \\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.79 \\times 10^{-5}}{2.55} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\n    Since the ratio is extremely small, we have $\\langle H \\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$. This means the energy splitting caused by a 1 Tesla magnetic field is a very small perturbation compared to the energy difference between the principal electronic levels of the atom.\n\n<<<C>>>"
