    "The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) in a solution of 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Understand the chemical equilibrium:** The Ca-EDTA complex ($CaY^{2-}$, where $Y^{4-}$ represents the EDTA anion) is formed from the reaction of calcium ions with EDTA.\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons CaY^{2-}$\n    The equilibrium constant for this formation reaction is given as the stability constant, $K_f$ (also written as $K_{Ca-EDTA}$).\n    $K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n2.  **Consider the dissociation of the complex:** Since we start with a solution of the complex, it will slightly dissociate back into its constituent ions. This is the reverse of the formation reaction.\n    $CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:** We can use an ICE table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions that forms from the dissociation of the complex.\n    *   **Reaction:** $CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n    *   **Initial Concentration (M):**\n        *   $[CaY^{2-}] = 0.02$\n        *   $[Ca^{2+}] = 0$\n        *   $[Y^{4-}] = 0$\n    *   **Change in Concentration (M):**\n        *   $[CaY^{2-}] = -x$\n        *   $[Ca^{2+}] = +x$\n        *   $[Y^{4-}] = +x$\n    *   **Equilibrium Concentration (M):**\n        *   $[CaY^{2-}] = 0.02 - x$\n        *   $[Ca^{2+}] = x$\n        *   $[Y^{4-}] = x$\n\n4.  **Use the equilibrium constant expression:** Now, substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression.\n    $K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}$\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Simplify and solve for x:** The formation constant ($K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$) is very large, which means the equilibrium lies far to the right for the formation reaction (or far to the left for the dissociation). This implies that the amount of dissociation, 'x', will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can therefore make the simplifying assumption that $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n    The expression becomes:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n6.  **Calculate x:** Rearrange the equation to solve for $x^2$.\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx 0.4 \\times 10^{-12}$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    Now, take the square root to find x:\n    $x \\approx \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$\n\n    Since we defined 'x' as the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$, we have:\n    $[Ca^{2+}] = x \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n    The calculated value matches option C.\n\nLet's confirm with a quick calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\nK_f = 5e10\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# We need to solve the equation: K_f = (initial_complex_conc - x) / x^2\n# Using the approximation: K_f = initial_complex_conc / x^2\n# x^2 = initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n>>>\n6.32e-07\n\nThe calculation confirms that the concentration of calcium ions is $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, in a solution that initially contains 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n**1. The Dissociation Reaction**\nThe Ca-EDTA complex ($CaY^{2-}$) will dissociate into its constituent ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($Y^{4-}$). The reaction for this equilibrium is:\n$CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n**2. The Formation Constant ($K_f$)**\nThe problem provides the formation constant ($K_{Ca-EDTA}$ or $K_f$), which is the equilibrium constant for the *formation* of the complex:\n$Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons CaY^{2-}$\n$K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n**3. Setting up an ICE Table**\nWe can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the concentrations of the species at equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species     | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|-------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| $CaY^{2-}$    | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$     | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $Y^{4-}$      | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n**4. Solving for x**\nNow, we substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n$K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}$\n$5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\nBecause the formation constant ($K_f$) is extremely large, the equilibrium lies far to the side of the complex. This means the amount of dissociation, 'x', will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make a simplifying assumption:\n$0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n$5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\nNow, we rearrange and solve for x:\n$x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n$x^2 \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n$x^2 \\approx 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n$x \\approx \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n$x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$\n\nSince we defined 'x' as the equilibrium concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}] = x$.\nTherefore, $[Ca^{2+}] \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\nThis result matches option C. The calculation performed by the Python script confirms this value.\n\n<<<C>>>"
