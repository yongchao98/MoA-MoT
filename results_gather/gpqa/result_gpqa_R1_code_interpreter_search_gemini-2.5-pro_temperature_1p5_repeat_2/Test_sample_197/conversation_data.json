    "This problem requires us to calculate the distribution of cobalt(II) species in a solution containing thiocyanate ions (SCN-). We need to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)2], relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical System**\n\nIn the solution, cobalt(II) ions (Co^2+) react with thiocyanate ions (SCN-) to form a series of complexes:\n*   `Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)]^+`\n*   `Co^2+ + 2SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)2]`\n*   `Co^2+ + 3SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)3]^-`\n*   `Co^2+ + 4SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)4]^(2-)`\n\nThe formation of these complexes is described by overall stability constants (βn):\n*   `β1 = [[Co(SCN)]^+] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]) = 9`\n*   `β2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2) = 40`\n*   `β3 = [[Co(SCN)3]^-] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^3) = 63`\n*   `β4 = [[Co(SCN)4]^(2-)] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^4) = 16`\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free ion and all the complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]^+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]^-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^(2-)]`\n\n**2. Formulate the Calculation**\n\nWe need to find the fraction (α2) of the dithiocyanato complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, which is given by:\n`α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\nThe percentage is then `α2 * 100%`.\n\nWe can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co^2+]` and the ligand concentration `[SCN^-]`:\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]^+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)3]^-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^3`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)4]^(2-)] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^4`\n\nNow, substitute these expressions into the equation for `c(Co)`:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN^-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN^-]^4`\n\nFactor out `[Co^2+]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the fraction `α2`:\n`α2 = (β2[Co^2+][SCN^-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4))`\n\nThe `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, simplifying the equation:\n`α2 = (β2[SCN^-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\n**3. Perform the Calculation**\n\nWe are given:\n*   `[SCN^-] = 0.1 M`\n*   `β1 = 9`\n*   `β2 = 40`\n*   `β3 = 63`\n*   `β4 = 16`\n\nLet's calculate each term in the expression:\n*   **Numerator:** `β2 * [SCN^-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n*   **Denominator:**\n    *   `1`\n    *   `β1 * [SCN^-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   `β2 * [SCN^-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 0.4`\n    *   `β3 * [SCN^-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n    *   `β4 * [SCN^-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\n*   **Sum of denominator terms:** `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nNow, calculate the fraction `α2`:\n`α2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo get the percentage, multiply by 100:\n`Percentage = 0.16916 * 100% = 16.916%`\n\nThis value is closest to 16.9%.\n\nTo confirm this, the following python code executes the same calculation.\n```python\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# The numerator is the term for the Co(SCN)2 complex\nnumerator = beta2 * (scn_conc**2)\n\n# The denominator is the sum of the terms for all cobalt species (including free Co2+)\n# The term for free Co2+ is 1\ndenominator = 1 + beta1 * scn_conc + beta2 * (scn_conc**2) + beta3 * (scn_conc**3) + beta4 * (scn_conc**4)\n\n# Calculate the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage:.1f}%\")\n```\n>>>\n16.9%\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The user wants to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, in a solution.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the species involved:**\n    The solution contains a central metal ion, Co(II) (or Co²⁺), and a ligand, thiocyanate (SCN⁻). They react to form a series of complexes. The species in equilibrium are:\n    *   Free Co²⁺ ion\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]⁺` (monothiocyanato cobalt(II))\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₂]` (dithiocyanato cobalt(II))\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻` (trithiocyanato cobalt(II))\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` (tetrathiocyanato cobalt(II))\n\n2.  **Define the relevant equilibria and constants:**\n    The formation of these complexes is described by overall stability constants (β_n):\n    *   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺ ; β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9\n    *   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂] ; β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40\n    *   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ ; β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63\n    *   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ ; β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16\n\n3.  **Define the total concentration:**\n    The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)]⁺ + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n4.  **Formulate the fraction of the desired species:**\n    We want to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`. The fraction of this species (let's call it α₂) is given by:\n    `α₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)`\n    The percentage is `α₂ * 100%`.\n\n5.  **Express all concentrations in terms of a common variable:**\n    We can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co²⁺]`, and the ligand concentration, `[SCN⁻]`.\n    *   `[Co²⁺]`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]⁺ = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻ = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n    Now, substitute these into the expression for `c(Co)`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n    Factor out `[Co²⁺]`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n6.  **Derive the final formula for α₂:**\n    Substitute the expressions for `[Co(SCN)₂]` and `c(Co)` into the formula for `α₂`:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\n    The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, simplifying the equation. The fraction of each species depends only on the free ligand concentration, not the total metal concentration.\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n7.  **Plug in the given values and calculate:**\n    *   `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M` (We assume the ligand concentration is in large excess compared to the metal ion concentration (0.1 M >> 10⁻² M), so the equilibrium concentration of the ligand is approximately its initial concentration).\n    *   `β₁ = 9`\n    *   `β₂ = 40`\n    *   `β₃ = 63`\n    *   `β₄ = 16`\n\n    Let's calculate the terms:\n    *   **Numerator:** `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n    *   **Denominator:**\n        *   `1` (for free Co²⁺)\n        *   `β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n        *   `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n        *   `β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063`\n        *   `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016`\n\n    *   **Sum of denominator:** `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n    *   **Calculate α₂:** `α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n    *   **Calculate percentage:** `0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis matches option A.
