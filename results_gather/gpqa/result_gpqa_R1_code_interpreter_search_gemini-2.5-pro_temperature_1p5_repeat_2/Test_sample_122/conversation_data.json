    "This problem requires applying the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n**1. Identify the reference frames:**\n*   **Frame S:** The reference frame of the Galaxy (assumed to be stationary).\n*   **Frame S':** The reference frame of the supernova ejecta (which is moving).\n\n**2. Identify the given values:**\n*   **Relative velocity (v):** The speed of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is 60,000 km/s.\n*   **Proper time (Δt'):** The time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame (S') is 50 seconds. This is the \"proper time\" because it's measured by a clock that is at rest in the moving frame S'.\n*   **Speed of light (c):** Approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n**3. Determine the goal:**\n*   Calculate the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame (S). To do this, we first need to find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt), and then use the formula: `distance = velocity × time`.\n\n**4. Apply the Time Dilation formula:**\nThe time measured in the stationary frame (S) is related to the proper time measured in the moving frame (S') by the Lorentz factor (γ).\nThe formula for time dilation is:\nΔt = γ * Δt'\n\nwhere the Lorentz factor γ is defined as:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\n**5. Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n*   First, calculate the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n    v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n*   Next, square this ratio:\n    (v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04\n*   Now, calculate γ:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)\n\n**6. Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt):**\n*   Using the time dilation formula:\n    Δt = Δt' / √(0.96)\n    Δt = 50 s / √(0.96)\n\n**7. Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame:**\n*   The distance (d) is the velocity (v) multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).\n    d = v * Δt\n    d = 60,000 km/s * (50 s / √(0.96))\n    d = 3,000,000 km / √(0.96)\n\nTo get the final numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nv = 60000  # km/s\nt_prime = 50  # s\nc = 300000 # km/s\n\n# Calculate the numerator of the distance formula: v * t'\nnumerator = v * t_prime\n\n# Calculate the denominator: sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\nv_c_ratio_sq = (v / c)**2\ndenominator = math.sqrt(1 - v_c_ratio_sq)\n\n# Calculate the distance\ndistance = numerator / denominator\n\nprint(f\"{distance:.0f} km\")\n```\n\nThe calculation yields approximately 3,061,862 km. Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) 3,060,000 km\nB) 2,880,000 km\nC) 3,000,000 km\nD) 2,940,000 km\n\nThe calculated value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   We have two inertial reference frames.\n    *   **Frame S (The Galaxy):** We consider this our \"stationary\" frame of reference.\n    *   **Frame S' (The Ejecta):** This is the \"moving\" frame of reference, traveling at a high velocity relative to the Galaxy.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   **Relative velocity (v):** The speed of the ejecta (S') relative to the Galaxy (S) is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   **Time in the moving frame (Δt'):** The time that passes in the ejecta's frame is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is known as the **proper time** because it's measured by a clock that is at rest within its own frame (the ejecta).\n    *   **Speed of light (c):** We'll use the standard value, `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n    *   The formula for distance is `distance = velocity × time`.\n    *   In our case, the distance in frame S will be `d = v × Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (S), not the ejecta's frame.\n\n4.  **Apply the Principle of Time Dilation:**\n    *   According to special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object (the ejecta). This means the time `Δt` measured in the Galaxy's frame will be longer than the time `Δt'` measured in the ejecta's frame.\n    *   The relationship is given by the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    *   Here, `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n\n    *   **Step 5a: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n        *   First, find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n            `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n        *   Next, square this ratio:\n            `(v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n        *   Now, calculate γ:\n            `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n\n    *   **Step 5b: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).**\n        *   `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s`\n        *   `Δt = 50 / √(0.96) s`\n\n    *   **Step 5c: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (d).**\n        *   `d = v * Δt`\n        *   `d = 60,000 km/s * (50 / √(0.96)) s`\n        *   `d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) km`\n\n6.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    *   We can use a calculator or the provided python script to find the numerical value.\n    *   `√(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`\n    *   `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The calculated distance is approximately `3,061,862 km`.\n    *   Looking at the choices:\n        A) 3,060,000 km\n        B) 2,880,000 km\n        C) 3,000,000 km (This would be the incorrect, non-relativistic answer)\n        D) 2,940,000 km\n    *   The calculated value is extremely close to option A. The minor difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's options.\n\n<<<A>>>"
