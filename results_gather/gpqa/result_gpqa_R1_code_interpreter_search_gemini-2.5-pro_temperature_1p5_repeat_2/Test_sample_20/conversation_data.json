    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n1.  **Understanding Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where structures can interconvert rapidly, usually by the migration of a hydrogen atom (a proton) and a shift of a double bond. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a ketone or aldehyde to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O). This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen, and the carbon is the alpha-carbon.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups on carbons 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are -CH2- groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The hydrogen atoms on carbons 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-hydrogens because they are attached to carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups. In fact, these alpha-hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are positioned between two carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Tautomerization:** Due to the presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily undergoes tautomerization. It can lose protons and rearrange its double bonds to form its enol tautomer, which is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (also known as phloroglucinol). This enol form is aromatic and therefore exceptionally stable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show extensive tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Benzoquinone (specifically, p-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It's a six-membered ring containing two C=C double bonds and two C=O groups opposite each other (at positions 1 and 4).\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons do not have any hydrogen atoms attached that fit the typical requirement for keto-enol tautomerism (i.e., hydrogens on an sp³ hybridized alpha-carbon).\n    *   **Tautomerization:** The conversion of benzoquinone to its corresponding 'enol', hydroquinone (1,4-dihydroxybenzene), is a reduction reaction (it requires the addition of two electrons and two protons), not a simple tautomeric equilibrium. Therefore, benzoquinone is not considered to exhibit tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does *not* show tautomerism.\n\n**Therefore, compound (A) is benzoquinone.**\n\n---\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Understanding Optical Isomerism:** A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (also known as methyl lactate):**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the carbon bonded to the -OH group).\n        *   Group 1: -H (hydrogen)\n        *   Group 2: -OH (hydroxyl)\n        *   Group 3: -CH₃ (methyl)\n        *   Group 4: -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and will exhibit optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers, R and S).\n\n3.  **Analyzing Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the trans isomer of an alkene with methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃) on each side of the double bond.\n        H₃COOC     H\n               \\   /\n                C=C\n               /   \\\n              H     COOCH₃\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar. Planar molecules have a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and are therefore achiral. It also has a center of inversion (the midpoint of the C=C bond). A molecule with a center of inversion is always achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does *not* show optical isomerism.\n\n**Therefore, compound (B) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.**\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
