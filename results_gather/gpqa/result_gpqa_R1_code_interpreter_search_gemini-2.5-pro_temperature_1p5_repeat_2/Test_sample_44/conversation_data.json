    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the System**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Since they have half-integer spin, they are fermions.\n*   **Potential Well:** They are confined in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n*   **Key Principle:** Because the particles are identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\n*   First, let's recall the energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well. The energy for a given quantum number *n* (where n = 1, 2, 3, ...) is:\n    E_n = (n^2 * π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2)\n*   The problem defines a base energy unit E = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2).\n*   So, we can express the single-particle energy levels in terms of E:\n    E_n = n^2 * E\n*   The first few energy levels are:\n    *   E_1 = 1^2 * E = 1E\n    *   E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E\n    *   E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E\n    *   E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E\n    *   ...and so on.\n\n**3. Applying the Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\n*   A quantum state for a particle in this well is defined by its energy level (*n*) and its spin state (spin up, m_s = +1/2, or spin down, m_s = -1/2).\n*   The Pauli Exclusion Principle means that each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**4. Calculating the Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\n\n*   To find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy E_1 = 1E):** We can place two particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   **Level n=2 (Energy E_2 = 4E):** We have two particles left, so we place them in the next lowest level (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   **Total Ground State Energy:**\n    E_ground = (2 particles * E_1) + (2 particles * E_2)\n    E_ground = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E\n\n**5. Calculating the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\n*   To get the first excited state, we must move one particle from the ground state configuration to the next available higher energy level. This corresponds to the lowest possible energy increase.\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2.\n*   **Excitation:** The smallest energy jump is to promote one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n*   **First Excited State Configuration:**\n    *   Level n=1: 2 particles\n    *   Level n=2: 1 particle\n    *   Level n=3: 1 particle\n*   **Total First Excited State Energy:**\n    E_1st = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)\n    E_1st = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E\n\n**6. Calculating the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\n*   The second excited state is the state with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider all possible single-particle promotions from the ground state and find the one with the second-smallest energy increase.\n*   **From Ground State (Total Energy = 10E):**\n    *   **Promotion 1 (First Excitation):** Move a particle from n=2 to n=3.\n        *   Energy Increase: E_3 - E_2 = 9E - 4E = 5E.\n        *   Total Energy: 10E + 5E = 15E.\n    *   **Promotion 2 (Second Excitation):** Move a particle from n=1 to n=3.\n        *   Energy Increase: E_3 - E_1 = 9E - 1E = 8E.\n        *   Total Energy: 10E + 8E = 18E.\n    *   **Other promotions** would have higher energy costs (e.g., n=2 to n=4 has an increase of E_4 - E_2 = 16E - 4E = 12E).\n*   The lowest energy excitation gives the first excited state (15E). The second-lowest energy excitation gives the second excited state (18E).\n*   **Second Excited State Configuration:**\n    *   Level n=1: 1 particle\n    *   Level n=2: 2 particles\n    *   Level n=3: 1 particle\n*   **Total Second Excited State Energy:**\n    E_2nd = (1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)\n    E_2nd = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E\n\n**Summary of Energies:**\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis sequence matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
