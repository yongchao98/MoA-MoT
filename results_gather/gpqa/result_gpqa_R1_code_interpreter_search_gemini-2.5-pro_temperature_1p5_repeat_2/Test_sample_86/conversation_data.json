    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Molecular Formula and Functional Groups from the Clues:**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituent groups attached.\n*   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents together must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR ... carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O functional group.\n*   **\"FTIR ... aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means one substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) bonded directly to the aromatic ring. Let's denote it as '-X'.\n\n**2. Assemble the Molecular Structure:**\n\n*   We have two substituents on a benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a halogen, -X. This substituent contains 0 carbon atoms.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms AND the carbonyl group.\n*   Let's consider possible structures for a 2-carbon substituent containing a carbonyl group:\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This has 2 carbons and a C=O. This is a very common substituent.\n    *   **Carboxylic acid group (-CH2COOH):** This has 2 carbons and a C=O, but would also have a very characteristic broad singlet for the acidic -OH proton, typically above 10 ppm. None of the options show this.\n    *   **Acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO):** This has 2 carbons and a C=O (aldehyde). This is also a possibility.\n\n*   Let's evaluate the two most likely structures:\n    *   **Structure 1: Halo-acetophenone.** A halogen and an acetyl group on a benzene ring. The formula would be X-C6H5-COCH3. This has 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8 carbons. It fits all the criteria.\n    *   **Structure 2: (Halo-phenyl)acetaldehyde.** A halogen and a -CH2CHO group on a benzene ring. The formula is X-C6H5-CH2CHO. This has 6 (ring) + 2 (substituent) = 8 carbons. It also fits all the criteria.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Potential Structure and Compare with Options:**\n\nTo have a simple, clean NMR spectrum with doublets in the aromatic region, the most likely substitution pattern is **para (1,4)**. This symmetry results in only two types of aromatic protons.\n\n*   **Prediction for para-halo-acetophenone (Structure 1):**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (C6H4):** In a para-substituted ring, there are two sets of equivalent protons. We expect two signals, each integrating to 2H. Due to coupling with their ortho neighbors, each signal should be a **doublet (d)**. The protons next to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group will be shifted further downfield (higher ppm) than those next to the halogen. So we expect: `~7.5-8.0 ppm (2H, d)` and `~7.4-7.8 ppm (2H, d)`.\n    *   **Acetyl Protons (-COCH3):** The three protons on the methyl group are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with. We expect one signal, integrating to 3H, as a **singlet (s)**. The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone is around **2.1-2.6 ppm**.\n    *   **Summary for Structure 1:** Two doublets in the aromatic region (each 2H) and one singlet in the alkyl region (3H).\n\n*   **Prediction for para-(halo-phenyl)acetaldehyde (Structure 2):**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (C6H4):** Similar to above, we expect two **doublets (d)**, each integrating to 2H in the aromatic region (`~7.0-7.5 ppm`).\n    *   **Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** The single proton of the aldehyde group is unique. It has a very characteristic chemical shift, typically **9.5-10.1 ppm**. It is adjacent to the -CH2- group, so it should be split into a **triplet (t)** by the two CH2 protons (n+1 rule, 2+1=3). We expect: `~9.7 ppm (1H, t)`.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (-CH2-):** The two protons of the methylene group are adjacent to the aldehyde proton. They will be split into a **doublet (d)** by the single aldehyde proton (n+1 rule, 1+1=2). The chemical shift would be around **3.5-4.0 ppm**. We expect: `~3.7 ppm (2H, d)`.\n    *   **Summary for Structure 2:** Two doublets (aromatic), one triplet (aldehyde), and one doublet (methylene).\n\n**4. Analyze the Given NMR Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ... 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**: The signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are not in the typical aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ... 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**: This option corresponds to Structure 2, the acetaldehyde derivative. It has the correct chemical shifts for the aldehyde proton (`9.9 ppm`), methylene protons (`3.7 ppm`), and aromatic protons (`7.8`, `7.6 ppm`). **However, the splitting is wrong.** The aldehyde proton should be a triplet, not a singlet, and the methylene protons should be a doublet, not a singlet, due to mutual coupling. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n*   **C) 1H NMR: ... 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**: Similar to A, the chemical shifts are not characteristic of an aromatic compound of this type. The integration and splitting are also unusual. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ... 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**: This data perfectly matches our prediction for **para-halo-acetophenone (Structure 1)**.\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: Two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2H. This signifies a para-substituted ring.\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: A singlet for 3H at a chemical shift characteristic of an acetyl methyl group.\n    \nAll aspects (chemical shifts, integration, and splitting) of this option are consistent with the proposed structure of para-halo-acetophenone, which fulfills all the conditions given in the problem statement.\n\n<<<D>>>"
