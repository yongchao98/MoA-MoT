    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Provided Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** Indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). An ester group contains one carbonyl (C=O) and one C-O bond. It has a molecular formula fragment of -CO2-.\n*   **General Structure:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring with two other groups attached to it. The core of this ring is C6H4.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Six signals total:** This indicates six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has 4 aromatic protons. The fact that they appear as two signals suggests a substitution pattern like ortho (1,2-disubstituted) or para (1,4-disubstituted). In either case, we have a C6H4 group.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a classic and very informative splitting pattern. It strongly suggests the presence of a propenyl group, specifically `-CH=CH-CH3`.\n        *   Let's label the protons: -CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n        *   Proton H(b) is split by the adjacent H(a) (giving a doublet) and the three protons of the -CH3 group (giving a quartet). The combination results in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   Proton H(a) is split only by the adjacent H(b), resulting in a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   This confirms the presence of a `-CH=CH-CH3` fragment, which has a formula of C3H5.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** One of these methyl signals belongs to the `-CH=CH-CH3` group we just identified. Therefore, there must be a second, distinct `-CH3` group elsewhere in the molecule.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of negative evidence. The final structure cannot contain any methylene (-CH2-) groups.\n\n**2. Assemble the Molecular Fragments**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we have the following pieces of the molecule:\n*   A di-substituted benzene ring: `C6H4`\n*   An ester group: `-COO-`\n*   A propenyl group: `-CH=CH-CH3`\n*   A methyl group: `-CH3`\n\nNow, we must assemble these fragments into a valid chemical structure that is consistent with all the data. The ester group must link two parts of the molecule. There are two primary ways the benzene ring can be part of an ester:\n\n*   **Case A: Methyl Benzoate derivative:** The ring is attached to the carbonyl part of the ester (`C6H4-COO-R`). The two substituents on the ring would be the propenyl group and the ester group itself. R would be the remaining fragment, which is a methyl group (`-CH3`). However, the NMR specifies *two* -CH3 signals, one from the propenyl group and one other. This would only provide one -CH3 signal from the propenyl group and one from the ester's methyl group, which seems to fit. Let's reconsider. The question says there are two signals corresponding to `-CH3` groups. Our fragments are C6H4, COO, -CH=CH-CH3, and -CH3. It seems more likely the two substituents on the ring are -CH3 and something else.\n\nLet's try a different assembly. The two substituents on the C6H4 ring are a methyl group (`-CH3`) and the ester group.\n\n*   **Structure Possibility 1: Propenyl methylbenzoate**\n    *   Let's place the `-CH3` group and the ester group onto the benzene ring. This gives a `CH3-C6H4-COO-` fragment.\n    *   The remaining fragment is the propenyl group, `-CH=CH-CH3`. This group must be attached to the oxygen of the ester.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `CH3-C6H4-COO-CH=CH-CH3`.\n    *   This structure fits all the NMR data: two aromatic signals (possible for ortho/para), vinyl signals for `-O-CH=CH-CH3`, two distinct -CH3 signals (one on the ring, one on the vinyl group), and no -CH2 groups.\n\n*   **Structure Possibility 2: Methyl propenylbenzoate**\n    *   Let's place the `-CH=CH-CH3` group and the ester group onto the ring. This gives a `(CH3-CH=CH)-C6H4-COO-` fragment.\n    *   The remaining fragment is the methyl group, `-CH3`. This must be attached to the ester oxygen.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `(CH3-CH=CH)-C6H4-COOCH3`.\n    *   This structure also fits all the NMR data: two aromatic signals, vinyl signals for `Ar-CH=CH-CH3`, two distinct -CH3 signals (one on the vinyl group, one from the methyl ester), and no -CH2 groups.\n\n**3. Calculate the Chemical Formula**\n\nBoth plausible structures are isomers and should have the same chemical formula. Let's calculate it for the first structure (`CH3-C6H4-COO-CH=CH-CH3`):\n*   **Carbons (C):** 1 (from methyl on ring) + 6 (from ring) + 1 (from ester C=O) + 3 (from propenyl group) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 3 (from methyl on ring) + 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl group) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from ester group) = **2**\n\nThe chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\n*   **A) C11H12O2:** This matches our derived formula.\n*   **B) C12H12O2:** This would require adding a carbon atom without changing the hydrogen count, which is not possible with simple organic groups. It would disrupt the structure that fits the NMR data.\n*   **C) C12H14O2:** To get this formula from C11H12O2, one must add a `CH2` group. The problem statement explicitly says there are no signals for `-CH2` groups. This option is incorrect.\n*   **D) C11H14O2:** This formula has two more hydrogens than our derived structure. To add two hydrogens, we would need to remove a double bond. However, the NMR data clearly shows a `C=C` double bond (vinyl protons). This option contradicts the NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that perfectly aligns with all the provided spectroscopic evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
