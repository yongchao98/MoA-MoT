    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the optical activity of each compound. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters without any internal elements of symmetry (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** ClHC=C(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃). This is an alkene.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar about the C=C double bond. This plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral. There are no stereocenters.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex polycyclic molecule. The name itself provides the key information.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The name specifies a single, distinct stereoisomer with the configurations (3aR, 7aS) at two stereocenters and (E) at a double bond. When a specific enantiomer (indicated by R/S descriptors) is named, it implies the compound is chiral and has been resolved from its mirror image. Such a complex structure is highly unlikely to possess the symmetry required to be a meso compound. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. This molecule has two stereocenters, at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is symmetric, as the groups attached to C2 are identical to the groups attached to C3 (H, CH₃, COOH). We need to check if the (2R,3S) configuration leads to a meso compound. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry. For a molecule with two equivalent stereocenters, the (R,S) isomer is a meso compound. This molecule has a center of inversion midway along the C2-C3 bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a meso compound. Optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. This is a diastereomer of the previous compound.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Both stereocenters have the same configuration (R,R). This molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is chiral, and its mirror image is the (2S,3S) compound. A specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring containing a double bond (between C3 and C4) and an alcohol group (at C1).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the -CH=CH-CH₂- path around the ring, and (4) the -CH₂-CH₂-CH= path around the ring. These two paths are different, so C1 is a stereocenter. The molecule as a whole lacks any element of symmetry. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The nomenclature `1s,3s,5s` indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all `cis`).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** This is a highly symmetric molecule. Although C1, C3, and C5 are stereocenters, the molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through the C1-OH bond and the C4 atom acts as a mirror plane, reflecting C2 onto C6 and C3 onto C5. Since C3 and C5 have identical substituents in the same orientation, the molecule is symmetrical with respect to this plane. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** (CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-(Cyclopentyl).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** We need to check for any stereocenters or overall molecular chirality. There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The isobutyl group `((CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-)` is not chiral. The cyclopentyl ring attached to the carbonyl group is also not chiral, as the two paths around the ring from the point of attachment are identical. The molecule as a whole possesses a plane of symmetry that includes the carbonyl group and bisects both the isobutyl group and the cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Inactive: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n*   **Active**: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   Inactive: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   **Active**: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   **Active**: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   Inactive: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n*   Inactive: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nCounting the optically active compounds, we find there are 3.\n\n<<<A>>>"
