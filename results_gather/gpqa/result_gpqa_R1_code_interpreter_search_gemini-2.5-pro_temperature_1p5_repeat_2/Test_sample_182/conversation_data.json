    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the reactant molecule.**\n    The reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n    Let's first determine its structure and molecular formula.\n    *   `cyclohex-3-ene`: A 6-membered carbon ring with one double bond between carbons 3 and 4.\n    *   `carboxylic acid`: A -COOH group, which we'll place at position 1 by convention.\n    *   `2-formyl`: An aldehyde group (-CHO) at position 2.\n    *   `5-vinyl`: An ethylene group (-CH=CH2) at position 5.\n\n    Now, let's determine the molecular formula by counting the atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH2 = 10 carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** Let's count them on the structure.\n        *   C1: 1H\n        *   C2: 1H\n        *   C3: 1H\n        *   C4: 1H\n        *   C5: 1H\n        *   C6: 2H\n        *   -COOH: 1H\n        *   -CHO: 1H\n        *   -CH=CH2: 3H\n        *   Total H = 1+1+1+1+1+2+1+1+3 = 12 hydrogens.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\n    *   The molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Understand the reaction.**\n    The reagent is red phosphorus (Red P) with an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. Its effect is as follows:\n    *   It reduces carbonyl groups (like in aldehydes -CHO and carboxylic acids -COOH) completely to the corresponding alkane (CH3 group in this case).\n    *   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   Essentially, it removes all oxygen atoms and saturates all pi bonds.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the structure and formula of the product.**\n    We apply the effects of Red P/HI to our reactant:\n    *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring (the C=C bond is reduced).\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) is reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH3).\n    *   The `formyl` group (-CHO) is reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH3).\n    *   The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH2) is reduced to an `ethyl` group (-CH2CH3).\n\n    The product is a saturated hydrocarbon with one ring. Specifically, it's an isomer of ethyl-dimethyl-cyclohexane.\n    Since the carbon skeleton is preserved, the product still has 10 carbon atoms.\n    The product is a saturated cycloalkane. The general formula for a saturated hydrocarbon with one ring is CnH2n.\n    Since our product has 10 carbons (n=10), its molecular formula must be C10H(2*10) = **C10H20**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, tells us the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule. The formula is:\n    IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n    Where C is the number of carbons, H is the number of hydrogens, and N is the number of nitrogens.\n\n    For our product with the formula C10H20:\n    *   C = 10\n    *   H = 20\n    *   N = 0\n    IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 0 + 1\n    IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    IHD = 1\n\n    Alternatively, we can find the IHD by inspecting the final structure. The product is ethyl-dimethyl-cyclohexane.\n    *   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring)\n    *   Number of pi bonds = 0 (all double bonds were reduced to single bonds)\n    *   IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nBoth methods yield an IHD of 1 for the product.\n\n<<<A>>>"
