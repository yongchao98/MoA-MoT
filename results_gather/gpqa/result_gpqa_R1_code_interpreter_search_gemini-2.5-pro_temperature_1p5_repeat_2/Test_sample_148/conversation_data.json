    "*   **Analysis of the NMR Data:** The observation of two peaks for a single proton, with equal integrals summing to the expected value (1H), suggests the presence of two distinct chemical species in a roughly 1:1 ratio. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, these two species must be isomers of some kind. The similar chemical shifts indicate that the chemical environments of the proton in the two species are very similar, but not identical.\n\n*   **Analysis of the LC-MS Data:** The presence of two peaks in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace confirms that there are two different compounds that can be separated based on their physical properties (like polarity). The fact that both peaks have the same mass spectrum, and that this mass is consistent with the expected product, confirms that these two compounds are isomersâ€”they have the same chemical formula and mass but different three-dimensional arrangements. The separation is observed even at elevated temperatures, indicating that these are stable isomers, not just rapidly interconverting conformers with a low energy barrier.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical properties and are thus separable by standard chromatographic techniques like LC. They are also chemically distinct, meaning they will give different NMR spectra. For a peptide, this could easily arise from the racemization of an amino acid chiral center during synthesis, leading to, for example, a mixture of an L-L peptide and an L-D peptide. These are diastereomers. This explanation is fully consistent with both the NMR and LC-MS data.\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they cannot be separated by standard LC and give identical standard NMR spectra. To see two peaks, you would need a chiral LC column or a chiral NMR solvent/reagent. This explanation contradicts the observations.\n    *   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would result in a molecule with a higher mass than the expected product. The mass spectrum data, which shows a mass consistent with the *expected* molecule for both peaks, rules out this possibility.\n    *   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would be a different chemical compound, almost certainly with a different mass (usually lower). The mass spectrum data, showing both peaks have the same, correct mass, rules out this possibility.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The only explanation that fits all the data (two distinct peaks in both NMR and standard LC, but with the same mass) is that the compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<A>>>"
