    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown organic compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Number of Protons and Signals**\n\n*   The 1H NMR spectrum shows four distinct signals, which means there are four different types of protons in the molecule.\n*   Let's sum the integrations for each signal to find the total number of protons represented in the spectrum: 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n\nNow, let's check the number of protons in the possible structures:\n*   **Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2)**: A propenyl group (C3H5) plus an acetate group (C2H3O2). Total protons = 5 + 3 = 8. This matches the data.\n*   **Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2)**: A butenyl group (C4H7) plus an acetate group (C2H3O2). Total protons = 7 + 3 = 10. This does not match the data.\n\nBased on the total proton count, we can confidently eliminate the butenyl acetate options (A and D). The unknown compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Signal**\n\nLet's look at each signal individually to deduce the structure.\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**:\n    *   **Integration (3H)**: Represents a methyl (CH3) group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm)**: This region is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group of an ester or ketone. This signal corresponds to the methyl protons of the acetate group (CH3-COO-).\n    *   **Splitting (s)**: A singlet means this methyl group has no adjacent protons to couple with, which is consistent with the structure of an acetate group.\n\n*   **Remaining Signals (7.0, 5.5, and 1.6 ppm)**: These three signals must describe the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to the acetate oxygen.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**:\n    *   **Integration (3H)**: Another methyl group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm)**: This is a typical shift for a methyl group attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (an allylic methyl group). This is the CH3 in -CH=CH-CH3.\n    *   **Splitting (d)**: A doublet means this methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton. This is the vinylic proton next to it.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz) and 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**:\n    *   These two signals represent the two protons on the carbon-carbon double bond (the vinylic protons). Let's call them Ha and Hb: R-O-C(Ha)=C(Hb)-CH3.\n    *   The proton at **7.0 ppm** is significantly downfield, which is expected for a vinylic proton attached to an oxygen atom (Ha) due to the oxygen's deshielding effect. It's a doublet, meaning it's split only by the other vinylic proton (Hb).\n    *   The proton at **5.5 ppm** is the other vinylic proton (Hb), which is attached to the carbon bearing the methyl group. Its splitting pattern is a doublet of quartets (dq). The doublet comes from coupling to Ha, and the quartet comes from coupling to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group. This confirms our assignments.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**\n\nThe key to distinguishing between the cis and trans isomers lies in the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinylic protons (Ha and Hb).\n\n*   For **trans** vinylic protons, the coupling constant (³J_trans) is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n*   For **cis** vinylic protons, the coupling constant (³J_cis) is typically smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nThe observed coupling constant for the signal at 7.0 ppm is **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value falls squarely within the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   The proton count and signal analysis indicate the compound is a propenyl acetate.\n*   The large vinylic coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) definitively points to a trans geometry around the double bond.\n*   Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
