    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify compound E.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Compound A.**\n\n*   Hint (a) describes a Wittig reaction between compound A and a phosphorous ylide to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.\n*   The Wittig reaction is a method for synthesizing alkenes from carbonyl compounds (aldehydes or ketones) and a phosphonium ylide. The reaction replaces the C=O double bond with a C=C double bond.\n*   The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The \"propan-2-ylidene\" part corresponds to the `=(C(CH3)2)` group, which comes from the ylide.\n*   To find the structure of the starting carbonyl compound A, we reverse the reaction: replace the `C=C(CH3)2` group in the product with a `C=O` group.\n*   The product has a cyclopentane ring. At position 4, there is a `=C(CH3)2` group. At positions 1 and 2, there are methyl groups. Replacing the group at C4 with a carbonyl group gives a ketone at that position.\n*   Let's determine the IUPAC name for this ketone. The carbonyl group gets the highest priority and is assigned position 1. The cyclopentane ring is numbered to give the substituents (the two methyl groups) the lowest possible locants.\n*   If the C=O is at position 1, the methyl groups from the original C1 and C2 positions would now be at positions 3 and 4 (numbering away from them) or 4 and 5 (numbering towards them). The lowest locant set is 3,4.\n*   Therefore, Compound A is **3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one**.\n*   Hint (b) supports this conclusion. The IR peak for compound A is ~1750 cm⁻¹. Five-membered ring ketones (cyclopentanones) typically show a C=O stretching frequency around 1745-1750 cm⁻¹ due to increased ring strain, which is higher than the typical ~1715 cm⁻¹ for acyclic or six-membered ring ketones.\n\n**Step 2: Follow the reaction sequence from A to E.**\n\n*   **Reaction 1: A + HCN → B**\n    *   This is the nucleophilic addition of cyanide (from HCN) to the carbonyl group of compound A (3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one).\n    *   This reaction forms a cyanohydrin.\n    *   Compound B is **1-cyano-3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-ol**.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: B + H₂/Pd → C**\n    *   This is the catalytic hydrogenation of compound B. The nitrile group (-C≡N) is reduced to a primary amine group (-CH₂NH₂).\n    *   Compound C is **1-(aminomethyl)-3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-ol**.\n\n*   **Reaction 3: C + HNO₂ → D**\n    *   This is the diazotization of a primary amine. The primary amine group (-NH₂) of compound C reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂) to form an unstable aliphatic diazonium salt.\n    *   Compound D is the **[(1-hydroxy-3,4-dimethylcyclopentyl)methyl]diazonium ion**.\n\n*   **Reaction 4: D → E + inert gas**\n    *   The unstable diazonium salt (D) rapidly decomposes, losing a molecule of nitrogen gas (N₂, an inert gas).\n    *   This decomposition initially forms a very unstable primary carbocation on the exocyclic methylene carbon (-CH₂⁺).\n    *   This intermediate undergoes a rearrangement known as the **Tiffeneau–Demjanov rearrangement**, which involves ring expansion. One of the adjacent C-C bonds of the cyclopentane ring (either C1-C2 or C1-C5) migrates to the positively charged carbon. This expands the five-membered ring into a six-membered ring.\n    *   Simultaneously, a new carbocation is formed at the carbon that lost the migrating bond (C1), which also bears the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   This carbocation is stabilized by the oxygen of the hydroxyl group. It quickly rearranges and loses a proton (H⁺) to form a stable ketone.\n    *   The original five-membered ring (cyclopentanone derivative) expands to a six-membered ring (cyclohexanone derivative).\n    *   We need to track the position of the methyl groups. They were at positions 3 and 4 of the original cyclopentanone. After the ring expansion, they will be on the newly formed cyclohexanone ring. Regardless of whether the C1-C2 or C1-C5 bond migrates, the resulting ketone, when named by IUPAC rules, will have the methyl groups at positions 3 and 4 relative to the new carbonyl group.\n    *   Therefore, Compound E is **3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 3: Corroborate with Hint (b).**\n\n*   Hint (b) states that the IR spectrum of compound E shows a strong peak at ~1715 cm⁻¹.\n*   Six-membered ring ketones (cyclohexanones) are relatively strain-free and exhibit a characteristic C=O stretching frequency around 1715 cm⁻¹.\n*   This IR data is fully consistent with compound E being 3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The shift from 1750 cm⁻¹ (in A) to 1715 cm⁻¹ (in E) is a classic indicator of a five-membered ring ketone being converted to a six-membered ring ketone.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis of the Wittig reaction to identify A and tracing the subsequent Tiffeneau-Demjanov rearrangement, which is further supported by the IR spectral data, Compound E is 3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
