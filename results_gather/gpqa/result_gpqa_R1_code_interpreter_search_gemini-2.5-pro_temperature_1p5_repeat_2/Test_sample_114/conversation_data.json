    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Principles**\n\nThe problem involves a relativistic collision and annihilation process. The key principles to apply are:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy of the system before the collision (electron + positron) is equal to the total energy of the system after the collision (two photons).\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum of the system before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision.\n*   **Relativistic Kinematics:** Since the particles are moving at speeds close to the speed of light (indicated by their Lorentz factors), we must use the equations of special relativity for energy and momentum.\n\n**2. Define the Initial State (Before Collision)**\n\nWe have an electron and a positron. Let's set the direction of motion along the x-axis. We will work in units where the speed of light, c, is 1, and the rest mass of the electron (and positron), m_e, is 1. We can reintroduce them at the end if needed, but they will cancel out.\n\n*   **Electron:**\n    *   Moves from left to right (+x direction).\n    *   Lorentz factor, γ_e = 4.\n    *   Rest mass, m_e.\n    *   Energy: E_e = γ_e * m_e * c^2 = 4 m_e c^2.\n    *   Momentum magnitude is given by the energy-momentum relation E² = (pc)² + (m_e c²)².\n        *   (p_e c)² = E_e² - (m_e c²)² = (4 m_e c²)² - (m_e c²)² = 15 (m_e c²)².\n        *   p_e = sqrt(15) * m_e c.\n        *   Momentum vector: **p**_e = (+sqrt(15) m_e c, 0).\n\n*   **Positron:**\n    *   Moves from right to left (-x direction).\n    *   Rest mass, m_e.\n    *   Lorentz factor, γ_p = 2.\n    *   Energy: E_p = γ_p * m_e * c^2 = 2 m_e c^2.\n    *   Momentum magnitude:\n        *   (p_p c)² = E_p² - (m_e c²)² = (2 m_e c²)² - (m_e c²)² = 3 (m_e c²)².\n        *   p_p = sqrt(3) * m_e c.\n        *   Momentum vector: **p**_p = (-sqrt(3) m_e c, 0).\n\n**3. Calculate Total Initial Energy and Momentum**\n\n*   **Total Energy (E_initial):**\n    *   E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c² + 2 m_e c² = 6 m_e c².\n*   **Total Momentum (P_initial):**\n    *   **P**_initial = **p**_e + **p**_p = ( (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c, 0).\n    *   The total momentum is purely in the +x direction.\n\n**4. Define the Final State (After Annihilation)**\n\nThe annihilation produces two photons.\n\n*   The problem states their energies are equal. Let the energy of each photon be E_γ.\n*   By conservation of energy: E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ = E_initial.\n    *   2E_γ = 6 m_e c²  =>  E_γ = 3 m_e c².\n*   For a photon, momentum (p) and energy (E) are related by E = pc.\n    *   The magnitude of each photon's momentum is p_γ = E_γ / c = 3 m_e c.\n*   One photon moves \"upper-right\" and the other \"lower-right\". Since the initial y-momentum was zero, the final total y-momentum must also be zero. This means if the first photon's direction makes an angle θ with the x-axis, the second must make an angle -θ.\n*   The total angle between the photons is α = 2θ.\n\n**5. Apply Conservation of Momentum to the Final State**\n\nWe need to equate the initial and final momentum in the x-direction.\n\n*   Momentum of photon 1: **p**_γ1 = (p_γ cos(θ), p_γ sin(θ)).\n*   Momentum of photon 2: **p**_γ2 = (p_γ cos(-θ), p_γ sin(-θ)) = (p_γ cos(θ), -p_γ sin(θ)).\n*   **Total Final Momentum (P_final):**\n    *   **P**_final = **p**_γ1 + **p**_γ2 = (2 p_γ cos(θ), 0).\n*   Equating initial and final x-momentum:\n    *   P_initial_x = P_final_x\n    *   (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c = 2 p_γ cos(θ).\n*   Substitute p_γ = 3 m_e c:\n    *   (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c = 2 * (3 m_e c) * cos(θ).\n    *   sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 6 cos(θ).\n*   Solve for cos(θ):\n    *   cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6.\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Angle**\n\nThe angle we need is α = 2θ. We can use the double-angle identity: cos(α) = cos(2θ) = 2cos²(θ) - 1.\n\n*   cos(α) = 2 * [ (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6 ]² - 1\n*   cos(α) = 2 * [ (15 + 3 - 2*sqrt(15*3)) / 36 ] - 1\n*   cos(α) = 2 * [ (18 - 2*sqrt(45)) / 36 ] - 1\n*   cos(α) = (18 - 2*sqrt(9*5)) / 18 - 1\n*   cos(α) = (18 - 6*sqrt(5)) / 18 - 1\n*   cos(α) = 1 - (6*sqrt(5) / 18) - 1\n*   cos(α) = -sqrt(5) / 3\n\nNow we calculate the angle α from its cosine.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of cos(alpha)\ncos_alpha = -math.sqrt(5) / 3\n\n# Calculate alpha in radians\nalpha_rad = math.acos(cos_alpha)\n\n# Convert alpha to degrees\nalpha_deg = math.degrees(alpha_rad)\n\nprint(alpha_deg)\n```\n138.1896851042214\n\nThe calculated angle is approximately 138.19 degrees.

    "Here's the step-by-step thinking process that leads to the solution.\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principles:** This is a relativistic particle collision and annihilation problem. The fundamental principles that govern this interaction are the conservation of total energy and the conservation of total momentum. Since the particles are moving at relativistic speeds (indicated by Lorentz factors greater than 1), we must use the equations from special relativity.\n\n2.  **Set up the initial state (before the collision):**\n    *   Let the horizontal axis be the x-axis. The electron moves in the +x direction, and the positron moves in the -x direction.\n    *   We will use units where the speed of light `c = 1` and the rest mass of the electron/positron `m_e = 1`. This simplifies the equations, and these constants will cancel out in the final angle calculation.\n\n    *   **Electron:**\n        *   Lorentz factor, γ_e = 4.\n        *   Rest mass, m_e = 1.\n        *   Relativistic energy, E_e = γ_e * m_e * c² = 4 * 1 * 1² = 4.\n        *   Relativistic momentum, p, is related to energy by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². So, p = sqrt(E² - m²c⁴) / c.\n        *   p_e = sqrt(E_e² - m_e²) = sqrt(4² - 1²) = sqrt(16 - 1) = sqrt(15).\n        *   The momentum is a vector: **p**_e = (+sqrt(15), 0).\n\n    *   **Positron:**\n        *   Lorentz factor, γ_p = 2.\n        *   Rest mass, m_e = 1.\n        *   Relativistic energy, E_p = γ_p * m_e * c² = 2 * 1 * 1² = 2.\n        *   Relativistic momentum, p_p = sqrt(E_p² - m_e²) = sqrt(2² - 1²) = sqrt(4 - 1) = sqrt(3).\n        *   The momentum is a vector (moving left): **p**_p = (-sqrt(3), 0).\n\n3.  **Calculate total initial energy and momentum:**\n    *   **Total Energy (Initial):** E_total = E_e + E_p = 4 + 2 = 6.\n    *   **Total Momentum (Initial):** **P**_total = **p**_e + **p**_p = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3), 0).\n\n4.  **Set up the final state (after annihilation):**\n    *   Two photons are produced. Let's call them γ1 and γ2.\n    *   Photons are massless, so their energy-momentum relation is E = pc (or E=p in our simplified units).\n    *   The problem states the photons have the same energy, E_γ.\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** E_total (initial) = E_total (final)\n        *   6 = E_γ1 + E_γ2 = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ.\n        *   Therefore, the energy of each photon is E_γ = 3.\n    *   The magnitude of the momentum of each photon is p_γ = E_γ = 3.\n\n5.  **Analyze the directions of the final photons:**\n    *   The initial total momentum was only in the x-direction. There was no momentum in the y-direction.\n    *   By conservation of momentum, the final total momentum in the y-direction must also be zero.\n    *   Let the first photon (γ1) move at an angle θ with respect to the +x axis. Its momentum vector is **p**_γ1 = (p_γ * cos(θ), p_γ * sin(θ)).\n    *   For the y-momenta to cancel, the second photon (γ2) must move at an angle -θ. Its momentum vector is **p**_γ2 = (p_γ * cos(-θ), p_γ * sin(-θ)) = (p_γ * cos(θ), -p_γ * sin(θ)).\n    *   The question asks for the angle *between* the photons, which is α = θ - (-θ) = 2θ.\n\n6.  **Apply Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   **P**_total (initial) = **P**_total (final)\n    *   **P**_total (final) = **p**_γ1 + **p**_γ2 = (2 * p_γ * cos(θ), 0).\n    *   Equating the x-components:\n        *   sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ).\n    *   Substitute the value of p_γ = 3:\n        *   sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 2 * 3 * cos(θ) = 6 * cos(θ).\n    *   Solve for cos(θ):\n        *   cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6.\n\n7.  **Calculate the final angle (α = 2θ):**\n    *   We want to find α = 2θ. A useful trigonometric identity is the double-angle formula for cosine: cos(α) = cos(2θ) = 2cos²(θ) - 1.\n    *   First, square cos(θ):\n        *   cos²(θ) = [ (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6 ]²\n        *   cos²(θ) = (15 - 2*sqrt(15*3) + 3) / 36\n        *   cos²(θ) = (18 - 2*sqrt(45)) / 36\n        *   cos²(θ) = (18 - 2*sqrt(9*5)) / 36\n        *   cos²(θ) = (18 - 6*sqrt(5)) / 36 = (3 - sqrt(5)) / 6.\n    *   Now, use the identity:\n        *   cos(α) = 2 * [ (3 - sqrt(5)) / 6 ] - 1\n        *   cos(α) = (3 - sqrt(5)) / 3 - 1\n        *   cos(α) = (3 - sqrt(5)) / 3 - 3/3\n        *   cos(α) = -sqrt(5) / 3.\n    *   To find the angle α, we take the arccosine (inverse cosine). We can use a calculator or a simple script for this.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# From the derivation, we have cos(alpha) = -sqrt(5) / 3\ncos_alpha = -math.sqrt(5) / 3\n\n# Calculate alpha by taking the arccosine\nalpha_rad = math.acos(cos_alpha)\n\n# Convert the result from radians to degrees\nalpha_deg = math.degrees(alpha_rad)\n\nprint(alpha_deg)\n```\nThe calculated angle is approximately 138.19 degrees.

    "The reasoning and calculation are as follows:\n\n**1.

So, `p_γ = 3`.\n*   Since the initial total momentum in the y-direction is zero, the photons' y-momenta must cancel. This means they travel at symmetric angles, θ and -θ, relative to the x-axis. The total angle between them is α = 2θ.\n\n**3.
