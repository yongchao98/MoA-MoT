    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the product formed when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant:**\n    The starting molecule is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Let's draw its structure based on the IUPAC name.\n    *   \"nona\" indicates a 9-carbon main chain.\n    *   \"-2,6-diene\" indicates double bonds starting at carbon 2 and carbon 6.\n    *   \"5-butyl\" indicates a butyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃) is attached to carbon 5.\n\n    The structure is:\n    CH₃(1)-CH(2)=CH(3)-CH₂(4)-CH(5)-CH(6)=CH(7)-CH₂(8)-CH₃(9)\n                                  |\n                                  CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃ (butyl group)\n\n2.  **Identify the Potential Reaction:**\n    Heating a 1,5-diene system typically induces a Cope rearrangement. The Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. Our molecule, 5-butylnona-2,6-diene, contains a hexa-1,5-diene core structure (from carbon C2 to C7), making it a perfect candidate for this reaction.\n\n    The 1,5-diene system is:\n    `C(2)=C(3)-C(4)-C(5)-C(6)=C(7)`\n\n3.  **Apply the Cope Rearrangement Mechanism:**\n    In a Cope rearrangement, a 1,5-diene rearranges through a cyclic, six-membered transition state. The mechanism involves:\n    *   Breaking the sigma bond between C4 and C5 (the bond that is allylic to both double bonds).\n    *   Forming a new sigma bond between C2 and C7.\n    *   Shifting the double bonds to C3=C4 and C5=C6.\n\n    Let's trace the connectivity of the atoms and their substituents in the product:\n    *   **Original atoms and groups:**\n        *   On C2: a hydrogen and a methyl group (C1).\n        *   On C3: a hydrogen.\n        *   On C4: two hydrogens.\n        *   On C5: a hydrogen and a butyl group.\n        *   On C6: a hydrogen.\n        *   On C7: a hydrogen and an ethyl group (C8-C9).\n    *   **Product connectivity:**\n        *   A new C2-C7 bond is formed.\n        *   A new double bond is formed between C3 and C4 (`C3H=C4H₂`). This forms a vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) attached to C2.\n        *   A new double bond is formed between C5 and C6 (`(butyl)C5H=C6H-`). This forms a substituted vinyl group attached to C7.\n        *   The original substituents remain on their respective carbons.\n\n    Let's sketch the skeleton of the product molecule based on these new connections:\n               CH₃ (C1)\n               |\n    H₂C(4)=CH(3) - CH(2) - CH(7) - CH₂(8)CH₃ (ethyl)\n                         |\n                         CH(6)=CH(5)-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃ (butyl part of the new group)\n\n4.  **Name the Product (IUPAC Nomenclature):**\n    To name the product, we must find the longest continuous carbon chain that contains the maximum number of double bonds.\n    *   Our product has two double bonds: C3=C4 and C5=C6.\n    *   The longest chain containing both must include the segment `C4-C3-C2-C7-C6-C5`.\n    *   Let's see how this chain extends. From C5, the chain continues through the original butyl group (`-B1-B2-B3-B4`). C4 is a terminal `CH₂` group.\n    *   Thus, the longest chain is: `C4-C3-C2-C7-C6-C5-B1-B2-B3-B4`.\n    *   Let's count the carbons in this chain: 1(C4) + 1(C3) + 1(C2) + 1(C7) + 1(C6) + 1(C5) + 4(Butyl carbons) = 10 carbons. The parent chain is a **deca-diene**.\n\n    Now, we number the chain to give the double bonds the lowest possible locants (positions).\n    *   **Numbering from the C4 end:**\n        `C4(1)=C3(2)-C2(3)-C7(4)-C6(5)=C5(6)-B1(7)-B2(8)-B3(9)-B4(10)`\n        The double bonds start at positions **1** and **5**. The name is `deca-1,5-diene`.\n    *   **Numbering from the B4 end:**\n        The locants for the double bonds would be 5 and 9 (`deca-5,9-diene`).\n    *   Since (1,5) is lower than (5,9), we use the first numbering scheme.\n\n    Finally, identify and name the substituents on the main chain.\n    *   There is a methyl group (C1) on position 3 of the main chain (which is C2 of the original molecule). So, `3-methyl`.\n    *   There is an ethyl group (C8-C9) on position 4 of the main chain (which is C7 of the original molecule). So, `4-ethyl`.\n\n    Assembling the full name, we put the substituents in alphabetical order: `4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene`.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene\n    *   B) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n    *   C) 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene\n    *   D) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n\n    Our derived name, `4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene`, matches option C perfectly."
