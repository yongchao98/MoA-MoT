    "An oscillating charge distribution acts as a source of electromagnetic radiation. The simplest and most dominant form of radiation from a source like an oscillating spheroid (whose size is typically assumed to be much smaller than the wavelength of radiation) is electric dipole radiation.\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\n1.  **Modeling the Radiating Source:**\n    An oscillating charge distribution with a defined symmetry axis (the z-axis in this case) can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole. The dipole moment, **p**, oscillates along the z-axis: **p**(t) = p₀cos(ωt) **ẑ**, where **ẑ** is the unit vector in the z-direction.\n\n2.  **Power Radiated by an Electric Dipole:**\n    From classical electrodynamics, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) in the radiation zone for an oscillating electric dipole oriented along the z-axis is given by the formula:\n    \n    (dP/dΩ) = (μ₀ * p₀² * ω⁴) / (32 * π² * c) * sin²(θ)\n    \n    where:\n    *   `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   `θ` is the polar angle measured from the z-axis.\n    *   `p₀` is the amplitude of the dipole moment.\n    *   `μ₀` is the permeability of free space.\n\n    The function `f(λ, θ)` mentioned in the question represents this power per unit solid angle, `dP/dΩ`.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Wavelength Dependence:**\n    The formula shows that the radiated power is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency, `ω⁴`. The angular frequency is related to the wavelength `λ` by the equation `ω = 2πν = 2πc/λ`.\n    \n    Therefore, the power dependence on wavelength is:\n    \n    (dP/dΩ) ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴\n    \n    This tells us that a possible form for the wavelength dependence in the function `f` is `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Angular Dependence:**\n    The formula shows that the angular dependence of the radiated power is given by `sin²(θ)`.\n    \n    (dP/dΩ) ∝ sin²(θ)\n    \n    The maximum radiated power, `A`, occurs when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which happens at `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    \n    So, `A` corresponds to `sin²(90°) = 1`.\n    \n    We need to find the fraction of this maximum power that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. At this angle, the power will be proportional to `sin²(30°)`.\n    \n    We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n    \n    The fraction of the maximum power `A` at `θ = 30°` is the ratio of the power at 30° to the maximum power:\n    \n    Fraction = [Power at 30°] / [Maximum Power] = sin²(30°) / sin²(90°) = (1/4) / 1 = 1/4.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n    *   A possible form for the wavelength dependence of the radiated power is **λ⁻⁴**.\n    \n    Comparing these results with the given options:\n    A) 1/4, λ⁻³\n    B) 1/4, λ⁻⁴\n    C) 3/4, λ⁻⁶\n    D) 1/2, λ⁻⁴\n    \n    Option B matches our findings.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Part 1: Calculate the fraction of maximum power at theta = 30 degrees.\n# The power is proportional to sin^2(theta).\n# The maximum power occurs at theta = 90 degrees, where sin^2(90) = 1.\ntheta_deg = 30\ntheta_rad = np.deg2rad(theta_deg)\n\n# Power at 30 degrees is proportional to sin^2(30)\npower_at_30 = np.sin(theta_rad)**2\n\n# Maximum power is proportional to sin^2(90) = 1\nmax_power = 1.0\n\n# The fraction is the ratio\nfraction = power_at_30 / max_power\n\nprint(f\"Fraction of maximum power at 30 degrees: {fraction}\")\n# Part 2 of the question is based on the theoretical formula for dipole radiation,\n# where power is proportional to omega^4, which is proportional to lambda^-4.\n# Combining the results, the fraction is 1/4 and the lambda dependence is lambda^-4.\n# This corresponds to option B.\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem describes an oscillating charge distribution with a spheroid shape, which can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole. The key is to understand the characteristics of electric dipole radiation.\n\n### Reasoning and Analysis\n\n1.  **Angular Distribution of Radiated Power:**\n    For an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) is given by:\n    \n    (dP/dΩ) ∝ sin²(θ)\n    \n    where θ is the angle with respect to the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).\n    \n    *   The function `f` in the problem is this power per unit solid angle, so `f(λ, θ) ∝ sin²(θ)`.\n    *   The maximum radiated power, `A`, occurs when this function is maximized. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which happens at θ = 90° (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis). Thus, `A` corresponds to the value of power when `sin²(θ) = 1`.\n    *   We need to find the power radiated at an angle θ = 30°. The power at this angle will be proportional to `sin²(30°)`.\n    *   We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    *   Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power `A` is the ratio of the power at 30° to the maximum power:\n        \n        Fraction = (Power at 30°) / (Maximum Power) = sin²(30°) / sin²(90°) = (1/4) / 1 = 1/4.\n\n2.  **Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    The total power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is given by the Larmor formula, which shows that the power is proportional to the square of the acceleration. For sinusoidal oscillation, the acceleration is proportional to the square of the angular frequency (a ∝ ω²), and the power is proportional to the square of acceleration (P ∝ a²), leading to:\n    \n    P ∝ (ω²)² = ω⁴\n    \n    The power per unit solid angle, `f`, also has this dependence:\n    \n    `f ∝ ω⁴`\n    \n    The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` and the speed of light `c` by the relation `ω = 2πc / λ`.\n    \n    Substituting this into the proportionality for `f`:\n    \n    `f ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n    \n    So, a possible form for the dependence of `f` on the wavelength is `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the two results:\n*   The fraction of the maximum power radiated at θ = 30° is **1/4**.\n*   A possible form for the wavelength dependence of `f` is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
