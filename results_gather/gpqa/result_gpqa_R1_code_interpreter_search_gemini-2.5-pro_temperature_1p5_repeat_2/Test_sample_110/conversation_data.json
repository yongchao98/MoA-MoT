    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1 Analysis:\n**2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is a ketone.\n    *   **Reagent:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which acts as a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, bulky base.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction is a Michael addition. The base will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form a nucleophilic enolate, which will then attack the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n2.  **Determine the Site of Deprotonation (Enolate Formation):**\n    *   First, let's draw the structure of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The IUPAC name indicates the following structure:\n        *   A cyclohexanone ring (C=O at C1).\n        *   An ethyl group and a methyl group are on C2.\n        *   A methyl group is on C6.\n        ```\n              O\n             //\n          C1--C2(Et, Me)\n         /   \\\n       C6(Me)-C5--C4--C3\n        \\______/\n        (CH₂ groups at C3, C4, C5)\n        ```\n    *   The α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl C1) are C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is a quaternary carbon (bonded to C1, C3, an ethyl group, and a methyl group). It has **no α-protons**.\n    *   **C6** is a tertiary carbon (bonded to C1, C5, a methyl group, and a hydrogen). It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Since deprotonation can only occur where there are α-protons, the base (t-BuOK) must abstract the single proton from C6. There is no other possibility for enolate formation. The \"steric hindrance\" consideration mentioned in the prompt is moot here, as there's no choice of proton to remove.\n\n3.  **Perform the Michael Addition:**\n    *   The enolate forms with the negative charge effectively on C6. This nucleophilic carbon attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate.\n    *   Ethyl acrylate: CH₂(β)=CH(α)-COOEt.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. The group added to C6 is `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`.\n    *   The intermediate is protonated (by t-butanol, the conjugate acid of the base) to yield the final product, A.\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure and Name of Product A:**\n    *   The product molecule has the `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group attached to C6 of the original ketone ring.\n    *   To name this product using IUPAC nomenclature, we identify the principal functional group, which is the ester. The parent name is **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring system is a substituent on carbon 3 of the propanoate chain. So the name will be **ethyl 3-(...cyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   Now, we must name the cyclohexyl substituent. The point of attachment to the propanoate chain is defined as C1' of the substituent ring. This C1' corresponds to C6 of the original ketone.\n    *   Let's locate the other groups relative to C1':\n        *   The methyl group that was on C6 is now on C1'.\n        *   The keto group (=O) was at C1, which is adjacent to C6. So, the keto group is at C2'.\n        *   The ethyl and methyl groups were on C2, which is adjacent to C1. So, they are on C3'.\n    *   Assembling the name of the substituent: 1'-methyl, 2'-oxo, 3'-ethyl, 3'-methyl. In alphabetical order (excluding numerical prefixes), this gives `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This name matches the one provided in options B and C.\n\n### Reaction 2 Analysis:\n**1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) has acidic α-protons.\n    *   **Reagent:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN), also known as crotononitrile, is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile (a Michael acceptor).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is also a Michael addition. The base deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group, creating a nucleophilic nitronate anion, which attacks the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Determine the Nucleophile and Electrophile:**\n    *   **Nucleophile:** KOH removes a proton from the C1 of 1-nitropropane (the carbon attached to the -NO₂ group) to form the nitronate anion: `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n    *   **Electrophile:** In but-2-enenitrile (N≡C¹-C²H=C³H-C⁴H₃), the electron-withdrawing nitrile group makes the double bond electrophilic. The attack occurs at the β-carbon, which is C3.\n\n3.  **Perform the Michael Addition:**\n    *   The carbanion of the nitronate attacks C3 of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is protonated by water to give product B.\n    *   The product structure is: `NC-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(NO₂)-CH₂CH₃`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure and Name of Product B:**\n    *   Let's check the carbon count. The product should have 3 carbons from nitropropane and 4 from butenenitrile, for a total of 7 carbons.\n    *   Let's examine the options for B:\n        *   `2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile`: 4 (butane) + 2 (dimethyl) = 6 carbons. This is incorrect.\n        *   `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`: 6 (hexane) + 1 (methyl) = 7 carbons. This is correct.\n    *   This analysis alone eliminates options A and C.\n    *   To confirm, let's name our derived structure: `NC-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(NO₂)-CH₂CH₃`.\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile, so its carbon is C1. The longest carbon chain including C1 is 6 carbons long (`NC¹-C²-C³(CH₃)-C⁴(NO₂)-C⁵-C⁶`). The parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the name in options B and D.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, only option B contains both correct product names.\n\n**A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**\n**B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**\n\n<<<B>>>"
