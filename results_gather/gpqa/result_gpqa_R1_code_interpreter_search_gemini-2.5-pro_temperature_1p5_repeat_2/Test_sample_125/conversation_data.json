    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   It has one pre-existing chiral center at carbon C5, with the (S) configuration.\n    *   The carbonyl group is at carbon C3. This carbon is prochiral, meaning a reaction at this site can create a new chiral center.\n\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   LAH reduces the ketone C=O group to a secondary alcohol C-OH group.\n    *   The reduction creates a new chiral center at C3. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack the carbonyl group from either the top face or the bottom face.\n    *   Because the starting molecule is already chiral (due to the (S) center at C5), the two faces of the carbonyl group are diastereotopic. The attack is not equally probable, leading to an unequal mixture of two diastereomeric products.\n    *   The configuration at C5 remains unchanged during the reaction. The new center at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   **Products of Reaction I:**\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products are diastereomers because they have two chiral centers, with one being the same ((S) at C5) and the other being different ((R) vs (S) at C3).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral and has no chiral centers. It has a plane of symmetry.\n\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   \"Excess\" NaBH₄ ensures that both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohol groups.\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   The reaction creates two new chiral centers at carbons C2 and C4.\n    *   Since the starting material is achiral, any chiral products must be formed as a racemic mixture (an equal amount of each enantiomer).\n    *   Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol:\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are a pair of enantiomers. They will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has a plane of symmetry (it's superimposable on its mirror image, which would be (2S, 4R)). Therefore, it is a meso compound, which is achiral.\n    *   **Products of Reaction II:**\n        1.  A racemic mixture of (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n        2.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   So, Reaction II produces a total of three distinct stereoisomeric compounds.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It can separate structurally different compounds and diastereomers. However, it cannot separate enantiomers, as they have identical physical properties (including polarity) in an achiral environment.\n*   **The combined mixture contains:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n*   **Expected Peaks:**\n    *   Compounds 1 and 2 are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   Compounds 3 and 4 are enantiomers. They have identical polarity and will co-elute (not separate). This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   Compound 5 (the meso form) is a diastereomer of compounds 3 and 4. It has different properties and will be separated from them. This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇ ethers/alcohols) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C₅ diols) and will have different polarities. Therefore, the peaks from Reaction I will be separate from the peaks from Reaction II.\n    *   Total peaks = (Peak for Cpd 1) + (Peak for Cpd 2) + (Peak for Cpds 3 & 4) + (Peak for Cpd 5) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP). The CSP interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can also separate diastereomers. Essentially, it can separate all different stereoisomers.\n*   **The combined mixture contains 5 distinct stereoisomers:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Expected Peaks:**\n    *   Since all five compounds are stereochemically distinct and a chiral column is designed to separate such isomers, we expect each compound to produce a separate peak (assuming ideal separation conditions).\n    *   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: **4 peaks**\n*   Chiral HPLC: **5 peaks**\n\nThis corresponds to the option: 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<B>>>"
