Identify the Nucleus and its Composition**\n*   The problem specifies the nucleus is Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n*   The atomic number (Z) of Lithium is 3, which means it has 3 protons.\n*   The number of neutrons (N) is given as 3.\n*   The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons: A = Z + N = 3 + 3 = 6.\n*   Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 (⁶Li).\n\n**2. State the Relativistic Energy Formula**\nThe total energy (E) of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by:\nE = γ * E₀\nwhere:\n*   E₀ is the rest energy of the particle (m₀c²).\n*   γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as: γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\n**3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n*   The speed of the nucleus is given as v = 0.96c.\n*   First, calculate v²/c²: (0.96c)² / c² = 0.96² = 0.9216.\n*   Now, calculate γ:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\n    γ = 1 / √(0.0784)\n    γ = 1 / 0.28\n    γ ≈ 3.5714\n\n**4. Calculate the Rest Energy (E₀) of the ⁶Li Nucleus**\nThe most physically accurate method is to use the experimentally determined mass of the ⁶Li nucleus. The provided python script calculates this accurately:\n*   It starts with the atomic mass of a ⁶Li atom (6.0151228874 u) and subtracts the mass of the 3 electrons.\n*   Mass of ⁶Li nucleus ≈ 6.013477 u.\n*   It then converts this mass to energy in GeV using the conversion factor 1 u ≈ 0.931494 GeV/c².\n*   **Rest Energy E₀ ≈ 5.6015 GeV**.\n\nHowever, in many physics problems, a simplified approach is intended where the rest mass is calculated by summing the masses of its constituent protons and neutrons, which ignores the mass defect due to binding energy. Let's see if this matches an answer choice better.\n*   Rest energy of a proton ≈ 0.93827 GeV.\n*   Rest energy of a neutron ≈ 0.93957 GeV.\n*   E₀ = (3 * E_proton) + (3 * E_neutron)\n*   E₀ ≈ 3 * (0.93827 GeV) + 3 * (0.93957 GeV)\n*   E₀ ≈ 2.81481 GeV + 2.81871 GeV\n*   E₀ ≈ 5.63352 GeV\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Energy (E)**\nUsing the rest energy from the more accurate method (calculated by the Python script):\n*   E = γ * E₀\n*   E ≈ 3.5714 * 5.6015 GeV\n*   **E ≈ 20.005 GeV**\n\nUsing the rest energy from summing the nucleon masses:\n*   E = γ * E₀\n*   E ≈ 3.5714 * 5.63352 GeV\n*   **E ≈ 20.120 GeV**\n\n**6. Conclusion and Final Answer Selection**\nThe result from the Python script (20.005 GeV), which is the more physically precise method, is closest to 20.132 GeV among the options. The second calculation (20.120 GeV), based on a common problem-solving simplification, is even closer to option D. The minor difference between 20.120 GeV and the answer 20.132 GeV can be attributed to using slightly different values for the fundamental constants (proton/neutron mass). Given the choices, 20.132 GeV is the clear intended answer.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The user wants to find the total energy of a Lithium-6 nucleus moving at a relativistic speed.\n\n**1. Identify the properties of the nucleus X.**\n*   The element is Lithium (Li), which has an atomic number (Z) of 3. This means it has 3 protons.\n*   The problem states it has 3 neutrons (N).\n*   The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons: A = Z + N = 3 + 3 = 6.\n*   Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 (⁶Li).\n\n**2. State the formula for relativistic energy.**\nThe total energy (E) of a particle moving at a relativistic speed (v) is given by the formula:\nE = γ * E₀\nwhere:\n*   E₀ is the rest energy of the particle (m₀c²).\n*   γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n\n**3. Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\nThe speed is given as v = 0.96c.\n*   First, we calculate (v/c)²: (0.96c / c)² = 0.96² = 0.9216.\n*   Next, we calculate the Lorentz factor:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\n    γ = 1 / √(0.0784)\n    γ = 1 / 0.28\n    γ ≈ 3.5714\n\n**4. Calculate the rest energy (E₀) of the ⁶Li nucleus.**\nTo find the rest energy, we first need the rest mass (m₀) of the ⁶Li nucleus. A common method for such problems is to sum the masses of its constituent nucleons (protons and neutrons).\n*   Number of protons = 3\n*   Number of neutrons = 3\n*   Rest mass of a proton ≈ 1.007276 u (atomic mass units)\n*   Rest mass of a neutron ≈ 1.008665 u\n*   Total rest mass m₀ = (3 * 1.007276 u) + (3 * 1.008665 u)\n    m₀ = 3.021828 u + 3.025995 u\n    m₀ = 6.047823 u\n\nNow, convert this mass into energy (GeV) using the mass-energy equivalence conversion factor: 1 u ≈ 931.5 MeV/c² or 0.9315 GeV/c².\n*   Rest energy E₀ = m₀c²\n    E₀ = (6.047823 u) * (0.9315 GeV/c² / u) * c²\n    E₀ ≈ 5.6335 GeV\n\n**5. Calculate the total energy (E).**\nNow we multiply the rest energy by the Lorentz factor.\n*   E = γ * E₀\n*   E ≈ 3.5714 * 5.6335 GeV\n*   E ≈ 20.1195 GeV\n\n**6. Compare with the given options.**\nA) 23.069 GeV\nB) 18.475 GeV\nC) 21.419 GeV\nD) 20.132 GeV\n\nOur calculated value of 20.1195 GeV is extremely close to option D. The minor difference is likely due to using slightly different precision for the physical constants (mass of proton, neutron, and the u-to-GeV conversion factor). Therefore, 20.132 GeV is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
