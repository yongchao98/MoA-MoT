    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental Data and Identify the Products**\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of a mixture of two salts, A and B. The resulting gas mixture is passed through a series of traps to identify its components.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong dehydrating agent, meaning it absorbs water. The mass of this tube increased by 3.60 g, which corresponds to the mass of water (`H₂O`) produced during the decomposition.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 = 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is a lime water test, used to detect acidic gases, most commonly carbon dioxide (`CO₂`), which would form a precipitate (`CaCO₃`). Since the weight of the tube did not change, no `CO₂` or other acidic gas was present in the mixture. This tells us the original salts do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g. The reaction involves the copper being oxidized to copper(II) oxide (`CuO`). The mass increase is solely due to the mass of oxygen atoms that have reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 L of a gas (C) remains under standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Formulate a Hypothesis about the Salts' Identities**\n\nThe decomposition produces `H₂O`, an oxygen-donating gas, and another inert gas, but no `CO₂`. The presence of H, O, and N (as a likely component of the inert gas) points towards ammonium salts of nitrogen oxoacids. Two common examples that fit this profile are ammonium nitrite (`NH₄NO₂`) and ammonium nitrate (`NH₄NO₃`).\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that salts A and B are `NH₄NO₂` and `NH₄NO₃`. Their decomposition reactions upon heating are:\n*   `NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n*   `NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n\nSo, the initial gas mixture would contain `N₂`, `N₂O`, and `H₂O`.\n\n**3. Verify the Hypothesis Quantitatively**\n\nThe problem states that the initial mixture was equimolar. Let `n` be the number of moles of salt A (`NH₄NO₂`) and also `n` for salt B (`NH₄NO₃`).\n\n*   **Water (H₂O):** From the reactions, `NH₄NO₂` produces `2n` moles of H₂O, and `NH₄NO₃` also produces `2n` moles of H₂O.\n    *   Total moles of H₂O = `2n + 2n = 4n`.\n    *   From our analysis in step 1, we know 0.20 mol of H₂O was produced.\n    *   Therefore, `4n = 0.20` mol, which means `n = 0.05` mol.\n\n*   **Oxygen for Tube №3:** Let's see which gas reacts with the hot copper. `N₂` is very stable and would not react. `N₂O` (nitrous oxide) will decompose on hot copper in the reaction: `N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO`.\n    *   From the decomposition of `n` moles of `NH₄NO₃`, `n` moles of `N₂O` are produced.\n    *   Each mole of `N₂O` contains one mole of oxygen atoms. Thus, `n` moles of `N₂O` provide `n` moles of oxygen atoms to the copper.\n    *   From step 1, we know 0.05 mol of O atoms reacted.\n    *   Therefore, `n = 0.05` mol. This result is consistent with the value of `n` we calculated from the amount of water.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** Gas C is what's left after Tube 3. The gases entering Tube 3 are `N₂` and `N₂O`.\n    *   `N₂` from `NH₄NO₂` decomposition: `n` moles.\n    *   `N₂O` from `NH₄NO₃` decomposition: `n` moles. This reacts completely to form `N₂` gas: `N₂O → N₂ + [O]`.\n    *   So, the total moles of `N₂` (Gas C) exiting Tube 3 is the initial `n` moles plus the `n` moles from the `N₂O` reaction.\n    *   Total moles of Gas C = `n + n = 2n`.\n    *   Using `n = 0.05` mol, the moles of Gas C = `2 * 0.05 = 0.10` mol.\n    *   This perfectly matches the 0.10 mol of Gas C we calculated from the volume in step 1.\n\n**4. Check the Initial Mass**\n\nThe hypothesis holds true for all products. Let's check if the initial mass is also correct.\n\n*   Salt A: `NH₄NO₂` (Molar Mass ≈ 14+4+14+32 = 64 g/mol)\n*   Salt B: `NH₄NO₃` (Molar Mass ≈ 14+4+14+48 = 80 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = (moles of A × Molar Mass of A) + (moles of B × Molar Mass of B)\n*   Total mass = `(0.05 mol × 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80 g/mol)`\n*   Total mass = `3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g`.\nThis matches the given initial weight. Our identification of the salts is correct.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in their chemical formulas.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   2 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   3 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in both salts = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
