    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let's define the frames of reference and the velocities involved.\n\n1.  **Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the frame of the observer, which we consider stationary.\n    *   **Glass Frame (S'):** This is the frame that is moving along with the glass. It moves with a velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame (S).\n\n2.  **Velocities:**\n    *   **`v`**: The velocity of the glass (S' frame) relative to the laboratory (S frame). The problem states the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam.\n    *   **`u'`**: The velocity of the light beam as measured in the rest frame of the glass (S' frame). The speed of light in a medium with a refractive index `n` is `c/n`. Since the problem sets the speed of light in vacuum `c=1`, the speed of light within the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   **`u`**: The velocity of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory (S frame). This is the quantity we need to find.\n\n3.  **Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    When two velocities `v` (the velocity of the frame S' relative to S) and `u'` (the velocity of an object in frame S') are in the same direction, the velocity `u` of the object as measured in frame S is given by the Einstein velocity addition formula:\n\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitution and Calculation:**\n    We substitute the values we have into this formula:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n    `u = ( 1/n + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n    To simplify this expression, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n\n    `u = n * ( 1/n + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n    `u = ( n * (1/n) + n * v ) / ( n * 1 + n * (v/n) )`\n\n    `u = ( 1 + n*v ) / ( n + v )`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`. Comparing this result with the given options, it matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
