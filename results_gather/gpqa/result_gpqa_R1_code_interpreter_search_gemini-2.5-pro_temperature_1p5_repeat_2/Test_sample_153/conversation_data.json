    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158, which is 2 mass units higher than the molecular ion peak, is called the M+2 peak. The relative intensity of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1. This specific 3:1 ratio is a tell-tale sign for the presence of **one chlorine atom** in the molecule, as chlorine has two stable isotopes, ³⁵Cl (approx. 75% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (approx. 25% abundance).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (containing ³⁵Cl) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration within a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position, coupled with the O-H peak, confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid. The conjugation with an aromatic ring slightly lowers the frequency to this range.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically > 10 ppm) is characteristic of a **carboxylic acid proton (-COOH)**. It is a singlet because it does not have any adjacent protons to couple with and often exchanges too rapidly to show coupling. This confirms the IR data.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm).\n    *   The total integration is 2H + 2H = 4 aromatic protons. This means the benzene ring is disubstituted.\n    *   The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of **1,4-disubstitution (para-substitution)** on a benzene ring. The two protons on one side of the ring are chemically equivalent to the two on the other, giving two signals. They appear as doublets because each proton is split by its single ortho neighbor.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group and a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\n**Synthesis and Evaluation of Options:**\n\n*   **From the data:** We are looking for a para-substituted chlorobenzoic acid.\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is a benzoic acid (has -COOH) with a chlorine atom at the para (4) position.\n    *   **MW:** C₇H₅ClO₂ gives a molecular weight of 156 for the ³⁵Cl isotope. (Correct)\n    *   **IR:** It is a carboxylic acid. (Correct)\n    *   **¹H NMR:** It has a -COOH proton and a para-disubstituted ring, which would give two doublets for the 4 aromatic protons. (Correct)\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is ortho-substituted. The ¹H NMR spectrum would be much more complex than two doublets. (Incorrect)\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It lacks the -COOH proton at ~11 ppm and would not show the very broad IR stretch from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹. (Incorrect)\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an acid chloroformate. It lacks the carboxylic acid O-H group, so it would not have the IR peak at 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ or the NMR peak at 11 ppm. (Incorrect)\n\nThe only structure that perfectly matches all pieces of spectral data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>"
