    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principles of the system.**\n    This problem involves a harmonic oscillator, but the mass is moving at relativistic speeds. Therefore, we must use the principles of special relativity, specifically the formula for relativistic energy, combined with the concept of conservation of energy for the harmonic oscillator system.\n\n2.  **Define the energy components.**\n    *   **Potential Energy (U):** The potential energy of a harmonic oscillator with spring constant $k$ and displacement $x$ from the equilibrium position is given by $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    *   **Relativistic Energy (E):** The total energy of a particle of mass $m$ moving at speed $v$ is given by $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $c$ is the speed of light. This energy includes both the rest energy ($mc^2$) and the kinetic energy ($K = (\\gamma-1)mc^2$).\n    *   **Total Energy of the System (E_total):** The total energy of the oscillating system is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and the potential energy stored in the field (represented by the spring).\n        $E_{total} = E + U(x) = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Law of Conservation of Energy.**\n    The total energy of the system, $E_{total}$, must remain constant throughout the oscillation. We can analyze the energy at two key points in the motion:\n    *   **Point 1: At maximum amplitude (turning point).**\n        *   The position is $x = A$.\n        *   At the maximum amplitude, the mass momentarily stops before changing direction, so its speed is $v = 0$.\n        *   When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0}} = 1$.\n        *   The total energy at this point is:\n            $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n    *   **Point 2: At the equilibrium position.**\n        *   The position is $x = 0$.\n        *   At the equilibrium position, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy (and thus the speed) is at its maximum. So, $v = v_{max}$.\n        *   The potential energy at this point is $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n        *   The total energy at this point is:\n            $E_{total} = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} + 0 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n\n4.  **Equate the energies and solve for v_max.**\n    Since energy is conserved, the total energy at the turning point must equal the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    Now, we rearrange this equation to solve for $v_{max}$:\n    *   Factor out $mc^2$ on the left side:\n        $mc^2 \\left( 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \\right) = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n    *   Cancel $mc^2$ from both sides:\n        $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n    *   Invert both sides to isolate the square root term:\n        $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n    *   Square both sides:\n        $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n    *   Rearrange the terms to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n    *   Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n        $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n5.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The derived expression for $v_{max}$ is:\n    $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n    This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
