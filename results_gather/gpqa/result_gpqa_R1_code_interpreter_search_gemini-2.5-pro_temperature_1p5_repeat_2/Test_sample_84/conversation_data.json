Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet orbiting a star is given by the formula:\n    T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n    *   R_star is the radius of the star.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (the orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n    *   A is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\n3.  **Form the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]\n    The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are the same for both. It also states that both planets have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Therefore, these terms cancel out in the ratio, simplifying the equation to:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [(R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2)] / [(R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2)]\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^(1/2)\n\n4.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Observations:** To find the ratio a2/a1, we must use the information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's light caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. The maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, known as the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K_star). The relationship is:\n    K_star = c * (Δλ / λ0)\n    where c is the speed of light and λ0 is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\n5.  **Relate K_star to Orbital Parameters:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by:\n    K_star = (M_p * v_p / M_star) * sin(i)\n    where M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, v_p is the planet's orbital velocity, and `i` is the orbital inclination. Since the planets were also detected by the transit method, their orbits must be nearly edge-on, meaning the inclination `i` is close to 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1.\n    The planet's orbital velocity (v_p) is given by v_p = sqrt(G * M_star / a), assuming M_p << M_star.\n    Substituting v_p into the K_star equation:\n    K_star ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\n6.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We rearrange the equation to solve for `a`:\n    K_star^2 ≈ M_p^2 * G / (M_star * a)\n    a ≈ (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K_star^2)\n\n7.  **Find the Ratio a2 / a1:** Now we can form the ratio of the semi-major axes for Planet2 and Planet1:\n    a2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K_star2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K_star1^2)]\n    The terms G and M_star cancel out:\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / M_p1^2) * (K_star1^2 / K_star2^2) = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_star1 / K_star2)^2\n\n8.  **Substitute K_star with Doppler Shift (Δλ):** From step 4, K_star is directly proportional to Δλ. Thus, the ratio K_star1 / K_star2 is equal to the ratio Δλ1 / Δλ2.\n    K_star1 / K_star2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2\n    Substitute this into the expression for a2 / a1:\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2\n\n9.  **Final Calculation:** Now substitute the expression for a2 / a1 back into the temperature ratio equation from step 3:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^(1/2) = sqrt[ (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2 ]\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)\n\n    Now, plug in the given values:\n    *   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n    *   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n    *   Δλ1 = 0.03 Å\n    *   Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04) = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28\n\n10. **Numerical Value:** To find the numerical answer, we perform the division.\n```python\n# Given values for the problem\nMp1_Me = 7  # Mass of Planet 1 in Earth masses\nMp2_Me = 5  # Mass of Planet 2 in Earth masses\ndelta_lambda1_A = 0.03  # Doppler shift due to Planet 1 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda2_A = 0.04  # Doppler shift due to Planet 2 in Angstroms\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is given by the formula:\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\n\n# Calculate the ratio of masses (the units cancel out)\nmass_ratio = Mp2_Me / Mp1_Me\n\n# Calculate the ratio of Doppler shifts (the units cancel out)\nshift_ratio = delta_lambda1_A / delta_lambda2_A\n\n# Calculate the final temperature ratio\ntemp_ratio = mass_ratio * shift_ratio\n\nprint(f\"{temp_ratio:.4f}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.5357\n</execute_result>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.536, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
