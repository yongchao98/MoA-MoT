    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 5: The Melting Point of B**\n    The substance B has a melting point very close to 277 K.\n    277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), where D is Deuterium (²H), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    This is a very strong match. Therefore, substance **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 4: Formation of B from G**\n    Substance G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This indicates that G is likely a deuterated hydrate or a deuteroxide that decomposes upon heating to yield D₂O. For example, a metal deuteroxide `M(OD)n` might decompose to a metal oxide and D₂O.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clues 1, 2, and 3: The Reaction of X and Y**\n    *   Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Since D₂O is a product down the line, this heavier isotope is almost certainly **Deuterium (D)**.\n    *   Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y.\n    *   This reaction releases a gas W \"whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   Let's analyze potential gases (W). Given that Deuterium is involved, let's check hydrogen isotopes:\n        *   H₂ (normal hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Does not fit)\n        *   HD (hydrogen deuteride): 2 protons, 1 neutron. (Does not fit)\n        *   **D₂ (dideuterium)**: 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Fits perfectly!)\n    *   For the reaction to produce D₂ gas, both reactants should ideally be rich in Deuterium. So, X is a deuterated compound, and Y is likely D₂O. Let's assume **Y is D₂O**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Clues 7 and 8: Identifying Substance X**\n    *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   We are looking for a common deuterated organic reagent that reacts violently with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate (G). A keto acid (containing R-C(=O)- and -COOH groups, for a total of at least 3 oxygen atoms) is reduced by X to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. This implies the reduction of both the ketone and the carboxylic acid group to alcohol groups (e.g., R-C(=O)-R'-COOH → R-CH(OH)-R'-CH₂(OH), which has two -OH groups, hence 2 oxygens).\n    *   Common reducing agents are NaBH₄ and LiAlH₄. NaBH₄ is not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids. LiAlH₄ (lithium aluminum hydride) is a very powerful reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids. Its analog is **LiAlD₄ (lithium aluminum deuteride)**.\n    *   Let's test if X = LiAlD₄ fits all clues:\n        *   **Heavy isotope:** Yes, it contains Deuterium (D).\n        *   **Organic reagent:** Yes, LiAlH₄ is a very common reagent, and LiAlD₄ is its well-known analog used for isotopic labeling.\n        *   **Reaction with Y = D₂O:** `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`\n        *   **Violent reaction:** Yes, the reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is famously violent. The same applies to LiAlD₄ with D₂O.\n        *   **Gas W:** The reaction produces D₂, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description.\n        *   **Precipitate G:** The products are LiOD (soluble) and Al(OD)₃ (aluminum deuteroxide), which is insoluble and forms a precipitate. So, G = Al(OD)₃.\n        *   **Heating G:** Heating aluminum deuteroxide would cause decomposition: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This releases B = D₂O.\n        *   **Keto acid reduction:** LiAlD₄ is strong enough to reduce a keto acid to a diol, changing the oxygen count from 3 to 2. This fits.\n\n    All clues point to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n5.  **Perform the Final Calculation**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X = LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements present, ordered by atomic number (Z), are Hydrogen (Z=1, present as isotope D), Lithium (Z=3), and Aluminum (Z=13).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   The formula unit is LiAlD₄. We need to sum the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n    *   We use integer atomic mass numbers for this calculation, as is standard for such problems and suggested by the integer options.\n        *   The isotope of Hydrogen is Deuterium (D or ²H), with a mass number of **2**.\n        *   The stable isotope of Aluminum is ²⁷Al, with a mass number of **27**.\n    *   The molecule LiAlD₄ contains:\n        *   Four atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen, as D). Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   One atom of the heaviest element (Aluminum). Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative (summed) mass = (Total mass of D) + (Total mass of Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
