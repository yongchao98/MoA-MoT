These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions.

When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nA) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\nB) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\nC) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione\nD) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a base (sodium ethoxide, NaOEt), the acidic proton on the α-carbon (the CH₂ group between the two carbonyls) is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon is electrophilic due to conjugation with the ester group.\n\n2.  **Mechanism of the Michael Addition:**\n    *   The malonate enolate `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` attacks the β-carbon of the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.\n    *   The π electrons of the C=C double bond shift to the α-carbon, and the electrons of the C=O double bond shift to the oxygen, forming a new enolate intermediate: `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH=C(O⁻)OCH₃`.\n    *   This enolate intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (ethanol, EtOH), typically at the α-carbon, to yield the final, neutral product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure and Name of Product (A):**\n    *   The final product structure is:\n        `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`\n    *   To name this molecule, we need to identify the longest carbon chain that can serve as the parent. The options suggest a \"propane-tricarboxylate\" naming scheme. Let's orient the molecule to fit this system. The structure can be written as:\n        `(MeOOC)CH₂ - CH(p-Tolyl) - CH(COOMe)₂`\n    *   Let's number this as a substituted propane chain: `C(3)H₂(COOMe) - C(2)H(p-Tolyl) - C(1)H(COOMe)₂`.\n    *   This is a propane chain with:\n        *   Two methoxycarbonyl groups at C-1.\n        *   One p-tolyl group at C-2.\n        *   One methoxycarbonyl group at C-3.\n    *   The systematic name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**. This matches the name for compound A in options B and D.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O+) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type and Reactants:**\n    *   This is a **Stork enamine synthesis**, which utilizes an enamine as the nucleophile in a Michael addition.\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon of the enamine system (the C-2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`.\n\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   The β-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms a C-C bond, generating an iminium ion from the enamine part and a resonance-stabilized anion from the nitrile part.\n    *   The anion is protonated.\n    *   Finally, the addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion intermediate back to a ketone.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure and Name of Product (B):**\n    *   The reaction attaches the `CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` fragment (from but-2-enenitrile) to the α-carbon of the original ketone (cyclohexanone).\n    *   The final product is 2-substituted cyclohexanone:\n        `2-[CH(CH₃)CH₂CN]-cyclohexanone`\n    *   To name this product, we can consider the butanenitrile chain as the parent. The chain originating from the acceptor is `N≡C-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-`.\n    *   This is a butanenitrile backbone, numbered `N≡C(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(subst)-C(4)H₃`.\n    *   The substituent on C-3 is the cyclohexanone ring, attached at its C-2 position. The name for this substituent group is `(2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the product name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile` is the enol form, which is not the major product after acidic hydrolysis. This matches the name for compound B in options B and D.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   This is a Michael addition where we need to find the starting Michael donor (reactant C).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`.\n    *   The reaction forms a new bond between the donor's nucleophilic carbon and the acceptor's β-carbon.\n\n2.  **Deduce Reactant C:**\n    *   Let's analyze the product structure. It consists of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring and a `(3-oxobutyl)` side chain `(-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃)`.\n    *   The side chain `(-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃)` is formed from the Michael acceptor, MVK (`CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`), after it gets attacked at the β-carbon (`CH₂=`) and the α-carbon (`=CH-`) gets protonated. This matches perfectly.\n    *   This means the `(3-oxobutyl)` group was added to the Michael donor.\n    *   The remainder of the molecule is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` moiety, and the new bond is at the C-2 position. The C-2 carbon (CH₂) is located between two carbonyl groups, making its protons highly acidic.\n    *   Therefore, the Michael donor (reactant C) must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The base (KOH) deprotonates the C-2 position to form the nucleophilic enolate, which then attacks MVK. This matches the name for compound C in options A and B.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nBy analyzing all three reactions, we have determined:\n*   **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**\n*   **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**\n*   **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\nThis combination of names corresponds exactly to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
