    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid (H3O+).\n*   **Step 1a: Epoxidation.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxy acid like mCPBA results in the formation of an epoxide via a *syn*-addition mechanism (the oxygen atom is added to the same face of the double bond).\n    *   (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. A *syn*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a racemic mixture of enantiomeric epoxides.\n    *   The products are (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. These are a pair of enantiomers.\n*   **Step 1b: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.** The epoxide is then opened by nucleophilic attack of water under acidic conditions. This reaction proceeds via an *anti*-addition mechanism (the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen). This two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) is a standard method for the *anti*-dihydroxylation of an alkene.\n    *   According to the rules of stereochemistry, an *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene yields a *meso* compound (when the substituents on the double bond are identical, as they are here with two propyl groups).\n    *   Let's verify this by considering the products from Step 1a:\n        *   Opening of (4R,5R)-epoxide (an enantiomer) via *anti*-attack by water gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Opening of (4S,5S)-epoxide (the other enantiomer) via *anti*-attack by water also gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (which is the same as (4S,5R)-diol).\n    *   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol is a *meso* compound because it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is the *meso* compound, **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. This is a single chemical compound.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reactants:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid (H3O+). This is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation reaction.\n*   **Step 2a: Epoxidation.**\n    *   (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene. A *syn*-addition to a *cis*-alkene yields a *meso* epoxide.\n    *   The product is *meso*-4,5-epoxyoctane, which is (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. This is a single achiral, meso compound.\n*   **Step 2b: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.**\n    *   Again, this is an *anti*-addition mechanism. According to the rules of stereochemistry, an *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene yields a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   Let's verify this by considering the product from Step 2a:\n        *   The *meso* epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane, has two enantiotopic carbon atoms (C4 and C5).\n        *   *Anti*-attack by water at C4 (the R center) will invert its configuration to S, leaving C5 as S. The product is **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   *Anti*-attack by water at C5 (the S center) will invert its configuration to R, leaving C4 as R. The product is **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   These two products, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers and are formed in equal amounts.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. This consists of two different compounds (enantiomers).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products of both reactions. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n1.  **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the *meso* compound from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (one enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the other enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n\nThe *meso* compound is a diastereomer of each of the enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties. The *meso* compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It will have a different retention time and elute as a separate peak.\n    *   Thus, the achiral HPLC will show **2 peaks**: one for the racemic pair and one for the meso compound.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral column will differentiate between the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers, causing them to elute at different times. This will result in two separate peaks.\n    *   The *meso* compound is also a distinct molecule and will have its own unique retention time, different from both enantiomers. It will produce a third peak.\n    *   Thus, the chiral HPLC will resolve all three stereoisomers present in the mixture, resulting in **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
