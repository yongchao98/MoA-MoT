    "SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It is a theoretical framework that extends the Standard Model (SM) by adding higher-dimensional operators. These operators are suppressed by a high-energy scale, Î›, and represent the low-energy effects of some unknown new physics. The construction of SMEFT is based on a set of fundamental principles and symmetries.\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** This is a fundamental spacetime symmetry that relates the observations of different inertial observers. It is a cornerstone of special relativity and all modern quantum field theories, including the Standard Model. SMEFT operators are constructed as Lorentz scalars, meaning they are invariant under Lorentz transformations (boosts and rotations). Therefore, Lorentz symmetry **must** be respected.\n\n2.  **Poincare Symmetry:** This is the full symmetry group of spacetime in special relativity, which includes Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations. Invariance under translations leads to the conservation of energy and momentum. Like Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry is a fundamental assumption in the construction of any standard quantum field theory, including SMEFT. All terms in the SMEFT Lagrangian, including the higher-dimensional operators, are required to be invariant under the Poincare group. Therefore, Poincare symmetry **must** be respected.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry:** This is the combination of Charge Conjugation (C) and Parity (P) symmetry. It is well-established experimentally that CP symmetry is violated in nature, specifically by the weak interactions within the Standard Model itself (due to the complex phase in the CKM matrix). Since SMEFT is an extension of the Standard Model, it must accommodate this known violation. Furthermore, the higher-dimensional operators in SMEFT can introduce new sources of CP violation beyond the SM. Therefore, CP symmetry is **not** a required symmetry that all SMEFT operators must respect.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry:** This is the combination of Charge Conjugation (C), Parity (P), and Time Reversal (T) symmetry. The CPT theorem is a fundamental theorem in quantum field theory which states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be CPT-invariant. SMEFT is constructed precisely as a local and Lorentz-invariant theory. Therefore, all operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian **must** respect CPT symmetry.\n\nIn summary:\n- Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected.\n- Poincare symmetry (2) must be respected.\n- CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily respected.\n- CPT symmetry (4) must be respected.\n\nThe symmetries that must be respected are 1, 2, and 4. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
