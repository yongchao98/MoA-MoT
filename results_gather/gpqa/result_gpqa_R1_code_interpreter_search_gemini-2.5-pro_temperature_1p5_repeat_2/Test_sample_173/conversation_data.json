    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Define Initial and Final State Parameters**\n\n*   Initial State:\n    *   An atomic nucleus at rest.\n    *   Initial rest mass = M.\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy = E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV.\n    *   Initial momentum = P_initial = 0.\n\n*   Final State:\n    *   Two fragments with rest masses m1 and m2.\n    *   m1 is the more massive fragment, so m1 = 2 * m2.\n    *   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest Masses of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations for m1 and m2:\n1.  m1 = 2 * m2\n2.  m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M\n3 * m2 = 0.99 * M\nm2 = 0.33 * M\n\nNow find m1:\nm1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M\n\nNext, we convert these masses to their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1 (m1*c^2):\n    m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2 (m2*c^2):\n    m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy.\n*   Q = E_initial_rest - E_final_rest\n*   Q = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: Q = T1 + T2.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p^2 / (2m), where p is the momentum.\n*   From the conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the final momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: |p1| = |p2| = p.\n*   The kinetic energies are T1_cl = p^2 / (2*m1) and T2_cl = p^2 / (2*m2).\n*   We can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n    T1_cl / T2_cl = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1.\n*   Since m1 = 2*m2, the ratio is T1_cl / T2_cl = 1/2, which means T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl.\n*   The total kinetic energy is Q = T1_cl + T2_cl.\n*   Substitute T2_cl: Q = T1_cl + 2*T1_cl = 3*T1_cl.\n*   Therefore, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment in the classical approximation is:\n    T1_cl = Q / 3 = 3 GeV / 3 = 1 GeV.\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using the Correct Relativistic Formulas**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, we use the conservation of total energy and momentum.\n*   **Conservation of Total Energy:**\n    E_initial = E_final\n    M*c^2 = E1 + E2, where E1 and E2 are the total energies (rest energy + kinetic energy) of the fragments.\n    300 GeV = (T1 + m1*c^2) + (T2 + m2*c^2)\n    300 GeV = E1 + E2\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    p1 = -p2 => |p1| = |p2| = p.\n*   We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2.\n    This gives us (p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2.\n*   Since the magnitudes of the momenta are equal, (p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2:\n    E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2\n    E1^2 - E2^2 = (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2\n    (E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1*c^2 - m2*c^2)(m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)\n*   Substitute the known values:\n    *   E1 + E2 = 300 GeV\n    *   m1*c^2 = 198 GeV\n    *   m2*c^2 = 99 GeV\n    (E1 - E2) * (300 GeV) = (198 GeV - 99 GeV) * (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\n    (E1 - E2) * 300 = (99) * (297)\n    E1 - E2 = (99 * 297) / 300 = 98.01 GeV.\n*   Now we have a system of two linear equations for E1 and E2:\n    1.  E1 + E2 = 300 GeV\n    2.  E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV\n*   Add the two equations to solve for E1 (the total energy of the more massive fragment):\n    2 * E1 = 398.01 GeV\n    E1 = 199.005 GeV.\n*   The (correct) relativistic kinetic energy T1 is the total energy E1 minus the rest-mass energy m1*c^2:\n    T1 = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV.\n\n**6. Calculate the Difference**\n\nThe difference is between the correct relativistic value (T1) and the classical approximation (T1_cl).\n*   Difference = T1 - T1_cl\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV.\n\nFinally, convert the answer to Mega-electron Volts (MeV). Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV:\n*   Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
