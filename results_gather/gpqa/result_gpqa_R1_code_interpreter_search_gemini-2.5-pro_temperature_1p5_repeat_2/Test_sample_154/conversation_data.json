    "An elegant and quick way to solve the problem is as follows. \nFirst, we identify the operator $P_z$ from the given description of its matrix representation. The rows are given, so we can write the matrix as:\n$P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe problem states that the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$.

    "The user wants me to solve a quantum mechanics problem.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the uncertainty in the measurement of the operator $P_z$, denoted by $\\Delta P_z$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Uncertainty:** The uncertainty of an operator A is given by the standard deviation, calculated from the variance:\n    $(\\Delta A)^2 = \\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2$\n    For our problem, this becomes:\n    $(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2$\n\n3.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The matrix representation of the operator $P_z$ in its own eigenbasis is given by its rows:\n        Row 1: $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$\n        Row 2: $(0, 0, 0)$\n        Row 3: $(0, 0, -\\hbar)$\n        So, the matrix is:\n        $P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    *   The state of the system, $|\\psi\\rangle$, is given as a column vector:\n        $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Analyze the Basis and State:** The problem states that the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. This is a crucial piece of information. Since $P_z$ is a diagonal matrix in this basis, its diagonal elements are its eigenvalues.\n    *   The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $p_1 = \\hbar$, $p_2 = 0$, and $p_3 = -\\hbar$.\n    *   The state vector $|\\psi\\rangle$ is expressed in this same basis. The components of the vector, $c_i$, are the probability amplitudes of finding the system in the corresponding eigenstate.\n        *   Amplitude for eigenvalue $\\hbar$: $c_1 = -1/2$\n        *   Amplitude for eigenvalue $0$: $c_2 = 1/\\sqrt{2}$\n        *   Amplitude for eigenvalue $-\\hbar$: $c_3 = -1/2$\n\n5.  **Calculate Probabilities:** The probability of measuring a specific eigenvalue $p_i$ is given by the square of the magnitude of its amplitude, $P(p_i) = |c_i|^2$.\n    *   Probability of measuring $\\hbar$: $P(\\hbar) = |-1/2|^2 = 1/4$\n    *   Probability of measuring $0$: $P(0) = |1/\\sqrt{2}|^2 = 1/2$\n    *   Probability of measuring $-\\hbar$: $P(-\\hbar) = |-1/2|^2 = 1/4$\n    *(Self-check: The probabilities sum to 1. $1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1$. The state vector is correctly normalized.)*\n\n6.  **Calculate the Expectation Values:**\n    *   **Calculate $\\langle P_z \\rangle$ (the mean value):** The expectation value is the sum of each eigenvalue multiplied by its probability.\n        $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\sum_i p_i P(p_i)$\n        $\\langle P_z \\rangle = (\\hbar) \\cdot (1/4) + (0) \\cdot (1/2) + (-\\hbar) \\cdot (1/4)$\n        $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{4} + 0 - \\frac{\\hbar}{4} = 0$\n\n    *   **Calculate $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$ (the mean of the square):** The expectation value of $P_z^2$ is the sum of each eigenvalue-squared multiplied by its probability.\n        $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\sum_i p_i^2 P(p_i)$\n        $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (\\hbar)^2 \\cdot (1/4) + (0)^2 \\cdot (1/2) + (-\\hbar)^2 \\cdot (1/4)$\n        $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{2\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Uncertainty:** Now, substitute the calculated expectation values into the uncertainty formula.\n    $(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2$\n    $(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    A) $\\sqrt{2}\\hbar$\n    B) $\\hbar/2$\n    C) $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$\n    D) $\\hbar$\n    The calculated result matches option C.\n\n9.  **Verification with Code Output:**\n    The provided Python code calculates the same quantity using matrix algebra.\n    The output `The calculated uncertainty Delta Pz is 0.7071067811865476 times hbar.` confirms the result.\n    Since $1/\\sqrt{2} \\approx 0.7071067811865476$, the code's output is numerically equivalent to $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThis confirms the final answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
