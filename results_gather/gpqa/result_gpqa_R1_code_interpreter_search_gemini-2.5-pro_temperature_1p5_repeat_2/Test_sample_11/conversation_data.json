    "This problem involves the decay of a stationary positive pion (Pi+) into a positive muon (mu+) and a muon neutrino (nu). We need to find the kinetic energies of the two product particles.\n\nThe decay process is:\n`Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu`\n\nHere are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the conservation laws:** In any particle decay, both energy and momentum must be conserved.\n2.  **Set up the conservation equations:** We will use the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum to establish a system of equations.\n3.  **Solve for the energies of the products:** Using the equations and the given rest masses, we can solve for the total energies of the product particles.\n4.  **Calculate the kinetic energies:** The kinetic energy of a particle is its total energy minus its rest mass energy.\n\n### Detailed Reasoning:\n\n**Given:**\n*   Rest mass of Pi(+), `m_pi` = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of mu(+), `m_mu` = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The initial Pi(+) is stationary.\n*   We will assume the neutrino (nu) is massless, which is a standard approximation in this type of problem. So, rest mass of nu, `m_nu` = 0.\n\n**1. Conservation of Momentum:**\n*   The initial Pi(+) is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero (`p_initial = 0`).\n*   According to the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the final products must also be zero.\n*   This means the muon (mu+) and the neutrino (nu) must be emitted in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this momentum magnitude `p`.\n    `|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p`\n\n**2. Conservation of Energy:**\n*   The initial energy of the stationary Pi(+) is its rest mass energy: `E_initial = m_pi * c^2`.\n*   The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (`E_mu`) and the neutrino (`E_nu`): `E_final = E_mu + E_nu`.\n*   By conservation of energy, `E_initial = E_final`:\n    `m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu`  (Equation 1)\n\n**3. Using Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\nThe total energy `E` of a particle is related to its rest mass `m` and momentum `p` by the equation:\n`E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n\n*   For the muon (mu+):\n    `E_mu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`  (Equation 2)\n\n*   For the massless neutrino (nu):\n    `E_nu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (0 * c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2`\n    Therefore, `E_nu = p*c`\n\n**4. Solving for the Energies:**\nWe can now solve for the unknown energies.\n\n*   Substitute `p*c = E_nu` into Equation 2:\n    `E_mu^2 = E_nu^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\n*   From Equation 1, express `E_mu` in terms of `E_nu`:\n    `E_mu = m_pi * c^2 - E_nu`\n\n*   Substitute this expression for `E_mu` into the previous equation:\n    `(m_pi * c^2 - E_nu)^2 = E_nu^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\n*   Expand the left side:\n    `(m_pi * c^2)^2 - 2 * (m_pi * c^2) * E_nu + E_nu^2 = E_nu^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\n*   The `E_nu^2` terms cancel out. Now, solve for `E_nu`:\n    `2 * (m_pi * c^2) * E_nu = (m_pi * c^2)^2 - (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n    `E_nu = [ (m_pi * c^2)^2 - (m_mu * c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * (m_pi * c^2) ]`\n\n**5. Calculating the Numerical Values:**\nWe can now plug in the given rest mass energy values (in MeV).\n*   `m_pi * c^2` = 139.6 MeV\n*   `m_mu * c^2` = 105.7 MeV\n\n*   **Energy of the Neutrino (`E_nu`):**\n    `E_nu = (139.6^2 - 105.7^2) / (2 * 139.6)`\n    `E_nu = (19488.16 - 11172.49) / 279.2`\n    `E_nu = 8315.67 / 279.2`\n    `E_nu ≈ 29.78 MeV`\n\nSince the neutrino is massless, its total energy is its kinetic energy:\n`KE_nu = E_nu ≈ 29.8 MeV`\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (`KE_mu`):**\n    The total energy released in the decay is the difference in rest mass energies, which is converted into the kinetic energies of the products.\n    `KE_total = KE_mu + KE_nu = (m_pi - m_mu) * c^2`\n    `KE_total = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV`\n\n    Now, we can find the kinetic energy of the muon:\n    `KE_mu = KE_total - KE_nu`\n    `KE_mu = 33.9 MeV - 29.78 MeV`\n    `KE_mu ≈ 4.12 MeV`\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon (mu+) and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino (nu).\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nB) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nC) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nD) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\nOur calculated values match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
