    "This problem involves an elimination-addition reaction, which proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. Let's break down the reaction step-by-step to identify all possible products.\n\n**1. Reactants and Conditions:**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. The structure is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base.\n\n**2. Reaction Mechanism: Elimination-Addition**\n\nThe reaction proceeds in two main stages: elimination to form a benzyne intermediate, and then addition of a nucleophile to the benzyne.\n\n**Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n\nThe strong base, amide ion (NH2-), abstracts an acidic proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions:\n*   **C2**, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n*   **C6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n\nThis leads to two possible elimination pathways:\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The amide ion abstracts the proton from C6. This is the kinetically favored pathway because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect).\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C6 then loses the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected in this process. The intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The amide ion abstracts the deuteron from C2. This pathway is slower than Pathway A but is still possible.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C2 then loses the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was removed, this is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed in the reaction mixture: 3-deuterobenzyne and benzyne.\n\n**Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne Intermediates)**\n\nThe amide ion (NH2-), which is also a good nucleophile, attacks one of the sp-hybridized carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Reaction from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium at C2. The NH2- nucleophile can attack either C1 or C6.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group attaches to C1. A negative charge develops on C6. Protonation of C6 by ammonia (NH3) yields a product where the -NH2 group is at C1 and the deuterium is at C2. This product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH2 group attaches to C6. A negative charge develops on C1. Protonation of C1 by ammonia yields a product where the -NH2 group is at C6 and the deuterium is at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH2 group the lowest number (position 1), the deuterium atom is at position 3. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Reaction from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    This intermediate is the simple, unsubstituted benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n    1.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** Due to the symmetry of the intermediate, attack at either C1 or C2 results in the formation of the same product after protonation. The product is **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\n**Summary of Products:**\nCombining the products from all possible pathways, we have:\n\n1.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n2.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n\nThese three molecules are distinct chemical compounds (isotopomers). Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<A>>>"
