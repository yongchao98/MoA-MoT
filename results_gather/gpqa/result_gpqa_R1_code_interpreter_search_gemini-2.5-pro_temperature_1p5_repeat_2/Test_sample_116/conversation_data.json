    "**1. Analysis of dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The structure consists of two phenyl rings linked by a carbon-carbon single bond. There are substituents at the positions ortho to this bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). Specifically, two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) are at positions 2 and 2', and two nitro groups (-NO2) are at positions 6 and 6'.\n*   **Source of Chirality (Atropisomerism):** In biphenyl systems, if there are bulky substituents at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6'), they can sterically hinder the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation can lock the molecule into a non-planar, twisted conformation.\n*   **Chirality Check:** For this specific molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups (-NO2 and -COOCH3). This severely restricts rotation. The resulting twisted conformation lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making it non-superimposable on its mirror image. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism, which is a type of axial chirality. Therefore, this compound is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**2. Analysis of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Structure:** The chemical name describes an ester derived from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid) and methanol. Its structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n*   **Source of Chirality (Chiral Center):** A common source of chirality in organic molecules is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Chirality Check:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group). The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n*   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus optically active. It can exist as two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).\n\n**3. Analysis of benzophenone**\n\n*   **Structure:** Benzophenone is also known as diphenyl ketone. Its structure is (C6H5)2C=O, where a central carbonyl group is attached to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Chirality Check:** To be optically active, a molecule must be chiral (not superimposable on its mirror image). A simple way to check for this is to look for elements of symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry. The benzophenone molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral. Therefore, benzophenone is not optically active.\n\n**4. Analysis of dimethyl fumarate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides (*trans*) of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Chirality Check:** The molecule is planar due to the sp2 hybridization of the carbons in the double bond.\n    *   It has a plane of symmetry which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n    *   It also possesses a center of inversion (or center of symmetry) located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n*   The presence of these symmetry elements means the molecule is achiral and therefore not optically active.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Compound 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) shows optical isomerism due to atropisomerism.\n*   Compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) shows optical isomerism due to a chiral center.\n*   Compound 3 (benzophenone) is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate) is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
