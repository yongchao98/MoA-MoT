    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the eigenvector.\n\n**1. Define the Quantum Mechanical Operator**\n\nThe problem provides the components of the operator $\\vec{P}$ as:\n*   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThese are the spin angular momentum operators for a spin-1/2 particle, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant. The matrices are the Pauli matrices $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$.\n\n**2. Define the Direction Vector**\n\nThe direction $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary unit vector lying in the x-z plane. In spherical coordinates, a general unit vector is described by angles $\\theta$ (polar angle) and $\\phi$ (azimuthal angle):\n$\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$\n\nSince the vector lies in the x-z plane, its y-component must be zero. This requires $\\sin\\phi = 0$, which implies $\\phi = 0$ or $\\phi = \\pi$. We can choose $\\phi = 0$ without loss of generality, as the angle $\\theta$ can still describe any direction in the plane.\nThus, the unit vector is:\n$\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\n\n**3. Construct the Operator in the Direction $\\vec{n}$**\n\nThe operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$:\n$P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\nSubstituting the components of $\\vec{P}$ and $\\vec{n}$:\n$P_n = P_x (\\sin\\theta) + P_y (0) + P_z (\\cos\\theta)$\n$P_n = (\\sin\\theta) P_x + (\\cos\\theta) P_z$\n\nNow, substitute the matrix forms of $P_x$ and $P_z$:\n$P_n = \\sin\\theta \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) + \\cos\\theta \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\nCombine the matrices:\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left[ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right]$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**4. Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. Let the eigenvector be represented by the column vector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n$P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe can cancel the constant $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis matrix equation yields a system of two linear equations:\n1.  $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n2.  $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\nFrom the first equation:\n$b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n\nUsing the trigonometric half-angle identities $\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$ and $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$:\n$b \\cdot [2 \\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)] = a \\cdot [2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)]$\nAssuming $\\sin(\\theta/2) \\neq 0$ (i.e., $\\theta \\neq 0$), we can divide both sides by $2\\sin(\\theta/2)$:\n$b \\cos(\\theta/2) = a \\sin(\\theta/2)$\nThis gives the relationship between the components $a$ and $b$:\n$b = a \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nSo the eigenvector has the form:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = a \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nTo simplify and prepare for normalization, we can choose a convenient form for 'a'. Let $a = C \\cos(\\theta/2)$, where $C$ is a normalization constant.\nThen $b = (C \\cos(\\theta/2)) \\tan(\\theta/2) = C \\sin(\\theta/2)$.\nThe eigenvector is then:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**5. Normalize the Eigenvector**\n\nThe norm of the state vector must be 1, i.e., $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$.\n$\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = \\left( C^* (\\cos(\\theta/2) \\quad \\sin(\\theta/2)) \\right) \\left( C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$= |C|^2 (\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2))$\nUsing the identity $\\cos^2(x) + \\sin^2(x) = 1$:\n$|C|^2 (1) = 1 \\implies |C| = 1$\n\nWe can choose the simplest phase, $C=1$. The normalized eigenvector is:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe elements of this normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
