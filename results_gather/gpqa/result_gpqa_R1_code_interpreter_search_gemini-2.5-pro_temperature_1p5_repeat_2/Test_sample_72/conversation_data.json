    "Here's my thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** I need to find two quantities for a system of two astronauts:\n    *   The relative speed (`v_rel`) between them.\n    *   The total energy (`E_total`) of the system.\n\n2.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Mass of astronaut 1 (`m1`) = `2m`\n    *   Speed of astronaut 1 (`v1`) = `0.6c` (in the positive x-direction)\n    *   Mass of astronaut 2 (`m2`) = `3m`\n    *   Speed of astronaut 2 (`v2`) = `0.5c` (in the positive x-direction)\n    *   `c` is the speed of light.\n\n3.  **Plan the Calculation for Relative Speed (`v_rel`):**\n    *   Since the speeds are relativistic (a significant fraction of the speed of light), I cannot use the simple classical formula `v_rel = v1 - v2`.\n    *   I must use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. The formula for adding velocities is `v_add = (u + v) / (1 + uv/c^2)`. The subtraction formula is similar:\n        `v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n    *   I will substitute the given values `v1 = 0.6c` and `v2 = 0.5c` into this formula.\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation for Relative Speed:**\n    *   `v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n    *   `v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.30c^2 / c^2)`\n    *   The `c^2` terms cancel in the denominator: `v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.30)`\n    *   `v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7`\n    *   `v_rel = (1/7)c`\n    *   Now, I'll convert the fraction `1/7` to a decimal: `1 / 7 ≈ 0.1428...`\n    *   So, `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`.\n\n5.  **Analyze Intermediate Results:**\n    *   My calculated relative speed is `0.14c`.\n    *   Looking at the options:\n        *   A) `v_rel = 0.1c` - Incorrect.\n        *   B) `v_rel = 0.14c` - Possible.\n        *   C) `v_rel = 0.14c` - Possible.\n        *   D) `v_rel = 1.1c` - Incorrect (relative speed cannot be greater than c).\n    *   The correct answer must be either B or C. Now I need to calculate the total energy to distinguish between them.\n\n6.  **Plan the Calculation for Total Energy (`E_total`):**\n    *   The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts: `E_total = E1 + E2`.\n    *   The formula for the total energy of a single relativistic particle is `E = γmc^2`, where `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is `1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`.\n    *   I need to calculate the Lorentz factor for each astronaut (`γ1` and `γ2`) separately.\n    *   Then, I will calculate the energy for each astronaut (`E1` and `E2`).\n    *   Finally, I will add `E1` and `E2` to get `E_total`.\n\n7.  **Execute the Calculation for Total Energy:**\n    *   **Astronaut 1:**\n        *   `v1 = 0.6c`\n        *   `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n        *   `E1 = γ1 * m1 * c^2 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2 = 2.5mc^2`\n    *   **Astronaut 2:**\n        *   `v2 = 0.5c`\n        *   `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75)`\n        *   `E2 = γ2 * m2 * c^2 = (1 / sqrt(0.75)) * (3m) * c^2`\n    *   **Total Energy:**\n        *   `E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5mc^2 + (3 / sqrt(0.75))mc^2`\n        *   I will use a calculator to find the value of `3 / sqrt(0.75)`.\n\n8.  **Use Python for Precision:** To avoid rounding errors and confirm the calculation, I'll use a small Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nm1 = 2\nv1 = 0.6\nm2 = 3\nv2 = 0.5\n\n# --- Calculate Relative Speed ---\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - v1 * v2)\nprint(f\"Relative speed (in terms of c): {v_rel:.3f}c\")\n\n# --- Calculate Total Energy ---\n\n# Lorentz factor for astronaut 1\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v1**2)\n# Energy for astronaut 1 (in terms of mc^2)\nE1 = gamma1 * m1\n\n# Lorentz factor for astronaut 2\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v2**2)\n# Energy for astronaut 2 (in terms of mc^2)\nE2 = gamma2 * m2\n\n# Total energy\nE_total = E1 + E2\nprint(f\"Total energy (in terms of mc^2): {E_total:.3f}mc^2\")\n```\n> **Execution Output:**\n> ```\n> Relative speed (in terms of c): 0.143c\n> Total energy (in terms of mc^2): 5.964mc^2\n> ```\n\n9.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The python code confirms my manual calculations.\n    *   The relative speed `v_rel` is approximately `0.143c`, which rounds to `0.14c`.\n    *   The total energy `E_total` is approximately `5.964mc^2`, which rounds to `5.96mc^2`.\n    *   These results (`v_rel = 0.14c` and `E = 5.96mc^2`) match option B perfectly.\n\n<<<B>>>",
