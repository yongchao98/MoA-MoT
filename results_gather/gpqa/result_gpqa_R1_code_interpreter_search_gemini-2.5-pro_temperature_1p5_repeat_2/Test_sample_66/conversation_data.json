    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial and final states.**\n    *   The initial state of the 2-electron system is the coupled angular momentum state $|\\Psi_{initial}> = |l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$. Here, $l_1=1, l_2=1$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons (since they are in p orbitals). $l=2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, and $m=-1$ is the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum.\n    *   The measurement is of the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   We want to find the probability of getting an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ and an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{z}$ is $m_l\\hbar$. Therefore, getting an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the state having $m_{l1}=-1$. Similarly, for $L_{2z}$, it corresponds to $m_{l2}=-1$.\n    *   The final state we are projecting onto is the uncoupled state $|\\Psi_{final}> = |l_1, m_{l1}> |l_2, m_{l2}> = |1, -1> |1, -1>$.\n\n2.  **Relate the initial and final states using the principles of quantum mechanics.**\n    *   In quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a system, initially in state $|\\Psi_{initial}>$, to be in a specific state $|\\Psi_{final}>$ is given by the square of the modulus of the inner product (or projection) of the two states:\n        $P = |<\\Psi_{final} | \\Psi_{initial}>|^2$\n    *   Substituting our states, the probability is:\n        $P = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$\n    *   The term $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which gives the amplitude of the uncoupled state $|m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1>$ in the expansion of the coupled state $|l=2, m=-1>$.\n\n3.  **Apply the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.**\n    *   The total z-component of the angular momentum operator is the sum of the individual components: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   The quantum numbers are similarly related: $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$. This is a fundamental selection rule.\n    *   For the initial state, $|1, 1, 2, -1>$, the total z-component quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the final state we are interested in, $|1, -1>|1, -1>$, the individual quantum numbers are $m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$.\n    *   Let's check the sum for the final state: $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Since the total $m$ of the initial state ($m=-1$) is not equal to the sum of the individual $m_l$ values in the target final state ($m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -2$), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient must be zero. This is because the uncoupled state $|1, -1>|1, -1>$ does not contribute to the expansion of the coupled state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n\n4.  **Formal orthogonality argument.**\n    *   The initial state $|\\Psi_{initial}> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$ is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum z-component operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n        $L_z |\\Psi_{initial}> = -\\hbar |\\Psi_{initial}>$\n    *   The final state $|\\Psi_{final}> = |1, -1> |1, -1>$ is also an eigenstate of $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. The eigenvalue is $(m_{l1}+m_{l2})\\hbar = (-1-1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$.\n        $L_z |\\Psi_{final}> = -2\\hbar |\\Psi_{final}>$\n    *   Since $|\\Psi_{initial}>$ and $|\\Psi_{final}>$ are eigenstates of the same Hermitian operator ($L_z$) but have different eigenvalues ($-1\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$), they must be orthogonal.\n    *   Therefore, their inner product is zero: $<\\Psi_{final} | \\Psi_{initial}> = 0$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the probability.**\n    *   The probability is the square of the modulus of this inner product.\n        $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nThus, the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is 0.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.physics.quantum.cg import CG\n\n# Define the quantum numbers from the problem statement\n# Initial coupled state |l1, l2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>\nj1 = 1\nj2 = 1\nJ = 2\nM = -1\n\n# Desired measurement outcome corresponds to the uncoupled state |l1, m_l1> |l2, m_l2>\n# Eigenvalue of L_1z = -hbar -> m_l1 = -1\n# Eigenvalue of L_2z = -hbar -> m_l2 = -1\nm1 = -1\nm2 = -1\n\n# The probability amplitude of finding the system in the state |m1, m2> is\n# given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient <j1, m1; j2, m2 | J, M>.\n# The selection rule is M = m1 + m2.\n# Here, M = -1, but m1 + m2 = -1 + (-1) = -2.\n# Since -1 != -2, the coefficient must be 0.\n\n# Let's verify this using the sympy library.\ncg_coefficient = CG(j1, m1, j2, m2, J, M).doit()\n\n# The probability is the square of the magnitude of this coefficient.\nprobability = abs(cg_coefficient)**2\n\nprint(f\"The initial state is |l={J}, m={M}>\")\nprint(f\"The measurement is for the outcome |m1={m1}, m2={m2}>\")\nprint(f\"The selection rule m = m1 + m2 gives {M} = {m1} + {m2}, which is {M} = {m1+m2}.\")\nprint(f\"Since the condition is not met, the amplitude must be zero.\")\nprint(f\"Calculated Clebsch-Gordan coefficient: {cg_coefficient}\")\nprint(f\"The probability is the square of the coefficient: {probability}\")\n```\n>>>\nout: The initial state is |l=2, m=-1>\nout: The measurement is for the outcome |m1=-1, m2=-1>\nout: The selection rule m = m1 + m2 gives -1 = -1 + -1, which is -1 = -2.\nout: Since the condition is not met, the amplitude must be zero.\nout: Calculated Clebsch-Gordan coefficient: 0\nout: The probability is the square of the coefficient: 0\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the probability of a specific measurement outcome given an initial quantum state.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State:**\nThe system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital ($l_1=1, l_2=1$). Their angular momenta are coupled to form a total angular momentum state. The initial state is given as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n*   $l_1 = 1$: orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 1.\n*   $l_2 = 1$: orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 2.\n*   $l = 2$: total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the 2-electron system.\n*   $m = -1$: the magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum, $L_z$. The eigenvalue of $L_z$ is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n**2. Understand the Measurement and Final State:**\nWe are performing a measurement on the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n*   We want to find the probability of getting an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$. This corresponds to the first electron being in a state with magnetic quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n*   We want to find the probability of getting an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$. This corresponds to the second electron being in a state with magnetic quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\nThe final state we are projecting onto is the uncoupled state defined by these measurement outcomes: $|l_1, m_{l1}\\rangle |l_2, m_{l2}\\rangle = |1, -1\\rangle |1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n**3. Apply the Rules of Quantum Mechanics:**\nThe probability, P, of finding the system in the final state after measurement is given by the square of the magnitude of the inner product of the initial and final states:\n$P = |\\langle \\text{final state} | \\text{initial state} \\rangle|^2$\n$P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1; 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe term $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1; 2, -1 \\rangle$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. These coefficients are used to transform states from the coupled basis to the uncoupled basis.\n\n**4. Use the Conservation of Angular Momentum (The Selection Rule):**\nA fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This means the quantum numbers must add up:\n$m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\nLet's check if this rule is satisfied for our states:\n*   From the initial state, $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we have $m = -1$.\n*   From the desired final state, $|1, -1\\rangle |1, -1\\rangle$, we have $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$. Their sum is $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\nSince $m \\neq m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ (because $-1 \\neq -2$), the transition is forbidden. This means the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n$\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1; 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Probability:**\nThe probability is the square of the magnitude of this coefficient:\n$P = |0|^2 = 0$\n\nTherefore, the joint probability of getting the specified eigenvalues is 0. This outcome is physically impossible because it violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n<<<C>>>"
