    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the most effective mutation:\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to find a mutation that eliminates the production of an anti-nutritional compound. This means we are looking for a mutation that will most likely create a non-functional gene product (protein).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Intact Gene:**\n    *   The sequence starts with `5’-ATG...`, which is the start codon for translation, coding for the amino acid Methionine (Met).\n    *   Translation reads the DNA sequence in groups of three bases called codons.\n    *   Let's break down the beginning of the intact gene's coding sequence into codons and their corresponding amino acids:\n        *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met)\n        *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n        *   `CTC` -> Leucine (Leu)\n        *   `GCT` -> Alanine (Ala)\n        *   `GGT` -> Glycine (Gly)\n        *   ... and so on.\n    *   The full-length, functional protein is synthesized from this sequence.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Mutant:** We need to compare each mutant sequence to the intact gene to understand the type of mutation and its likely consequence on the final protein. The most desirable mutation is a \"knockout\" or \"null\" mutation, which completely abolishes protein function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCT...**\n        *   Intact Codons: `ATG TTT CTC ...`\n        *   Mutant Codons: `ATG TTC TAC ...`\n        *   Changes:\n            *   Codon 2: `TTT` -> `TTC`. Both codons code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a **silent mutation** and has no effect on the protein sequence.\n            *   Codon 3: `CTC` (Leucine) -> `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It changes one amino acid in the protein chain. While this *could* disrupt the protein's function, it is not guaranteed. The protein will still be full-length, and the function might only be altered, not eliminated.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCT...**\n        *   Intact Codons: `ATG TTT CTC ...`\n        *   Mutant Codons: `ATG TTT TAC ...`\n        *   Change:\n            *   Codon 3: `CTC` (Leucine) -> `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is another **missense mutation**, identical in effect to the main change in Mutant 1. It is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACT...**\n        *   Intact Sequence: `...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`\n        *   Mutant Sequence: `...TAC GCT --- ACT...` (Comparing the raw strings reveals that the `GGT` codon has been deleted).\n        *   Change: This mutation involves both a missense change (`CTC`->`TAC`) and an **in-frame deletion** (the `GGT` codon is removed). While deleting an amino acid is more disruptive than just changing one, the rest of the protein is synthesized correctly. This is less likely to be a complete knockout than other types of mutations.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCT...**\n        *   Intact Codons: `ATG TTT CTC ...`\n        *   Mutant Codons: `ATG TTC TAA ...`\n        *   Changes:\n            *   Codon 2: `TTT` -> `TTC`. This is a silent mutation (Phe -> Phe).\n            *   Codon 3: `CTC` (Leucine) -> `TAA` (**STOP**). This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n        *   **Consequence:** The `TAA` codon is one of the three \"stop codons\" that signals the ribosome to terminate translation. This mutation will cause protein synthesis to halt prematurely after only the second amino acid (Phenylalanine) has been added. The resulting product would be a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe). Such a short peptide is completely non-functional and cannot perform the enzymatic activity of the full-length protein.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Of the options presented, the nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most definitive and severe. It guarantees the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This is the most probable mutation to successfully eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. The other mutations (missense, in-frame deletion) result in a full-length or near-full-length protein that might retain some or all of its original function.\n\n<<<C>>>"
