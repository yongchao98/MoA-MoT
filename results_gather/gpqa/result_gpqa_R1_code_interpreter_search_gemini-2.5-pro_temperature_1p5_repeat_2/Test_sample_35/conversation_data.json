    "An absorption line observed from a distant object is subject to cosmological redshift. This means the energy of the photon we observe (E_observed) is lower than the energy it had when it was emitted (E_rest). The relationship between these energies is given by the redshift (z):\n\nE_observed = E_rest / (1 + z)\n\nTherefore, to identify the transition, we must first calculate its rest-frame energy. This requires us to find the redshift (z) corresponding to the distance of the object.\n\n**1. Calculate Redshift (z)**\n\nWe can estimate the redshift from the distance using Hubble's Law: v = H₀ * d, where v is the recessional velocity, d is the distance, and H₀ is the Hubble constant. The redshift is then approximately z ≈ v/c.\n\n*   **Distance (d):** 2.1 Gpc = 2100 Mpc\n*   **Hubble Constant (H₀):** We'll use a standard approximate value, H₀ ≈ 70 km/s/Mpc.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** c ≈ 300,000 km/s\n\nFirst, calculate the recessional velocity (v):\nv = 70 km/s/Mpc * 2100 Mpc = 147,000 km/s\n\nNow, calculate the redshift (z):\nz = v / c = 147,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.49\n\n**2. Calculate Rest-Frame Energy (E_rest)**\n\nNow we can calculate the energy of the absorption line in its own rest frame.\n\n*   **Observed Energy (E_observed):** 3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV\n*   **Redshift (z):** 0.49\n\nE_rest = E_observed * (1 + z)\nE_rest = (3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV) * (1 + 0.49)\nE_rest = (3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV) * 1.49\nE_rest ≈ 5.81 * 10⁻⁶ eV\n\n**3. Identify the Transition**\n\nWe need to identify a known transition in the interstellar medium that corresponds to an energy of approximately 5.81 * 10⁻⁶ eV. It is often easier to work with wavelength or frequency. Let's convert the energy to wavelength (λ).\n\n*   **Planck's Constant (h):** 4.136 × 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** 3.00 × 10⁸ m/s\n*   **Energy-Wavelength Relation:** E = hc/λ  => λ = hc/E\n\nλ = (4.136 × 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s * 3.00 × 10⁸ m/s) / (5.81 * 10⁻⁶ eV)\nλ ≈ 0.214 m = 21.4 cm\n\nA wavelength of ~21 cm is characteristic of the **21-cm line**, which is one of the most important spectral lines in radio astronomy. This line results from a hyperfine transition in the ground state of neutral **atomic hydrogen (H I)**.\n\n**4. Determine the Medium**\n\nThe 21-cm line arises from neutral atomic hydrogen. This eliminates the molecular medium options (B and C). We are left to choose between the \"cold\" and \"warm\" atomic medium.\n\n*   **Warm Atomic Interstellar Medium (WNM):** Temperatures of ~6000-10000 K.\n*   **Cold Atomic Interstellar Medium (CNM):** Temperatures of ~50-100 K.\n\nThe problem states that an **absorption line** was detected. The strength (optical depth) of an absorption line is inversely proportional to the temperature of the gas. Therefore, cold gas produces a much stronger and more easily detectable absorption feature than warm gas. For this reason, 21-cm absorption studies are specifically used to trace the **cold atomic interstellar medium**.\n\nThus, the absorption line corresponds to the 21-cm transition of neutral atomic hydrogen, which is predominantly observed in absorption in the cold atomic interstellar medium.\n\n```python\n# Constants\nd_mpc = 2100  # Distance in Megaparsecs\nH0 = 70  # Hubble constant in km/s/Mpc\nc_kms = 299792.458  # Speed of light in km/s\nE_obs_eV = 3.9e-6  # Observed energy in eV\nh_eVs = 4.135667696e-15  # Planck's constant in eV*s\nc_ms = 299792458 # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# 1.

    "An absorption line observed from a distant galaxy is redshifted, meaning the observed wavelength is longer (and the energy is lower) than the wavelength at which it was emitted. To identify the physical process responsible for the line, we first need to calculate its rest-frame energy.\n\n1.  **Calculate Redshift (z):**\n    We can estimate the redshift from the distance using the Hubble-Lemaître law, v ≈ H₀d, and the relativistic Doppler formula for redshift, z ≈ v/c (for v << c, which is a reasonable first approximation).\n    *   Distance (d) = 2.1 Gpc = 2100 Mpc\n    *   Hubble constant (H₀) ≈ 70 km/s/Mpc\n    *   Speed of light (c) ≈ 300,000 km/s\n\n    First, calculate the recessional velocity (v):\n    v ≈ 70 km/s/Mpc * 2100 Mpc = 147,000 km/s\n\n    Now, calculate the redshift (z):\n    z ≈ v/c = 147,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.49\n\n2.  **Calculate Rest-Frame Energy (E_rest):**\n    The observed energy (E_obs) is related to the rest-frame energy (E_rest) by the redshift:\n    E_rest = E_obs * (1 + z)\n\n    *   Observed Energy (E_obs) = 3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV\n    *   Redshift (z) ≈ 0.49\n\n    E_rest ≈ (3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV) * (1 + 0.49)\n    E_rest ≈ 5.81 * 10⁻⁶ eV\n\n3.  **Identify the Atomic/Molecular Transition:**\n    We need to find a common transition in the interstellar medium that has an energy of approximately 5.81 x 10⁻⁶ eV. This energy corresponds to the well-known **21-cm line** (or 1420 MHz line), which arises from the hyperfine structure transition in the ground state of neutral **atomic hydrogen (H I)**. The precise energy of this transition is about 5.87 x 10⁻⁶ eV, which is in excellent agreement with our calculation.\n\n    Since the transition is from atomic hydrogen, we can eliminate the options involving molecular medium (B and C).\n\n4.  **Identify the State of the Medium:**\n    The 21-cm line can be observed in both emission and absorption.\n    *   **Emission:** Traces the total column density of neutral atomic hydrogen, which exists in both warm and cold phases.\n    *   **Absorption:** Requires a background radio source. The strength of the absorption is inversely proportional to the spin temperature of the gas (T_s). Cold gas (T ~ 50-100 K) produces a much stronger, more easily detectable absorption line than warm gas (T ~ 6000-10000 K). Therefore, observing a 21-cm *absorption* line is the primary method for tracing the **cold atomic interstellar medium (CNM)**.\n\nConclusion: The observation corresponds to the redshifted 21-cm line of atomic hydrogen seen in absorption, which is a characteristic signature of the cold atomic interstellar medium.\n\n<<<A>>>"
