    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the partition function Z for the given system.\n\n### **1. Define the System and its States**\nThe system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3.\nEach spin can take one of two values: +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\nThe total number of possible configurations (microstates) of the system is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.\n\nLet's list all 8 possible states:\n1.  (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n2.  (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1)\n3.  (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1)\n4.  (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1)\n5.  (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1)\n6.  (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1)\n7.  (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1)\n8.  (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n\n### **2. Define the Energy of the System**\nThe energy for any given state is given by the formula:\nE = -J * (S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3)\n\n### **3. Calculate the Energy for Each State**\nWe will now calculate the energy for each of the 8 states. It is useful to first calculate the sum term (S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3).\n\n*   **State 1: (+1, +1, +1)**\n    Sum = (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n    E = -J * (3) = -3J\n\n*   **State 2: (+1, +1, -1)**\n    Sum = (+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1\n    E = -J * (-1) = +J\n\n*   **State 3: (+1, -1, +1)**\n    Sum = (+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1\n    E = -J * (-1) = +J\n\n*   **State 4: (-1, +1, +1)**\n    Sum = (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1\n    E = -J * (-1) = +J\n\n*   **State 5: (+1, -1, -1)**\n    Sum = (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1\n    E = -J * (-1) = +J\n\n*   **State 6: (-1, +1, -1)**\n    Sum = (-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1\n    E = -J * (-1) = +J\n\n*   **State 7: (-1, -1, +1)**\n    Sum = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1\n    E = -J * (-1) = +J\n\n*   **State 8: (-1, -1, -1)**\n    Sum = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n    E = -J * (3) = -3J\n\n### **4. Group States by Energy Level (Degeneracy)**\nWe can see that there are only two distinct energy levels in the system.\n\n*   **Energy Level E₁ = -3J:**\n    This energy occurs for states (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    The number of states with this energy (degeneracy, g₁) is 2.\n\n*   **Energy Level E₂ = +J:**\n    This energy occurs for the other 6 states.\n    The number of states with this energy (degeneracy, g₂) is 6.\n\n### **5. Calculate the Partition Function (Z)**\nThe partition function is the sum over all states of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), where β = 1/kT. We can write this sum by grouping the states with the same energy:\nZ = Σ_i g_i * e^(-βE_i)\n\nSubstituting the energy levels and their degeneracies:\nZ = (g₁ * e^(-βE₁)) + (g₂ * e^(-βE₂))\nZ = (2 * e^(-β(-3J))) + (6 * e^(-β(+J)))\nZ = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
