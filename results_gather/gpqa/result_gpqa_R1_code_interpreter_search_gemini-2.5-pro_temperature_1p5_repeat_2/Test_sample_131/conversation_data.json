    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to identify which two compounds, from a list of four, are present in a 1:1 mixture, based on the provided 1H NMR spectrum data.\n\n**2. Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 ratio of two compounds. This means that for every molecule of compound X, there is one molecule of compound Y.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four options satisfy this condition.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):**\n    *   There are **two signals**.\n    *   Both signals are **singlets**. This means the aromatic protons do not have any adjacent proton neighbors.\n    *   The integration ratio is **1:1**.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):**\n    *   There are **three signals**.\n    *   All three signals are **singlets**. This indicates the protons of the alkyl groups are not coupled to other non-equivalent protons. This is characteristic of methyl (CH3) groups not adjacent to a CH or CH2 group, or an ethyl group where coupling is not resolved or absent.\n    *   The integration ratio is **2:1:1**.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Candidate Compound Individually**\n\nLet's predict the spectrum for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **single singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. They will appear as a **single singlet (12H)**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at position 4 is unique, and the proton at position 6 is unique. They are not adjacent. This will result in **two separate singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the one at C2 is unique (3H); the one at C5 is unique (3H); and the ones at C1 and C3 are equivalent to each other (6H). This will result in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H + 1H), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H + 3H + 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They are adjacent to each other, which would normally create a doublet. However, because they are chemically equivalent, they behave as a singlet in many common cases (an AA' system) or a more complex pattern. Given the simple data, it's most likely treated as a singlet for this level of problem. Assuming they appear as a singlet due to equivalence, this gives a **single singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: those at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H), and those at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H). This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, or **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H + 6H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Structure:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent, resulting in a **single singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 protons will be split by the CH3 protons, creating a **quartet (4H)**. The CH3 protons will be split by the CH2 protons, creating a **triplet (6H)**. The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, so this compound can be immediately **ruled out**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Mixtures Based on the Options**\n\nNow, let's see which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data. We need a combination that results in 2 aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and 3 aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5- gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4- gives one 2H singlet. Total: **Two singlets**. Since it's a 1:1 mixture and both signals represent 2H, their integration ratio is **1:1**. (Matches)\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5- gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4- gives two 6H singlets. Total: **Three singlets**. In a 1:1 mixture, the integration ratio is 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. (Matches)\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect match for the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   This is invalid because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4- gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5- gives two 1H singlets. Total: **Three singlets** (or two if there's accidental overlap), with an expected integration ratio of 2:1:1. This does not match the observed two singlets with a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5- gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5- gives two 1H singlets. Total: **Three singlets** with an expected integration ratio of 2:1:1. This does not match the observed two singlets with a 1:1 ratio.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nThe only combination that produces an NMR spectrum consistent with the experimental data is the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
