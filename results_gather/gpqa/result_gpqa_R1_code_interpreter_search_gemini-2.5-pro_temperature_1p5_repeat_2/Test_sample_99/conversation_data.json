    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify Compound A (C3H6)**\n*   The molecular formula C3H6 corresponds to the general formula CnH2n, which can be an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n*   The reaction is bromination in carbon tetrachloride (Br2/CCl4). This is a characteristic test for unsaturation (double or triple bonds). Alkenes readily undergo addition reactions with Br2/CCl4, while cycloalkanes (except cyclopropane) do not react under these conditions.\n*   Therefore, Compound A must be the alkene, which is **propene (CH3-CH=CH2)**.\n\n**2. Identify Compound B**\n*   Compound A (propene) undergoes bromination. This is an electrophilic addition reaction where a bromine molecule adds across the double bond.\n*   Reaction: CH3-CH=CH2 + Br2 --(CCl4)--> CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br)\n*   Compound B is **1,2-dibromopropane**.\n\n**3. Identify Compound C**\n*   Compound B (1,2-dibromopropane) reacts with alcoholic KOH. This reagent is a strong base that causes dehydrohalogenation (removal of H and a halogen).\n*   Since there are two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons (a vicinal dihalide), a double dehydrohalogenation occurs, eliminating two molecules of HBr to form an alkyne.\n*   Reaction: CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br) + 2 KOH (alcoholic) → CH3-C≡CH + 2 KBr + 2 H2O\n*   Compound C is **propyne**.\n\n**4. Identify Compound D**\n*   Compound C (propyne) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. This condition causes the cyclic polymerization (trimerization) of alkynes to form aromatic compounds.\n*   Three molecules of propyne (CH3-C≡CH) will polymerize to form a substituted benzene ring. To minimize steric hindrance, the methyl groups will arrange themselves symmetrically.\n*   Reaction: 3 CH3-C≡CH --(Red-hot Fe tube)--> 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene\n*   Compound D is **1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (also known as Mesitylene)**.\n\n**5. Identify Compound E**\n*   Compound D (Mesitylene) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids. This typically refers to a nitrating mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (nitration). The methyl (-CH3) groups are ortho-, para-directing and activating. In mesitylene, all three available positions on the ring (2, 4, and 6) are equivalent and highly activated.\n*   Reaction: Mesitylene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 2-Nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene + H2O\n*   Compound E is **2-Nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**.\n\n**6. Identify Compound F**\n*   Compound E (2-Nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene) reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl). This is a standard method for the reduction of an aromatic nitro group (-NO2) to a primary amino group (-NH2).\n*   Reaction: 2-Nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene + (Fe/HCl) → 2-Amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene + ...\n*   Compound F is **2-Amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (also known as Mesidine)**.\n\n**7. Identify Compound G**\n*   Compound F (Mesidine, an aromatic primary amine) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2), typically formed in situ from NaNO2 and HCl at low temperatures (0-5 °C).\n*   This is a diazotization reaction, which converts the primary amino group into a diazonium salt group (-N2+).\n*   Reaction: Mesidine + NaNO2/HCl (0-5 °C) → 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium chloride\n*   Compound G is the **2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n\n**8. Identify Compound H**\n*   Compound G (diazonium salt) reacts with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Warming an aqueous solution of a diazonium salt, especially in the presence of base, causes hydrolysis, replacing the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group to form a phenol.\n*   Reaction: 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt + H2O/NaOH → 2,4,6-trimethylphenol + N2 + NaCl\n*   Compound H is **2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n**9. Evaluate the Statements**\n\n*   **A) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene). Due to its high symmetry, all 9 protons of the three methyl groups are chemically equivalent and will produce one singlet. The 3 protons on the aromatic ring are also chemically equivalent and will produce another singlet. Thus, the spectrum has two singlets. **This statement is correct.**\n\n*   **B) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne. Its boiling point is -23.2 °C, so it is a gas at room temperature. Like other small hydrocarbons, it is highly flammable. **This statement is correct.**\n\n*   **C) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is used to detect the presence of most phenols, which typically produce a characteristic violet, blue, or green color. However, phenols with bulky groups at both ortho positions (the carbons adjacent to the -OH group) are sterically hindered. This hindrance prevents the formation of the colored complex with the ferric ion (Fe³⁺). Therefore, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol gives a *negative* ferric chloride test. The resulting solution may appear yellow or brown, but this is the color of the ferric chloride reagent itself, not the result of a positive reaction. **This statement is incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2-Amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesidine), which is an aromatic primary amine. Aromatic amines are crucial starting materials in the synthesis of azo dyes. They are diazotized (as in step 7 to form G) and then coupled with other aromatic compounds (like phenols or anilines) to produce brightly colored dyes. **This statement is correct.**\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe only incorrect statement among the given options is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
