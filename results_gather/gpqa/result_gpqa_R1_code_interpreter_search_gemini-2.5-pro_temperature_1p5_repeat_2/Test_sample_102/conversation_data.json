    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nThe key structural feature is that all three substituents are **meta** (in a 1,3,5 relationship) to each other.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nWe need to consider how each substituent influences the position of subsequent electrophilic aromatic substitutions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating (weakly) and an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Deactivating (strongly) and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Synthetic Challenge**\n\nSynthesizing a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene ring is challenging, especially when one of the substituents is an ortho, para-director (-Br) and the other two are meta-directors (-COCH3, -NO2). A direct sequence of electrophilic substitutions is unlikely to work efficiently.\n*   If we try to add the three groups directly, their directing effects will conflict. For example, if we have a 1,3-disubstituted ring with a meta-director and an o,p-director, the third substituent will likely lead to a mixture of products.\n*   Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH3 group) fails on strongly deactivated rings, such as those bearing a -NO2 group. This means the acylation step must happen before nitration, or an alternative strategy is needed.\n\nThe presence of steps like reduction of a nitro group (Fe/HCl), diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), and deamination (H3PO2) in the options strongly suggests a more sophisticated strategy involving the use of a temporary amino group (-NH2) to control the regiochemistry. The amino group can be introduced by reducing a nitro group, and it can be removed completely after it has served its directing purpose.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options Step-by-Step**\n\nLet's trace each proposed reaction sequence.\n\n**Option B:**\ni) Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → Bromobenzene.\nii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → A mixture of o- and p-bromonitrobenzene.\niii) Product from (ii) + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a nitro-substituted benzene ring. The reaction is extremely slow or fails due to the strong deactivating effect of the nitro group. Thus, **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n**Option D:**\ni) Benzene → Nitrobenzene\nii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline\niii) Aniline → Diazonium salt\niv) Diazonium salt → Benzene (deamination). This sequence just regenerates the starting material, benzene, and then proceeds with further reactions on it, which is nonsensical. Thus, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n**Option C:**\ni) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\nii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\niii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → This Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline is problematic. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. If it were to proceed, it would likely yield the meta product (3-aminoacetophenone), but it's not a standard, high-yield reaction. Assuming it works and gives 3-aminoacetophenone:\niv) 3-aminoacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → The powerful activating -NH2 group directs ortho/para. Under acidic conditions (FeBr3 is a Lewis acid), the amine is protonated to -NH3+, which is a meta-director. The -COCH3 group is also a meta-director. Starting with substituents at C1 and C3, both direct to C5. So we would get 3-amino-5-bromoacetophenone.\nv) Nitration of 3-amino-5-bromoacetophenone. The ring now has three substituents: -NH3+ (meta), -Br (o,p), and -COCH3 (meta). The ring is extremely deactivated by two strong deactivators (-NH3+, -COCH3) making this nitration step very difficult, if not impossible. Thus, **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n**Option A:**\nThis sequence employs the strategy of using a temporary group to control regiochemistry.\ni) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → **Acetophenone**. (This adds the acetyl group early, avoiding issues with Friedel-Crafts on a deactivated ring).\nii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → **3-Bromoacetophenone**. (The acetyl group is a meta-director, so this step is regioselective).\niii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → **Nitration**. Here, the directing effects conflict (-COCH3 is meta, -Br is o,p). This will produce a mixture of isomers, primarily 3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone and 3-bromo-6-nitroacetophenone. Crucially, the synthesis does not require this step to be selective. Let's call the product mixture **Isomer Mix**.\niv) Isomer Mix + Fe/HCl → **Reduction**. The nitro group in all isomers is reduced to an amino group (-NH2). We now have a mixture of 4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone and 6-amino-3-bromoacetophenone. Let's call this **Amino Mix**.\nv) Amino Mix + HNO3/H2SO4 → **Second Nitration**. This is the key step.\n    *   In 4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone, the powerful activating -NH2 group (at C4) and the meta-directing -COCH3 group (at C1) both strongly direct the incoming -NO2 group to **position 5**.\n    *   In 6-amino-3-bromoacetophenone, the powerful activating -NH2 group (at C6) and the meta-directing -COCH3 group (at C1) both strongly direct the incoming -NO2 group to **position 5**.\n    This step is highly regioselective for both components of the mixture, yielding a mix of 4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone and 6-amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone. The desired 1,3,5 substitution pattern is now established.\nvi) Product from (v) + NaNO2/HCl → **Diazotization**. The amino group (-NH2) in both isomers is converted to a diazonium salt group (-N2+).\nvii) Product from (vi) + H3PO2 → **Deamination**. The diazonium group is removed and replaced by a hydrogen atom.\n    *   Removing the group at C4 from the first isomer leaves substituents at C1, C3, and C5.\n    *   Removing the group at C6 from the second isomer also leaves substituents at C1, C3, and C5.\n    Both paths converge to the same final product: **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\nThis synthetic route is elegant because it doesn't rely on a difficult separation or a selective reaction in step (iii). Instead, it uses the initial nitro group as a \"sacrificial\" directing group that is later removed, ensuring a high overall yield of the final target molecule.\n\nTherefore, the sequence in Option A is the correct and most effective pathway.\n\n<<<A>>>"
