    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO) from the given NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5. A benzene ring accounts for 4 DBEs, and a carbonyl group (C=O) accounts for 1 DBE, which totals 5. This suggests the presence of both a benzene ring and a carbonyl group.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates it is adjacent to a CH₂ group (n+1 rule, 2+1=3 peaks).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a CH₂ group. Its chemical shift suggests it's adjacent to both an electron-withdrawing group (the aldehyde) and an aromatic ring. The splitting pattern, a doublet (d), confirms it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton (1+1=2 peaks). This confirms the presence of a **-CH₂-CHO** (acetaldehyde) fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are classic signals for a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons in this region is indicative of a primary amine group (-NH₂) attached to an aromatic ring. The protons are exchangeable, which often results in a broad signal. The upfield shift of one of the aromatic doublets (6.51 ppm) is consistent with the strong electron-donating effect of an -NH₂ group.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The substituents are an amine group (-NH₂) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH₂CHO).\n    *   The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. Let's verify the molecular formula: C₆H₄ (ring) + C₂H₃O (acetaldehyde group) + NH₂ = **C₈H₉NO**. This matches the given formula.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO₂ + HCl (at low temperature, typically 0-5 °C)**\n    *   This is the **diazotization** reaction. A primary aromatic amine (Ar-NH₂) reacts with nitrous acid (HONO, formed in situ from NaNO₂ and HCl) to form an aromatic diazonium salt (Ar-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n    *   The product of this step is **p-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride** ([N₂⁺]-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO).\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H₂O, Heat**\n    *   Aromatic diazonium salts are generally unstable and react with water upon warming to replace the diazonium group (-N₂⁺) with a hydroxyl group (-OH). Nitrogen gas (N₂) is evolved as a byproduct.\n    *   The product of this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde** (HO-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO).\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   The product from the previous step, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is an aldehyde that has acidic alpha-protons (the protons on the -CH₂- group).\n    *   KOH is a strong base, and heat is applied. These are the classic conditions for a **base-catalyzed self-aldol condensation**.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an alpha-proton from one molecule of the aldehyde to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. After protonation of the resulting alkoxide, an aldol addition product is formed.\n            *   Intermediate Product (Aldol Adduct): **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (D).\n        2.  **Condensation (Dehydration):** Because the reaction is heated, the aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (elimination of a water molecule). The base removes the acidic alpha-proton (at C2), and the hydroxyl group from the beta-carbon (C3) leaves. This forms a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The stability is enhanced because the new C=C double bond is in conjugation with both the aldehyde's C=O group and one of the aromatic rings.\n            *   Final Product (Condensation Product): The double bond forms between C2 and C3, resulting in **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Final Product.**\n\nThe question asks for the final product. Given the condition \"Heat\", the reaction will not stop at the aldol addition stage (D). The elimination of water is thermodynamically favorable due to the formation of a highly conjugated system. Therefore, the final isolated product is the condensation product.\n\n*   **Final Product Structure:**\n    (HO-C₆H₄)-CH=C(CHO)-(CH₂-C₆H₄-OH) is incorrect. Let's redraw the condensation from the correct adduct.\n    Adduct: (HO-C₆H₄)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH(C₆H₄-OH)-CHO\n    Dehydration (loss of H from C2 and OH from C3):\n    (HO-C₆H₄)-CH₂-CH=C(C₆H₄-OH)-CHO\n    Let's name this: The main chain is a but-2-enal. It has a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group at C2 and a (4-hydroxyphenyl)methyl group at C4? No, my structural analysis of the aldol product was correct the first time. Let's re-verify.\n\n    Enolate [HO-Ph-CH-CHO]⁻ attacks electrophile HO-Ph-CH₂-CHO.\n    The α-carbon of the enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon of the electrophile.\n    Product: HO-Ph-CH(CHO)-CH(OH)-CH₂-Ph-OH\n    Main chain is butanal.\n    C1 is CHO.\n    C2 has substituent HO-Ph.\n    C3 has substituent OH.\n    C4 has substituent HO-Ph.\n    Name: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This is option D.\n\n    Dehydration removes H from C2 and OH from C3.\n    A double bond forms between C2 and C3.\n    Product: HO-Ph-CH=C(CHO)-Ph-OH\n    Main chain is but-2-enal.\n    C1 is CHO.\n    C2 has substituent HO-Ph.\n    C3 has H and is attached to C4.\n    C4 has substituent HO-Ph.\n    Structure: HO-Ph-CH₂-CH=C(Ph-OH)-CHO <-- No, this is incorrect again.\n\n    Let's write it out clearly one last time.\n    Addition product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option D)\n     \n    Dehydration removes the **-H from C2** and the **-OH from C3**.\n    A double bond forms between **C2 and C3**.\n     \n    Final product name: The main chain is a **but-2-enal**. There is a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group at C2 and another (4-hydroxyphenyl) group at C4.\n    Name: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This matches option C.\n\nThe final product after heating is the dehydrated, conjugated molecule.\n\nFinal Answer: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**\n\n<<<C>>>"
