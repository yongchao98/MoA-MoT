    "*   **Analysis of the Options:**\n    *   **A) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** QCD is the quantum field theory of the strong interaction. Like other quantum field theories describing forces between point particles, calculations involving loop diagrams (which represent virtual particle interactions at high energies) lead to infinite results (ultraviolet divergences). To extract meaningful physical predictions, these infinities must be dealt with through a process called regularization (e.g., dimensional regularization, lattice regularization) followed by renormalization. Therefore, QCD *requires* regularization.\n    *   **B) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** QED is the quantum field theory of the electromagnetic interaction. It was the first theory where the problem of infinities in calculations was successfully handled. Similar to QCD, loop diagrams lead to ultraviolet divergences that must be tamed by regularization and renormalization. Therefore, QED *requires* regularization.\n    *   **C) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory, described by Maxwell's equations, also has a high-energy/short-distance problem. If one considers a charged particle to be a true mathematical point, the energy stored in its own electric field (its self-energy) becomes infinite. To calculate a finite self-energy, one must assume the charge is spread out over a small but finite radius, effectively introducing a short-distance cutoff. This cutoff is a form of regularization. Therefore, classical electrodynamics *requires* a form of regularization to avoid the point-charge self-energy divergence.\n    *   **D) Superstring Theory:** One of the primary motivations for superstring theory is that it is a candidate for a quantum theory of gravity that is free from ultraviolet divergences. Unlike point particles in quantum field theory, the fundamental objects in string theory are one-dimensional extended strings. When strings interact, they do so over a small region of spacetime, not at a single point. This \"smearing out\" of the interaction effectively smooths out the short-distance behavior that leads to infinities in other theories. As a result, calculations of scattering amplitudes in superstring theory are believed to be finite without the need for an external regularization procedure. The finite size of the string acts as a natural, built-in regulator.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** QCD, QED, and Classical Electrodynamics all encounter infinities related to high-energy (or short-distance) behavior that must be fixed with a regularization procedure. Superstring theory is specifically formulated in a way that is expected to naturally avoid these infinities.\n\n<<<D>>>"
