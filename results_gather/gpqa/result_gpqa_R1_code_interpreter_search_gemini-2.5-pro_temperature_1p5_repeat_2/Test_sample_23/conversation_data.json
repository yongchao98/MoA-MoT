    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy. The mass percentage of hydrogen is given by `(y * AtomicMass_H) / (x * AtomicMass_C + y * AtomicMass_H) * 100`.\n    *   Using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1) for simplicity, the fraction of hydrogen mass is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   14.28% is very close to 100/7. So, `y / (12x + y) ≈ 1/7`.\n    *   This gives `7y ≈ 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y ≈ 12x`, or `y ≈ 2x`.\n    *   A hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n can be either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z is formed after hydrogenation under severe conditions and does not react further with hydrogen. This indicates that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n    *   Let's verify the mass percentage for CnH2n using integer masses:\n        `Mass % H = (2n * 1) / (n * 12 + 2n * 1) * 100 = 2n / 14n * 100 = (1/7) * 100 = 14.2857...%`. This is a perfect match.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's assume Z is cyclohexane for now and check if it fits all other conditions.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Hydrogenation Process.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only one substance, Z.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n    *   Let mixture Y = {Y1, Y2}. We can set Y1 = Z = Cyclohexane.\n    *   Hydrogenating Y, which is {Cyclohexane, Y2}, gives only Cyclohexane.\n        *   Hydrogenating Cyclohexane gives Cyclohexane (no reaction).\n        *   Therefore, hydrogenating Y2 must also yield Cyclohexane.\n    *   Since Y does not decolorize bromine water, Y2 must be a saturated compound or an aromatic compound that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. The most logical candidate for Y2 is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not react with bromine water without a catalyst, and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane: C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12.\n    *   So, Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}. This is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that fit the description.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, so X1 and X2 are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in X's components.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means both X1 and X2 have a six-membered ring carbon skeleton.\n    *   The reaction from X to Y is a disproportionation on a platinum catalyst:\n        X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2 (equimolar)\n        Substituting our findings:\n        X1 + X2 → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One molecule is hydrogenated (gaining hydrogen) and the other is dehydrogenated (losing hydrogen). To balance the hydrogen atoms:\n        H_atoms(X1) + H_atoms(X2) = H_atoms(C6H12) + H_atoms(C6H6)\n        H_atoms(X1) + H_atoms(X2) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Since X1 and X2 are unsaturated compounds with a cyclohexane skeleton, they must be cyclohexene or cyclohexadienes.\n        *   Cyclohexane: C6H12\n        *   Cyclohexene: C6H10\n        *   Cyclohexadienes: C6H8\n    *   We need two different compounds from this list whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The only possible combination is **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and a **cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n        10 + 8 = 18. This is a perfect match.\n    *   The problem specifies \"no conjugated multiple bonds\". Cyclohexene has only one double bond. For the cyclohexadiene (C6H8), there are two isomers: cyclohexa-1,3-diene (conjugated) and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene** (non-conjugated). Therefore, the diene must be cyclohexa-1,4-diene.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion and Answer.**\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n    *   The reaction is:\n        C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexa-1,4-diene) --[Pt, heat]--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in cyclohexene) + (H atoms in cyclohexa-1,4-diene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
