    "This problem requires understanding the selectivity of two different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, when reacting with a molecule that contains both a carboxylic acid and an ester functional group. The stereochemistry of the starting material determines the stereochemistry of the product because the chiral center is not involved in the reaction.\n\n### **Analysis of the Starting Material and Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material (from options):** The proposed starting materials are enantiomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule is a derivative of glutaric acid (a 5-carbon dicarboxylic acid). It has a carboxylic acid group at one end (C1), an ester group at the other end (C5), and a chiral center at C3, which bears an ethyl group.\n    *   Structure: HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu\n    *   The chiral center is C3.\n\n*   **Product:** The products are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone).\n    *   The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the C4 in the lactone ring. The ethyl group is attached to this chiral center.\n    *   Lactonization occurs by forming an ester linkage between the oxygen of a hydroxyl group at C5 and the carbonyl carbon at C1 of a pentanoic acid derivative.\n\n### **Reaction 1: Reduction with LiBH₄**\n\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent that is more selective than LiAlH₄. In a molecule containing both an ester and a carboxylic acid, **LiBH₄ preferentially reduces the ester group** to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid is typically deprotonated to a carboxylate salt, which is less reactive towards reduction.\n*   **Reaction Sequence:**\n    1.  **Reduction:** Starting material A (3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid) reacts with LiBH₄. The ester at C5 is reduced to a primary alcohol, and isobutanol is released. The carboxylic acid at C1 remains (or is reformed during workup).\n        A (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu) + LiBH₄ → HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    2.  **Lactonization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the intermediates and catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the resulting 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid to form the six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Throughout this process, the bonds to the chiral center (C3 in the starting material, which becomes C4 in the lactone) are not broken. Therefore, the stereochemical configuration is retained.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n    *   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n### **Reaction 2: Reduction with BH₃**\n\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is a highly selective reducing agent. It is particularly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while it is **very slow to react with esters**.\n*   **Reaction Sequence:**\n    1.  **Reduction:** Starting material B (3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid) reacts with BH₃. The carboxylic acid at C1 is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol. The ester at C5 remains intact.\n        B (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu) + BH₃ → HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n    2.  **Lactonization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular transesterification of the resulting 5-hydroxy ester. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the six-membered lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to the first reaction, the chiral center is not involved in the bond-forming/breaking steps. Its configuration is retained.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n    *   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n### **Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
