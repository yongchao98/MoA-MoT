    "*   **Step 1: Understand the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance.**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star. The energy received is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the star. The temperature is related to energy by the Stefan-Boltzmann law (Power ∝ T⁴), and the energy flux received is proportional to 1/a², where 'a' is the semi-major axis (orbital distance). Therefore, the energy balance gives T_eq⁴ ∝ 1/a². This simplifies to T_eq ∝ 1/√a or T_eq ∝ a⁻¹/².\n\n*   **Step 2: Relate orbital distance to orbital period.**\n    According to Kepler's Third Law, for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a).\n    P² ∝ a³\n    This can be rearranged to express 'a' in terms of 'P':\n    a ∝ P²/³\n\n*   **Step 3: Combine the relationships to find T_eq in terms of P.**\n    Substitute the relationship from Step 2 into the relationship from Step 1:\n    T_eq ∝ (P²/³)⁻¹/²\n    T_eq ∝ P⁽²⁾*⁽⁻¹/²⁾/³\n    T_eq ∝ P⁻¹/³\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the ratio of equilibrium temperatures.**\n    We want to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to that of Planet_2 (T_eq4 / T_eq2).\n    Using the proportionality from Step 3:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4)⁻¹/³ / (P2)⁻¹/³\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4 / P2)⁻¹/³\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)¹/³\n\n*   **Step 5: Use the given orbital period ratios.**\n    The problem states the ratio of orbital periods is P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    From this, we can take the values for P2 and P4:\n    P2 = 2 (in relative units)\n    P4 = 3.5 (in relative units)\n\n*   **Step 6: Substitute the values and compute the final ratio.**\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)¹/³\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / (7/2))¹/³\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (4 / 7)¹/³\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)¹/³\n\n    We can calculate the cube root:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.8298\n\n    This value is approximately 0.83.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.69\nB) ~0.75\nC) ~0.83\nD) ~0.57\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
