    "The problem asks for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal.\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant formula\nThe formula for the interplanar spacing `d` for a plane with Miller indices (hkl) in a rhombohedral crystal system is given by:\n`1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²)sin²α + 2(hk + kl + hl)(cos²α - cosα) ] / [ a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ]`\nwhere:\n*   `a` is the lattice constant (the length of the primitive lattice vectors).\n*   `α` is the angle between the primitive lattice vectors (`α = β = γ`).\n*   `(hkl)` are the Miller indices of the plane.\n\n### 2. List the given values\nFrom the problem statement, we have:\n*   Lattice constant, `a = 10` Angstrom.\n*   The angle, `α = 30°`.\n*   The Miller indices, `(h, k, l) = (1, 1, 1)`.\n\n### 3. Substitute the values into the formula\nFirst, let's pre-calculate the components of the formula:\n*   `h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3`\n*   `hk + kl + hl = 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 = 3`\n*   `a² = 10² = 100`\n*   For `α = 30°`:\n    *   `sin(30°) = 1/2`\n    *   `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n    *   `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`\n    *   `cos²(30°) = (√3 / 2)² = 3/4`\n    *   `cos³(30°) = (√3 / 2)³ = 3√3 / 8`\n\nNow, let's compute the numerator of the `1/d²` expression:\nNumerator = `(3) * sin²(30°) + 2 * (3) * (cos²(30°) - cos(30°))`\nNumerator = `3 * (1/4) + 6 * (3/4 - √3/2)`\nNumerator = `3/4 + 18/4 - 3√3`\nNumerator = `21/4 - 3√3 = (21 - 12√3) / 4`\n\nNext, let's compute the denominator:\nDenominator = `a² * (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)`\nDenominator = `100 * (1 - 3(3/4) + 2(3√3/8))`\nDenominator = `100 * (1 - 9/4 + 6√3/8)`\nDenominator = `100 * (1 - 9/4 + 3√3/4)`\nDenominator = `100 * ( (4 - 9 + 3√3) / 4 )`\nDenominator = `100 * ( (3√3 - 5) / 4 )`\nDenominator = `25 * (3√3 - 5)`\n\nNow, combine the numerator and denominator to find `1/d²`:\n`1/d² = Numerator / Denominator`\n`1/d² = [ (21 - 12√3) / 4 ] / [ 25 * (3√3 - 5) ]`\n`1/d² = (21 - 12√3) / [ 100 * (3√3 - 5) ]`\n\nTo simplify this fraction, we can rationalize the denominator by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by `(3√3 + 5)`:\n`1/d² = [ (21 - 12√3) * (3√3 + 5) ] / [ 100 * (3√3 - 5) * (3√3 + 5) ]`\n\nLet's evaluate the new numerator:\n` (21 - 12√3)(3√3 + 5) = 21*3√3 + 21*5 - 12√3*3√3 - 12√3*5 `\n`= 63√3 + 105 - 108 - 60√3 = 3√3 - 3 = 3(√3 - 1)`\n\nAnd the new denominator:\n`100 * ( (3√3)² - 5² ) = 100 * (27 - 25) = 100 * 2 = 200`\n\nSo, the simplified expression for `1/d²` is:\n`1/d² = 3(√3 - 1) / 200`\n\n### 4. Calculate the final value\nNow we can solve for `d`. Using the approximation `√3 ≈ 1.732`:\n`1/d² ≈ 3(1.732 - 1) / 200 = 3(0.732) / 200 = 2.196 / 200 = 0.01098`\n`d² ≈ 1 / 0.01098 ≈ 91.075`\n`d ≈ √91.075 ≈ 9.543` Angstrom\n\nTo get a more precise result, we can use a calculator without rounding intermediate steps.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Use the simplified formula derived above\n# 1/d^2 = (3 * (sqrt(3) - 1)) / 200\ninv_d_squared = (3 * (math.sqrt(3) - 1)) / 200\n\n# Calculate d by taking the square root of the reciprocal\nd = math.sqrt(1 / inv_d_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{d:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\n9.54\nThe calculated interplanar distance is approximately 9.54 Angstrom. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
