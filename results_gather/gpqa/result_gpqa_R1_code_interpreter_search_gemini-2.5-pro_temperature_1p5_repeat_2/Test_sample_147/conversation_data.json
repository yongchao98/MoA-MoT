    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of fluorine in A2.**\n\nThe problem states that substance A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y and has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YF_n, where M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y, n is the number of fluorine atoms, and M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (approx. 19.00 g/mol).\n\nThe formula for mass percentage is:\nɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\nWe are given ɷF = 31.96% = 0.3196. We can rearrange the formula to solve for M(Y):\n0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * n * 19.00 = n * 19.00\n0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 19.00 * (1 - 0.3196)\n0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 19.00 * 0.6804\nM(Y) = n * (12.9276 / 0.3196)\nM(Y) ≈ n * 40.45\n\nWe need to find an element Y and an integer n that satisfy this relationship. Let's test integer values for n:\n*   If n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (fits Ca, K, Sc - these do not typically form five binary fluorides or fit the other chemical properties).\n*   If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (fits Br, Se - Bromine has 3 common fluorides, Selenium has 3).\n*   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n*   If n=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (no common element fits).\n*   If n=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (somewhat close to Bi, Hg).\n*   If n=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (fits Plutonium, Pu=244 g/mol).\n\nLet's check the most promising candidates, Sb and Pu, with a more precise calculation.\n\n**Candidate 1: Antimony (Sb)**\nIf Y = Sb and n = 3, then A2 = SbF3.\nM(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 18.998 = 178.754 g/mol.\nɷF(SbF3) = (3 * 18.998 / 178.754) * 100% = 31.88%. This is extremely close to the given 31.96%.\n\n**Candidate 2: Plutonium (Pu)**\nIf Y = Pu and n = 6, then A2 = PuF6.\nM(PuF6) = 244 + 6 * 18.998 = 357.988 g/mol.\nɷF(PuF6) = (6 * 18.998 / 357.988) * 100% = 31.84%. This is also very close.\n\nHowever, when we check the molecular weights of possible compounds against the given answer ranges, plutonium fluorides (PuF3 ≈ 301, PuF4 ≈ 320, PuF6 ≈ 358) do not fit at all. This strongly suggests Y = Antimony (Sb).\n\n**Step 2: Reconstruct the scenario with Y = Antimony (Sb).**\n\n*   **Y = Sb**. The problem states five binary compounds are known. The two major ones are SbF3 and SbF5. Other, less stable or polymeric species may be considered to reach five for the context of this problem.\n*   **A2 = SbF3**. This is based on the excellent match of the fluorine mass percentage.\n*   **A1**: \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (SbF3) and fluorine\". This implies the reaction A1 -> SbF3 + F2. For this to happen, A1 must be a higher fluoride than SbF3, which would be SbF5. So, **A1 = SbF5**. There is a known contradiction here: SbF5 is a colorless liquid, not a bright-red solid, and it's thermally stable. We must assume these properties are either incorrect or refer to an obscure, reactive form within the problem's context.\n*   **A3**: \"A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine\" and \"A3 can also interact with xenon\". The fluorination of Sb can yield SbF3 or SbF5. The ability to interact with xenon (a hallmark of very strong Lewis acids or oxidizing agents) points definitively to **A3 = SbF5**.\n*   **A4 and A5**: \"By adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" The question asks for the molecular weight range of A4. A4 must be one of the antimony fluorides, likely SbF3 or SbF5, as they are the main ones. Both are colorless.\n\n**Step 3: Determine A4 by calculating molecular weights and comparing with the given ranges.**\n\nWe need to find the molecular weight of A4. The most plausible candidates for A4 are SbF3 and SbF5. Let's calculate their molecular weights.\n*   **Molar Mass of SbF3**: M = M(Sb) + 3 * M(F) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n*   **Molar Mass of SbF5**: M = M(Sb) + 5 * M(F) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 216.76 g/mol.\n\nNow, let's compare these values with the given answer ranges:\nA) 160-180\nB) 110-130\nC) 140-160\nD) 220-240\n\n*   The molecular weight of SbF3 (178.76 g/mol) falls perfectly within range **A) 160-180**.\n*   The molecular weight of SbF5 (216.76 g/mol) does not fit well in any range. It is close to range D, but outside of it.\n\nThis provides strong evidence that **A4 is SbF3**.\n\nThe final parts of the problem describe the formation of A5 (Sb + SbF3 -> A5) and its subsequent decomposition in water. This describes a comproportionation reaction to form a subfluoride (A5), which would then disproportionate upon hydrolysis. This is chemically complex but does not contradict the identification of A4 based on its molecular weight.\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of substance A4 falls in the range of 160-180 g/mol.\n\n<<<A>>>"
