    "This problem asks for the scalar potential V and vector potential $\\vec{A}$ generated by a moving point charge. These potentials are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Conceptual Framework\nThe potentials from a time-varying charge and current distribution are given by the retarded potentials, which account for the finite speed of light, c. The potential at a field point $\\vec{r}$ at time t is determined by the state of the source at an earlier time, the retarded time $t_r$.\n\nThe retarded time $t_r$ is defined by the condition that the signal emitted from the source at position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ at time $t_r$ must travel the distance $|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$ to reach the observer at position $\\vec{r}$ at time t.\nLet $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ be the vector from the retarded source position to the observation point. Let $d = |\\vec{d}|$. The retardation condition is:\n$t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$\n\nThe general formulas for the retarded potentials are:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\nwhere $t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$.\n\n### 2. Application to a Point Charge\nFor a point charge q moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$ with velocity $\\vec{v}(t) = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}$, the charge and current densities are:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t) = q \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t) = q \\vec{v}(t) \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t))$\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals is not straightforward because the retarded time $t_r$ in the integrand depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. The standard derivation involves a careful evaluation of the integral over the delta function.\n\nThe result of this derivation gives the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key is that the motion of the source changes the effective volume element of the charge as seen by the observer. This introduces a correction factor in the denominator.\n\n### 3. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\nThe resulting potentials are:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} \\right]_{ret}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\frac{\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} \\right]_{ret}$\n\nThe subscript \"ret\" indicates that all quantities inside the brackets (d, $\\hat{d}$, and $\\vec{v}$) are to be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\nIn the notation of the problem:\n*   $\\vec{d}$ is the vector from the source at $t_r$ to the observer at $t$.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n*   $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$.\n*   $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the charge at $t_r$.\n\nLet's rewrite the potentials to match the form given in the options. We can multiply the numerator and denominator by c:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - d\\frac{\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nSimilarly for the vector potential:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n### 4. Comparing with the Options\nLet's check the given options:\n\nA) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\nThis matches our derived expressions perfectly.\n\nB) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\nThe sign in the denominator is incorrect. A positive sign would imply that a charge moving towards the observer produces a weaker potential, which is contrary to the Doppler effect for electromagnetic waves.\n\nC) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\nThe expression for V is the static Coulomb potential, which ignores retardation. It is only an approximation for v << c and does not account for the relativistic effects correctly. While the relationship $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the expression for V itself is wrong.\n\nD) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\nThe expression for V is the incorrect static potential, and the relationship between $\\vec{A}$ and V is also incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
