    "*   **Step 1: Deconstruct the experimental scenario.**\n    *   **Antigen:** Inner capsid proteins of rotavirus (tagged with GFP). Rotavirus is a gut pathogen.\n    *   **Delivery Route:** Oral gavage, mimicking natural infection.\n    *   **Site of Immune Response:** Peyer's patches. These are secondary lymphoid organs in the intestine, crucial for mucosal immunity. They are a primary site for initiating immune responses to intestinal antigens.\n    *   **Cell Population:** A \"proliferating cell population\" is isolated. In a secondary lymphoid organ following antigen exposure, massive proliferation is characteristic of lymphocytes (B cells and T cells) undergoing clonal expansion.\n    *   **Molecular Observation:** The variable heavy chain gene of these cells is sequenced and shows \"high variability.\" The variable heavy chain is part of the B cell receptor (and the antibody it will eventually secrete). Its sequence determines the antigen-binding specificity.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the key immunological events.**\n    *   The rotavirus protein antigen is taken up in the Peyer's patches.\n    *   B cells with B cell receptors (BCRs) that recognize the rotavirus protein are activated, with help from T helper cells.\n    *   These activated B cells proliferate rapidly and form a structure called a germinal center within the Peyer's patch. This accounts for the \"proliferating cell population.\"\n    *   Inside the germinal center, B cells undergo processes to improve the quality of the antibody response.\n\n*   **Step 3: Evaluate the options in the context of the observation.**\n    *   The core finding is \"high variability\" in the *variable heavy chain gene* of this specific, proliferating B cell population. We need to identify the process that introduces mutations into this specific gene region *after* a B cell has been activated by an antigen.\n\n    *   **A) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a process that occurs specifically in activated B cells within germinal centers. It introduces point mutations at a high rate into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). The goal is to generate B cell variants with slightly different receptors. Cells with receptors that bind the antigen with higher affinity are then preferentially selected to survive and differentiate. This process directly and perfectly explains the \"high variability\" observed in the variable heavy chain gene among the proliferating B cell clones.\n\n    *   **B) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that creates the initial diversity of B cell receptors. It occurs in the bone marrow during the development of B cells, *before* they ever encounter an antigen. While it generates a diverse repertoire of B cells in the body, it is not the process causing high variability *within a specific population of proliferating cells* in response to a single antigen in a secondary lymphoid organ.\n\n    *   **C) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate and adaptive immune system that involves a cascade of serum proteins. It helps clear pathogens but does not involve any genetic changes to B cell immunoglobulin genes.\n\n    *   **D) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in B cells within the germinal center. It changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene, which switches the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgG or IgA). While this is a genetic recombination event, it does not affect the *variable* region. Therefore, it is not responsible for the observed high variability in the *variable* heavy chain gene sequence.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude.**\n    *   The scenario describes an active immune response in a germinal center within a Peyer's patch. The finding of high sequence variability specifically in the variable heavy chain gene of the proliferating B cells is the definitive characteristic of somatic hypermutation, the process of affinity maturation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
