    "This problem requires devising a multi-step synthesis for a specifically substituted benzene ring, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene. The key is to introduce three substituents—ethoxy (-OEt), tert-butyl (-C(CH3)3), and nitro (-NO2)—at positions 1, 2, and 3, respectively. This vicinal (1,2,3) substitution pattern is often challenging to achieve due to the directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n\nLet's analyze the target molecule's structure and the directing effects of its substituents:\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt)** at position 1: A strong activator and an ortho-, para-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl group (-tBu)** at position 2: A weak activator and an ortho-, para-director. Its steric bulk often favors para-substitution.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2)** at position 3: A strong deactivator and a meta-director.\n\nThe relative positions are:\n*   OEt and tBu are *ortho*.\n*   tBu and NO2 are *ortho*.\n*   OEt and NO2 are *meta*.\n\nA good strategy for such a complex synthesis is to work backward from the final product (retrosynthesis) or to evaluate the given options step-by-step.\n\n**Retrosynthetic Analysis (Simplified):**\n\n1.  The ethoxy group is likely introduced last, via a Williamson ether synthesis on the corresponding phenol. This is a common and high-yield reaction.\n    *Target* <- (`NaOH/EtBr`) <- **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**\n\n2.  Phenols are very commonly prepared from primary aromatic amines via diazotization followed by hydrolysis.\n    *Precursor 1* <- (`i. NaNO2/HCl; ii. H3O+, heat`) <- **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**\n\n3.  The crucial step is the synthesis of **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. This aniline has the NH2, tBu, and NO2 groups in a 1,2,3 arrangement. Let's call this the Key Intermediate. How can this be made from benzene? This is the core challenge, as direct sequential EAS reactions often give different isomers.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options:**\n\nLet's evaluate the given sequences to see if any can plausibly form the Key Intermediate and then convert it to the final product.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This starts with `Benzene -> Nitrobenzene -> Aniline`. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring towards electrophilic substitution. Thus, option A is incorrect from an early step.\n\n*   **Option C & D:** These options involve a blocking group strategy with sulfonation (`SO3/H2SO4`). Let's analyze this strategy.\n    1.  `Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 -> tert-Butylbenzene`.\n    2.  `tert-Butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid` (sulfonation at the para position is favored due to sterics).\n    3.  `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`. Here, both the tBu group (directs ortho) and the -SO3H group (directs meta) direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (C2).\n    In the resulting molecule, the tBu and NO2 groups are at positions 4 and 2 respectively, meaning they are *meta* to each other. The target molecule requires them to be *ortho*. Therefore, this common blocking group strategy leads to the wrong isomer, invalidating options C and D which rely on this or a similar sequence.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    Let's trace the core synthesis path in this option, initially ignoring the last two strange steps (viii, ix) which might be distractors.\n    1.  `i) Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 -> tert-Butylbenzene`. A standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    2.  `ii) tert-Butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 -> o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene + p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene`. The tBu group is an o,p-director. To proceed towards the target, we need the tBu and NO2 groups to be ortho. This requires isolating the minor *ortho* isomer. While not ideal for \"high-yield\", it's a necessary step in this path. Let's proceed with **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    3.  `iii) o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene + Fe/HCl -> 2-tert-butylaniline`. Standard reduction of a nitro group to an amine.\n    4.  `iv) 2-tert-butylaniline + HNO3/H2SO4 -> ?`. This is the most questionable step regarding regioselectivity. Direct nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline is complex. The strongly activating -NH2 group directs ortho and para (positions 6 and 4), while the weakly activating -tBu group directs ortho and para (positions 3 and 5). Under the strongly acidic conditions of nitration, the amino group is protonated to the -NH3+ group, which is a meta-director (directing to positions 3 and 5). The t-butyl group still directs to 3 and 5. Therefore, both groups synergistically direct the nitration to positions 3 and 5. Position 3 is extremely sterically hindered, but it is the position required to form our Key Intermediate. Position 5 would be the other product. While the yield of the 3-nitro isomer may not be perfect, this is the only proposed pathway among the options that can rationalize the formation of the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline** precursor.\n    5.  `v) 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline + NaNO2/HCl -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenediazonium salt`. This is a standard diazotization.\n    6.  `vi) ... + H3O+, H2O/Heat -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol`. The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group.\n    7.  `vii) ... + NaOH/EtBr -> 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`. Williamson ether synthesis gives the final product.\n\nThe sequence of reaction types in Option B (i through vii) is chemically logical and directly leads to the target molecule, provided the challenging nitration in step (iv) yields the desired isomer. The other options are flawed due to incorrect reaction principles or lead definitively to the wrong isomers. The extra steps (viii, ix) in option B appear extraneous and are likely distractors. Thus, Option B represents the most plausible (albeit challenging) route among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>"
