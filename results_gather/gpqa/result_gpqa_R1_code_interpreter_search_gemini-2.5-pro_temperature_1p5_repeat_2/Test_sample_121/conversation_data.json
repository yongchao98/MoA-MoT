    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Bromine (Br2), Pyridine, Acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O), with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is intended to perform an α-bromination of the carboxylic acid. This reaction is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The acidic protons are on the α-carbon (the methyl group). Bromine will substitute one of these hydrogens.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid (bromoacetic acid) reacts with an alcohol (ethanol) in the presence of a strong acid catalyst (H2SO4) to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction (SN2). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile that displaces the bromide ion from the α-carbon.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a multi-step process involving deprotonation and alkylation.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** The methylene protons (-CH2-) in ethyl cyanoacetate are highly acidic because they are flanked by two strong electron-withdrawing groups (the cyano group, -CN, and the ester group, -COOEt). Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, removes one of these protons to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (an enolate).\n        `NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂`\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + Br⁻`\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The problem states that *excess* NaH is used. The product from the first alkylation still has one acidic proton on the α-carbon. The excess NaH will deprotonate this carbon as well.\n        `NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + NaH → [NC-C((CH2)5Br)-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂`\n    4.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The newly formed carbanion is positioned to attack the other end of the pentyl chain, which still has a bromine atom. This intramolecular SN2 reaction is highly favorable because it forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group and an ethyl ester group attached to the same carbon (C1). The name of the compound is **Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n**Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      CN\n     /\nC(1)--COOCH₂CH₃\n |  \\\nC(6)-C(2)\n|    |\nC(5)-C(3)\n \\  /\n  C(4)\n```\n\nWe look for chemical equivalence based on the molecule's symmetry. At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. This results in time-averaged environments. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   Total from the ethyl group = 2 signals.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   **C2 and C6:** Due to the plane of symmetry, the protons on C2 are equivalent to the corresponding protons on C6. However, on any single one of these carbons (e.g., C2), the two protons are not equivalent. They are *diastereotopic* because C1 is a prochiral center. Therefore, they will have different chemical shifts. This results in **2 signals** for the four protons on C2 and C6.\n    *   **C3 and C5:** Similarly, the protons on C3 are equivalent to those on C5. The two protons on C3 itself are diastereotopic. This gives another **2 signals** for the four protons on C3 and C5.\n    *   **C4:** The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons are also diastereotopic. One is on one side of the ring relative to the substituents on C1, and the other is on the other side. They are in different chemical environments. This gives **2 signals** for the two protons on C4.\n    *   Total from the ring = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nAdding the signals from the ethyl group and the ring:\n2 (from ethyl group) + 6 (from cyclohexane ring) = 8 distinct signals.\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
