    "**Analysis of the Reactions:**\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves a ketone (butan-2-one) reacting with sodium cyanide (NaCN) to form a cyanohydrin (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile).\n2.  **Understand the mechanism:** The formation of a cyanohydrin is a nucleophilic addition reaction.\n    *   The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n    *   This attack forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate: `CH₃CH₂-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₃`.\n    *   This alkoxide ion needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group in the cyanohydrin product.\n3.  **Determine the role of reagent A:** Reagent A must be a proton source to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. The overall reaction is the addition of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) across the carbonyl double bond. HCN is a weak acid and can be generated *in situ* by reacting NaCN with a stronger acid.\n    *   `NaCN + H⁺ <=> HCN + Na⁺`\n4.  **Evaluate the options for A:**\n    *   **H₃O⁺:** This represents a strong acid in an aqueous solution (like HCl or H₂SO₄). It can readily provide the necessary protons to generate HCN from NaCN and to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. This is a suitable reagent.\n    *   **NaHSO₃:** Sodium bisulfite. This reagent undergoes a different reaction with ketones to form a bisulfite addition product (an α-hydroxy sulfonate). It is not the correct reagent to facilitate cyanohydrin formation.\n    *   Based on this, we can eliminate options B and C. We are left with options A and D, where A = H₃O⁺.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile.\n2.  **Understand the mechanism:** Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base. The reaction involves the addition of water across the carbon-nitrogen triple bond, typically requiring heat.\n    *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is reacted with water in the presence of a strong acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄). The reaction proceeds through an amide intermediate, which is then further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid and an ammonium salt.\n        `R-CN + 2H₂O + H⁺ --(heat)--> R-COOH + NH₄⁺`\n3.  **Determine the role of reagent B:** Reagent B, along with water, must facilitate the hydrolysis of the nitrile group. This requires strong acidic or basic conditions.\n4.  **Evaluate the options for B:**\n    *   **CH₃COOH (Acetic acid):** This is a weak acid. While technically an acid catalyst, it is generally not strong enough to effectively hydrolyze nitriles to carboxylic acids in a reasonable timeframe. Strong acids are preferred.\n    *   **HCl (Hydrochloric acid):** This is a strong acid and is a very common and effective reagent for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   For Reaction 1, reagent **A** must be a proton source like **H₃O⁺**.\n*   For Reaction 2, reagent **B** must be a strong acid catalyst like **HCl** for efficient hydrolysis.\n\nCombining these findings, we get:\n*   A = H₃O⁺\n*   B = HCl\n\nThis combination corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
