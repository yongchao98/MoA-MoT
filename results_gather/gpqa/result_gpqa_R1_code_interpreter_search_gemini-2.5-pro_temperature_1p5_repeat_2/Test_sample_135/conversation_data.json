    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are given a vector field **f** that is purely radial and its magnitude is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the origin.\n*   Vector field: **f**(r) = (1/r²) **r̂**, where **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n*   We need to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, ∫_V (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV.\n*   The volume V is a sphere of radius R, centered at the origin.\n\n**2. Choose the Method**\n\nThis problem is a classic application of the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's theorem). The theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux of the field through the closed surface that bounds the volume.\n\nThe Divergence Theorem states:\n∫_V (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV = ∮_S (**f** ⋅ d**S**)\n\nWhere:\n*   V is the volume (the sphere of radius R).\n*   S is the closed surface that encloses V (the surface of the sphere of radius R).\n*   d**S** is the differential surface area vector, which points outward from the surface.\n\nUsing the Divergence Theorem is advantageous because it allows us to avoid directly calculating the divergence of the field, which has a singularity at the origin (r=0).\n\n**3. Set up the Surface Integral**\n\nWe need to evaluate the surface integral ∮_S (**f** ⋅ d**S**).\n\n*   **The Surface (S):** This is the surface of the sphere of radius R. On this surface, the radial distance `r` is constant and equal to `R`.\n*   **The Vector Field on the Surface (f):** We evaluate the field **f** at r = R.\n    **f**(R) = (1/R²) **r̂**\n*   **The Differential Surface Area Vector (d**S**):** For a sphere, the differential surface area element in spherical coordinates is given by dS = R² sin(θ) dθ dφ. The direction of this area element is normal to the surface, pointing radially outward. So, the vector is:\n    d**S** = (R² sin(θ) dθ dφ) **r̂**\n\n**4. Calculate the Dot Product (f ⋅ dS)**\n\nNow, we compute the dot product of the field and the surface element vector:\n**f** ⋅ d**S** = [ (1/R²) **r̂** ] ⋅ [ (R² sin(θ) dθ dφ) **r̂** ]\n\nSince **r̂** ⋅ **r̂** = 1, the expression simplifies:\n**f** ⋅ d**S** = (1/R²) * (R²) * sin(θ) dθ dφ\n**f** ⋅ d**S** = sin(θ) dθ dφ\n\n**5. Evaluate the Integral**\n\nNow we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for a full sphere are:\n*   `θ` (polar angle) from 0 to π.\n*   `φ` (azimuthal angle) from 0 to 2π.\n\n∮_S (**f** ⋅ d**S**) = ∫(from φ=0 to 2π) ∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ dφ\n\nLet's evaluate the integrals separately:\n*   **Integral with respect to θ:**\n    ∫(from 0 to π) sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)](from 0 to π)\n    = -cos(π) - (-cos(0))\n    = -(-1) - (-1)\n    = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n*   **Integral with respect to φ:**\n    ∫(from 0 to 2π) dφ = [φ](from 0 to 2π)\n    = 2π - 0 = 2π\n\nMultiplying the results of the two integrals:\n∮_S (**f** ⋅ d**S**) = (2) * (2π) = 4π\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral we wanted to find is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n∫_V (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV = 4π\n\nThis result is independent of the radius R, as long as R > 0 (meaning the sphere encloses the origin).\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 4/3 π R\nB) 4 π\nC) 1\nD) 0\n\nThe calculated answer is 4π, which matches option B.\n\n*(Self-Correction/Alternative Thought): If we were to calculate ∇ ⋅ **f** directly, we would find it is 0 for r > 0. However, the field is singular at r = 0, and the divergence at this point is a Dirac delta function: ∇ ⋅ (**r̂**/r²) = 4πδ³(**r**). Integrating 4πδ³(**r**) over a volume that includes the origin gives 4π, confirming the result from the Divergence Theorem.*\n\n<<<B>>>"
