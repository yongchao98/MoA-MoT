    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Problem**\n\nThe problem asks for a possible decay path and its associated probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via two consecutive electric dipole transitions. The notation is $|n, l, m\\rangle$, representing the principal, orbital angular momentum, and magnetic quantum numbers, respectively.\n\n### **2. Recall the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole Transitions**\n\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by a set of selection rules, which dictate which transitions are \"allowed\". For a transition from an initial state $|n, l, m\\rangle$ to a final state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$, the rules are:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l$, must be $\\pm 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m$, must be $0$ or $\\pm 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   The change in the principal quantum number, $\\Delta n$, is not restricted by a selection rule, but for spontaneous emission (decay), the energy must decrease, so $n' < n$.\n\n### **3. Determine the Intermediate State(s)**\n\nThe decay is a two-step process:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nLet's find the quantum numbers of the allowed intermediate state(s) by applying the selection rules to both steps.\n\n**First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$**\n*   Initial state: $|n=3, l=0, m=0\\rangle$.\n*   Applying the rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{int} - 0 = \\pm 1 \\implies l_{int} = 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{int} - 0 = 0, \\pm 1 \\implies m_{int} = -1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$.\n*   From the options provided, the intermediate principal quantum number is $n_{int}=2$. This is a valid decay since $2 < 3$.\n*   So, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Second Transition: $|n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   Final state: $|n=1, l=0, m=0\\rangle$.\n*   Let's check if the transitions from our possible intermediate states are allowed:\n    *   Intermediate state candidates: $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ where $m_{int} \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Applying the rules:\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{int} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{int} = 0 - m_{int}$.\n            *   If $m_{int}=-1$, $\\Delta m = 1$. This is allowed.\n            *   If $m_{int}=0$, $\\Delta m = 0$. This is allowed.\n            *   If $m_{int}=1$, $\\Delta m = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   All three intermediate states lead to an allowed transition to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Thus, there are three possible decay routes:\n    1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### **4. Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route**\n\nThe problem asks for the probability corresponding to a given route. This is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition. The atom starts in the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state and can decay into any of the three $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ states. We need to find the relative probability of these three initial decay channels.\n\n*   The transition probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element of the electric dipole operator, $\\mathbf{d}$.\n*   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, which means its wave function is spherically symmetric. In such a case, there is no preferred direction in space.\n*   The electric dipole operator has components corresponding to the three possible changes in $m$:\n    *   $d_z \\propto r \\cos\\theta$ (for $\\Delta m = 0$)\n    *   $d_x \\pm i d_y \\propto r \\sin\\theta e^{\\pm i\\phi}$ (for $\\Delta m = \\pm 1$)\n*   Due to the spherical symmetry of the initial state, the system has no preference for emitting a photon that changes $m$ by $-1, 0,$ or $+1$. Therefore, the transition probabilities to the three degenerate final states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle$) must be equal.\n\n**Formal Argument (using Wigner-Eckart Theorem):**\nThe transition probability from $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ is proportional to $|\\langle n'l'm'|\\mathbf{d}|nlm\\rangle|^2$. According to the Wigner-Eckart theorem, this matrix element can be separated into a physical part (the reduced matrix element) and a geometric part (the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient).\n\nFor the first transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|2,1,m'\\rangle$:\n$P(m') \\propto |\\langle 2,1,m' | d_q | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 \\propto |\\langle 0,0; 1,q | 1,m' \\rangle|^2 \\cdot |\\langle 2,1 || d || 3,0 \\rangle|^2$\n\nWhere $q=m'$. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients $\\langle 0,0; 1,m' | 1,m' \\rangle$ are equal to 1 for all $m' \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$. The reduced matrix element $\\langle 2,1 || d || 3,0 \\rangle$ is independent of $m'$.\nTherefore, the probabilities are equal for all three transitions:\n$P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle)$\n\nSince these are the only three possible intermediate states for the $n=2$ level, their probabilities must sum to 1. If there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability of each one is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   Prob (path via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$) = $\\frac{1}{3}$\n*   Prob (path via $|2,1,0\\rangle$) = $\\frac{1}{3}$\n*   Prob (path via $|2,1,1\\rangle$) = $\\frac{1}{3}$\n\nThe second step of the cascade ($|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$) is guaranteed to happen once the atom is in the intermediate state, so the probability of the entire route is just the probability of the first step.\n\n### **5. Compare with Options**\n\nLet's review the given options:\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\nB) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\nC) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (**Correct** route and probability)\nD) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe only option that matches our analysis is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
