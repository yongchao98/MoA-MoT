    "**1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the range of 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretching in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding (dimerization).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** A strong, sharp peak around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) bond stretching in a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\nConclusion from FTIR: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the choices. The absence of peaks in the vinyl region (around 1650 cm⁻¹ for C=C and 3010-3100 cm⁻¹ for =C-H) is also consistent with the NMR data.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in interpreting the complex splitting patterns described. The multiplicity of a signal is given by the `n+1` rule, where `n` is the number of equivalent neighboring protons. When a proton is coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons, the splitting pattern becomes a \"multiplet of multiplets.\"\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   This means a single proton is being split by three different groups of neighbors.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** It's coupled to one neighboring proton (n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** It's coupled to a group of two neighboring protons (n=2).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** It's coupled to a group of three neighboring protons (n=3).\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    *   This means a different proton is also being split by three different groups of neighbors.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** It's coupled to one neighboring proton (n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** It's coupled to a group of two neighboring protons (n=2).\n    *   **Another Triplet (t):** It's coupled to another, different group of two neighboring protons (n=2).\n\nThese highly complex splitting patterns typically arise from methine protons (CH) in a complex, chiral environment. We must now examine the structure of each option to see which one contains protons that would produce these specific signals.\n\n**3. Evaluation of Candidate Structures**\n\nWe will focus on the methine (CH) protons in the backbone of each molecule.\n\n*   **A) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    ```\n           CH3\n           |\n    CH3-CH2-CH(c)-CH(b)-COOH\n                 |\n                 CH3\n    ```\n    *   H(b): Coupled to H(c) (1H, doublet) and the adjacent CH3 (3H, quartet). Pattern: **dq (doublet of quartets)**.\n    *   H(c): Coupled to H(b) (1H, doublet) and the adjacent CH2 (2H, triplet). Pattern: **dt (doublet of triplets)**.\n    *   This does not match the observed dtq and dtt.\n\n*   **C) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    ```\n             CH3   CH3\n             |     |\n    HOOC-CH2-CH(c)-CH(d)-CH3\n    ```\n    *   H(c): Coupled to the adjacent CH2 (2H, triplet), H(d) (1H, doublet), and the adjacent CH3 (3H, quartet). Pattern: **dtq (doublet of triplets of quartets)**. This matches one signal.\n    *   H(d): Coupled to H(c) (1H, doublet), the terminal CH3 (3H, quartet), and the other CH3 on C4 (3H, quartet). Pattern: **dqq (doublet of quartets of quartets)**.\n    *   This does not match the dtt signal.\n\n*   **D) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    ```\n          CH2CH3\n          |\n    CH3-CH2-CH(c)-CH(b)-COOH\n                 |\n                 CH2CH3\n    ```\n    *   H(b): Coupled to H(c) (1H, doublet) and the CH2 of its ethyl group (2H, triplet). Pattern: **dt (doublet of triplets)**.\n    *   H(c): Coupled to H(b) (1H, doublet), the CH2 of the main chain (2H, triplet), and the CH2 of its ethyl group (2H, triplet). Pattern: **dtt (doublet of triplets of triplets)**. This matches one signal.\n    *   However, this molecule does not have a proton that would give a dtq signal.\n\n*   **B) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH (3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid)**\n    *The condensed formula can be ambiguous. The correct IUPAC name for the structure represented is 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, found by identifying the longest carbon chain containing the COOH group.*\n    ```\n                   CH3(on C4)\n                   |\n    CH3-CH2(5)-CH(d)-CH(c)-CH2(2)-COOH\n                         |\n                         CH2CH3 (ethyl on C3)\n    ```\n    *   **Let's analyze the proton H(d) on carbon C4:**\n        *   It is coupled to H(c) on C3 (1 proton) -> **doublet**.\n        *   It is coupled to the CH2 group on C5 (2 protons) -> **triplet**.\n        *   It is coupled to the CH3 group on C4 (3 protons) -> **quartet**.\n        *   The resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This perfectly matches one of the observed signals.\n\n    *   **Now let's analyze the proton H(c) on carbon C3:**\n        *   It is coupled to H(d) on C4 (1 proton) -> **doublet**.\n        *   It is coupled to the CH2 group on C2 (2 protons) -> **triplet**.\n        *   It is coupled to the CH2 group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2 protons) -> **triplet**.\n        *   The resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This perfectly matches the other observed signal.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the structure corresponding to option B, which is 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, contains two different protons whose predicted splitting patterns perfectly match the observed `dtq` and `dtt` signals from the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
