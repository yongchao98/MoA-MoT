However, the third interpretation—that \"at least 30%\" was a common approximation for \"at least 1/3\"—yielded a result of `2.0695e-06 m`. This value is an exceptionally close match to option B, with a relative difference of only 0.50%.\n4.  **Conclusion**: The code identified this interpretation as the best fit, providing strong evidence that B is the intended answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo decide the final answer, a step-by-step analysis of the physics problem is required, paying close attention to the interpretation of the question's phrasing and the given physical quantities.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal and Given Information:**\n    The objective is to find the minimum detector resolution required to observe the decay track of at least 30% of $X^0$ particles.\n    *   Total Energy, E = 27 GeV\n    *   Rest Mass, $m_0$ = 3.41 GeV/c²\n    *   Proper Lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n\n2.  **Interpret the Physics of the Question:**\n    *   **Relativistic Motion:** The particle's total energy (27 GeV) is significantly larger than its rest mass energy (3.41 GeV), indicating it is moving at a speed very close to the speed of light. Therefore, calculations must use the principles of special relativity.\n    *   **Observation Condition:** For a decay to be \"observed,\" the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution ($L_{res}$). If it decays before traveling this distance, its production and decay points are indistinguishable.\n    *   **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of particles is a random process. The probability that a particle will travel a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by the formula $P(d \\ge x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n    *   **The 30% Condition:** We need to find the resolution $L_{res}$ such that the probability of observing the decay is at least 30%. This translates to the mathematical condition: $P(d \\ge L_{res}) = e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):**\n    The mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame. It can be calculated using the particle's momentum and proper lifetime.\n\n    *   **Calculate Momentum (p):** Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$:\n        $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ (GeV)}^2$\n        $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n    *   **Calculate Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** The formula is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\times c \\times \\tau_0$.\n        $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n        $\\lambda \\approx 7.854 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m})$\n        $\\lambda \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Resolution ($L_{res}$):**\n    Now we solve the boundary condition from Step 2: $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$.\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-L_{res}/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$\n    $L_{res} = -\\lambda \\times \\ln(0.30) \\approx \\lambda \\times 1.204$\n    $L_{res} \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.204 \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n    This result ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is reasonably close to the option $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, but the discrepancy is about 9%.\n\n### Careful Points and Refined Interpretation\n\nA common practice in physics problems is to use round numbers or simple fractions that result in clean calculations. Let's consider the possibility that \"30%\" is an approximation for 1/3.\n\n*   **Re-evaluating the 30% Condition:** If we assume the condition is to observe at least 1/3 of the decays, the equation becomes:\n    $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$\n    $L_{res} = -\\lambda \\times \\ln(1/3) = \\lambda \\times \\ln(3)$\n\n*   **Final Calculation with Refined Interpretation:**\n    $L_{res} = (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times \\ln(3)$\n    $L_{res} \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.0986$\n    $L_{res} \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis calculated value, $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is extremely close to the value in option C, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m (a difference of less than 0.5%). This strongly suggests that this was the intended method for solving the problem.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe most accurate calculation, based on a standard interpretation of physics problem design, yields a result of $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This value corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Physics and Interpret the Question\n\nThe problem asks for the \"minimum resolution\" required to \"observe at least 30% of the decays.\"\n\n*   **Observing a Decay:** In a detector like a bubble chamber, a decay is considered \"observed\" if the particle travels a distance greater than the detector's spatial resolution (`L_res`) before it decays. This creates a visible track separate from the particle's creation point.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of particles is a random process. The probability that a particle will travel a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by the exponential decay law: `P(distance ≥ x) = e^(-x/λ)`, where `λ` is the mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n*   **The Condition:** Combining these points, the condition \"observe at least 30% of the decays\" translates to the mathematical inequality: `P(distance ≥ L_res) ≥ 0.30`.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ) in the Lab Frame\n\nTo use the decay law, we first need to calculate the mean decay length (`λ`). This requires using principles of special relativity.\n\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):** This factor relates the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy (m₀c²).\n    *   Given: E = 27 GeV, m₀c² = 3.41 GeV\n    *   γ = E / m₀c² = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.918\n\n2.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ):** This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab. A direct formula is `λ = (pc / m₀c²) * c * τ₀`, where `p` is the momentum and `τ₀` is the proper lifetime.\n    *   First, find the momentum `pc` using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)².\n    *   (pc)² = E² - (m₀c²)² = (27)² - (3.41)² = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 (GeV)²\n    *   pc = √717.3719 ≈ 26.78 GeV\n    *   Now, calculate `λ`:\n    *   λ = (26.78 / 3.41) * (3 × 10⁸ m/s) * (8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s)\n    *   λ ≈ 1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Required Resolution (L_res)\n\nNow we solve for `L_res` using the condition from Step 1 and the calculated mean decay length `λ`.\n\n*   `e^(-L_res / λ) ≥ 0.30`\n\nTo find the boundary value for the resolution, we solve the equality:\n*   `e^(-L_res / λ) = 0.30`\n*   Taking the natural logarithm: `-L_res / λ = ln(0.30)`\n*   `L_res = -λ * ln(0.30) ≈ - (1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) * (-1.204) ≈ 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m`\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Result and Compare with Options\n\nThe calculated resolution is approximately `2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m`. The provided options are:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n\nThe calculated value (`2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m`) does not exactly match option B (`2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m`), but it is the only option with the correct order of magnitude. This discrepancy requires careful consideration.\n\n### Careful Point: The \"30%\" Approximation\n\nIn physics problems designed for multiple-choice answers, it is common for percentages like \"30%\" to be an approximation for a fraction that yields a cleaner result. Let's test the hypothesis that 30% is an approximation for 1/3.\n\n*   The condition becomes: `e^(-L_res / λ) ≥ 1/3`\n*   Solving the equality: `-L_res / λ = ln(1/3) = -ln(3)`\n*   `L_res = λ * ln(3)`\n*   `L_res = (1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) * 1.0986 ≈ 2.071 × 10⁻⁶ m`\n\nThis result, `2.071 × 10⁻⁶ m`, is extremely close to the value in option B, `2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m`. The less than 0.5% difference can be attributed to minor rounding of the initial values (E, m₀, τ₀) in the problem statement. This interpretation provides a much better fit than the strict calculation with 30%.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe most logical solution path assumes that \"30%\" is an approximation for 1/3. The calculation proceeds by finding the mean decay length in the lab frame and then determining the distance `d` for which `d = λ * ln(3)`. This yields a result that is a near-perfect match for option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Goal and Physical Principles\n\nThe objective is to find the minimum spatial resolution a detector needs to \"observe\" the decay of the particle X⁰ for at least 30% of the events.\n\n*   **Observing a Decay:** In a detector like a bubble chamber, a decay is considered \"observed\" if the particle travels a distance greater than the detector's resolution limit before it decays. This creates a visible track separate from the particle's creation point.\n*   **Relativistic Effects:** The particle has a total energy (E = 27 GeV) much greater than its rest mass energy (m₀c² = 3.41 GeV), so it is highly relativistic. We must use principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of unstable particles is a random process. The probability that a particle will travel a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by the formula P(distance ≥ x) = e^(-x/λ), where λ is the mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step A: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\nThe Lorentz factor relates the particle's total energy to its rest mass energy.\n*   E = γ * m₀c²\n*   γ = E / m₀c² = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.918\n\n**Step B: Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ)**\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. A direct way to calculate this is using the particle's momentum.\n*   First, find the momentum (pc) using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²\n    *   (pc)² = E² - (m₀c²)² = (27)² - (3.41)² = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 (GeV)²\n    *   pc = √717.3719 ≈ 26.78 GeV\n*   Next, calculate the mean decay length (λ) using the formula λ = (pc / m₀c²) * c * τ₀:\n    *   λ = (26.78 GeV / 3.41 GeV) * (3 × 10⁸ m/s) * (8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s)\n    *   λ ≈ 7.854 * (2.4 × 10⁻⁷ m)\n    *   λ ≈ 1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n**Step C: Calculate the Required Resolution (L_res)**\nWe need to find the resolution `L_res` such that the probability of the particle traveling a distance greater than `L_res` is at least 30%.\n*   P(distance ≥ L_res) = e^(-L_res/λ) ≥ 0.30\n*   To find the boundary condition (the largest resolution that works), we solve the equality: e^(-L_res/λ) = 0.30\n*   Taking the natural logarithm: -L_res/λ = ln(0.30) ≈ -1.204\n*   Solving for L_res: L_res = λ * 1.204 ≈ (1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) * 1.204 ≈ 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n### 3. Analysis and Comparison with Options\n\nThe calculated required resolution is approximately **2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m**. Let's compare this to the given options:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n\nThe calculated value (2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m) is numerically closest to option B (2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m). The other options are incorrect by several orders of magnitude.\n\n### 4. Careful Points and Final Confirmation\n\n*   **Interpretation of \"Minimum Resolution\":** The term can be confusing. It refers to the least stringent (i.e., largest) resolution that still allows for observing 30% of decays. Any resolution smaller (better) than this value would observe more than 30%. Our calculated value of 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m is this upper limit. Option B, being slightly smaller, comfortably satisfies the condition.\n*   **Approximation in Problem Design:** The small discrepancy between our calculated value (2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m) and the option (2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m) is common in physics problems. It often arises from rounding in the given values or from an intended simplification. As several candidate answers discovered, if one assumes \"30%\" is an approximation for the fraction **1/3**, the calculation becomes:\n    *   L_res = -λ * ln(1/3) = λ * ln(3)\n    *   L_res ≈ (1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) * 1.0986 ≈ **2.071 × 10⁻⁶ m**\n*   This result (2.071 × 10⁻⁶ m) is an almost perfect match for option B (2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m), strongly suggesting this was the intended solution path.\n\nBased on this comprehensive analysis, the calculation that assumes 30% is an approximation for 1/3 provides the most accurate match to the provided options.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires us to calculate the minimum detector resolution needed to observe the decay tracks of at least 30% of the $X^0$ particles. This involves concepts from special relativity and the exponential nature of particle decay.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:**\n    *   A particle moving at relativistic speeds experiences time dilation. Its lifetime as measured in the laboratory frame ($\\tau$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) by a factor of $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor): $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n    *   The average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying is the mean decay length, $\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity.\n    *   Particle decay is a random process. The probability that a particle will travel a distance $x$ or more before decaying is given by the exponential decay law: $P(\\text{distance} \\ge x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$.\n    *   To \"observe\" a decay, the particle's track length must be greater than the detector's resolution. Therefore, we need to find the resolution, $L_{res}$, such that $P(\\text{distance} \\ge L_{res}) \\ge 0.30$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):**\n    The Lorentz factor relates the particle's total energy ($E$) to its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$).\n    *   Given: $E = 27$ GeV, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):**\n    We can calculate this using the particle's momentum ($p$). First, find the momentum from the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    *   $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ (GeV)}^2$\n    *   $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n    The mean decay length is given by $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c \\cdot \\tau_0$.\n    *   Given: $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s, $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s.\n    *   $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78}{3.41} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    *   $\\lambda \\approx 7.854 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Resolution ($L_{res}$):**\n    We need to find the resolution $L_{res}$ that satisfies the condition $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$. To find the boundary condition (the largest possible resolution that works), we solve the equality:\n    *   $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    *   Taking the natural logarithm: $-\\frac{L_{res}}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30)$\n    *   $L_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204)$\n    *   $L_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Refine:**\n    Our calculated value is $L_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The closest option is C) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The discrepancy is about 9%.\n\n    Let's consider a common practice in physics problems where a percentage like 30% might be an approximation for a simpler fraction like 1/3, which often leads to a cleaner answer involving natural logarithms. Let's test this hypothesis.\n    *   $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$\n    *   $-\\frac{L_{res}}{\\lambda} = \\ln(1/3) = -\\ln(3)$\n    *   $L_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.0986$\n    *   $L_{res} \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n    This result, $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is extremely close to option C) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This strongly suggests that this was the intended method to solve the problem.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Relativistic Calculation:** It is essential to use relativistic formulas for energy, momentum, and time, as the particle's energy is much greater than its rest mass.\n*   **Mean Decay Length vs. Resolution:** The mean decay length ($\\lambda$) is the average distance. The resolution required to see a certain fraction of decays is related to $\\lambda$ via the exponential decay law, not equal to it.\n*   **Interpretation of \"At least 30%\":** This sets up an inequality, $P \\ge 0.30$. The \"minimum resolution\" corresponds to the boundary case, which gives the largest possible value for the resolution that still satisfies the condition.\n*   **Problem Heuristics:** In multiple-choice physics questions, if a direct calculation is slightly off from an option, consider if a common approximation (like 30% ≈ 1/3) was intended to make the numbers work out cleanly.\n\nBased on the analysis, the calculation assuming the 30% was an approximation for 1/3 yields a result that matches one of the options almost perfectly.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating the careful points needed to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Calculate Relativistic Parameters:** The particle's total energy (E = 27 GeV) is significantly larger than its rest mass energy (m₀c² = 3.41 GeV), indicating it is moving at a highly relativistic speed. The first step is to calculate the Lorentz factor (γ), which quantifies these relativistic effects.\n    *   **Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n        γ = E / m₀c² = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.918\n\n2.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ):** The proper lifetime (τ₀) is the particle's lifetime in its own rest frame. In the laboratory frame, this lifetime is dilated by the factor γ. The mean decay length (λ) is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It can be calculated efficiently using the particle's momentum.\n    *   **Momentum (pc):** From the relativistic energy-momentum relation E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²:\n        (pc)² = E² - (m₀c²)² = (27)² - (3.41)² = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 (GeV)²\n        pc = √717.3719 ≈ 26.78 GeV\n    *   **Mean Decay Length (λ):**\n        λ = (pc / m₀c²) * c * τ₀\n        λ = (26.78 / 3.41) * (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * (8 x 10⁻¹⁶ s)\n        λ ≈ 7.854 * (2.4 x 10⁻⁷ m) ≈ 1.885 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\n3.  **Apply the Exponential Decay Law:** The question asks for the resolution needed to observe \"at least 30% of the decays.\" For a decay to be \"observed,\" the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution (`L_res`). The probability that a particle travels a distance `d` or more before decaying follows an exponential law:\n    P(distance ≥ d) = e^(-d/λ)\n    We need to find the resolution `L_res` that satisfies the condition:\n    e^(-L_res / λ) ≥ 0.30\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Resolution:** To find the boundary condition, we solve the equality:\n    e^(-L_res / λ) = 0.30\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    -L_res / λ = ln(0.30)\n    L_res = -λ * ln(0.30)\n    Using ln(0.30) ≈ -1.204:\n    L_res ≈ -(1.885 x 10⁻⁶ m) * (-1.204) ≈ 2.27 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:** The calculated required resolution is approximately 2.27 x 10⁻⁶ m. This value represents the largest possible resolution (i.e., the least stringent detector) that can still observe at least 30% of the decays. We compare this to the given options:\n    A) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n    B) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n    C) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n    D) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n\n    The calculated value (2.27 x 10⁻⁶ m) is numerically closest to option D (2.08 x 10⁻⁶ m). The other options are incorrect by several orders of magnitude.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Interpretation of \"Energy\":** The given energy of 27 GeV is correctly interpreted as the total energy, as it is greater than the rest mass of 3.41 GeV.\n*   **Interpretation of \"Minimum Resolution\":** This term refers to the boundary condition for the detector's capability. A resolution of `L_res = 2.27 x 10⁻⁶ m` would allow observation of exactly 30% of decays. Any resolution value smaller than this (i.e., a \"better\" resolution) would allow for observing more than 30%. Since 2.08 x 10⁻⁶ m is less than 2.27 x 10⁻⁶ m, a detector with this resolution would indeed observe *at least* 30% of the decays.\n*   **Discrepancy in Values:** The calculated value (2.27 x 10⁻⁶ m) differs from the closest option (2.08 x 10⁻⁶ m) by about 9%. This is common in physics problems and is likely due to the input values being rounded. A very plausible explanation, as noted by several candidate answers, is that the problem intended for the fraction to be 1/3 instead of 30%. In that case, the calculation would be `L_res = λ * ln(3) ≈ 1.885 x 10⁻⁶ m * 1.0986 ≈ 2.07 x 10⁻⁶ m`, which is an almost perfect match for option D.

Understand the Goal and Physical Principles\nThe goal is to find the minimum spatial resolution a detector needs to observe the decay track of at least 30% of the $X^0$ particles.\n\n*   **Relativity:** The particle is moving at relativistic speeds, so we must use formulas for relativistic energy, momentum, and time dilation.\n*   **Particle Decay:** The decay of particles is a random process governed by an exponential decay law. The probability that a particle travels a distance `x` or more before decaying is $P(d \\ge x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n*   **Observation Condition:** To \"observe\" a decay, the particle's track length must be greater than the detector's resolution. Let the resolution be $L_{res}$. The condition is that the fraction of particles with track lengths greater than $L_{res}$ must be at least 30%.\n    $P(d \\ge L_{res}) = e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\n### 2. Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the mean decay length, $\\lambda$, in the laboratory frame.\n\n*   **Given:**\n    *   Total Energy, $E = 27$ GeV\n    *   Rest Mass, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n    *   Proper Lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   Speed of Light, $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\n*   **Calculate Momentum ($pc$):**\n    We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ (GeV)}^2$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n*   **Calculate Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):**\n    The mean decay length is given by $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\times c \\tau_0$.\n    $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $\\lambda \\approx 7.854 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### 3.

We need to find the resolution $L_{res}$ that satisfies $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$.\n\n*   **Careful Point: Interpretation of \"30%\"**\n    In physics problems with multiple-choice answers, it is common for percentages like \"30%\" to be an approximation for a simple fraction that yields a clean answer. Let's test the hypothesis that 30% is an approximation for 1/3, as suggested by several candidate answers.\n\n*   **Calculation assuming P = 1/3:**\n    We solve for the boundary condition: $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-\\frac{L_{res}}{\\lambda} = \\ln(1/3) = -\\ln(3)$\n    $L_{res} = \\lambda \\times \\ln(3)$\n    Using our calculated $\\lambda \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m and $\\ln(3) \\approx 1.0986$:\n    $L_{res} \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.0986 \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### 4.

The minor difference (less than 0.5%) is due to rounding of the input values in the problem statement. This confirms that the most plausible intended solution involves assuming the 30% is an approximation for 1/3.\n\n*   **Alternative Check (using exactly 30%):**\n    If we use 0.30 directly, $L_{res} = \\lambda \\times \\ln(1/0.3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times 1.204 \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This value is not as close to any of the options as the result from the 1/3 approximation.\n\nTherefore, the most logical and consistent solution leads to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem requires us to determine the minimum spatial resolution a detector needs to observe the decay track of at least 30% of the $X^0$ particles.

Understand the Goal and Physical Principles\nThe objective is to find the minimum spatial resolution a detector needs to observe the decay track of at least 30% of the $X^0$ particles. This involves two main physical concepts:\n*   **Special Relativity:** The particle is moving at high speed, so its lifetime as observed in the laboratory is longer than its lifetime at rest (time dilation). Its decay length is calculated using relativistic kinematics.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** Particle decay is a random process. The probability that a particle will travel a certain distance before decaying follows an exponential distribution.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step A: Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\nThe Lorentz factor relates the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$).\n*   Given: $E = 27$ GeV, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n*   Formula: $E = \\gamma m_0c^2$\n*   Calculation: $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n**Step B: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It can be calculated directly using the particle's momentum.\n*   First, find the momentum ($pc$) using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    *   $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ (GeV)}^2$\n    *   $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78$ GeV\n*   Next, calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$) using the formula $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c \\tau_0$.\n    *   Given: $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s, $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n    *   $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78}{3.41} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step C: Apply the Decay Condition**\nTo \"observe\" a decay, the particle must travel a distance ($d$) greater than the detector's resolution ($L_{res}$). The problem states we must observe at least 30% of decays.\n*   The probability of a particle traveling a distance $d \\ge L_{res}$ is given by $P(d \\ge L_{res}) = e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda}$.\n*   The condition is: $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$.\n\n**Step D: Solve for the Resolution ($L_{res}$)**\nTo find the required resolution, we solve for the boundary condition. There are two interpretations for \"30%\":\n\n*   **Interpretation 1: Use the exact value of 0.30.**\n    *   $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    *   $L_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\n    This value is reasonably close to option B ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m), but the ~9% difference is notable.\n\n*   **Interpretation 2: Assume \"30%\" is a common approximation for 1/3.**\n    In physics problems with multiple-choice answers, values are often chosen to give a clean result. Let's test the hypothesis that we need to observe at least 1/3 of the decays.\n    *   $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$\n    *   $L_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(1/3) = \\lambda \\ln(3)$\n    *   $L_{res} = (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.0986 \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\n\n### 3. Conclusion and Careful Points\n\n*   The result from Interpretation 2 ($2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is an almost perfect match for the value in option B ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). This strongly suggests that this was the intended method for solving the problem.\n*   **Careful Point 1 (Interpretation):** The most critical step is correctly interpreting the condition \"observe at least 30% of the decays\". This means the particle's track length must be greater than the resolution, and the 30% value is likely a proxy for 1/3 to yield a clean answer.\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Mean Length vs. Resolution):** A common mistake is to assume the answer is simply the mean decay length ($\\lambda \\approx 1.89 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). While this value is close, it doesn't account for the probability condition. A resolution equal to the mean decay length would observe $e^{-1} \\approx 37\\%$ of decays.\n*   **Careful Point 3 (Relativistic Formulas):** Using the correct relativistic formulas for energy, momentum, and time is essential.

Understand the Physical Principles\nThe problem involves a high-energy particle, which means we must use the principles of special relativity. The key concepts are:\n*   **Relativistic Energy:** The total energy (E) of a particle is related to its rest mass ($m_0$) and its Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) by the equation $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$.\n*   **Time Dilation:** A moving particle's internal clock runs slower as observed from a stationary frame (the lab). Its lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) by a factor of $\\gamma$: $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n*   **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before it decays. It is calculated as $\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of particles is a random process. The probability that a particle will travel a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by an exponential law: $P(d \\ge x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step A: Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\nThe Lorentz factor is the ratio of the particle's total energy to its rest energy.\n*   Total Energy, E = 27 GeV\n*   Rest Mass Energy, $m_0c^2$ = 3.41 GeV\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27}{3.41} \\approx 7.918$\n\n**Step B: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\nWe can calculate this using the particle's momentum, which is often more direct.\nFirst, find the momentum ($p$) using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n*   $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ (GeV)}^2$\n*   $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nNow, calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$) using the formula $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c \\cdot \\tau_0$.\n*   Proper lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   Speed of light, $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n*   $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78}{3.41} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step C: Calculate the Required Resolution**\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe *at least 30%* of the decays. This means we need to find the track length, $d$, such that the probability of a particle traveling at least that far is 30%.\n*   $P(x \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\nTo solve for $d$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n*   $-d/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$\n*   $d = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30) = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(1/0.30) \\approx \\lambda \\cdot 1.204$\n*   $d \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.204 \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### 3. Analysis of Options and Careful Points\n\n*   **Calculated Value vs. Options:** Our calculated value is $d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The provided options are:\n    A) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n    B) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n    C) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n    D) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n    The only option with the correct order of magnitude is A. The calculated value is reasonably close to option A.\n\n*   **A Common Physics Problem Trope:** In many physics problems, numbers are chosen to yield a clean result. It is highly likely that the \"30%\" was a rounded value for 1/3. Let's test this hypothesis, as several candidate answers did.\n    *   If we set the probability to 1/3: $e^{-d/\\lambda} = 1/3$\n    *   $d = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$\n    *   $d \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.0986 \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n*   **Conclusion:** This result, $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is an almost perfect match for option A, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This provides strong evidence that this was the intended solution path. The other options are incorrect by several orders of magnitude.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nAn analysis of the provided answers reveals a consistent computational approach, despite some variations in interpretation and final conclusions on the option letter. The core of the problem is to determine a specific distance, which corresponds to the detector's resolution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\n    This is the foundational step upon which all interpretations are built. The mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying.\n    *   **Given:** Total Energy $E = 27$ GeV, Rest Mass $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV, Proper Lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s.\n    *   **Relativistic Momentum ($pc$):** First, we find the particle's momentum using the energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n        $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{27^2 - 3.41^2} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78$ GeV.\n    *   **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** The formula for the mean decay length is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c \\tau_0$.\n        $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n    This value is consistently calculated across most of the provided answers.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Condition: \"Observe at least 30% of the decays\"**\n    This is the most critical part of the problem and where the candidate answers show slight variations.\n    *   **Physical Meaning:** For a decay to be \"observed,\" the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution ($L_{res}$). If it decays before traveling this distance, the production and decay points are indistinguishable.\n    *   **Exponential Decay Law:** The probability that a particle travels a distance $d$ or more before decaying is given by $P(d \\ge L_{res}) = e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda}$.\n    *   **The Condition:** We need to find the resolution $L_{res}$ such that at least 30% of particles are observed, meaning $P(d \\ge L_{res}) \\ge 0.30$.\n\n3.  **Solve for the Resolution ($L_{res}$)**\n    To find the required resolution, we solve the boundary condition of the inequality:\n    $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-\\frac{L_{res}}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n    $L_{res} = \\lambda \\times 1.204 \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.204 \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n    This calculated value is close to the option $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, but the match is not perfect.\n\n### Careful Points and Refinements\n\n*   **Ambiguity of \"Minimum Resolution\":** The term can be confusing. It refers to the *least stringent* (i.e., largest numerical value) of the resolution that still satisfies the condition. Any resolution smaller (more stringent) than this value would observe an even greater fraction of decays.\n*   **The \"30%\" Approximation:** As identified in several candidate answers (e.g., Answer 2, Answer 6), it is a common practice in physics problems for a number like 30% to be a rounded value for a simpler fraction, such as 1/3. Let's test this hypothesis, as it often leads to a value that perfectly matches one of the options.\n    *   **Recalculating with 1/3:**\n        $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$\n        $-\\frac{L_{res}}{\\lambda} = \\ln(1/3) = -\\ln(3)$\n        $L_{res} = \\lambda \\times \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.0986 \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe value calculated using the 1/3 approximation, $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is extremely close to the value presented in option D, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The other options are incorrect by several orders of magnitude. This provides strong evidence that this was the intended solution path.\n\n*   **Calculated Value:** $\\approx 2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n*   **Option D:** $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n*   **Other Options:** $10^{-9}$ m, $10^{-3}$ m, $10^{-1}$ m (all incorrect).\n\nThe overwhelming consensus among the detailed analyses points to the value $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, which corresponds to option D in the problem statement.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem to determine the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the minimum resolution required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the particle decays. In a detector like a bubble chamber, a decay is considered \"observed\" if the particle travels a distance greater than the detector's spatial resolution before it decays. This creates a visible track separate from the particle's creation point.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Physics:** The decay of unstable particles is a random process governed by an exponential decay law. The probability that a particle will travel a distance `d` or more before decaying is given by:\n    $P(d \\ge L_{res}) = e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda}$\n    where $L_{res}$ is the detector resolution and $\\lambda$ is the particle's mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\n    The condition is to observe *at least* 30% of the decays, so:\n    $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):**\n    To find $\\lambda$, we first need the particle's properties in the lab frame.\n    *   **Given:**\n        *   Total Energy, $E = 27$ GeV\n        *   Rest Mass, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n        *   Proper Lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n        *   Speed of Light, $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\n    *   **Calculate Momentum ($pc$):** We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n        $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ (GeV)}^2$\n        $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n    *   **Calculate Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** The average distance a relativistic particle travels is given by $\\lambda = \\frac{p}{m_0} c \\tau_0$, which can be written as:\n        $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\times c \\times \\tau_0$\n        $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n        $\\lambda \\approx 7.854 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Resolution ($L_{res}$):**\n    Now we solve the inequality from Step 2. To find the boundary condition (the largest resolution that still works), we use an equality:\n    $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-\\frac{L_{res}}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n    $L_{res} = 1.204 \\times \\lambda = 1.204 \\times (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Refine:**\n    The calculated value is $L_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The options are:\n    A) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n    B) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n    C) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n    D) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n\n    Our calculated value is closest to option C. The other options are incorrect by several orders of magnitude. The small discrepancy between our calculation ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) and the option ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is likely intentional. In physics problems, round numbers like \"30%\" are often approximations for values that yield cleaner results. Let's test the hypothesis that \"at least 30%\" was meant to be satisfied by observing a fraction of $1/3$ (which is ~33.3%).\n\n    *   **Refined Calculation:**\n        $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$\n        $-\\frac{L_{res}}{\\lambda} = \\ln(1/3) = -\\ln(3) \\approx -1.0986$\n        $L_{res} = \\ln(3) \\times \\lambda = 1.0986 \\times (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n    This refined calculation gives a result of $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, which is an almost perfect match for option C, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Interpretation of \"Observe\":** The key is understanding that \"observing\" a decay requires the particle's track length to be greater than the detector's resolution.\n*   **Relativistic Calculations:** The particle is highly relativistic ($\\gamma \\approx 7.9$), so using the correct formulas for energy, momentum, and time dilation is essential.\n*   **Total vs. Kinetic Energy:** The problem states \"energy... is 27GeV\". In this context, it is standard to assume this is the total energy. Assuming it is kinetic energy leads to a different but still similar result, but is a less likely interpretation.\n*   **Problem Design:** The specific value in the correct option ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) strongly suggests that the problem was designed with the assumption that the fraction of decays to be observed is $1/3$, which is \"at least 30%\".\n\nThe overwhelming evidence from the calculations points to option C as the only physically plausible answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the most accurate methodologies from the provided answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Calculate the Relativistic Properties of the Particle**\n    The first step is to determine the particle's properties in the laboratory frame using the principles of special relativity.\n\n    *   **Given:**\n        *   Total energy, E = 27 GeV\n        *   Rest mass energy, m₀c² = 3.41 GeV\n        *   Proper lifetime, τ₀ = 8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s\n        *   Speed of light, c ≈ 3 × 10⁸ m/s\n\n    *   **Lorentz Factor (γ):** The Lorentz factor relates the total energy to the rest energy.\n        γ = E / (m₀c²) = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.918\n\n    *   **Momentum (p):** The particle's momentum can be found using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)².\n        (pc)² = E² - (m₀c²)² = (27)² - (3.41)² = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 (GeV)²\n        pc = √717.3719 ≈ 26.78 GeV\n\n2.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ)**\n    The mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before it decays. It can be calculated directly using the momentum.\n\n    *   **Formula:** λ = (pc / m₀c²) * c * τ₀\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        λ = (26.78 GeV / 3.41 GeV) * (3 × 10⁸ m/s) * (8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s)\n        λ ≈ 7.854 * (2.4 × 10⁻⁷ m)\n        λ ≈ 1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n3.  **Interpret the Condition and Apply the Exponential Decay Law**\n    The core of the question is to find the \"minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays.\"\n\n    *   **Physical Meaning:** A decay is \"observed\" if the particle leaves a track longer than the detector's resolution limit ($L_{res}$).

Assuming the 27 GeV is total energy leads to a consistent answer.\n*   **Relativistic Formulas:** The particle is highly relativistic (γ ≈ 7.9), so using classical formulas for momentum or energy would give a completely wrong result.\n*   **Mean Decay Length vs. Resolution:** The mean decay length (λ) is the average distance traveled, not the final answer.

Let's test the hypothesis that the intended condition was to observe at least 1/3 of the decays.\n        $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$\n        $L_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.0986 \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\n\n4.  **Compare with Options and Conclude**\n    The value from the second interpretation, $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is an almost perfect match for the value in option D, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The other options are incorrect by several orders of magnitude. This provides overwhelming evidence that this was the intended solution path.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Relativistic vs. Classical:** It is essential to use relativistic formulas for energy, momentum, and time. The particle's Lorentz factor is $\\gamma \\approx 7.9$, making classical mechanics completely inapplicable.\n*   **Total Energy:** The given 27 GeV is the particle's total energy, a standard convention in particle physics unless \"kinetic energy\" is explicitly stated.\n*   **Mean Decay Length vs. Resolution:** The answer is not the mean decay length ($\\lambda$). A resolution equal to $\\lambda$ would observe $e^{-1} \\approx 37\\%$ of decays. The resolution must be calculated from $\\lambda$ using the exponential decay law to match the 30% condition.\n*   **Interpretation of \"Minimum Resolution\":** This term refers to the largest possible (i.e., least stringent) resolution value that still satisfies the condition. Any resolution *smaller* (better) than this value would observe *more* than 30% of the decays.\n*   **The \"30% ≈ 1/3\" Approximation:** Recognizing that 30% is likely a convenient approximation for the fraction 1/3 is the key insight to arriving at the precise answer provided in the options. This is a common problem-setting technique.\n\n<<<D>>>"

This value corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Physics and Interpret the Question\n\nThe problem asks for the \"minimum resolution\" required to \"observe at least 30% of the decays.\"\n\n*   **Observing a Decay:** In a detector like a bubble chamber, a decay is considered \"observed\" if the particle travels a distance greater than the detector's spatial resolution (`L_res`) before it decays. This creates a visible track separate from the particle's creation point.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of particles is a random process. The probability that a particle will travel a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by the exponential decay law: `P(distance ≥ x) = e^(-x/λ)`, where `λ` is the mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n*   **The Condition:** Combining these points, the condition \"observe at least 30% of the decays\" translates to the mathematical inequality: `P(distance ≥ L_res) ≥ 0.30`.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ) in the Lab Frame\n\nTo use the decay law, we first need to calculate the mean decay length (`λ`). This requires using principles of special relativity.\n\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):** This factor relates the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy (m₀c²).\n    *   Given: E = 27 GeV, m₀c² = 3.41 GeV\n    *   γ = E / m₀c² = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.918\n\n2.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ):** This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab. A direct formula is `λ = (pc / m₀c²) * c * τ₀`, where `p` is the momentum and `τ₀` is the proper lifetime.\n    *   First, find the momentum `pc` using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)².\n    *   (pc)² = E² - (m₀c²)² = (27)² - (3.41)² = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 (GeV)²\n    *   pc = √717.3719 ≈ 26.78 GeV\n    *   Now, calculate `λ`:\n    *   λ = (26.78 / 3.41) * (3 × 10⁸ m/s) * (8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s)\n    *   λ ≈ 1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Required Resolution (L_res)\n\nNow we solve for `L_res` using the condition from Step 1 and the calculated mean decay length `λ`.\n\n*   `e^(-L_res / λ) ≥ 0.30`\n\nTo find the boundary value for the resolution, we solve the equality:\n*   `e^(-L_res / λ) = 0.30`\n*   Taking the natural logarithm: `-L_res / λ = ln(0.30)`\n*   `L_res = -λ * ln(0.30) ≈ - (1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) * (-1.204) ≈ 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m`\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Result and Compare with Options\n\nThe calculated resolution is approximately `2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m`. The provided options are:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n\nThe calculated value (`2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m`) does not exactly match option B (`2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m`), but it is the only option with the correct order of magnitude. This discrepancy requires careful consideration.\n\n### Careful Point: The \"30%\" Approximation\n\nIn physics problems designed for multiple-choice answers, it is common for percentages like \"30%\" to be an approximation for a fraction that yields a cleaner result. Let's test the hypothesis that 30% is an approximation for 1/3.\n\n*   The condition becomes: `e^(-L_res / λ) ≥ 1/3`\n*   Solving the equality: `-L_res / λ = ln(1/3) = -ln(3)`\n*   `L_res = λ * ln(3)`\n*   `L_res = (1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) * 1.0986 ≈ 2.071 × 10⁻⁶ m`\n\nThis result, `2.071 × 10⁻⁶ m`, is extremely close to the value in option B, `2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m`. The less than 0.5% difference can be attributed to minor rounding of the initial values (E, m₀, τ₀) in the problem statement. This interpretation provides a much better fit than the strict calculation with 30%.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe most logical solution path assumes that \"30%\" is an approximation for 1/3. The calculation proceeds by finding the mean decay length in the lab frame and then determining the distance `d` for which `d = λ * ln(3)`. This yields a result that is a near-perfect match for option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Goal and Physical Principles\n\nThe objective is to find the minimum spatial resolution a detector needs to \"observe\" the decay of the particle X⁰ for at least 30% of the events.\n\n*   **Observing a Decay:** In a detector like a bubble chamber, a decay is considered \"observed\" if the particle travels a distance greater than the detector's resolution limit before it decays. This creates a visible track separate from the particle's creation point.\n*   **Relativistic Effects:** The particle has a total energy (E = 27 GeV) much greater than its rest mass energy (m₀c² = 3.41 GeV), so it is highly relativistic. We must use principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of unstable particles is a random process. The probability that a particle will travel a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by the formula P(distance ≥ x) = e^(-x/λ), where λ is the mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step A: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\nThe Lorentz factor relates the particle's total energy to its rest mass energy.\n*   E = γ * m₀c²\n*   γ = E / m₀c² = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.918\n\n**Step B: Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ)**\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. A direct way to calculate this is using the particle's momentum.\n*   First, find the momentum (pc) using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²\n    *   (pc)² = E² - (m₀c²)² = (27)² - (3.41)² = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 (GeV)²\n    *   pc = √717.3719 ≈ 26.78 GeV\n*   Next, calculate the mean decay length (λ) using the formula λ = (pc / m₀c²) * c * τ₀:\n    *   λ = (26.78 GeV / 3.41 GeV) * (3 × 10⁸ m/s) * (8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s)\n    *   λ ≈ 7.854 * (2.4 × 10⁻⁷ m)\n    *   λ ≈ 1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n**Step C: Calculate the Required Resolution (L_res)**\nWe need to find the resolution `L_res` such that the probability of the particle traveling a distance greater than `L_res` is at least 30%.\n*   P(distance ≥ L_res) = e^(-L_res/λ) ≥ 0.30\n*   To find the boundary condition (the largest resolution that works), we solve the equality: e^(-L_res/λ) = 0.30\n*   Taking the natural logarithm: -L_res/λ = ln(0.30) ≈ -1.204\n*   Solving for L_res: L_res = λ * 1.204 ≈ (1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) * 1.204 ≈ 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n### 3. Analysis and Comparison with Options\n\nThe calculated required resolution is approximately **2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m**. Let's compare this to the given options:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n\nThe calculated value (2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m) is numerically closest to option B (2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m). The other options are incorrect by several orders of magnitude.\n\n### 4. Careful Points and Final Confirmation\n\n*   **Interpretation of \"Minimum Resolution\":** The term can be confusing. It refers to the least stringent (i.e., largest) resolution that still allows for observing 30% of decays. Any resolution smaller (better) than this value would observe more than 30%. Our calculated value of 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m is this upper limit. Option B, being slightly smaller, comfortably satisfies the condition.\n*   **Approximation in Problem Design:** The small discrepancy between our calculated value (2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m) and the option (2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m) is common in physics problems. It often arises from rounding in the given values or from an intended simplification. As several candidate answers discovered, if one assumes \"30%\" is an approximation for the fraction **1/3**, the calculation becomes:\n    *   L_res = -λ * ln(1/3) = λ * ln(3)\n    *   L_res ≈ (1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) * 1.0986 ≈ **2.071 × 10⁻⁶ m**\n*   This result (2.071 × 10⁻⁶ m) is an almost perfect match for option B (2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m), strongly suggesting this was the intended solution path.\n\nBased on this comprehensive analysis, the calculation that assumes 30% is an approximation for 1/3 provides the most accurate match to the provided options.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires us to calculate the minimum detector resolution needed to observe the decay tracks of at least 30% of the $X^0$ particles. This involves concepts from special relativity and the exponential nature of particle decay.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:**\n    *   A particle moving at relativistic speeds experiences time dilation. Its lifetime as measured in the laboratory frame ($\\tau$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) by a factor of $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor): $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n    *   The average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying is the mean decay length, $\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity.\n    *   Particle decay is a random process. The probability that a particle will travel a distance $x$ or more before decaying is given by the exponential decay law: $P(\\text{distance} \\ge x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$.\n    *   To \"observe\" a decay, the particle's track length must be greater than the detector's resolution. Therefore, we need to find the resolution, $L_{res}$, such that $P(\\text{distance} \\ge L_{res}) \\ge 0.30$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):**\n    The Lorentz factor relates the particle's total energy ($E$) to its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$).\n    *   Given: $E = 27$ GeV, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):**\n    We can calculate this using the particle's momentum ($p$). First, find the momentum from the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    *   $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ (GeV)}^2$\n    *   $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n    The mean decay length is given by $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c \\cdot \\tau_0$.\n    *   Given: $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s, $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s.\n    *   $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78}{3.41} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    *   $\\lambda \\approx 7.854 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Resolution ($L_{res}$):**\n    We need to find the resolution $L_{res}$ that satisfies the condition $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$. To find the boundary condition (the largest possible resolution that works), we solve the equality:\n    *   $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    *   Taking the natural logarithm: $-\\frac{L_{res}}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30)$\n    *   $L_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204)$\n    *   $L_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Refine:**\n    Our calculated value is $L_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The closest option is C) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The discrepancy is about 9%.\n\n    Let's consider a common practice in physics problems where a percentage like 30% might be an approximation for a simpler fraction like 1/3, which often leads to a cleaner answer involving natural logarithms. Let's test this hypothesis.\n    *   $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$\n    *   $-\\frac{L_{res}}{\\lambda} = \\ln(1/3) = -\\ln(3)$\n    *   $L_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.0986$\n    *   $L_{res} \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n    This result, $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is extremely close to option C) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This strongly suggests that this was the intended method to solve the problem.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Relativistic Calculation:** It is essential to use relativistic formulas for energy, momentum, and time, as the particle's energy is much greater than its rest mass.\n*   **Mean Decay Length vs. Resolution:** The mean decay length ($\\lambda$) is the average distance. The resolution required to see a certain fraction of decays is related to $\\lambda$ via the exponential decay law, not equal to it.\n*   **Interpretation of \"At least 30%\":** This sets up an inequality, $P \\ge 0.30$. The \"minimum resolution\" corresponds to the boundary case, which gives the largest possible value for the resolution that still satisfies the condition.\n*   **Problem Heuristics:** In multiple-choice physics questions, if a direct calculation is slightly off from an option, consider if a common approximation (like 30% ≈ 1/3) was intended to make the numbers work out cleanly.\n\nBased on the analysis, the calculation assuming the 30% was an approximation for 1/3 yields a result that matches one of the options almost perfectly.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating the careful points needed to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Calculate Relativistic Parameters:** The particle's total energy (E = 27 GeV) is significantly larger than its rest mass energy (m₀c² = 3.41 GeV), indicating it is moving at a highly relativistic speed. The first step is to calculate the Lorentz factor (γ), which quantifies these relativistic effects.\n    *   **Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n        γ = E / m₀c² = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.918\n\n2.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ):** The proper lifetime (τ₀) is the particle's lifetime in its own rest frame. In the laboratory frame, this lifetime is dilated by the factor γ. The mean decay length (λ) is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It can be calculated efficiently using the particle's momentum.\n    *   **Momentum (pc):** From the relativistic energy-momentum relation E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²:\n        (pc)² = E² - (m₀c²)² = (27)² - (3.41)² = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 (GeV)²\n        pc = √717.3719 ≈ 26.78 GeV\n    *   **Mean Decay Length (λ):**\n        λ = (pc / m₀c²) * c * τ₀\n        λ = (26.78 / 3.41) * (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * (8 x 10⁻¹⁶ s)\n        λ ≈ 7.854 * (2.4 x 10⁻⁷ m) ≈ 1.885 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\n3.  **Apply the Exponential Decay Law:** The question asks for the resolution needed to observe \"at least 30% of the decays.\" For a decay to be \"observed,\" the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution (`L_res`). The probability that a particle travels a distance `d` or more before decaying follows an exponential law:\n    P(distance ≥ d) = e^(-d/λ)\n    We need to find the resolution `L_res` that satisfies the condition:\n    e^(-L_res / λ) ≥ 0.30\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Resolution:** To find the boundary condition, we solve the equality:\n    e^(-L_res / λ) = 0.30\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    -L_res / λ = ln(0.30)\n    L_res = -λ * ln(0.30)\n    Using ln(0.30) ≈ -1.204:\n    L_res ≈ -(1.885 x 10⁻⁶ m) * (-1.204) ≈ 2.27 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:** The calculated required resolution is approximately 2.27 x 10⁻⁶ m. This value represents the largest possible resolution (i.e., the least stringent detector) that can still observe at least 30% of the decays. We compare this to the given options:\n    A) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n    B) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n    C) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n    D) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n\n    The calculated value (2.27 x 10⁻⁶ m) is numerically closest to option D (2.08 x 10⁻⁶ m). The other options are incorrect by several orders of magnitude.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Interpretation of \"Energy\":** The given energy of 27 GeV is correctly interpreted as the total energy, as it is greater than the rest mass of 3.41 GeV.\n*   **Interpretation of \"Minimum Resolution\":** This term refers to the boundary condition for the detector's capability. A resolution of `L_res = 2.27 x 10⁻⁶ m` would allow observation of exactly 30% of decays. Any resolution value smaller than this (i.e., a \"better\" resolution) would allow for observing more than 30%. Since 2.08 x 10⁻⁶ m is less than 2.27 x 10⁻⁶ m, a detector with this resolution would indeed observe *at least* 30% of the decays.\n*   **Discrepancy in Values:** The calculated value (2.27 x 10⁻⁶ m) differs from the closest option (2.08 x 10⁻⁶ m) by about 9%. This is common in physics problems and is likely due to the input values being rounded. A very plausible explanation, as noted by several candidate answers, is that the problem intended for the fraction to be 1/3 instead of 30%. In that case, the calculation would be `L_res = λ * ln(3) ≈ 1.885 x 10⁻⁶ m * 1.0986 ≈ 2.07 x 10⁻⁶ m`, which is an almost perfect match for option D.

Understand the Goal and Physical Principles\nThe goal is to find the minimum spatial resolution a detector needs to observe the decay track of at least 30% of the $X^0$ particles.\n\n*   **Relativity:** The particle is moving at relativistic speeds, so we must use formulas for relativistic energy, momentum, and time dilation.\n*   **Particle Decay:** The decay of particles is a random process governed by an exponential decay law. The probability that a particle travels a distance `x` or more before decaying is $P(d \\ge x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n*   **Observation Condition:** To \"observe\" a decay, the particle's track length must be greater than the detector's resolution. Let the resolution be $L_{res}$. The condition is that the fraction of particles with track lengths greater than $L_{res}$ must be at least 30%.\n    $P(d \\ge L_{res}) = e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\n### 2. Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the mean decay length, $\\lambda$, in the laboratory frame.\n\n*   **Given:**\n    *   Total Energy, $E = 27$ GeV\n    *   Rest Mass, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n    *   Proper Lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   Speed of Light, $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\n*   **Calculate Momentum ($pc$):**\n    We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ (GeV)}^2$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n*   **Calculate Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):**\n    The mean decay length is given by $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\times c \\tau_0$.\n    $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $\\lambda \\approx 7.854 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### 3. Calculate the Required Resolution ($L_{res}$)\n\nNow we apply the observation condition. We need to find the resolution $L_{res}$ that satisfies $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$.\n\n*   **Careful Point: Interpretation of \"30%\"**\n    In physics problems with multiple-choice answers, it is common for percentages like \"30%\" to be an approximation for a simple fraction that yields a clean answer. Let's test the hypothesis that 30% is an approximation for 1/3, as suggested by several candidate answers.\n\n*   **Calculation assuming P = 1/3:**\n    We solve for the boundary condition: $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-\\frac{L_{res}}{\\lambda} = \\ln(1/3) = -\\ln(3)$\n    $L_{res} = \\lambda \\times \\ln(3)$\n    Using our calculated $\\lambda \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m and $\\ln(3) \\approx 1.0986$:\n    $L_{res} \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.0986 \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### 4. Compare with Options and Conclude\n\nThe calculated resolution is $L_{res} \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Let's compare this with the given options:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n\nThe calculated value is extremely close to option D. The minor difference (less than 0.5%) is due to rounding of the input values in the problem statement. This confirms that the most plausible intended solution involves assuming the 30% is an approximation for 1/3.\n\n*   **Alternative Check (using exactly 30%):**\n    If we use 0.30 directly, $L_{res} = \\lambda \\times \\ln(1/0.3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times 1.204 \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This value is not as close to any of the options as the result from the 1/3 approximation.\n\nTherefore, the most logical and consistent solution leads to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem requires us to determine the minimum spatial resolution a detector needs to observe the decay track of at least 30% of the $X^0$ particles. This involves combining principles of special relativity with the statistics of exponential decay.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics of Observation:**\n    To \"observe\" a decay, the particle must travel a distance ($d$) that is greater than the detector's resolution ($L_{res}$). If the particle decays before traveling this distance, its creation and decay points are indistinguishable. The decay of particles is a random process governed by an exponential probability law.

Understand the Goal and Physical Principles\nThe objective is to find the minimum spatial resolution a detector needs to observe the decay track of at least 30% of the $X^0$ particles. This involves two main physical concepts:\n*   **Special Relativity:** The particle is moving at high speed, so its lifetime as observed in the laboratory is longer than its lifetime at rest (time dilation). Its decay length is calculated using relativistic kinematics.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** Particle decay is a random process. The probability that a particle will travel a certain distance before decaying follows an exponential distribution.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step A: Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\nThe Lorentz factor relates the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$).\n*   Given: $E = 27$ GeV, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n*   Formula: $E = \\gamma m_0c^2$\n*   Calculation: $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n**Step B: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It can be calculated directly using the particle's momentum.\n*   First, find the momentum ($pc$) using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    *   $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ (GeV)}^2$\n    *   $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78$ GeV\n*   Next, calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$) using the formula $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c \\tau_0$.\n    *   Given: $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s, $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n    *   $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78}{3.41} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step C: Apply the Decay Condition**\nTo \"observe\" a decay, the particle must travel a distance ($d$) greater than the detector's resolution ($L_{res}$). The problem states we must observe at least 30% of decays.\n*   The probability of a particle traveling a distance $d \\ge L_{res}$ is given by $P(d \\ge L_{res}) = e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda}$.\n*   The condition is: $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$.\n\n**Step D: Solve for the Resolution ($L_{res}$)**\nTo find the required resolution, we solve for the boundary condition. There are two interpretations for \"30%\":\n\n*   **Interpretation 1: Use the exact value of 0.30.**\n    *   $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    *   $L_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\n    This value is reasonably close to option B ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m), but the ~9% difference is notable.\n\n*   **Interpretation 2: Assume \"30%\" is a common approximation for 1/3.**\n    In physics problems with multiple-choice answers, values are often chosen to give a clean result. Let's test the hypothesis that we need to observe at least 1/3 of the decays.\n    *   $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$\n    *   $L_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(1/3) = \\lambda \\ln(3)$\n    *   $L_{res} = (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.0986 \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\n\n### 3. Conclusion and Careful Points\n\n*   The result from Interpretation 2 ($2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is an almost perfect match for the value in option B ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). This strongly suggests that this was the intended method for solving the problem.\n*   **Careful Point 1 (Interpretation):** The most critical step is correctly interpreting the condition \"observe at least 30% of the decays\". This means the particle's track length must be greater than the resolution, and the 30% value is likely a proxy for 1/3 to yield a clean answer.\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Mean Length vs. Resolution):** A common mistake is to assume the answer is simply the mean decay length ($\\lambda \\approx 1.89 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). While this value is close, it doesn't account for the probability condition. A resolution equal to the mean decay length would observe $e^{-1} \\approx 37\\%$ of decays.\n*   **Careful Point 3 (Relativistic Formulas):** Using the correct relativistic formulas for energy, momentum, and time is essential. Classical formulas would give a completely wrong answer.\n\nBased on the analysis, the calculation that assumes the condition is to observe at least 1/3 of the decays provides the best fit to the given options.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, along with a list of crucial points to consider.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**: The Lorentz factor relates the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$). It is a measure of the relativistic effects.\n    *   Total Energy, E = 27 GeV\n    *   Rest Mass, $m_0$ = 3.41 GeV/c² (Rest Energy $m_0c^2$ = 3.41 GeV)\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n2.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**: This is the average distance the particle travels in the laboratory frame before it decays. It is calculated using the particle's momentum and proper lifetime.\n    *   First, find the momentum ($p$) using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    *   $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ (GeV)}^2$\n    *   $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n    *   The mean decay length $\\lambda$ is given by $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\times c \\times \\tau_0$.\n    *   Given proper lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s and speed of light $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s.\n    *   $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78}{3.41} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n3.  **Apply the Exponential Decay Law**: The question asks for the minimum resolution ($L_{res}$) to observe *at least 30%* of the decays. A decay is \"observed\" if the particle travels a distance greater than the resolution. The probability of a particle traveling a distance $x$ or more is $P(x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$.\n    *   The condition is: $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n    *   To find the required resolution, we solve for the boundary case: $L_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$.\n    *   $L_{res} = -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n4.  **Compare with Options and Refine Interpretation**: The calculated value is $L_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This is numerically closest to option C, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The discrepancy of about 9% is common in physics problems where input values are rounded. A frequent practice is to use round fractions like 1/3 instead of decimals like 0.3. Let's test this hypothesis, as several candidate answers suggest.\n    *   Assume \"at least 30%\" is a proxy for \"at least 1/3\".\n    *   The condition becomes $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 1/3$.\n    *   Solving for the boundary: $L_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(1/3) = \\lambda \\ln(3)$.\n    *   $L_{res} = (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.0986 \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion**: The value calculated using the 1/3 assumption, $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is an almost perfect match for option C, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This strongly indicates it was the intended solution path.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Relativistic Effects**: The particle's high energy ($\\gamma \\approx 7.9$) makes it crucial to use formulas from special relativity (time dilation, relativistic momentum) and not classical mechanics.\n*   **Decay in Lab Frame**: All calculations for distance must be done in the laboratory frame, which requires using the time-dilated lifetime or the lab-frame momentum to calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$).\n*   **Exponential Decay Law**: The core of the problem lies in correctly applying the formula for exponential decay probability, $P(x \\ge L_{res}) = e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda}$.\n*   **Interpretation of \"Minimum Resolution\"**: This phrase refers to the least stringent requirement for the detector, which corresponds to the largest numerical value of resolution ($L_{res}$) that still meets the 30% observation criterion. Any resolution better (smaller) than this value would observe an even higher percentage of decays.\n*   **Problem-Solving Strategy**: In multiple-choice physics questions, if a direct calculation leads to a result close but not identical to an option, it is wise to check for common approximations (like 30% ≈ 1/3) that might have been used to make the numbers align perfectly.\n\nBased on the analysis, the calculation that assumes \"30%\" is a proxy for \"1/3\" provides the most accurate match to the given options.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physical Principles\nThe problem involves a high-energy particle, which means we must use the principles of special relativity. The key concepts are:\n*   **Relativistic Energy:** The total energy (E) of a particle is related to its rest mass ($m_0$) and its Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) by the equation $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$.\n*   **Time Dilation:** A moving particle's internal clock runs slower as observed from a stationary frame (the lab). Its lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) by a factor of $\\gamma$: $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n*   **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before it decays. It is calculated as $\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of particles is a random process. The probability that a particle will travel a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by an exponential law: $P(d \\ge x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step A: Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\nThe Lorentz factor is the ratio of the particle's total energy to its rest energy.\n*   Total Energy, E = 27 GeV\n*   Rest Mass Energy, $m_0c^2$ = 3.41 GeV\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27}{3.41} \\approx 7.918$\n\n**Step B: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\nWe can calculate this using the particle's momentum, which is often more direct.\nFirst, find the momentum ($p$) using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n*   $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ (GeV)}^2$\n*   $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nNow, calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$) using the formula $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c \\cdot \\tau_0$.\n*   Proper lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   Speed of light, $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n*   $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78}{3.41} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step C: Calculate the Required Resolution**\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe *at least 30%* of the decays. This means we need to find the track length, $d$, such that the probability of a particle traveling at least that far is 30%.\n*   $P(x \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\nTo solve for $d$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n*   $-d/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$\n*   $d = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30) = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(1/0.30) \\approx \\lambda \\cdot 1.204$\n*   $d \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.204 \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### 3. Analysis of Options and Careful Points\n\n*   **Calculated Value vs. Options:** Our calculated value is $d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The provided options are:\n    A) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n    B) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n    C) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n    D) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n    The only option with the correct order of magnitude is A. The calculated value is reasonably close to option A.\n\n*   **A Common Physics Problem Trope:** In many physics problems, numbers are chosen to yield a clean result. It is highly likely that the \"30%\" was a rounded value for 1/3. Let's test this hypothesis, as several candidate answers did.\n    *   If we set the probability to 1/3: $e^{-d/\\lambda} = 1/3$\n    *   $d = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$\n    *   $d \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.0986 \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n*   **Conclusion:** This result, $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is an almost perfect match for option A, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This provides strong evidence that this was the intended solution path. The other options are incorrect by several orders of magnitude.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nAn analysis of the provided answers reveals a consistent computational approach, despite some variations in interpretation and final conclusions on the option letter. The core of the problem is to determine a specific distance, which corresponds to the detector's resolution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\n    This is the foundational step upon which all interpretations are built. The mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying.\n    *   **Given:** Total Energy $E = 27$ GeV, Rest Mass $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV, Proper Lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s.\n    *   **Relativistic Momentum ($pc$):** First, we find the particle's momentum using the energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n        $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{27^2 - 3.41^2} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78$ GeV.\n    *   **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** The formula for the mean decay length is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c \\tau_0$.\n        $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n    This value is consistently calculated across most of the provided answers.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Condition: \"Observe at least 30% of the decays\"**\n    This is the most critical part of the problem and where the candidate answers show slight variations.\n    *   **Physical Meaning:** For a decay to be \"observed,\" the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution ($L_{res}$). If it decays before traveling this distance, the production and decay points are indistinguishable.\n    *   **Exponential Decay Law:** The probability that a particle travels a distance $d$ or more before decaying is given by $P(d \\ge L_{res}) = e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda}$.\n    *   **The Condition:** We need to find the resolution $L_{res}$ such that at least 30% of particles are observed, meaning $P(d \\ge L_{res}) \\ge 0.30$.\n\n3.  **Solve for the Resolution ($L_{res}$)**\n    To find the required resolution, we solve the boundary condition of the inequality:\n    $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-\\frac{L_{res}}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n    $L_{res} = \\lambda \\times 1.204 \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.204 \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n    This calculated value is close to the option $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, but the match is not perfect.\n\n### Careful Points and Refinements\n\n*   **Ambiguity of \"Minimum Resolution\":** The term can be confusing. It refers to the *least stringent* (i.e., largest numerical value) of the resolution that still satisfies the condition. Any resolution smaller (more stringent) than this value would observe an even greater fraction of decays.\n*   **The \"30%\" Approximation:** As identified in several candidate answers (e.g., Answer 2, Answer 6), it is a common practice in physics problems for a number like 30% to be a rounded value for a simpler fraction, such as 1/3. Let's test this hypothesis, as it often leads to a value that perfectly matches one of the options.\n    *   **Recalculating with 1/3:**\n        $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$\n        $-\\frac{L_{res}}{\\lambda} = \\ln(1/3) = -\\ln(3)$\n        $L_{res} = \\lambda \\times \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.0986 \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe value calculated using the 1/3 approximation, $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is extremely close to the value presented in option D, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The other options are incorrect by several orders of magnitude. This provides strong evidence that this was the intended solution path.\n\n*   **Calculated Value:** $\\approx 2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n*   **Option D:** $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n*   **Other Options:** $10^{-9}$ m, $10^{-3}$ m, $10^{-1}$ m (all incorrect).\n\nThe overwhelming consensus among the detailed analyses points to the value $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, which corresponds to option D in the problem statement.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem to determine the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the minimum resolution required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the particle decays. In a detector like a bubble chamber, a decay is considered \"observed\" if the particle travels a distance greater than the detector's spatial resolution before it decays. This creates a visible track separate from the particle's creation point.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Physics:** The decay of unstable particles is a random process governed by an exponential decay law. The probability that a particle will travel a distance `d` or more before decaying is given by:\n    $P(d \\ge L_{res}) = e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda}$\n    where $L_{res}$ is the detector resolution and $\\lambda$ is the particle's mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\n    The condition is to observe *at least* 30% of the decays, so:\n    $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):**\n    To find $\\lambda$, we first need the particle's properties in the lab frame.\n    *   **Given:**\n        *   Total Energy, $E = 27$ GeV\n        *   Rest Mass, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n        *   Proper Lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n        *   Speed of Light, $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\n    *   **Calculate Momentum ($pc$):** We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n        $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ (GeV)}^2$\n        $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n    *   **Calculate Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** The average distance a relativistic particle travels is given by $\\lambda = \\frac{p}{m_0} c \\tau_0$, which can be written as:\n        $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\times c \\times \\tau_0$\n        $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n        $\\lambda \\approx 7.854 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Resolution ($L_{res}$):**\n    Now we solve the inequality from Step 2. To find the boundary condition (the largest resolution that still works), we use an equality:\n    $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-\\frac{L_{res}}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n    $L_{res} = 1.204 \\times \\lambda = 1.204 \\times (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Refine:**\n    The calculated value is $L_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The options are:\n    A) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n    B) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n    C) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n    D) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n\n    Our calculated value is closest to option C. The other options are incorrect by several orders of magnitude. The small discrepancy between our calculation ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) and the option ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is likely intentional. In physics problems, round numbers like \"30%\" are often approximations for values that yield cleaner results. Let's test the hypothesis that \"at least 30%\" was meant to be satisfied by observing a fraction of $1/3$ (which is ~33.3%).\n\n    *   **Refined Calculation:**\n        $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$\n        $-\\frac{L_{res}}{\\lambda} = \\ln(1/3) = -\\ln(3) \\approx -1.0986$\n        $L_{res} = \\ln(3) \\times \\lambda = 1.0986 \\times (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n    This refined calculation gives a result of $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, which is an almost perfect match for option C, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Interpretation of \"Observe\":** The key is understanding that \"observing\" a decay requires the particle's track length to be greater than the detector's resolution.\n*   **Relativistic Calculations:** The particle is highly relativistic ($\\gamma \\approx 7.9$), so using the correct formulas for energy, momentum, and time dilation is essential.\n*   **Total vs. Kinetic Energy:** The problem states \"energy... is 27GeV\". In this context, it is standard to assume this is the total energy. Assuming it is kinetic energy leads to a different but still similar result, but is a less likely interpretation.\n*   **Problem Design:** The specific value in the correct option ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) strongly suggests that the problem was designed with the assumption that the fraction of decays to be observed is $1/3$, which is \"at least 30%\".\n\nThe overwhelming evidence from the calculations points to option C as the only physically plausible answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the most accurate methodologies from the provided answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Calculate the Relativistic Properties of the Particle**\n    The first step is to determine the particle's properties in the laboratory frame using the principles of special relativity.\n\n    *   **Given:**\n        *   Total energy, E = 27 GeV\n        *   Rest mass energy, m₀c² = 3.41 GeV\n        *   Proper lifetime, τ₀ = 8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s\n        *   Speed of light, c ≈ 3 × 10⁸ m/s\n\n    *   **Lorentz Factor (γ):** The Lorentz factor relates the total energy to the rest energy.\n        γ = E / (m₀c²) = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.918\n\n    *   **Momentum (p):** The particle's momentum can be found using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)².\n        (pc)² = E² - (m₀c²)² = (27)² - (3.41)² = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 (GeV)²\n        pc = √717.3719 ≈ 26.78 GeV\n\n2.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ)**\n    The mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before it decays. It can be calculated directly using the momentum.\n\n    *   **Formula:** λ = (pc / m₀c²) * c * τ₀\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        λ = (26.78 GeV / 3.41 GeV) * (3 × 10⁸ m/s) * (8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s)\n        λ ≈ 7.854 * (2.4 × 10⁻⁷ m)\n        λ ≈ 1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n3.  **Interpret the Condition and Apply the Exponential Decay Law**\n    The core of the question is to find the \"minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays.\"\n\n    *   **Physical Meaning:** A decay is \"observed\" if the particle leaves a track longer than the detector's resolution limit ($L_{res}$). If it decays before traveling this distance, the production and decay points are indistinguishable.\n    *   **Exponential Decay Law:** The probability that a particle will travel a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by the survival function: P(distance ≥ x) = e^(-x/λ).\n    *   **Applying the Condition:** We need to find the resolution $L_{res}$ such that the fraction of observed decays is at least 30%:\n        P(distance ≥ $L_{res}$) ≥ 0.30  or  e^(-$L_{res}$/λ) ≥ 0.30\n\n4.  **Solve for the Resolution (L_res)**\n    To find the required resolution, we solve for the boundary condition. It is common in such physics problems for a percentage like \"30%\" to be an approximation for a simpler fraction like 1/3, which often yields a result that neatly matches a given option. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\n    *   **Assumption:** Assume \"at least 30%\" means \"at least 1/3\".\n    *   **Equation:** e^(-$L_{res}$/λ) = 1/3\n    *   **Solving for $L_{res}$:**\n        -($L_{res}$/λ) = ln(1/3) = -ln(3)\n        $L_{res}$ = λ * ln(3)\n    *   **Final Calculation:**\n        $L_{res}$ ≈ (1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) * 1.0986\n        $L_{res}$ ≈ 2.071 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n5.  **Compare with Options**\n    The calculated resolution is approximately 2.071 × 10⁻⁶ m. Now we compare this to the given options:\n    *   A) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n    *   B) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n    *   C) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n    *   D) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n\n    The calculated value is extremely close to option C (2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m). The minor difference is negligible and likely due to rounding in the problem's given constants.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Energy Interpretation:** In relativistic physics, \"energy\" usually refers to the total energy (rest + kinetic) unless specified otherwise. Assuming the 27 GeV is total energy leads to a consistent answer.\n*   **Relativistic Formulas:** The particle is highly relativistic (γ ≈ 7.9), so using classical formulas for momentum or energy would give a completely wrong result.\n*   **Mean Decay Length vs. Resolution:** The mean decay length (λ) is the average distance traveled, not the final answer. The final answer depends on the probability distribution of decay distances.\n*   **Interpreting \"Observe at least 30%\":** This phrase is key. It requires using the exponential decay law P(x) = e^(-x/λ) to find the distance `x` for which the survival probability is 30%.\n*   **Approximation of 30%:** The fact that using 1/3 instead of 0.3 yields a result that perfectly matches an option is a strong clue that this was the intended method. Calculating with 0.3 gives $L_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, which is still closest to option C but not as precise a match.\n*   **\"Minimum Resolution\":** This term can be ambiguous. In this context, it refers to the largest (least stringent) resolution value that still allows for observing at least 30% of decays. Any resolution smaller (more stringent) than this value would observe an even greater fraction of decays.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
