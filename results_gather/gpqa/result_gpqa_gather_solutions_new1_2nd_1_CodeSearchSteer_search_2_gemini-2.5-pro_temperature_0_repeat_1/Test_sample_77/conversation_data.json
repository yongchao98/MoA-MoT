Let $\\vec{r}$ be the field point, where the field is observed, with respect to the origin of the same reference frame, and  $\\vec{d}$ be the vector from the point where the electromagnetic field was generated at some earlier time $tr$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$. The velocity of the moving charge q at the field generating instant $tr$ is $\\vec{v}$. What are the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (\\vec{A}) at time t, satisfying $t > tr$, and position $\\vec{r}$?

The potential from a moving charge must depend on its position when the field was emitted (the retarded position), not a static distance `r`. This correctly eliminated options A and B.\n    *   **Constraint 2 (Doppler Factor):** The script then checked the sign in the denominator of the remaining candidates. The correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials for retarded fields have a denominator of the form `(dc - d.v)`. The negative sign is physically necessary to account for the Doppler-like effect. This constraint eliminated option C, which had an incorrect positive sign.\n\n3.  **Final Selection:** Option D was the only candidate to survive all constraints. It represents the standard, correct form for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The script also performed a successful consistency check, verifying that the relationship $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ holds for the expressions in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principle:** The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a point charge moving in an arbitrary trajectory. This is a classic problem in electrodynamics, and the solution is given by the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**. These potentials are the relativistically correct solutions to Maxwell's equations for a moving point charge.\n\n2.  **Understand the Concept of Retarded Time:** A crucial concept is \"retarded time\" ($t_r$). Because electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`, the potentials at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` are determined by the state of the charge (its position and velocity) at an earlier time, $t_r$. This earlier time is such that the time elapsed, $t - t_r$, is exactly the time it took for the field to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$. Using the notation from the problem, this is expressed as $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n3.  **State the Standard Formulas:** The standard formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{R - \\frac{\\vec{R} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{R - \\frac{\\vec{R} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n\n    The subscript \"ret\" means all quantities inside the brackets ($\\vec{R}$, $R$, and $\\vec{v}$) must be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n4.  **Translate to the Problem's Notation:** We must carefully map the standard notation to the notation given in the question.\n    *   The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point, commonly denoted $\\vec{R}$, is called $\\vec{d}$ in the problem.\n    *   The magnitude of this vector, $R$, is therefore $d$.\n    *   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v}$.\n\n    Substituting this notation into the standard formulas gives:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n5.  **Manipulate to Match the Options:** The given options have a denominator that is a single term without fractions. We can achieve this form by multiplying the numerator and denominator of our expressions by `c`:\n    *   For the scalar potential V:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q \\cdot c}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   For the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v} \\cdot c}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**: Incorrect. This uses the static Coulomb potential, which is only valid for a stationary charge, and the expression for $\\vec{A}$ is incorrect.\n    *   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**: Correct. These expressions perfectly match our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n    *   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**: Incorrect. This also uses the static potential, failing to account for the motion-dependent term in the denominator.\n    *   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**: Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is positive. The correct sign is negative. This sign is physically significant; it represents a Doppler-like effect where the potential is strengthened when the charge moves toward the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$) and weakened when it moves away.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. A step-by-step derivation and comparison with the given options confirms that option B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nAn analysis of the provided answers and a step-by-step derivation confirms the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics**: The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. This is a fundamental problem in classical electrodynamics, the solution to which is given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials correctly account for the finite speed of light, meaning the field at a point in space and time is determined by the charge's state at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time.\n\n2.  **Define Retarded Quantities**: The potential at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ is caused by the charge at its position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ at the retarded time $t_r$. The retarded time is defined by the condition that the time elapsed, $t - t_r$, is equal to the time it takes for light to travel the distance $d$ from the charge's past position to the observer.\n    *   Retarded time condition: $t - t_r = d/c$\n    *   Vector from retarded position to observer: $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$\n    *   Distance from retarded position to observer: $d = |\\vec{d}|$\n    *   Velocity of the charge at retarded time: $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$\n\n3.  **The Liénard-Wiechert Formulas**: The standard derivation from Maxwell's equations yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. In their common form, they are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    The term in the denominator, $(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})$, is a crucial relativistic correction. It accounts for the Doppler effect on the potential; when the charge moves towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$ is positive), the denominator decreases, and the potential's magnitude increases.\n\n4.  **Matching to the Options**: To compare the standard formulas with the given options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Candidates**:\n    *   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**: This is incorrect. The plus sign in the denominator is physically wrong, as it would imply the potential weakens as the charge approaches the observer.\n    *   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**: This option perfectly matches the correctly derived expressions for both the scalar and vector potentials.\n    *   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**: This is incorrect. The scalar potential $V$ is given as the simple static Coulomb potential, which does not account for the motion of the charge or retardation effects in its structure. It uses the distance $r$ from the origin, not the correct distance $d$ from the retarded position.\n    *   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**: This is incorrect for the same reason as C, and the expression for the vector potential is also dimensionally and structurally wrong.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. After careful derivation and comparison with the provided options, only option B accurately represents these potentials in the given notation.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nAn analysis of the provided answers reveals a strong consensus on the underlying physics, despite significant confusion in labeling the final options. Here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Problem**: The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge. These are known in physics as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. They are a direct consequence of Maxwell's equations when applied to a point charge, accounting for the finite speed of light (the principle of retardation).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Form of the Potentials**:\n    *   The potentials at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$ depend on the charge's state (position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ and velocity $\\vec{v}$) at an earlier, *retarded time* $t_r$.\n    *   The distance the field information travels is $d = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n    *   Therefore, any correct expression must depend on `d`, not `r` (the distance from the origin to the observation point). This immediately invalidates options A and B, which use the static form $V \\propto 1/r$. This is a critical point missed by some agents but correctly identified by others (e.g., Answer 13).\n\n3.  **Distinguish Between Options C and D**: Both options C and D have the correct general structure, depending on `d` and `v`. They differ only by the sign in the denominator.\n    *   Option C: Denominator is $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$\n    *   Option D: Denominator is $(dc + \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$\n\n4.  **Determine the Correct Sign**: The term in the denominator, often written as $d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)$, accounts for the relativistic Doppler effect. A formal derivation from the retarded potential integrals (as outlined in answers 5, 7, and 8) confirms that the sign is negative.\n    *   **Physical Intuition**: When the charge moves towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$ is positive), the charge is \"catching up\" to the field it emits, effectively compressing the field in the forward direction. This leads to a stronger potential. For the potential to increase, the denominator $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ must decrease. This requires a negative sign. A positive sign (as in option D) would lead to the unphysical conclusion that the potential weakens as the charge approaches. Therefore, the negative sign is correct.\n\n5.  **Final Verification**: The correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    These expressions perfectly match **Option C**.\n\n### Conclusion on Candidate Answers\n\nA review of the 14 candidate answers shows that while almost all of them correctly derive or state the proper physical formulas, there is a widespread and systematic error in labeling the options. For example, Answers 2, 7, 12, and 14 all correctly derive the formulas found in Option C but incorrectly label them as \"Option B\". Similarly, others mislabel them as D or A.\n\nHowever, the core physical reasoning across the majority of the answers is sound and converges on a single set of equations. Answers 5 and 13 correctly perform the analysis and also correctly identify the final answer as C. The overwhelming consensus on the *physics* points directly to the expressions in C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. This is a fundamental problem in classical electrodynamics. The solution must account for the finite speed of light, which means the potentials at a given time and place depend on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier, \"retarded\" time. These potentials are known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**.\n\n2.  **Recall the Standard Formulas:** The standard textbook formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n\n3.  **Translate to the Problem's Notation:** We need to map the standard notation to the notation given in the question.\n    *   The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point, usually denoted $\\vec{R}$, is called $\\vec{d}$ in the problem.\n    *   The magnitude of this vector, $R$, is therefore $d$.\n    *   The unit vector in this direction, $\\vec{n} = \\vec{R}/R$, becomes $\\vec{d}/d$.\n    *   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v}$.\n    *   The normalized velocity, $\\vec{\\beta}$, is $\\vec{v}/c$.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Denominator:** Let's substitute the problem's notation into the crucial denominator term $R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})$:\n    $d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c}\\right) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n    This is a critical step. The negative sign is a key feature of retarded potentials.\n\n5.  **Rewrite the Potentials in Problem Notation:** Substituting the simplified denominator back into the potential formulas, we get:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n6.  **Match to the Format of the Options:** The answer choices have a denominator of the form $(dc \\pm \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. We can get this form by multiplying the numerator and denominator of our expressions by $c$:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n7.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) Incorrect. This uses the static Coulomb potential and a dimensionally incorrect formula for $\\vec{A}$.\n    *   B) Incorrect. This has a `+` sign in the denominator. A positive sign would correspond to \"advanced potentials\" (where the effect precedes the cause), which are typically discarded as unphysical. The retarded potential requires a negative sign.\n    *   **C) Correct.** These expressions for both $V$ and $\\vec{A}$ perfectly match the Liénard-Wiechert potentials we derived.\n    *   D) Incorrect. This also uses the static Coulomb potential, which is only valid for a stationary charge.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.

This is a fundamental problem in classical electrodynamics. The solution must account for the fact that electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`. This means the potential at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` is determined by the charge's position and velocity at an earlier, \"retarded\" time, $t_r$. The resulting potentials are known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**.\n\n### Step 2: Recall or Derive the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\nThe standard formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations. In a common notation, they are:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n\nThe subscript \"ret\" indicates that all quantities in the brackets must be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n### Step 3: Translate to the Notation of the Problem\nLet's map the standard notation to the notation given in the question:\n*   The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point, $\\vec{R}$ in standard notation, is given as $\\vec{d}$.\n*   The magnitude of this vector, $R$, is given as $d$.\n*   The unit vector in this direction, $\\vec{n} = \\vec{R}/R$, is therefore $\\vec{d}/d$.\n*   The charge's velocity at the retarded time is $\\vec{v}$.\n*   The normalized velocity, $\\vec{\\beta}$, is $\\vec{v}/c$.\n\nNow, let's substitute this into the denominator term $R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})$:\n$d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c}\\right) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\n### Step 4: Finalize the Expressions\nSubstituting this denominator back into the potential formulas gives:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nTo match the format of the given options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator of these expressions by `c`:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### Step 5: Compare with the Given Options\n\n*   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    This option **perfectly matches** our derived expressions.\n\n*   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    This is incorrect. The scalar potential is the static Coulomb potential, which depends on the distance `r` from the origin, not the retarded distance `d` from the charge.

The sign in the denominator is positive. The correct sign is negative. The term $-\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$ is a crucial part of the relativistic Doppler effect; for a charge moving toward the observer, this term increases the potential, which is physically correct. A `+` sign would give the opposite, unphysical result (for retarded potentials).\n\n*   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    This is incorrect for the same reason as option B (it uses the static potential).

This option has a `+` sign in the denominator. The correct sign is `-`. A positive sign would correspond to \"advanced potentials,\" which violate causality.\n    *   **B)** Incorrect. This option uses the static Coulomb potential ($V \\propto 1/r$), which does not account for the relativistic effects of the charge's motion captured by the velocity-dependent term in the denominator. It also incorrectly uses `r` (distance from the origin) instead of `d` (distance from the charge's retarded position).\n    *   **C)** **Correct.** This option perfectly matches the derived expressions for both the scalar and vector potentials. The term $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ is the correct relativistic factor.\n    *   **D)** Incorrect. This option also uses the incorrect static potential form. Furthermore, the expression for the vector potential is dimensionally and structurally wrong (it should be proportional to $\\vec{v}$, not $\\vec{v}^2$).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.

Instead, they are determined by the charge's position and velocity at an earlier \"retarded\" time, $t_r$. This is because the electromagnetic field propagates at a finite speed, $c$. The retarded time is defined by the condition that the time elapsed, $t - t_r$, is equal to the time it takes for light to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$. Using the problem's notation, this is $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials**: The standard formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations. In their common form, they are:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{R(1 - \\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{R(1 - \\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    where $\\vec{R}$ is the vector from the retarded position to the observation point, $\\hat{n} = \\vec{R}/R$ is the unit vector in that direction, and $\\vec{\\beta} = \\vec{v}/c$.\n\n3.  **Translate to the Problem's Notation**: We can translate the standard formula into the notation provided in the question:\n    *   The vector from the retarded position to the observation point, $\\vec{R}$, is given as $\\vec{d}$.\n    *   Its magnitude, $R$, is given as $d$.\n    *   The unit vector, $\\hat{n}$, is $\\vec{d}/d$.\n    *   The velocity, $\\vec{v}$, is the same.\n    *   The term in the denominator becomes: $R(1 - \\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta}) = d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c}\\right) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$.\n\n4.  **Rewrite the Potentials**: Substituting this denominator back into the formulas gives:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n5.  **Match with the Options**: The given options have a denominator of the form $(dc \\pm \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. We can get this form by multiplying the numerator and denominator of our derived expressions by $c$:\n    *   For the scalar potential V:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q \\cdot c}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   For the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v} \\cdot c}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n6.  **Final Comparison**:\n    *   **Option A**: Incorrect.

This exactly matches our derived expressions.\n    *   **Option C**: Incorrect. It has a `+` sign in the denominator. The negative sign is physically significant; it represents a Doppler-like effect where the potential is stronger if the charge is moving towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$), which makes the denominator smaller. A `+` sign would give the opposite, unphysical result for retarded potentials.\n    *   **Option D**: Incorrect.

This is a fundamental problem in electrodynamics that accounts for the finite speed of light, a concept known as retardation. The solutions are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n2.  **Recall the Standard Formulas:** The potentials at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$ are determined by the charge's properties at an earlier, \"retarded\" time $t_r$. The standard formulas, derived from Maxwell's equations, are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    The notation matches the problem statement: $\\vec{d}$ is the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observer, and $\\vec{v}$ is the charge's velocity at the retarded time.\n\n3.  **Simplify to Match Option Format:** To compare these formulas with the given options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator of the core fraction by $c$:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n4.  **Analyze the Options and Identify Careful Points:**\n    *   **Point 1: The Denominator and the Doppler Effect.** The term $(d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ is the most critical part. The negative sign is physically significant. It accounts for a Doppler-like effect: if the charge moves towards the observer, $\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$ is positive, making the denominator smaller and the potential stronger. Option C has a `+` sign, which is incorrect and would describe an unphysical \"advanced potential.\"\n    *   **Point 2: Static vs. Dynamic Potential.** Options B and D use the form $V = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}$. This is the static Coulomb potential. It is incorrect for two reasons: it doesn't include the velocity-dependent term in the denominator, and it uses $r$ (distance from the origin) instead of $d$ (distance from the charge's retarded position). The potential is generated by the charge, so the distance must be measured from the charge's location when the field was emitted.\n    *   **Point 3: Vector Potential Structure.** The vector potential $\\vec{A}$ must be a vector and is related to the charge's velocity $\\vec{v}$. The expression in Option B, $\\vec{A} \\propto \\vec{v}^2 V$, is structurally and dimensionally incorrect. The correct relationship, which holds for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, is $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$.

This is a standard problem in classical electrodynamics, and the solution is given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials correctly account for the fact that electromagnetic fields propagate at a finite speed, `c`, a phenomenon known as retardation.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Structure of the Options:**\n    *   **Options A and B:** Both suggest that the scalar potential is $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}$. This is the formula for the static Coulomb potential, which depends on `r`, the distance from the origin to the observation point. This is incorrect for a moving charge because the potential at time `t` must depend on the charge's position at an earlier, *retarded* time `tr`. The potential should depend on `d`, the distance from the charge's retarded position to the observation point. Therefore, options A and B are fundamentally incorrect.\n    *   **Options C and D:** Both options correctly express the potentials in terms of the retarded quantities `d` (distance from the retarded position) and `\\vec{v}` (velocity at the retarded time). The only difference between them is the sign in the denominator.\n\n3.  **Determine the Correct Sign in the Denominator:** The term in the denominator, $(dc \\pm \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$, accounts for the relativistic Doppler effect. We can determine the correct sign by considering a simple physical case:\n    *   The vector `\\vec{d}` points from the charge's retarded position towards the observer.\n    *   The term `\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}` represents the component of the charge's velocity directed towards the observer.\n    *   If the charge is moving towards the observer, `\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}` is positive. In this situation, the charge is \"chasing\" the field it emits, causing the wavefronts to bunch up. This should result in a *stronger* (larger) potential.\n    *   For the potential's magnitude to increase, the denominator must decrease.\n    *   Comparing the two possibilities:\n        *   In option C, the denominator is $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. When `\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}` is positive, the denominator gets smaller, correctly predicting a larger potential.\n        *   In option D, the denominator is $(dc + \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. When `\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}` is positive, the denominator gets larger, incorrectly predicting a smaller potential.\n    *   Therefore, the negative sign is the physically correct one, which eliminates option D.\n\n4.  **Final Confirmation of Option C:**\n    The remaining option is C:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    $\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\n    These are indeed the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, written in a slightly rearranged form. The standard textbook form is often written as:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    Multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c` yields the exact expression for V in option C.\n\n    Furthermore, the vector and scalar potentials for a moving point charge are related by $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$. Applying this to the scalar potential in option C and using the relation $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o \\epsilon_o)$ correctly yields the vector potential in option C.\n\n### Conclusion on Candidate Answers\nA review of the 14 candidate answers shows that while many correctly derive the physical formulas (like answers 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, etc.), most of them make a simple error in matching their correct derivation to the corresponding letter of the multiple-choice options.

Identify the Core Physics\nThe question asks for the scalar potential (V) and the vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. This is a standard problem in classical electrodynamics. The solution must account for the fact that electromagnetic fields propagate at a finite speed, `c`. This means the fields at an observation point `r` at time `t` are determined by the charge's position and velocity at an earlier, \"retarded\" time, `tr`. The resulting potentials are known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**.\n\n### 2. Recall or Derive the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\nThe standard formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations. In a common notation, they are:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n\nThe subscript \"ret\" indicates that all quantities in the brackets must be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n### 3. Translate to the Notation of the Problem\nWe must carefully map the standard notation to the notation given in the question:\n*   The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point, often denoted $\\vec{R}$, is given as $\\vec{d}$.\n*   The magnitude of this vector, $R$, is given as $d$.\n*   The unit vector in this direction, $\\vec{n} = \\vec{R}/R$, is therefore $\\vec{d}/d$.\n*   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v}$.\n*   The normalized velocity, $\\vec{\\beta}$, is $\\vec{v}/c$.\n\nNow, let's substitute this notation into the denominator term $R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})$:\n$d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c}\\right) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\n### 4. Formulate the Potentials in the Problem's Notation\nSubstituting the simplified denominator back into the potential equations, we get:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nTo match the format of the given options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator of these expressions by `c`:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### 5. Compare with the Given Options\nLet's compare our derived expressions with the choices:\n\n*   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    *   Incorrect. This uses the static Coulomb potential, which is only valid for a stationary charge. It does not account for the retardation effects in the denominator.\n\n*   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    *   Incorrect. This also uses the static potential and has a dimensionally incorrect formula for the vector potential.\n\n*   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    *   **Correct.** These expressions perfectly match our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The negative sign in the denominator is crucial; it represents a Doppler-like effect, increasing the potential when the charge moves towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$).\n\n*   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    *   Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is positive. This would correspond to \"advanced\" potentials (where the effect precedes the cause), which are generally discarded as unphysical in this context.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe analysis shows that the expressions in option C are the correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge, expressed in the given notation. Many of the provided candidate answers correctly derive these formulas but then incorrectly map them to the wrong letter choice, indicating a likely shuffling of the options during their process.

The field observed at a point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ was generated by the source at an earlier, \"retarded\" time $t_r$. The potentials must depend on the charge's properties (position and velocity) at this retarded time.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Options - The Distance Term:**\n    *   Options A and B express the scalar potential as $V \\propto 1/r$. Here, $r$ is the magnitude of the field point vector $\\vec{r}$, which is the distance from the origin. This represents a static or quasi-static potential.\n    *   The correct potential must depend on the distance from the charge *at the moment the field was emitted*. This distance is $d = |\\vec{d}|$, the distance from the charge's retarded position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n    *   Options C and D correctly use the distance `d` in their formulation.\n    *   Therefore, options A and B are incorrect because they do not properly account for retardation in the distance term.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Options - The Relativistic Correction:**\n    *   Options C and D include a denominator of the form $(dc \\pm \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. This term is a crucial relativistic correction that arises from a Doppler-like effect. It accounts for the fact that the volume of space over which the charge's influence is spread appears different to the observer due to the charge's motion.\n    *   The choice between the `+` and `-` sign is a critical point. Let's consider the physical meaning. The term $\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$ is positive if the charge is moving generally towards the observation point. In this case, the field should be stronger (the denominator should be smaller).\n    *   For the denominator to decrease when $\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$ is positive, the sign must be negative. The correct denominator is $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$.\n    *   This means Option C has the correct sign, while Option D is incorrect. The positive sign in Option D would correspond to an unphysical \"advanced potential\" where the effect precedes the cause.\n\n4.  **Final Verification:**\n    *   The standard formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n        where all quantities on the right are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   Multiplying the numerator and denominator of these standard forms by `c` gives:\n        $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   These expressions exactly match the formulas given in Option C.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, Option C is the only one that correctly represents the Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge with the given notation. It correctly uses the retarded distance `d` and includes the necessary relativistic correction factor $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ with the physically correct negative sign.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis task requires identifying the correct expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge from a set of options.

The time delay is the light-travel time from the charge's retarded position to the observer: $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:** The standard formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations. In a common notation, they are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    where $\\vec{R}$ is the vector from the retarded position to the observer, $R=|\\vec{R}|$, $\\vec{n} = \\vec{R}/R$, and $\\vec{\\beta} = \\vec{v}/c$.\n\n3.  **Translate to the Problem's Notation:** We must carefully map the standard notation to the one given in the question.\n    *   The vector from the retarded position to the observer, $\\vec{R}$, is called $\\vec{d}$.\n    *   The distance, $R$, is called $d$.\n    *   The unit vector, $\\vec{n}$, is $\\vec{d}/d$.\n    *   The velocity at the retarded time is $\\vec{v}$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\vec{\\beta}$ is $\\vec{v}/c$.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Denominator (Careful Point 1):** The crucial part of the expression is the denominator, which accounts for the relativistic Doppler effect. Let's substitute the problem's notation into the standard denominator term:\n    $R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta}) = d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c}\\right) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\n5.  **Rewrite the Potentials:** Now, substitute this simplified denominator back into the potential formulas:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n6.  **Match to the Options' Format:** The options have a denominator of the form $(dc \\pm \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. We can get this form by multiplying the numerator and denominator of our expressions by `c`:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n7.  **Compare with the Candidates (Careful Point 2):** Now we compare our derived expressions with the four options.\n    *   **A)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n        *   This is incorrect. The sign in the denominator is `+`, while the correct derivation yields a `-`. The negative sign is physically significant; it increases the potential when the charge moves toward the observer.\n    *   **B)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n        *   This is incorrect. The scalar potential is the static Coulomb potential, which depends on the distance `r` from the origin and does not account for retardation or the velocity-dependent denominator.\n    *   **C)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n        *   This is incorrect for the same reason as B. The scalar potential is the static form.\n    *   **D)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n        *   This **perfectly matches** our derived expressions for both the scalar and vector Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis shows that many of the candidate answers correctly derived the physics but failed in the final step of matching their result to the correct option letter. The correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which, in the given notation, are precisely those in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires identifying the correct expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge, known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The analysis involves comparing the standard formulas with the given options, paying close attention to the notation.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principle**: The question concerns the electromagnetic potentials generated by a moving point charge. Because the electromagnetic field propagates at a finite speed, `c`, the potentials at an observation point `r` at time `t` are determined by the charge's state (position and velocity) at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time `tr`. The correct description is given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n2.  **Recall the Standard Formulas**: The Liénard-Wiechert potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations. In a common form, they are:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{R - \\vec{R} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{R - \\vec{R} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    The subscript \"ret\" indicates that all quantities inside the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\n3.  **Translate to the Problem's Notation**:\n    *   The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point, $\\vec{R}$, is given as $\\vec{d}$.\n    *   The magnitude of this vector, $R$, is given as $d$.\n    *   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v}$.\n\n    Substituting this notation into the standard formulas gives:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n\n4.  **Manipulate to Match the Options**: The given options have a denominator of the form $(dc \\pm \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. We can achieve this form by multiplying the numerator and denominator of our expressions by `c`:\n    *   For the scalar potential V:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q \\cdot c}{c(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   For the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v} \\cdot c}{c(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options**:\n    *   A) Incorrect. Uses the static potential form ($V \\propto 1/r$) which ignores retardation effects on the potential's magnitude.\n    *   B) Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is positive. The correct sign is negative.\n    *   C) Incorrect. Uses the static potential form.\n    *   D) **Correct**. The expressions for both V and $\\vec{A}$ perfectly match the derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Retardation is Key**: The potentials depend on the distance `d` from the charge's position *at the retarded time*, not the distance `r` from the origin. Options A and C are incorrect for this reason alone.\n*   **The Sign in the Denominator**: The term $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ in the denominator accounts for a relativistic Doppler-like effect. The negative sign is crucial. If the charge is moving towards the observer, $\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$ is positive, the denominator gets smaller, and the potential's magnitude increases, which is the correct physical behavior. Option B has the wrong sign, which would correspond to unphysical \"advanced\" potentials.\n*   **Consistency Check**: The Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a point charge are related by $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$. Let's check this for option D.\n    $\\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left( \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$.\n    Using the relation $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o \\epsilon_o)$, we can substitute $\\mu_o = 1/(\\epsilon_o c^2)$. This gives $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_o c} = \\mu_o c$.\n    Substituting this into our expression yields $\\frac{\\mu_o c q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$, which is exactly the formula for $\\vec{A}$ in option D. The relationship holds.\n*   **Analysis of Agent Responses**: A review of the provided agent answers shows that while several conclude with the wrong letter (A, B, or C), their underlying physical derivations almost unanimously arrive at the expressions found in option D. The discrepancies are likely due to a shuffling of the option labels during their processing. The consensus of the *physical reasoning* strongly supports option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principle**: The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. This is a fundamental problem in classical electrodynamics, and the solution is given by the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**. These potentials account for the finite speed of light, meaning the field at a point in space and time is determined by the charge's position and velocity at an earlier, \"retarded\" time ($t_r$).\n\n2.  **Recall the Standard Formulas**: The standard expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, derived from Maxwell's equations, are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n\n    The subscript \"ret\" indicates that all variables inside the brackets ($\\vec{d}$, $d$, and $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$. The notation matches the one given in the problem.\n\n3.  **Manipulate to Match Option Format**: The given options have a denominator of the form $(dc \\pm \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. We can transform our standard formulas to this format by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n    *   For the scalar potential V:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q \\cdot c}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    *   For the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v} \\cdot c}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n4.  **Compare with the Given Options**: Now we can carefully evaluate each option against these correctly derived expressions.\n\n    *   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n        This is incorrect. The sign in the denominator is positive (`+`). The correct sign is negative (`-`). The negative sign is physically significant; it causes the potential to increase when the charge moves toward the observer (a Doppler-like effect). A positive sign corresponds to an unphysical \"advanced\" potential.\n\n    *   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n        This is incorrect. The expression for the scalar potential, $V$, is the static Coulomb potential.

    "This problem requires identifying the correct expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge.

Instead, they depend on the charge's state (position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ and velocity $\\vec{v}$) at an earlier, \"retarded\" time $t_r$. The time difference $t - t_r$ is the time it takes for light to travel the distance $d$ from the charge's retarded position to the observer, i.e., $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Standard Liénard-Wiechert Formulas**: The standard derivation from Maxwell's equations yields the potentials. In a common textbook form, they are:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    where $\\vec{R}$ is the vector from the retarded position to the observer, $\\vec{n}$ is the unit vector $\\vec{R}/R$, and $\\vec{\\beta}$ is the normalized velocity $\\vec{v}/c$.\n\n3.  **Translate to the Problem's Notation**: We map the standard notation to the one provided in the question:\n    *   The vector $\\vec{R}$ is given as $\\vec{d}$.\n    *   Its magnitude $R$ is given as $d$.\n    *   The unit vector $\\vec{n}$ is $\\vec{d}/d$.\n    *   The velocity $\\vec{v}$ and normalized velocity $\\vec{\\beta} = \\vec{v}/c$ are the same.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Denominator**: The crucial term is the denominator, which accounts for the relativistic Doppler effect.

This immediately rules out options A and B.\n*   **The Sign in the Denominator**: The negative sign in the term $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ is physically correct. It represents a Doppler-like effect where the potential is strengthened when the charge moves towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$), causing the denominator to decrease.

This is a classic problem in electrodynamics, and the solution is given by the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**. These potentials are the relativistically correct solutions to Maxwell's equations for a moving point charge.\n\n2.  **Understand the Concept of Retarded Time:** A crucial concept is \"retarded time\" ($t_r$). Because electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`, the potentials at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` are determined by the state of the charge (its position and velocity) at an earlier time, $t_r$. This earlier time is such that the time elapsed, $t - t_r$, is exactly the time it took for the field to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.

This is a fundamental problem in classical electrodynamics, the solution to which is given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials correctly account for the finite speed of light, meaning the field at a point in space and time is determined by the charge's state at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time.\n\n2.  **Define Retarded Quantities**: The potential at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ is caused by the charge at its position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ at the retarded time $t_r$. The retarded time is defined by the condition that the time elapsed, $t - t_r$, is equal to the time it takes for light to travel the distance $d$ from the charge's past position to the observer.\n    *   Retarded time condition: $t - t_r = d/c$\n    *   Vector from retarded position to observer: $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$\n    *   Distance from retarded position to observer: $d = |\\vec{d}|$\n    *   Velocity of the charge at retarded time: $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$\n\n3.  **The Liénard-Wiechert Formulas**: The standard derivation from Maxwell's equations yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. In their common form, they are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    The term in the denominator, $(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})$, is a crucial relativistic correction. It accounts for the Doppler effect on the potential; when the charge moves towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$ is positive), the denominator decreases, and the potential's magnitude increases.\n\n4.  **Matching to the Options**: To compare the standard formulas with the given options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Candidates**:\n    *   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**: This is incorrect. The plus sign in the denominator is physically wrong, as it would imply the potential weakens as the charge approaches the observer.\n    *   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**: This option perfectly matches the correctly derived expressions for both the scalar and vector potentials.\n    *   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**: This is incorrect. The scalar potential $V$ is given as the simple static Coulomb potential, which does not account for the motion of the charge or retardation effects in its structure. It uses the distance $r$ from the origin, not the correct distance $d$ from the retarded position.\n    *   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**: This is incorrect for the same reason as C, and the expression for the vector potential is also dimensionally and structurally wrong.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. After careful derivation and comparison with the provided options, only option B accurately represents these potentials in the given notation.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nAn analysis of the provided answers reveals a strong consensus on the underlying physics, despite significant confusion in labeling the final options. Here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Problem**: The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge. These are known in physics as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. They are a direct consequence of Maxwell's equations when applied to a point charge, accounting for the finite speed of light (the principle of retardation).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Form of the Potentials**:\n    *   The potentials at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$ depend on the charge's state (position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ and velocity $\\vec{v}$) at an earlier, *retarded time* $t_r$.\n    *   The distance the field information travels is $d = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n    *   Therefore, any correct expression must depend on `d`, not `r` (the distance from the origin to the observation point). This immediately invalidates options A and B, which use the static form $V \\propto 1/r$. This is a critical point missed by some agents but correctly identified by others (e.g., Answer 13).\n\n3.  **Distinguish Between Options C and D**: Both options C and D have the correct general structure, depending on `d` and `v`. They differ only by the sign in the denominator.\n    *   Option C: Denominator is $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$\n    *   Option D: Denominator is $(dc + \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$\n\n4.  **Determine the Correct Sign**: The term in the denominator, often written as $d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)$, accounts for the relativistic Doppler effect. A formal derivation from the retarded potential integrals (as outlined in answers 5, 7, and 8) confirms that the sign is negative.\n    *   **Physical Intuition**: When the charge moves towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$ is positive), the charge is \"catching up\" to the field it emits, effectively compressing the field in the forward direction. This leads to a stronger potential. For the potential to increase, the denominator $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ must decrease. This requires a negative sign. A positive sign (as in option D) would lead to the unphysical conclusion that the potential weakens as the charge approaches. Therefore, the negative sign is correct.\n\n5.  **Final Verification**: The correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    These expressions perfectly match **Option C**.\n\n### Conclusion on Candidate Answers\n\nA review of the 14 candidate answers shows that while almost all of them correctly derive or state the proper physical formulas, there is a widespread and systematic error in labeling the options. For example, Answers 2, 7, 12, and 14 all correctly derive the formulas found in Option C but incorrectly label them as \"Option B\". Similarly, others mislabel them as D or A.\n\nHowever, the core physical reasoning across the majority of the answers is sound and converges on a single set of equations. Answers 5 and 13 correctly perform the analysis and also correctly identify the final answer as C. The overwhelming consensus on the *physics* points directly to the expressions in C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. This is a fundamental problem in classical electrodynamics. The solution must account for the finite speed of light, which means the potentials at a given time and place depend on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier, \"retarded\" time. These potentials are known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**.\n\n2.  **Recall the Standard Formulas:** The standard textbook formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n\n3.  **Translate to the Problem's Notation:** We need to map the standard notation to the notation given in the question.\n    *   The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point, usually denoted $\\vec{R}$, is called $\\vec{d}$ in the problem.\n    *   The magnitude of this vector, $R$, is therefore $d$.\n    *   The unit vector in this direction, $\\vec{n} = \\vec{R}/R$, becomes $\\vec{d}/d$.\n    *   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v}$.\n    *   The normalized velocity, $\\vec{\\beta}$, is $\\vec{v}/c$.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Denominator:** Let's substitute the problem's notation into the crucial denominator term $R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})$:\n    $d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c}\\right) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n    This is a critical step. The negative sign is a key feature of retarded potentials.\n\n5.  **Rewrite the Potentials in Problem Notation:** Substituting the simplified denominator back into the potential formulas, we get:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n6.  **Match to the Format of the Options:** The answer choices have a denominator of the form $(dc \\pm \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. We can get this form by multiplying the numerator and denominator of our expressions by $c$:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n7.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) Incorrect. This uses the static Coulomb potential and a dimensionally incorrect formula for $\\vec{A}$.\n    *   B) Incorrect. This has a `+` sign in the denominator. A positive sign would correspond to \"advanced potentials\" (where the effect precedes the cause), which are typically discarded as unphysical. The retarded potential requires a negative sign.\n    *   **C) Correct.** These expressions for both $V$ and $\\vec{A}$ perfectly match the Liénard-Wiechert potentials we derived.\n    *   D) Incorrect. This also uses the static Coulomb potential, which is only valid for a stationary charge.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.

The sign in the denominator is positive. The correct sign is negative. The term $-\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$ is a crucial part of the relativistic Doppler effect; for a charge moving toward the observer, this term increases the potential, which is physically correct.

Instead, they are determined by the charge's position and velocity at an earlier \"retarded\" time, $t_r$. This is because the electromagnetic field propagates at a finite speed, $c$. The retarded time is defined by the condition that the time elapsed, $t - t_r$, is equal to the time it takes for light to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$. Using the problem's notation, this is $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials**: The standard formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations. In their common form, they are:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{R(1 - \\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{R(1 - \\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    where $\\vec{R}$ is the vector from the retarded position to the observation point, $\\hat{n} = \\vec{R}/R$ is the unit vector in that direction, and $\\vec{\\beta} = \\vec{v}/c$.\n\n3.  **Translate to the Problem's Notation**: We can translate the standard formula into the notation provided in the question:\n    *   The vector from the retarded position to the observation point, $\\vec{R}$, is given as $\\vec{d}$.\n    *   Its magnitude, $R$, is given as $d$.\n    *   The unit vector, $\\hat{n}$, is $\\vec{d}/d$.\n    *   The velocity, $\\vec{v}$, is the same.\n    *   The term in the denominator becomes: $R(1 - \\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta}) = d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c}\\right) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$.\n\n4.  **Rewrite the Potentials**: Substituting this denominator back into the formulas gives:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n5.  **Match with the Options**: The given options have a denominator of the form $(dc \\pm \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. We can get this form by multiplying the numerator and denominator of our derived expressions by $c$:\n    *   For the scalar potential V:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q \\cdot c}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   For the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v} \\cdot c}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n6.  **Final Comparison**:\n    *   **Option A**: Incorrect.

This exactly matches our derived expressions.\n    *   **Option C**: Incorrect. It has a `+` sign in the denominator. The negative sign is physically significant; it represents a Doppler-like effect where the potential is stronger if the charge is moving towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$), which makes the denominator smaller. A `+` sign would give the opposite, unphysical result for retarded potentials.\n    *   **Option D**: Incorrect.

This is a fundamental problem in electrodynamics that accounts for the finite speed of light, a concept known as retardation. The solutions are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n2.  **Recall the Standard Formulas:** The potentials at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$ are determined by the charge's properties at an earlier, \"retarded\" time $t_r$. The standard formulas, derived from Maxwell's equations, are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    The notation matches the problem statement: $\\vec{d}$ is the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observer, and $\\vec{v}$ is the charge's velocity at the retarded time.\n\n3.  **Simplify to Match Option Format:** To compare these formulas with the given options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator of the core fraction by $c$:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n4.  **Analyze the Options and Identify Careful Points:**\n    *   **Point 1: The Denominator and the Doppler Effect.** The term $(d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ is the most critical part. The negative sign is physically significant. It accounts for a Doppler-like effect: if the charge moves towards the observer, $\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$ is positive, making the denominator smaller and the potential stronger. Option C has a `+` sign, which is incorrect and would describe an unphysical \"advanced potential.\"\n    *   **Point 2: Static vs. Dynamic Potential.** Options B and D use the form $V = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}$. This is the static Coulomb potential. It is incorrect for two reasons: it doesn't include the velocity-dependent term in the denominator, and it uses $r$ (distance from the origin) instead of $d$ (distance from the charge's retarded position). The potential is generated by the charge, so the distance must be measured from the charge's location when the field was emitted.\n    *   **Point 3: Vector Potential Structure.** The vector potential $\\vec{A}$ must be a vector and is related to the charge's velocity $\\vec{v}$. The expression in Option B, $\\vec{A} \\propto \\vec{v}^2 V$, is structurally and dimensionally incorrect. The correct relationship, which holds for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, is $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$. While this relationship is stated in Option D, it is applied to the wrong scalar potential $V$.\n\n5.  **Final Comparison:**\n    *   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n        This option perfectly matches the correctly derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n    *   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n        Incorrect.

Uses static potential.\n\nThe analysis of the candidate answers reveals that while their final letter choices vary (likely due to a shuffling of the options in their inputs), their physical derivations almost unanimously converge on the expressions presented in Option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Problem:** The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. This is a standard problem in classical electrodynamics, and the solution is given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials correctly account for the fact that electromagnetic fields propagate at a finite speed, `c`, a phenomenon known as retardation.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Structure of the Options:**\n    *   **Options A and B:** Both suggest that the scalar potential is $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}$. This is the formula for the static Coulomb potential, which depends on `r`, the distance from the origin to the observation point. This is incorrect for a moving charge because the potential at time `t` must depend on the charge's position at an earlier, *retarded* time `tr`. The potential should depend on `d`, the distance from the charge's retarded position to the observation point. Therefore, options A and B are fundamentally incorrect.\n    *   **Options C and D:** Both options correctly express the potentials in terms of the retarded quantities `d` (distance from the retarded position) and `\\vec{v}` (velocity at the retarded time). The only difference between them is the sign in the denominator.\n\n3.  **Determine the Correct Sign in the Denominator:** The term in the denominator, $(dc \\pm \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$, accounts for the relativistic Doppler effect. We can determine the correct sign by considering a simple physical case:\n    *   The vector `\\vec{d}` points from the charge's retarded position towards the observer.\n    *   The term `\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}` represents the component of the charge's velocity directed towards the observer.\n    *   If the charge is moving towards the observer, `\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}` is positive. In this situation, the charge is \"chasing\" the field it emits, causing the wavefronts to bunch up. This should result in a *stronger* (larger) potential.\n    *   For the potential's magnitude to increase, the denominator must decrease.\n    *   Comparing the two possibilities:\n        *   In option C, the denominator is $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. When `\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}` is positive, the denominator gets smaller, correctly predicting a larger potential.\n        *   In option D, the denominator is $(dc + \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. When `\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}` is positive, the denominator gets larger, incorrectly predicting a smaller potential.\n    *   Therefore, the negative sign is the physically correct one, which eliminates option D.\n\n4.  **Final Confirmation of Option C:**\n    The remaining option is C:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    $\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\n    These are indeed the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, written in a slightly rearranged form. The standard textbook form is often written as:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    Multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c` yields the exact expression for V in option C.\n\n    Furthermore, the vector and scalar potentials for a moving point charge are related by $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$. Applying this to the scalar potential in option C and using the relation $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o \\epsilon_o)$ correctly yields the vector potential in option C.\n\n### Conclusion on Candidate Answers\nA review of the 14 candidate answers shows that while many correctly derive the physical formulas (like answers 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, etc.), most of them make a simple error in matching their correct derivation to the corresponding letter of the multiple-choice options. Answer 5 provides a correct derivation and correctly identifies C as the answer. Answer 13 also selects C, though its logical reasoning has some flaws. The overwhelming consensus on the physics, despite the labeling errors, points to the expressions found in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Identify the Core Physics\nThe question asks for the scalar potential (V) and the vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. This is a standard problem in classical electrodynamics. The solution must account for the fact that electromagnetic fields propagate at a finite speed, `c`. This means the fields at an observation point `r` at time `t` are determined by the charge's position and velocity at an earlier, \"retarded\" time, `tr`. The resulting potentials are known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**.\n\n### 2. Recall or Derive the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\nThe standard formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations. In a common notation, they are:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n\nThe subscript \"ret\" indicates that all quantities in the brackets must be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n### 3. Translate to the Notation of the Problem\nWe must carefully map the standard notation to the notation given in the question:\n*   The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point, often denoted $\\vec{R}$, is given as $\\vec{d}$.\n*   The magnitude of this vector, $R$, is given as $d$.\n*   The unit vector in this direction, $\\vec{n} = \\vec{R}/R$, is therefore $\\vec{d}/d$.\n*   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v}$.\n*   The normalized velocity, $\\vec{\\beta}$, is $\\vec{v}/c$.\n\nNow, let's substitute this notation into the denominator term $R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})$:\n$d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c}\\right) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\n### 4. Formulate the Potentials in the Problem's Notation\nSubstituting the simplified denominator back into the potential equations, we get:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nTo match the format of the given options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator of these expressions by `c`:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### 5. Compare with the Given Options\nLet's compare our derived expressions with the choices:\n\n*   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    *   Incorrect. This uses the static Coulomb potential, which is only valid for a stationary charge. It does not account for the retardation effects in the denominator.\n\n*   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    *   Incorrect. This also uses the static potential and has a dimensionally incorrect formula for the vector potential.\n\n*   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    *   **Correct.** These expressions perfectly match our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The negative sign in the denominator is crucial; it represents a Doppler-like effect, increasing the potential when the charge moves towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$).\n\n*   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    *   Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is positive. This would correspond to \"advanced\" potentials (where the effect precedes the cause), which are generally discarded as unphysical in this context.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe analysis shows that the expressions in option C are the correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge, expressed in the given notation. Many of the provided candidate answers correctly derive these formulas but then incorrectly map them to the wrong letter choice, indicating a likely shuffling of the options during their process.

The field observed at a point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ was generated by the source at an earlier, \"retarded\" time $t_r$. The potentials must depend on the charge's properties (position and velocity) at this retarded time.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Options - The Distance Term:**\n    *   Options A and B express the scalar potential as $V \\propto 1/r$. Here, $r$ is the magnitude of the field point vector $\\vec{r}$, which is the distance from the origin. This represents a static or quasi-static potential.\n    *   The correct potential must depend on the distance from the charge *at the moment the field was emitted*. This distance is $d = |\\vec{d}|$, the distance from the charge's retarded position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n    *   Options C and D correctly use the distance `d` in their formulation.\n    *   Therefore, options A and B are incorrect because they do not properly account for retardation in the distance term.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Options - The Relativistic Correction:**\n    *   Options C and D include a denominator of the form $(dc \\pm \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. This term is a crucial relativistic correction that arises from a Doppler-like effect. It accounts for the fact that the volume of space over which the charge's influence is spread appears different to the observer due to the charge's motion.\n    *   The choice between the `+` and `-` sign is a critical point. Let's consider the physical meaning. The term $\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$ is positive if the charge is moving generally towards the observation point. In this case, the field should be stronger (the denominator should be smaller).\n    *   For the denominator to decrease when $\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$ is positive, the sign must be negative. The correct denominator is $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$.\n    *   This means Option C has the correct sign, while Option D is incorrect. The positive sign in Option D would correspond to an unphysical \"advanced potential\" where the effect precedes the cause.\n\n4.  **Final Verification:**\n    *   The standard formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n        where all quantities on the right are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   Multiplying the numerator and denominator of these standard forms by `c` gives:\n        $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   These expressions exactly match the formulas given in Option C.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, Option C is the only one that correctly represents the Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge with the given notation. It correctly uses the retarded distance `d` and includes the necessary relativistic correction factor $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ with the physically correct negative sign.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis task requires identifying the correct expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge from a set of options. This is a standard problem in classical electrodynamics, and the solution is given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principle:** The core of the problem is accounting for **retardation**. Because electromagnetic fields propagate at a finite speed, `c`, the potential measured at a point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` is caused by the charge's state (position and velocity) at an earlier, or **retarded**, time `t_r`. The time delay is the light-travel time from the charge's retarded position to the observer: $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:** The standard formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations. In a common notation, they are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    where $\\vec{R}$ is the vector from the retarded position to the observer, $R=|\\vec{R}|$, $\\vec{n} = \\vec{R}/R$, and $\\vec{\\beta} = \\vec{v}/c$.\n\n3.  **Translate to the Problem's Notation:** We must carefully map the standard notation to the one given in the question.\n    *   The vector from the retarded position to the observer, $\\vec{R}$, is called $\\vec{d}$.\n    *   The distance, $R$, is called $d$.\n    *   The unit vector, $\\vec{n}$, is $\\vec{d}/d$.\n    *   The velocity at the retarded time is $\\vec{v}$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\vec{\\beta}$ is $\\vec{v}/c$.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Denominator (Careful Point 1):** The crucial part of the expression is the denominator, which accounts for the relativistic Doppler effect.

The correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which, in the given notation, are precisely those in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires identifying the correct expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge, known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The analysis involves comparing the standard formulas with the given options, paying close attention to the notation.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principle**: The question concerns the electromagnetic potentials generated by a moving point charge. Because the electromagnetic field propagates at a finite speed, `c`, the potentials at an observation point `r` at time `t` are determined by the charge's state (position and velocity) at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time `tr`. The correct description is given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n2.  **Recall the Standard Formulas**: The Liénard-Wiechert potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations. In a common form, they are:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{R - \\vec{R} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{R - \\vec{R} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    The subscript \"ret\" indicates that all quantities inside the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\n3.  **Translate to the Problem's Notation**:\n    *   The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point, $\\vec{R}$, is given as $\\vec{d}$.\n    *   The magnitude of this vector, $R$, is given as $d$.\n    *   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v}$.\n\n    Substituting this notation into the standard formulas gives:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n\n4.  **Manipulate to Match the Options**: The given options have a denominator of the form $(dc \\pm \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. We can achieve this form by multiplying the numerator and denominator of our expressions by `c`:\n    *   For the scalar potential V:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q \\cdot c}{c(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   For the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v} \\cdot c}{c(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options**:\n    *   A) Incorrect. Uses the static potential form ($V \\propto 1/r$) which ignores retardation effects on the potential's magnitude.\n    *   B) Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is positive. The correct sign is negative.\n    *   C) Incorrect. Uses the static potential form.\n    *   D) **Correct**. The expressions for both V and $\\vec{A}$ perfectly match the derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Retardation is Key**: The potentials depend on the distance `d` from the charge's position *at the retarded time*, not the distance `r` from the origin. Options A and C are incorrect for this reason alone.\n*   **The Sign in the Denominator**: The term $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ in the denominator accounts for a relativistic Doppler-like effect. The negative sign is crucial. If the charge is moving towards the observer, $\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$ is positive, the denominator gets smaller, and the potential's magnitude increases, which is the correct physical behavior. Option B has the wrong sign, which would correspond to unphysical \"advanced\" potentials.\n*   **Consistency Check**: The Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a point charge are related by $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$. Let's check this for option D.\n    $\\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left( \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$.\n    Using the relation $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o \\epsilon_o)$, we can substitute $\\mu_o = 1/(\\epsilon_o c^2)$. This gives $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_o c} = \\mu_o c$.\n    Substituting this into our expression yields $\\frac{\\mu_o c q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$, which is exactly the formula for $\\vec{A}$ in option D. The relationship holds.\n*   **Analysis of Agent Responses**: A review of the provided agent answers shows that while several conclude with the wrong letter (A, B, or C), their underlying physical derivations almost unanimously arrive at the expressions found in option D. The discrepancies are likely due to a shuffling of the option labels during their processing. The consensus of the *physical reasoning* strongly supports option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principle**: The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. This is a fundamental problem in classical electrodynamics, and the solution is given by the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**. These potentials account for the finite speed of light, meaning the field at a point in space and time is determined by the charge's position and velocity at an earlier, \"retarded\" time ($t_r$).\n\n2.  **Recall the Standard Formulas**: The standard expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, derived from Maxwell's equations, are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n\n    The subscript \"ret\" indicates that all variables inside the brackets ($\\vec{d}$, $d$, and $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$. The notation matches the one given in the problem.\n\n3.  **Manipulate to Match Option Format**: The given options have a denominator of the form $(dc \\pm \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. We can transform our standard formulas to this format by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n    *   For the scalar potential V:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q \\cdot c}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    *   For the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v} \\cdot c}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n4.  **Compare with the Given Options**: Now we can carefully evaluate each option against these correctly derived expressions.\n\n    *   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n        This is incorrect. The sign in the denominator is positive (`+`). The correct sign is negative (`-`). The negative sign is physically significant; it causes the potential to increase when the charge moves toward the observer (a Doppler-like effect). A positive sign corresponds to an unphysical \"advanced\" potential.\n\n    *   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n        This is incorrect. The expression for the scalar potential, $V$, is the static Coulomb potential. It fails to account for the motion of the charge through the velocity-dependent term in the denominator and uses the distance from the origin, $r$, instead of the correct distance from the retarded position, $d$.\n\n    *   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n        This is incorrect for the same reason as option B (it uses the static potential). Furthermore, the expression for $\\vec{A}$ is structurally and dimensionally wrong, as $\\vec{v}^2$ is a scalar, while $\\vec{A}$ must be a vector.\n\n    *   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n        This is correct. Both the scalar potential $V$ and the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ perfectly match the standard Liénard-Wiechert formulas after the algebraic manipulation shown in Step 3.\n\n### Analysis of Candidate Answers\nA review of the provided candidate answers shows a significant amount of confusion, where many agents correctly derived the physics but then selected the wrong option letter. For example, Answers 2, 7, 12, and 14 correctly describe the physics leading to option D but incorrectly label their final choice as B. Similarly, Answer 5's reasoning points to D but it chooses C, and Answer 8's reasoning points to D but it chooses A. This highlights the importance of carefully matching the derived formula to the options as written. The agents that correctly performed both the derivation and the matching (e.g., Answers 3, 4, 6, 9, 10) all converged on option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
