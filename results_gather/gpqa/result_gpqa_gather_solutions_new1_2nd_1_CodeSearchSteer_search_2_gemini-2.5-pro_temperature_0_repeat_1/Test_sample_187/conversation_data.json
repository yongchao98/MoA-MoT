Identify the Correct Formula**\n\nThe first crucial step is to use the correct formula for the interplanar distance (d-spacing) in a rhombohedral crystal system. The formula is:\n\n1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²)sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα) ] / [ a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ]\n\nWhere:\n*   `a` is the lattice parameter (given as the interatomic distance = 10 Å).\n*   `α` is the angle between the crystal axes (given as 30°).\n*   `(hkl)` are the Miller indices of the plane (given as (111)).\n\n**2. Substitute the Miller Indices (hkl) = (111)**\n\n*   h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3\n*   hk + kl + lh = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3\n\n**3. Careful Point: Formula Simplification for the (111) Plane**\n\nAs demonstrated by one of the more astute agents (Answer 5), the general formula can be algebraically simplified for the specific (111) plane. This reduces the chance of calculation errors.\n\nThe numerator becomes: 3sin²α + 6(cos²α - cosα) = 3(1-cos²α) + 6cos²α - 6cosα = 3 + 3cos²α - 6cosα = 3(1 - cosα)².\nThe denominator term `(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)` can be factored into `(1 - cosα)²(1 + 2cosα)`.\n\nSubstituting these back, the `(1 - cosα)²` terms cancel out, leaving a much simpler formula for the d-spacing of the (111) plane:\n\n1/d₁₁₁² = 3 / [ a²(1 + 2cosα) ]\n\nThis simplification is a key step for ensuring accuracy.\n\n**4. Substitute the Given Physical Values**\n\nNow, we plug the given values into the simplified formula:\n*   `a = 10` Å\n*   `α = 30°`\n\n1/d² = 3 / [ 10² * (1 + 2cos(30°)) ]\n\n**5. Careful Point: Calculation with High Precision**\n\nTo avoid errors, it is best to avoid rounding intermediate trigonometric values.\n*   `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n\n1/d² = 3 / [ 100 * (1 + 2 * (√3 / 2)) ]\n1/d² = 3 / [ 100 * (1 + √3) ]\n\nNow, solve for `d`:\nd² = [ 100 * (1 + √3) ] / 3\nd = √[ 100 * (1 + √3) / 3 ]\nd = 10 * √[ (1 + √3) / 3 ]\n\nUsing the value `√3 ≈ 1.73205`:\nd = 10 * √[ (1 + 1.73205) / 3 ]\nd = 10 * √[ 2.73205 / 3 ]\nd = 10 * √[ 0.91068... ]\nd ≈ 10 * 0.954297\nd ≈ 9.543 Å\n\n**6. Compare with Options and Final Decision**\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 9.543 Å. Comparing this to the given options:\n*   A) 8.95 Angstrom\n*   B) 9.54 Angstrom\n*   C) 10.05 Angstrom\n*   D) 9.08 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated value matches option B. Many of the candidate answers performed the calculation correctly but failed in the final step of matching the numerical result to the correct option letter.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on an analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step evaluation to determine the correct interplanar distance.\n\n**1. Identify the Correct Formula**\nThe first crucial step is to use the correct formula for the interplanar distance, *d*<sub>hkl</sub>, in a rhombohedral crystal system. The formula is:\n\n1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²)sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα) ] / [ a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ]\n\nWhere:\n*   (h, k, l) are the Miller indices of the plane.\n*   *a* is the lattice parameter (given as the interatomic distance).\n*   α is the angle between the crystal axes.\n\n**2. Simplify the Formula for the (111) Plane**\nFor the specific case of the (111) plane, where h=1, k=1, and l=1, the formula can be greatly simplified. This is a key step that reduces the chance of calculation errors.\n\n*   h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3\n*   hk + kl + lh = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3\n\nSubstituting these into the general formula and simplifying the trigonometric terms (as shown by Agent 5) leads to a much simpler expression:\n\n1/d²<sub>(111)</sub> = 3 / [ a²(1 + 2cosα) ]\n\n**3. Substitute the Given Values and Calculate**\nNow, we can substitute the given values into this simplified formula:\n*   a = 10 Angstrom\n*   α = 30°\n\nFirst, find the value of cos(30°):\n*   cos(30°) = √3 / 2 ≈ 0.866025\n\nSubstitute into the formula:\n*   1/d² = 3 / [ 10² * (1 + 2 * (√3 / 2)) ]\n*   1/d² = 3 / [ 100 * (1 + √3) ]\n\nNow, solve for d:\n*   d² = [ 100 * (1 + √3) ] / 3\n*   d = √[ (100 * (1 + √3)) / 3 ]\n*   d = 10 * √[ (1 + √3) / 3 ]\n\nUsing the value √3 ≈ 1.73205:\n*   d = 10 * √[ (1 + 1.73205) / 3 ]\n*   d = 10 * √[ 2.73205 / 3 ]\n*   d = 10 * √[ 0.910683... ]\n*   d ≈ 10 * 0.954297\n*   d ≈ 9.543 Angstrom\n\n**4. Compare with Options**\nThe calculated value of approximately 9.543 Angstrom is closest to option B.\n\n*   A) 8.95 Angstrom\n*   **B) 9.54 Angstrom**\n*   C) 9.08 Angstrom\n*   D) 10.05 Angstrom\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Formula Choice:** Using the general formula is correct, but simplifying it for the (111) plane is more efficient and less error-prone.\n*   **Calculation Precision:** Many of the provided answers show that using rounded-off trigonometric values (like 0.650 for cos³(30°)) early in the calculation leads to an incorrect result of ~9.62 Angstrom. It is critical to maintain high precision or use exact values (like √3) until the final step.\n*   **Matching Result to Option:** A significant number of the candidate answers calculated the correct numerical value but then selected the wrong letter option (e.g., calculating 9.54 but choosing A or C). This highlights the importance of carefully matching the final result to the given choices.\n\nThe most reliable calculations consistently point to a value of approximately 9.54 Angstrom.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nTo determine the final answer, a step-by-step analysis of the problem is required, paying close attention to the points where errors could be introduced.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Crystal System and Parameters:**\n    *   The crystal system is rhombohedral.\n    *   The lattice parameter (interatomic distance) is `a = 10` Angstrom.\n    *   The angle between the axes is `α = 30°`.\n    *   The plane of interest is the (111) plane, so the Miller indices are `h=1`, `k=1`, `l=1`.\n\n2.  **Select the Correct Formula:**\n    The formula for the interplanar distance `d` in a rhombohedral crystal is:\n    `1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²)sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα) ] / [ a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ]`\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    This calculation can be done in two ways: by direct substitution into the complex formula or by first simplifying the formula for the (111) plane. The simplification method is less prone to error.\n\n    **Method 1: Simplification (as shown in Answer 5)**\n    For the (111) plane, `h²+k²+l² = 3` and `hk+kl+lh = 3`. The formula for `1/d²` can be algebraically simplified to a much cleaner form:\n    `1/d₁₁₁² = 3 / [a²(1 + 2cosα)]`\n\n    Now, substitute the given values:\n    *   `a = 10` Å\n    *   `α = 30°`, so `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n\n    `1/d₁₁₁² = 3 / [10² * (1 + 2 * (√3 / 2))]`\n    `1/d₁₁₁² = 3 / [100 * (1 + √3)]`\n\n    Now, solve for `d₁₁₁`:\n    `d₁₁₁² = [100 * (1 + √3)] / 3`\n    `d₁₁₁ = √([100 * (1 + √3)] / 3)`\n\n    Using the numerical value `√3 ≈ 1.73205`:\n    `d₁₁₁ = √([100 * (1 + 1.73205)] / 3) = √([100 * 2.73205] / 3) = √(273.205 / 3) = √91.068...`\n    `d₁₁₁ ≈ 9.543` Å\n\n    **Method 2: Direct Substitution (as shown in most other answers)**\n    This method requires careful calculation of each term. Using high precision (`cos(30°) ≈ 0.866025`, `cos²(30°) = 0.75`, `cos³(30°) ≈ 0.649519`):\n    *   **Numerator:** `(3 * 0.25) + 6 * (0.75 - 0.866025) = 0.75 - 0.69615 = 0.05385`\n    *   **Denominator:** `100 * (1 - 3*0.75 + 2*0.649519) = 100 * (1 - 2.25 + 1.299038) = 100 * 0.049038 = 4.9038`\n    *   **1/d²:** `0.05385 / 4.9038 ≈ 0.0109813`\n    *   **d²:** `1 / 0.0109813 ≈ 91.064`\n    *   **d:** `√91.064 ≈ 9.543` Å\n\n    Both methods yield the same result.\n\n4.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated value is `d ≈ 9.543` Angstrom. This is compared to the given options:\n    *   A) 9.08 Angstrom\n    *   B) 9.54 Angstrom\n    *   C) 10.05 Angstrom\n    *   D) 8.95 Angstrom\n\n    The calculated value is extremely close to 9.54 Angstrom.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Formula Accuracy:** It is crucial to use the correct, complete formula for the rhombohedral system.\n*   **Calculation Precision:** Using rounded-off values for trigonometric functions in intermediate steps can lead to significant errors. For instance, using `cos(30°) ≈ 0.866` and `cos³(30°) ≈ 0.650` leads to a result of `d ≈ 9.62` Å, which is not close to any option. Maintaining precision, ideally by keeping terms like `√3` until the final step, is essential.\n*   **Matching Answer to Option:** A review of the candidate answers shows that many agents calculated the correct numerical value but then selected the wrong lettered option. This is a critical final step that must be done carefully.\n\nThe correct calculation yields ~9.54 Angstrom, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem and Identify Given Information**\n*   **Crystal System:** Rhombohedral\n*   **Lattice Parameter (a):** The problem states the \"interatomic distance\" is 10 Angstrom. In the context of a primitive rhombohedral cell, this is the lattice parameter `a`. So, `a = 10` Å.\n*   **Interaxial Angle (α):** The angles are given as `α = β = γ = 30°`. For a rhombohedral system, we only need the single angle `α`. So, `α = 30°`.\n*   **Miller Indices (hkl):** We need to find the distance for the (111) plane. So, `(h, k, l) = (1, 1, 1)`.\n\n**2. Select the Correct Formula**\nThe formula for the interplanar spacing `d_hkl` in a rhombohedral crystal system is:\n```\n1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²)sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα) ] / [ a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ]\n```\n\n**3. Simplify the Formula for the (111) Plane (Careful Point)**\nWhile we can plug the numbers directly into the complex formula, it's prone to calculation errors. For the specific case of the (111) plane, the formula can be greatly simplified.\n*   `h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3`\n*   `hk + kl + lh = 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 = 3`\n\nSubstituting these into the numerator and denominator terms (as shown in detail by agent 5) leads to a cancellation, resulting in a much simpler formula for the d-spacing of the (111) plane:\n```\n1/d₁₁₁² = 3 / [ a²(1 + 2cosα) ]\n```\nThis simplification is a key step to reduce calculation complexity and potential errors.\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\nNow, we substitute the given values into the simplified formula:\n*   `a = 10` Å\n*   `α = 30°`\n*   `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n\n```\n1/d₁₁₁² = 3 / [ 10² * (1 + 2 * (√3 / 2)) ]\n1/d₁₁₁² = 3 / [ 100 * (1 + √3) ]\n```\nNow, solve for `d₁₁₁`:\n```\nd₁₁₁² = [ 100 * (1 + √3) ] / 3\nd₁₁₁ = √[ 100 * (1 + √3) / 3 ]\nd₁₁₁ = 10 * √[ (1 + √3) / 3 ]\n```\nUsing the numerical value `√3 ≈ 1.73205`:\n```\nd₁₁₁ = 10 * √[ (1 + 1.73205) / 3 ]\nd₁₁₁ = 10 * √[ 2.73205 / 3 ]\nd₁₁₁ = 10 * √[ 0.910683 ]\nd₁₁₁ ≈ 10 * 0.954297\nd₁₁₁ ≈ 9.543 Å\n```\n\n**5. Compare with Options and Conclude**\nThe calculated interplanar distance is approximately 9.543 Å. Let's compare this with the given options:\nA) 9.08 Angstrom\nB) 9.54 Angstrom\nC) 10.05 Angstrom\nD) 8.95 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated value of 9.543 Å is extremely close to 9.54 Å. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\n**Analysis of Candidate Answers:**\nMost of the provided answers correctly calculate the value to be ~9.54 Å. However, several of them make an error in the final step by selecting the wrong option letter (e.g., choosing A, C, or D despite calculating 9.54). This highlights the importance of carefully matching the calculated result to the provided options. Answers 5, 8, 9, and 10 correctly perform the calculation and identify B as the final answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Goal and Crystal System**\nThe objective is to calculate the interplanar distance for the (111) plane of a rhombohedral crystal.\n\n**2. Select the Correct Formula**\nFor a rhombohedral crystal system, the formula for the interplanar spacing ($d_{hkl}$) is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk+kl+lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1 - 3\\cos^2\\alpha + 2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n\n**3. List the Given Parameters**\n*   Lattice parameter, $a = 10$ Angstrom\n*   Angle, $\\alpha = 30^\\circ$\n*   Miller indices, $(hkl) = (111)$\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\nFirst, substitute the Miller indices into the formula components:\n*   $h^2+k^2+l^2 = 1^2+1^2+1^2 = 3$\n*   $hk+kl+lh = (1)(1)+(1)(1)+(1)(1) = 3$\n\nNext, find the values of the trigonometric functions for $\\alpha = 30^\\circ$:\n*   $\\sin(30^\\circ) = 0.5 \\implies \\sin^2(30^\\circ) = 0.25$\n*   $\\cos(30^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx 0.866025$\n*   $\\cos^2(30^\\circ) = (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75$\n*   $\\cos^3(30^\\circ) = (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})^3 = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{8} \\approx 0.649519$\n\nNow, substitute these values into the main formula. It is best to calculate the numerator and denominator separately, using high precision to avoid rounding errors.\n\n**Numerator Calculation:**\nNumerator = $(3 \\cdot \\sin^2\\alpha) + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot (\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)$\nNumerator = $(3 \\cdot 0.25) + 6 \\cdot (0.75 - 0.866025)$\nNumerator = $0.75 + 6 \\cdot (-0.116025)$\nNumerator = $0.75 - 0.69615 = 0.05385$\n\n**Denominator Calculation:**\nDenominator = $a^2 \\cdot (1 - 3\\cos^2\\alpha + 2\\cos^3\\alpha)$\nDenominator = $10^2 \\cdot (1 - 3 \\cdot 0.75 + 2 \\cdot 0.649519)$\nDenominator = $100 \\cdot (1 - 2.25 + 1.299038)$\nDenominator = $100 \\cdot (0.049038) = 4.9038$\n\n**Final Calculation for d:**\n$\\frac{1}{d^2} = \\frac{\\text{Numerator}}{\\text{Denominator}} = \\frac{0.05385}{4.9038} \\approx 0.0109813$\n$d^2 = \\frac{1}{0.0109813} \\approx 91.064$\n$d = \\sqrt{91.064} \\approx 9.5427$ Angstrom\n\n**5. Verification with Simplified Formula**\nAs shown by one of the candidate answers, for the specific (111) plane, the general formula simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\nLet's calculate using this simpler and less error-prone formula:\n$\\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{10^2(1 + 2 \\cdot \\cos(30^\\circ))} = \\frac{3}{100(1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})} = \\frac{3}{100(1 + \\sqrt{3})}$\n$d_{111}^2 = \\frac{100(1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3} \\approx \\frac{100(2.73205)}{3} \\approx \\frac{273.205}{3} \\approx 91.068$\n$d_{111} = \\sqrt{91.068} \\approx 9.543$ Angstrom\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n**6.

The given parameters are:\n    *   Crystal System: Rhombohedral\n    *   Lattice Parameter, `a`: 10 Angstrom\n    *   Interaxial Angle, `α`: 30°\n    *   Miller Indices, `(hkl)`: (111)\n\n2.  **Select the Correct Formula**: The interplanar spacing, `d`, in a rhombohedral crystal system is given by a specific formula. The correct general formula, identified by most candidate answers and confirmed by external search, is:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk+kl+lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1 - 3\\cos^2\\alpha + 2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation**: The most reliable method, as pointed out by several candidate answers, is to first simplify the formula for the specific case of the (111) plane, where `h=k=l=1`. This reduces the chance of arithmetic errors.\n    *   Substituting `h=k=l=1` and performing algebraic simplification (factoring the numerator and denominator) reduces the complex general formula to a much simpler form:\n        $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\n    *   Now, substitute the given values (`a = 10` and `α = 30°`) into this simplified formula. It is crucial to use a precise value for `cos(30°)`, which is `√3 / 2`.\n        $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{10^2(1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})} = \\frac{3}{100(1 + \\sqrt{3})} $$\n    *   Solving for `d₁₁₁`:\n        $$ d_{111}^2 = \\frac{100(1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3} $$\n        $$ d_{111} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100(1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n    *   Using the numerical value `√3 ≈ 1.73205`:\n        $$ d_{111} \\approx 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{2.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{0.91068...} $$\n        $$ d_{111} \\approx 10 \\times 0.9543 = 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\n\n4.  **Compare with Options and Conclude**: The calculated value is approximately **9.543 Angstrom**.

This is a powerful technique that reduces the number of terms and minimizes the risk of calculation errors.\n*   **Calculation Precision**: Using rounded-off values for trigonometric functions in intermediate steps can lead to significant errors. For instance, some candidate answers showed that imprecise calculations lead to an incorrect result of ~9.62 Å. Maintaining high precision by using exact values like `√3` until the final step is critical for accuracy.\n*   **Option Mapping**: A significant number of the candidate answers calculated the correct numerical value (~9.54) but then selected the wrong lettered option. This was due to inconsistent listings of the options in their individual analyses. The final decision must be based on matching the correct numerical result to the original list of options provided in the problem statement.\n\nThe rigorous calculation consistently yields a value of approximately 9.54 Angstrom, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"

The formula for `1/d²` can be algebraically simplified to a much cleaner form:\n    `1/d₁₁₁² = 3 / [a²(1 + 2cosα)]`\n\n    Now, substitute the given values:\n    *   `a = 10` Å\n    *   `α = 30°`, so `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n\n    `1/d₁₁₁² = 3 / [10² * (1 + 2 * (√3 / 2))]`\n    `1/d₁₁₁² = 3 / [100 * (1 + √3)]`\n\n    Now, solve for `d₁₁₁`:\n    `d₁₁₁² = [100 * (1 + √3)] / 3`\n    `d₁₁₁ = √([100 * (1 + √3)] / 3)`\n\n    Using the numerical value `√3 ≈ 1.73205`:\n    `d₁₁₁ = √([100 * (1 + 1.73205)] / 3) = √([100 * 2.73205] / 3) = √(273.205 / 3) = √91.068...`\n    `d₁₁₁ ≈ 9.543` Å\n\n    **Method 2: Direct Substitution (as shown in most other answers)**\n    This method requires careful calculation of each term. Using high precision (`cos(30°) ≈ 0.866025`, `cos²(30°) = 0.75`, `cos³(30°) ≈ 0.649519`):\n    *   **Numerator:** `(3 * 0.25) + 6 * (0.75 - 0.866025) = 0.75 - 0.69615 = 0.05385`\n    *   **Denominator:** `100 * (1 - 3*0.75 + 2*0.649519) = 100 * (1 - 2.25 + 1.299038) = 100 * 0.049038 = 4.9038`\n    *   **1/d²:** `0.05385 / 4.9038 ≈ 0.0109813`\n    *   **d²:** `1 / 0.0109813 ≈ 91.064`\n    *   **d:** `√91.064 ≈ 9.543` Å\n\n    Both methods yield the same result.\n\n4.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated value is `d ≈ 9.543` Angstrom. This is compared to the given options:\n    *   A) 9.08 Angstrom\n    *   B) 9.54 Angstrom\n    *   C) 10.05 Angstrom\n    *   D) 8.95 Angstrom\n\n    The calculated value is extremely close to 9.54 Angstrom.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Formula Accuracy:** It is crucial to use the correct, complete formula for the rhombohedral system.\n*   **Calculation Precision:** Using rounded-off values for trigonometric functions in intermediate steps can lead to significant errors. For instance, using `cos(30°) ≈ 0.866` and `cos³(30°) ≈ 0.650` leads to a result of `d ≈ 9.62` Å, which is not close to any option. Maintaining precision, ideally by keeping terms like `√3` until the final step, is essential.\n*   **Matching Answer to Option:** A review of the candidate answers shows that many agents calculated the correct numerical value but then selected the wrong lettered option. This is a critical final step that must be done carefully.\n\nThe correct calculation yields ~9.54 Angstrom, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem and Identify Given Information**\n*   **Crystal System:** Rhombohedral\n*   **Lattice Parameter (a):** The problem states the \"interatomic distance\" is 10 Angstrom. In the context of a primitive rhombohedral cell, this is the lattice parameter `a`. So, `a = 10` Å.\n*   **Interaxial Angle (α):** The angles are given as `α = β = γ = 30°`. For a rhombohedral system, we only need the single angle `α`. So, `α = 30°`.\n*   **Miller Indices (hkl):** We need to find the distance for the (111) plane. So, `(h, k, l) = (1, 1, 1)`.\n\n**2. Select the Correct Formula**\nThe formula for the interplanar spacing `d_hkl` in a rhombohedral crystal system is:\n```\n1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²)sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα) ] / [ a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ]\n```\n\n**3. Simplify the Formula for the (111) Plane (Careful Point)**\nWhile we can plug the numbers directly into the complex formula, it's prone to calculation errors. For the specific case of the (111) plane, the formula can be greatly simplified.\n*   `h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3`\n*   `hk + kl + lh = 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 = 3`\n\nSubstituting these into the numerator and denominator terms (as shown in detail by agent 5) leads to a cancellation, resulting in a much simpler formula for the d-spacing of the (111) plane:\n```\n1/d₁₁₁² = 3 / [ a²(1 + 2cosα) ]\n```\nThis simplification is a key step to reduce calculation complexity and potential errors.\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\nNow, we substitute the given values into the simplified formula:\n*   `a = 10` Å\n*   `α = 30°`\n*   `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n\n```\n1/d₁₁₁² = 3 / [ 10² * (1 + 2 * (√3 / 2)) ]\n1/d₁₁₁² = 3 / [ 100 * (1 + √3) ]\n```\nNow, solve for `d₁₁₁`:\n```\nd₁₁₁² = [ 100 * (1 + √3) ] / 3\nd₁₁₁ = √[ 100 * (1 + √3) / 3 ]\nd₁₁₁ = 10 * √[ (1 + √3) / 3 ]\n```\nUsing the numerical value `√3 ≈ 1.73205`:\n```\nd₁₁₁ = 10 * √[ (1 + 1.73205) / 3 ]\nd₁₁₁ = 10 * √[ 2.73205 / 3 ]\nd₁₁₁ = 10 * √[ 0.910683 ]\nd₁₁₁ ≈ 10 * 0.954297\nd₁₁₁ ≈ 9.543 Å\n```\n\n**5.
