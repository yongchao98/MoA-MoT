The starting ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has a quaternary carbon at the C2 position, which has no alpha-protons. Therefore, the base (t-BuOK) can only deprotonate the alpha-proton at the C6 position to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the ethyl acrylate. When naming the product with the propanoate as the parent chain, the correct IUPAC name is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This structural requirement eliminated options A and C.\n3.  **Constraint for Reaction B:** The second reaction is also a Michael addition. The carbanion formed from 1-nitropropane (a 3-carbon molecule) attacks (E)-but-2-enenitrile (a 4-carbon molecule). The resulting product's main carbon chain, which includes the nitrile carbon, is six carbons long. Therefore, the product must be a derivative of hexanenitrile. The correct IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This constraint eliminated option D from the remaining candidates.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only hypothesis that satisfies both constraints is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct products for both reactions.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n**Reaction:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK as a base.\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will deprotonate the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate, which then attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate).\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate (Nucleophile):** The ketone has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group), which are at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at **C2** is a quaternary carbon, as it is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has **no α-protons** and cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   The carbon at **C6** is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and a single hydrogen atom. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, the base can only abstract the proton from the C6 position. This leads to the formation of a single, specific enolate.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The nucleophilic carbon of the enolate (C6) attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:** The resulting product has an ethyl propanoate group attached to the C6 position of the original ketone. To name this compound according to the options provided, the ethyl propanoate is treated as the parent chain, and the cyclohexanone ring is a substituent.\n    *   The parent chain is **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The cyclohexyl ring is a substituent at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the ring substituent, we number it starting from the point of attachment (the original C6) as C1.\n    *   The carbonyl group (ketone) is at position C2 (oxo).\n    *   The ethyl and methyl groups are at position C3.\n    *   The original methyl group from C6 is now at C1.\n    *   This gives the substituent name: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This name appears in options C and D.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n**Reaction:** 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH as a base.\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition. The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon α to the electron-withdrawing nitro group, creating a nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:** The protons on the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) are acidic. KOH removes one of these protons to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion), `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:** A new C-C bond is formed, connecting the α-carbon of the nitropropane to the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    *   The resulting structure is `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so its carbon is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile has 6 carbons, making the parent name **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering the chain from the nitrile: `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This name appears in options B and C.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   The correct name for **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The correct name for **Product B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies both products is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct products for both reactions.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition reaction.

Therefore, it cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   The carbon at position 6 is a tertiary carbon and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The base can only abstract the single available proton from the C6 position. This forms a specific enolate.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is a 1,4-conjugate addition that forms a new carbon-carbon bond.\n\n4.  **Product A Structure and Naming**:\n    *   The resulting product has an ethyl propanoate group (`-CH₂CH₂COOEt`) attached to the C6 position of the original ketone.\n    *   To name this product according to the options, the ethyl propanoate is treated as the parent chain because the ester functional group has higher priority than the ketone.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the ring substituent, the point of attachment (the original C6) is numbered as C1. The numbering then proceeds to give the principal group on the ring (the ketone) the lowest possible number.\n        *   **C1** (original C6): Has a **methyl** group.\n        *   **C2** (original C1): Has the **oxo** (ketone) group.\n        *   **C3** (original C2): Has an **ethyl** group and a **methyl** group.\n    *   This gives the substituent name: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition.

The base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK) creates a nucleophile (an enolate) from the ketone, which then attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate).\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate)**:\n    *   The starting ketone has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group): C2 and C6.\n    *   The C2 position is a quaternary carbon, substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group. It has **no α-protons** and cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   The C6 position is a tertiary carbon, substituted with a methyl group and one **α-proton**.\n    *   Due to the availability of only one type of α-proton, the strong, bulky base t-BuOK will exclusively remove the proton from the C6 position to form a single, specific enolate.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The enolate, with its nucleophilic character at C6, attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).

The reaction involves a nucleophile (a Michael donor) adding to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound (a Michael acceptor). Here, the ketone is the Michael donor (after being deprotonated), ethyl acrylate is the Michael acceptor, and potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is the strong base used to generate the nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):** The base, t-BuOK, abstracts an acidic proton from a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-carbon) to form an enolate.\n    *   The starting ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   The C2 carbon is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group) and has **no α-protons**.\n    *   The C6 carbon is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen) and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position, leading to a single, specific enolate.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This forms a new carbon-carbon bond.\n\n4.  **Product A Structure and Name:** After the addition and subsequent protonation (during workup), a `-CH₂CH₂COOEt` group is attached to the C6 carbon of the original ketone. To name this product according to the options, the ethyl propanoate moiety is considered the parent chain.\n    *   **Parent Chain:** ethyl propanoate.\n    *   **Substituent:** The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   **Naming the Substituent:** The ring is numbered starting from the point of attachment (the original C6) as C1.

The α-protons of a nitroalkane are acidic and can be removed by a base.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Nitronate):** The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate), `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`, which acts as the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n\n4.  **Product B Structure and Name:** A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. The resulting structure is `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   **Parent Chain:** The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN).

The nitroalkane is the Michael donor, and the α,β-unsaturated nitrile is the Michael acceptor.\n2.  **Determine the Nucleophile:** The base, KOH, deprotonates the carbon α to the electron-withdrawing nitro group in 1-nitropropane (`CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂`). This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (`[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`), which acts as the nucleophile.\n3.  **Predict the Product Structure:** The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitropropane anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`).

The enolate will then act as a nucleophile (the Michael donor) and attack the α,β-unsaturated ester, ethyl acrylate (the Michael acceptor).\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation**: The crucial first step is to identify which α-proton will be removed by the base. The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group): C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is a quaternary carbon, as it is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has **no α-protons** and cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   **C6** is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom.

This is a classic **Michael addition** reaction.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):** The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon (a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   The C2 position is a quaternary carbon, substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group. It has **no α-protons** and cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   The C6 position is a tertiary carbon, substituted with a methyl group and one hydrogen. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, the base can only abstract the proton from the C6 position, leading to the formation of a single, specific enolate.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate, which is nucleophilic at C6, attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The resulting product has a `-CH₂CH₂COOEt` group attached to the C6 position of the original ketone.\n    *   The options provided name the product as a derivative of ethyl propanoate, which is a valid IUPAC naming convention since the ester functional group has higher priority than the ketone.\n    *   The parent chain is **ethyl propanoate**. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the C3 position of this chain.\n    *   To name the complex cyclohexyl substituent, the point of attachment to the main chain is designated as C1.\n        *   **New C1 (original C6):** This carbon is the point of attachment and also has a **methyl** group.\n        *   **New C2 (original C1):** This carbon bears the carbonyl group, named as an **oxo** substituent.\n        *   **New C3 (original C2):** This carbon bears an **ethyl** group and a **methyl** group.\n    *   Assembling the name of the substituent gives: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This result eliminates options A and D, which incorrectly place the oxo group at position 4.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** The reaction involves a nitroalkane (1-nitropropane), an α,β-unsaturated nitrile ((E)-but-2-enenitrile), and a base (KOH). This is also a **Michael addition**.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Nitronate):** The protons on the carbon α to the electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic. The base, KOH, deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate), `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`). A new C-C bond is formed.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   The resulting structure is `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so its carbon is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon has six carbons.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on a careful review of the chemical reactions.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n**Reaction:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition. The ketone serves as the Michael donor after being deprotonated by the strong base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK).

The starting ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has a quaternary carbon at the C2 position, which has no alpha-protons. Therefore, the base (t-BuOK) can only deprotonate the alpha-proton at the C6 position to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the ethyl acrylate. When naming the product with the propanoate as the parent chain, the correct IUPAC name is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This structural requirement eliminated options A and C.\n3.  **Constraint for Reaction B:** The second reaction is also a Michael addition. The carbanion formed from 1-nitropropane (a 3-carbon molecule) attacks (E)-but-2-enenitrile (a 4-carbon molecule). The resulting product's main carbon chain, which includes the nitrile carbon, is six carbons long. Therefore, the product must be a derivative of hexanenitrile. The correct IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.

The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will deprotonate the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate, which then attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate).\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate (Nucleophile):** The ketone has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group), which are at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at **C2** is a quaternary carbon, as it is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has **no α-protons** and cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   The carbon at **C6** is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and a single hydrogen atom. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, the base can only abstract the proton from the C6 position. This leads to the formation of a single, specific enolate.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The nucleophilic carbon of the enolate (C6) attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:** The resulting product has an ethyl propanoate group attached to the C6 position of the original ketone. To name this compound according to the options provided, the ethyl propanoate is treated as the parent chain, and the cyclohexanone ring is a substituent.\n    *   The parent chain is **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The cyclohexyl ring is a substituent at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the ring substituent, we number it starting from the point of attachment (the original C6) as C1.\n    *   The carbonyl group (ketone) is at position C2 (oxo).\n    *   The ethyl and methyl groups are at position C3.\n    *   The original methyl group from C6 is now at C1.\n    *   This gives the substituent name: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This name appears in options C and D.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n**Reaction:** 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH as a base.\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition. The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon α to the electron-withdrawing nitro group, creating a nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:** The protons on the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) are acidic. KOH removes one of these protons to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion), `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:** A new C-C bond is formed, connecting the α-carbon of the nitropropane to the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    *   The resulting structure is `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so its carbon is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile has 6 carbons, making the parent name **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering the chain from the nitrile: `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.

Therefore, it cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   The carbon at position 6 is a tertiary carbon and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The base can only abstract the single available proton from the C6 position.

The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group): C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is a quaternary carbon, as it is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has **no α-protons** and cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   **C6** is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, the base can only abstract the single available α-proton from the **C6 position**. This leads to the formation of a single, specific enolate.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The enolate, which is nucleophilic at C6, attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Product A Naming**: The resulting product must be named correctly. The options name the product as a derivative of ethyl propanoate, which is correct as the ester functional group has higher priority than the ketone.\n    *   The parent chain is **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the ring as a substituent, the point of attachment (the original C6) is designated as C1. Numbering proceeds to give the ketone's carbonyl group the lowest possible number, which is C2.\n    *   The substituents on the ring are: a **methyl** group at C1, an **oxo** group at C2, and an **ethyl** and a **methyl** group at C3.\n    *   This gives the substituent name: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name for Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition. The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group, creating a nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation**: The protons on the carbon adjacent to the electron-withdrawing nitro group in 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) are acidic. KOH removes a proton from this carbon to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate), which acts as the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The nucleophilic carbon of the nitronate attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n\n4.  **Product B Naming**: A new C-C bond is formed. To name the product, we identify the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the nitrile, -CN).\n    *   The resulting structure is `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   The longest chain including the nitrile carbon has six carbons. Thus, the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1: `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   The full name for Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   **Product B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these correct names with the given options:\n*   A) Incorrect A, Correct B\n*   B) **Correct A, Correct B**\n*   C) Incorrect A, Incorrect B\n*   D) Correct A, Incorrect B\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies both products is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nTo determine the final answer, we must carefully analyze both chemical reactions and correctly name the resulting major products.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n**Reaction:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK as a base.\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will deprotonate the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate, which then attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate).\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation (The Nucleophile):**\n    *   The starting ketone has two alpha-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group): C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at position C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group) and has **no acidic α-protons**.\n    *   The carbon at position C6 is a tertiary carbon and has **one acidic α-proton**.\n    *   Due to the availability of only one type of α-proton, the strong base t-BuOK will exclusively deprotonate the C6 position. This regioselectivity is a key point, as it leads to a single enolate product.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is a 1,4-conjugate addition, forming a new carbon-carbon bond.\n\n4.  **Product A Structure and Naming:**\n    *   A new `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` group is attached to the C6 position of the original ketone.\n    *   To name the product according to the options, the ethyl propanoate moiety is considered the parent chain, as the ester functional group has higher priority than the ketone.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name this complex substituent, we number the ring starting from the point of attachment (the original C6) as C1.\n        *   The methyl group is on C1.\n        *   The ketone's carbonyl group (=O) is on C2 (named \"oxo\").\n        *   The ethyl and the other methyl group are on C3.\n    *   Therefore, the substituent is named **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name for Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n**Reaction:** 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH as a base.\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition. The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon alpha to the electron-withdrawing nitro group, creating a nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation:** The protons on the carbon adjacent to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) are acidic. KOH removes one of these protons to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate), `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The nucleophilic carbon of the nitronate attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n\n4.  **Product B Structure and Naming:**\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile. The resulting structure is `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so its carbon is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile group has six carbons. Thus, the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering the chain from the nitrile carbon: `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name for Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these correct names with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct A and Correct B**)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A and Incorrect B)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A)\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies both major products is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, considering the provided candidate answers and performing a careful verification of the chemical reactions.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n**Reaction:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition.

The enolate then attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester, ethyl acrylate (the Michael acceptor).\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation (Nucleophile):** The crucial first step is to identify which α-proton will be removed by the base. The ketone has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group at C1):\n    *   **C2:** This carbon is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**.\n    *   **C6:** This carbon is substituted with a methyl group and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Since C6 is the only position with an α-proton, the base will exclusively deprotonate at this position. This forms a single, specific enolate.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The nucleophilic carbon of the enolate (C6) attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n\n4.  **Product Naming:** The resulting product must be named correctly according to IUPAC rules. The ester functional group has higher priority than the ketone.\n    *   **Parent Chain:** The parent chain is the `ethyl propanoate`.\n    *   **Substituent:** The entire cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   **Numbering the Substituent:** To name the complex ring substituent, numbering starts at the point of attachment. The original C6 of the ketone is now the new C1 of the substituent.\n        *   **New C1:** Has a methyl group.\n        *   **New C2:** Is the carbonyl carbon (oxo group).\n        *   **New C3:** Has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   **Final Name for A:** Assembling the parts gives the substituent name `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.

The β-carbon is the one bonded to the methyl group.\n\n4.  **Product Naming:** The nitrile group (-CN) is the principal functional group and determines the parent chain.\n    *   **Parent Chain:** The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon is six carbons long.
