Its structure is a phenyl group (C₆H₅) attached to a propenal chain (-CH=CH-CHO).\n*   **Carbon Count of Starting Material:** The phenyl ring has 6 carbons, and the propenal chain has 3 carbons (C-C=C-O). Total carbons = 6 + 3 = **9 carbons**.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with methylmagnesium bromide (CH₃MgBr), a Grignard reagent. This reagent adds a methyl group (CH₃), which contains **1 carbon**. The reaction is a 1,2-nucleophilic addition to the aldehyde's carbonyl group.\n*   **Carbon Count of Product 1:** The initial 9 carbons plus the 1 carbon from the methyl group results in a total of **10 carbons** for Product 1 ((E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, a secondary alcohol with 10 carbons.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC), a mild oxidizing agent. PCC oxidizes a secondary alcohol to a ketone. This reaction changes the functional group but does not add or remove any carbon atoms.\n*   **Carbon Count of Product 2:** The carbon count remains unchanged. Product 2 ((E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one) has **10 carbons**.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Starting Material:** The prompt has a typo stating \"3 was treated...\". Logically, this should be \"Product 2 was treated...\". Product 2 is an α,β-unsaturated ketone with 10 carbons.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane, which is the IUPAC name for the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent. This reagent is a sulfur ylide that adds a methylene group (-CH₂-), which contains **1 carbon**.\n*   **Reaction:** With α,β-unsaturated ketones, the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent performs a conjugate addition (1,4-addition) to form a cyclopropane ring across the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Carbon Count of Product 3:** The 10 carbons of Product 2 plus the 1 carbon from the methylene group of the ylide results in a final total of **11 carbons**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe final product, Product 3, contains 11 carbon atoms.

This reaction increases the carbon count by one.\n    *   Product 1 (C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH₃) therefore has 9 + 1 = **10 carbon atoms**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 treated with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC).**\n    *   Product 1 is a secondary alcohol with 10 carbon atoms.\n    *   PCC is an oxidizing agent that converts a secondary alcohol to a ketone. This reaction does not add or remove any carbon atoms.\n    *   Product 2 (C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃) therefore still has **10 carbon atoms**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane.**\n    *   The prompt contains a typo; it should state that \"Product 2 was treated...\".\n    *   Product 2 is an α,β-unsaturated ketone with 10 carbon atoms.\n    *   The reagent, (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane, is the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent. It is a sulfur ylide that adds a single methylene group (CH₂) to the molecule. In this case, it reacts with the α,β-unsaturated ketone to form a cyclopropane ring across the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   This reaction adds one carbon atom to the structure.\n    *   Product 3 therefore has 10 + 1 = **11 carbon atoms**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe final product, Product 3, contains 11 carbon atoms. Matching this result with the given options:\nA) 10\nB) 11\nC) 12\nD) 14\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the starting material:** I will determine the number of carbon atoms in the initial reactant, trans-cinnamaldehyde.\n2.  **Analyze Step 1:** I will analyze the reaction of trans-cinnamaldehyde with methylmagnesium bromide. This is a Grignard reaction, which adds a methyl group, thus increasing the carbon count by one.\n3.  **Analyze Step 2:** I will analyze the reaction of the product from step 1 with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC). This is an oxidation reaction that converts a secondary alcohol to a ketone but does not change the number of carbon atoms.\n4.  **Analyze Step 3:** I will analyze the reaction of the product from step 2 with (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane (the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent). This reaction adds a methylene (CH₂) group to form a cyclopropane ring, increasing the carbon count by one.

With α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, 1,2-addition (to the C=O) is the typical pathway, adding one carbon from the methyl group.\n4.  **PCC Oxidation:** Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) is a mild oxidizing agent. It converts a secondary alcohol to a ketone without changing the number of carbon atoms.\n5.  **Corey-Chaykovsky Reaction:** The reagent (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane is the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent. With α,β-unsaturated ketones, it performs a conjugate addition (1,4-addition) to form a cyclopropane ring across the C=C double bond, adding one carbon atom.\n6.  **Typo in the Question:** The question states \"3 was treated...\", which is a typo.

This gives a total of 6 + 2 + 1 = **9 carbon atoms**.\n    *   **Reaction:** Methylmagnesium bromide (CH₃MgBr) is a Grignard reagent. It adds a methyl group (which contains 1 carbon) to the aldehyde's carbonyl carbon.\n    *   **Product 1:** This reaction increases the carbon count by one. Therefore, Product 1 has 9 + 1 = **10 carbon atoms**. The product is (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 treated with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Product 1 is a secondary alcohol with 10 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Reaction:** Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) is an oxidizing agent that converts a secondary alcohol into a ketone. This type of reaction does not add or remove any carbon atoms from the molecule's backbone.\n    *   **Product 2:** The carbon count remains the same. Product 2 has **10 carbon atoms**. The product is (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane**\n    *   **Starting Material:** The prompt has a typo stating \"3 was treated...\". Logically, this should be \"Product 2 was treated...\". Product 2 is an α,β-unsaturated ketone with 10 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reagent, (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane, is also known as the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent. This reagent adds a methylene group (-CH₂-), which contains 1 carbon, to the molecule. Specifically, with α,β-unsaturated ketones, it forms a cyclopropane ring across the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Product 3:** The reaction adds one carbon atom to the structure of Product 2. Therefore, the final product has 10 + 1 = **11 carbon atoms**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe final product, Product 3, contains 11 carbon atoms.
