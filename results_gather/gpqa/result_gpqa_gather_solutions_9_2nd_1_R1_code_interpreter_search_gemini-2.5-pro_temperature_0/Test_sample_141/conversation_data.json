Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the geometrical position of a given density matrix in the qubit space. For a single qubit, this space is the Bloch sphere, and the position is defined by the Bloch vector, $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$.\n\n**2. Express the Density Matrix in Matrix Form**\nThe given density matrix is:\n$\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$\n\nIn the standard computational basis, the basis states are represented as vectors:\n$\\left|0\\right\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\left|1\\right\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe outer products are projection operators:\n$\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe sum of these projectors is the identity matrix:\n$\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = I$\n\nTherefore, the density matrix simplifies to:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$\n\nThis is the density matrix for the **maximally mixed state**, which represents a state of maximum uncertainty (a 50/50 classical mixture of $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$).\n\n**3. Calculate the Bloch Vector**\nThere are two common methods to find the Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$ from the density matrix $\\rho$.\n\n*   **Method 1: Direct Comparison**\n    The general form of a single-qubit density matrix is $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$, where $\\vec{\\sigma}$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n    We can equate our specific density matrix with the general form:\n    $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n    Multiplying by 2 gives:\n    $I = I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$\n    This simplifies to $\\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = 0$. Since the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, this equation can only be true if all the coefficients are zero.\n    Thus, $r_x = 0$, $r_y = 0$, and $r_z = 0$. The Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the Trace Formula**\n    The components of the Bloch vector can be calculated using the formula $r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_k)$.\n    $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_x) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$\n    $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_y) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$\n    $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_z) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$\n    (This uses the fact that all Pauli matrices are traceless, i.e., the sum of their diagonal elements is zero).\n    Again, the result is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n**4. Conclusion and Final Answer Selection**\nBoth methods correctly show that the Bloch vector for the given density matrix is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$. This vector represents the origin, or the center, of the Bloch sphere.\n\nNow, we match this result to the given options:\nA) r=(0,0,0)\nB) r=(1,1,1)\nC) r=(0,0,1)\nD) r=(1,1,0)\n\nThe calculated vector (0,0,0) matches option A.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The expression $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|$ is the completeness relation and equals the identity matrix $I$.\n*   The state $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$ is the maximally mixed state.\n*   The geometrical position of the maximally mixed state is always at the center of the Bloch sphere, which corresponds to a Bloch vector of $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n*   All candidate answers correctly performed the calculation, but several made errors in selecting the final letter corresponding to the correct answer. The calculation is robust and the result is unambiguous.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo decide the final answer, I will analyze the provided candidate answers and the underlying physics problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the geometrical position of the density matrix $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$ in the qubit space. This position is described by the Bloch vector $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$.\n\n2.  **Express the Density Matrix in Matrix Form:**\n    *   The basis states are $|0\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $|1\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   The outer products are the projection operators onto these states:\n        *   $|0\\rangle\\langle0| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        *   $|1\\rangle\\langle1| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The sum of these outer products is the identity matrix: $|0\\rangle\\langle0| + |1\\rangle\\langle1| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = I$. This is the completeness relation for the basis.\n    *   Substituting this into the given expression for $\\rho$:\n        $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} (I) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   This state is known as the **maximally mixed state**.\n\n3.  **Relate the Density Matrix to the Bloch Vector:**\n    *   Any single-qubit density matrix can be written as $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$, where $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n    *   The components of the Bloch vector can be calculated using the formula $r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_k)$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Bloch Vector Components:**\n    *   **Method A: Direct Comparison**\n        We equate our specific density matrix with the general form:\n        $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n        Multiplying by 2 gives: $I = I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$\n        Subtracting $I$ from both sides gives: $\\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = 0$.\n        Since the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, this equation is only satisfied if all coefficients are zero: $r_x = 0, r_y = 0, r_z = 0$.\n        Therefore, $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n    *   **Method B: Using the Trace Formula**\n        *   $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_x) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$.\n        *   $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_y) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$.\n        *   $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_z) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$.\n        *   Again, the result is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Both methods unambiguously show that the Bloch vector is $(0, 0, 0)$.

This is a standard way of asking for the Bloch vector $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$ that corresponds to the density matrix $\\rho$. The Bloch vector represents the state as a point in a 3D space called the Bloch sphere.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Given Density Matrix**\nThe density matrix is given as:\n$\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$\n\n**Careful Point 1:** Recognize the completeness relation.\nIn a two-level quantum system (a qubit), the sum of the projection operators onto the basis states is the identity operator. That is:\n$\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right| = I$\nwhere $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix, $I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\rho$, we get:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\nThis state is known as the **maximally mixed state**. It represents a state with a 50% probability of being measured in state $|0\\rangle$ and a 50% probability of being measured in state $|1\\rangle$, with no defined phase relationship.\n\n**Step 3: Relate the Density Matrix to the Bloch Vector**\nAny single-qubit density matrix can be expressed in terms of its Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$ using the formula:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\nwhere $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Bloch Vector**\nWe can find the Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$ in two ways.\n\n**Method A: Direct Comparison**\nWe equate our specific density matrix with the general form:\n$\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n$I = I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$\n\nSubtracting $I$ from both sides gives:\n$0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z$\n\n**Careful Point 2:** The Pauli matrices are linearly independent. This means the only way their linear combination can equal the zero matrix is if all the coefficients are zero.\nTherefore, we must have:\n$r_x = 0$\n$r_y = 0$\n$r_z = 0$\nSo, the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n**Method B: Using the Trace Formula**\nThe components of the Bloch vector can also be calculated individually using the formula $r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_k)$.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** The trace of all Pauli matrices is zero. $\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = \\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = \\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = 0$.\n\nLet's calculate each component:\n*   $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_x) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$\n*   $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_y) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$\n*   $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_z) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$\n\nBoth methods confirm that the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n**Step 5: Match the Result to the Options**\nThe calculated geometrical position is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$. This corresponds to the origin, or the center, of the Bloch sphere.\n\nLet's check the given options:\nA) r=(1,1,1)\nB) r=(0,0,1)\nC) r=(0,0,0)\nD) r=(1,1,0)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n**Final Check:**\nThe analysis is consistent across all valid methods. The density matrix represents the maximally mixed state, which is known to be at the center of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to a Bloch vector of zero length, i.e., $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$. The calculation confirms this. The final step is to correctly map this result to the given options.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe analysis is complete.

The correct approach involves these steps:\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Density Matrix:** The given density matrix is $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$. This represents a quantum state that is an equal statistical mixture of the basis states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Convert to Matrix Form:** In the standard computational basis, the term $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|$ is the completeness relation, which is equal to the 2x2 identity matrix, $I$. Therefore, the density matrix simplifies to $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$. This is known as the **maximally mixed state**.\n\n3.  **Relate to the Bloch Vector:** Any single-qubit density matrix can be represented by a point in the Bloch sphere via the Bloch vector $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$. The relationship is given by the formula:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n    where $\\vec{\\sigma}$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Bloch Vector:** There are two common methods to find $\\vec{r}$:\n    *   **Method 1: Direct Comparison.** We equate our specific density matrix with the general form:\n        $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n        This simplifies to $\\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = 0$. Since the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, the only solution is for the vector $\\vec{r}$ to be the zero vector: $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n    *   **Method 2: Using the Trace Formula.** The components of the Bloch vector can be calculated using $r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_k)$.\n        *   $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_x) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$.\n        *   $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_y) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$.\n        *   $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_z) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}(1-1) = 0$.\n    Both methods correctly yield $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The geometrical position of the state is the origin of the Bloch sphere, represented by the vector r=(0,0,0).\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The expression $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|$ must be correctly identified as the identity matrix $I$.\n*   The relationship between the density matrix and the Bloch vector, $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$, is fundamental.\n*   The calculation, whether by comparison or using the trace formula, must be executed correctly.\n*   The final calculated vector must be correctly matched with the provided options.\n\nBased on the unanimous and correct calculation across all candidate answers, the geometrical position is r=(0,0,0).

Relate the Density Matrix to the Bloch Vector**\n\nThe geometrical position of a single-qubit state is represented by the Bloch vector, $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$, in the Bloch sphere. The relationship between the density matrix $\\rho$ and the Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$ is given by the equation:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$, where $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n\n**3. Calculate the Bloch Vector**\n\nWe can find the Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$ by equating the two expressions for $\\rho$:\n$\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 gives:\n$I = I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$\n\nSubtracting $I$ from both sides yields:\n$\\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = 0$\n\nThis equation, $r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z = 0$, can only be true if all the coefficients are zero, because the Pauli matrices are linearly independent.\nTherefore, $r_x = 0$, $r_y = 0$, and $r_z = 0$.\n\nThe resulting Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n**4. Identify the Geometrical Position**\n\nThe Bloch vector $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$ corresponds to the origin, or the exact center, of the Bloch sphere.

Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to find the geometrical position, represented by the Bloch vector $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$, for the given density matrix:\n$\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$\n\n**2. Simplify the Density Matrix**\nFirst, we express the density matrix in its matrix form. In the standard computational basis:\n*   $\\left|0\\right\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\left|1\\right\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   The outer products are projection operators:\n    *   $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   $\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\rho$:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ is the 2x2 identity matrix, $I$.\nSo, the density matrix is $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$. This is the definition of the **maximally mixed state**.\n\n**3. Relate the Density Matrix to the Bloch Vector**\nAny single-qubit density matrix can be written in terms of its Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$ as:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\nwhere $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n\n**4. Solve for the Bloch Vector**\nWe can now equate our specific density matrix with the general form:\n$\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 gives:\n$I = I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$\n\nSubtracting $I$ from both sides leaves:\n$0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$\n\nThis equation states that the linear combination of the Pauli matrices ($r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z$) must equal the zero matrix. Since the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, the only way for this to be true is if all the coefficients are zero:\n$r_x = 0$\n$r_y = 0$\n$r_z = 0$\n\nTherefore, the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n**5.

The discrepancies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) are due to inconsistent labeling of the options in their internal processing. However, the underlying physics and mathematical derivation are unanimously correct.

Based on the options provided in the problem description, the only correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Express the Density Matrix in Matrix Form**\nThe given density matrix is $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$.\nIn the standard computational basis, the basis vectors are:\n$\\left|0\\right\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\left|1\\right\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe outer products (projection operators) are:\n$\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\rho$:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis can be written as $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$, where $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix. This state is known as the **maximally mixed state**.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Density Matrix to the Bloch Vector**\nAny single-qubit density matrix can be represented by a point, the Bloch vector $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$, in a unit sphere called the Bloch sphere. The relationship is given by:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\nwhere $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Bloch Vector**\nThere are two common methods to find $\\vec{r}$.\n\n*   **Method A: Direct Comparison**\n    We equate our specific density matrix with the general form:\n    $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n    Multiplying both sides by 2 gives:\n    $I = I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$\n    Subtracting $I$ from both sides yields:\n    $\\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = 0$\n    Since the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, this equation can only be satisfied if all the coefficients are zero. Therefore, $r_x = 0$, $r_y = 0$, and $r_z = 0$.\n    The Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n*   **Method B: Using the Trace Formula**\n    The components of the Bloch vector can be calculated using the formula $r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_k)$.\n    $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_x) = \\text{Tr}\\left( \\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$\n    $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_y) = \\text{Tr}\\left( \\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$\n    $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_z) = \\text{Tr}\\left( \\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$\n    Again, we find the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n**Step 4: Match the Result to the Options**\nThe calculated geometrical position is the vector `r=(0,0,0)`.

This position is represented by the Bloch vector $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$.\n\n**2. Express the Density Matrix in Matrix Form**\nFirst, we convert the given density matrix from Dirac notation to its matrix representation.\nThe standard basis states are:\n$\\left|0\\right\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\left|1\\right\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe outer products (projection operators) are:\n$\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\rho$:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis can be written as $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$, where $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix. This state is known as the **maximally mixed state**.\n\n**3. Relate the Density Matrix to the Bloch Vector**\nAny single-qubit density matrix can be expressed using the Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$ with the formula:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$, where $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n\n**4. Calculate the Bloch Vector**\nWe can find $\\vec{r}$ by equating the two expressions for $\\rho$:\n$\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 gives:\n$I = I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$\n\nSubtracting $I$ from both sides yields:\n$\\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = 0$\n\nSince the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, this equation can only be true if all the components of the vector $\\vec{r}$ are zero.\nTherefore, $r_x = 0$, $r_y = 0$, and $r_z = 0$.\n\nThe Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n**5. Match the Result to the Options**\nThe calculated geometrical position is the vector $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating the reasoning from the candidate answers and identifying crucial points.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the geometrical position of a specific density matrix in the qubit space. For a single qubit, this space is visualized as the Bloch sphere, and the position is defined by a three-dimensional vector called the Bloch vector, $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Density Matrix:** The given density matrix is $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$.\n    The term in the parentheses, $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|$, is the completeness relation for a single-qubit system. It represents the sum of the projection operators onto the basis states and is always equal to the identity matrix, $I$.\n    *   In matrix form: $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = I$.\n    *   Therefore, the density matrix simplifies to $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$. This is the well-known **maximally mixed state**, representing a state of complete uncertainty.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Bloch Vector ($\\vec{r}$):** The relationship between any single-qubit density matrix and its Bloch vector is given by the formula:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$, where $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n\n    We can solve for $\\vec{r}$ by substituting our simplified density matrix into this equation:\n    $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n\n    Multiplying both sides by 2 gives:\n    $I = I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$\n\n    Subtracting $I$ from both sides leaves:\n    $0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$\n\n    This equation, $r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z = 0$, can only be true if all the coefficients are zero ($r_x=0, r_y=0, r_z=0$) because the Pauli matrices are linearly independent.\n\n    Thus, the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n4.  **Match the Result to the Options:** The calculated geometrical position is the vector $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$. This corresponds to the origin, or the exact center, of the Bloch sphere. We now compare this result with the given options:\n    A) r=(0,0,0)\n    B) r=(0,0,1)\n    C) r=(1,1,0)\n    D) r=(1,1,1)\n\n    The calculated vector (0,0,0) matches option A.\n\n**Careful Points**\n\n*   **Completeness Relation:** The most efficient first step is recognizing that $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right| = I$. This immediately simplifies the problem.\n*   **Maximally Mixed State:** The state $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$ is the maximally mixed state. It is a fundamental concept that this state lies at the very center of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to a Bloch vector of zero length.\n*   **Properties of Pauli Matrices:** The linear independence and traceless nature of the Pauli matrices are key properties that lead to the result. Using the trace formula $r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_k)$ is an alternative calculation method that also yields $(0,0,0)$ because all Pauli matrices are traceless.\n*   **Matching the Final Answer:** As observed in the candidate answers, the most common source of error is not in the calculation but in correctly matching the numerical result to the lettered options.

This is the completeness relation for the basis.\n    *   Substituting this into the given expression for $\\rho$:\n        $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} (I) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   This state is known as the **maximally mixed state**.\n\n3.  **Relate the Density Matrix to the Bloch Vector:**\n    *   Any single-qubit density matrix can be written as $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$, where $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n    *   The components of the Bloch vector can be calculated using the formula $r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_k)$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Bloch Vector Components:**\n    *   **Method A: Direct Comparison**\n        We equate our specific density matrix with the general form:\n        $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n        Multiplying by 2 gives: $I = I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$\n        Subtracting $I$ from both sides gives: $\\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = 0$.\n        Since the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, this equation is only satisfied if all coefficients are zero: $r_x = 0, r_y = 0, r_z = 0$.\n        Therefore, $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n    *   **Method B: Using the Trace Formula**\n        *   $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_x) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$.\n        *   $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_y) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$.\n        *   $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_z) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$.\n        *   Again, the result is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Both methods unambiguously show that the Bloch vector is $(0, 0, 0)$. This vector represents the origin, or the center, of the Bloch sphere.\n\n### Analysis of Candidate Answers\nAll 15 candidate answers correctly perform the calculation and find that the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.

This is a standard way of asking for the Bloch vector $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$ that corresponds to the density matrix $\\rho$. The Bloch vector represents the state as a point in a 3D space called the Bloch sphere.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Given Density Matrix**\nThe density matrix is given as:\n$\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$\n\n**Careful Point 1:** Recognize the completeness relation.\nIn a two-level quantum system (a qubit), the sum of the projection operators onto the basis states is the identity operator. That is:\n$\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right| = I$\nwhere $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix, $I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\rho$, we get:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\nThis state is known as the **maximally mixed state**. It represents a state with a 50% probability of being measured in state $|0\\rangle$ and a 50% probability of being measured in state $|1\\rangle$, with no defined phase relationship.\n\n**Step 3: Relate the Density Matrix to the Bloch Vector**\nAny single-qubit density matrix can be expressed in terms of its Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$ using the formula:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\nwhere $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Bloch Vector**\nWe can find the Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$ in two ways.\n\n**Method A: Direct Comparison**\nWe equate our specific density matrix with the general form:\n$\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n$I = I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$\n\nSubtracting $I$ from both sides gives:\n$0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z$\n\n**Careful Point 2:** The Pauli matrices are linearly independent. This means the only way their linear combination can equal the zero matrix is if all the coefficients are zero.\nTherefore, we must have:\n$r_x = 0$\n$r_y = 0$\n$r_z = 0$\nSo, the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n**Method B: Using the Trace Formula**\nThe components of the Bloch vector can also be calculated individually using the formula $r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_k)$.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** The trace of all Pauli matrices is zero. $\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = \\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = \\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = 0$.\n\nLet's calculate each component:\n*   $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_x) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$\n*   $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_y) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$\n*   $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_z) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$\n\nBoth methods confirm that the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n**Step 5: Match the Result to the Options**\nThe calculated geometrical position is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$. This corresponds to the origin, or the center, of the Bloch sphere.\n\nLet's check the given options:\nA) r=(1,1,1)\nB) r=(0,0,1)\nC) r=(0,0,0)\nD) r=(1,1,0)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n**Final Check:**\nThe analysis is consistent across all valid methods. The density matrix represents the maximally mixed state, which is known to be at the center of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to a Bloch vector of zero length, i.e., $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$. The calculation confirms this. The final step is to correctly map this result to the given options.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe analysis is complete. The provided density matrix is $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$, which simplifies to $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$, the maximally mixed state.\n\nThe geometrical position in the qubit space is given by the Bloch vector $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$, where the components are calculated by $r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_k)$.\n\nAs derived in the thinking process and confirmed by the code execution:\n*   $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = 0$\n*   $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = 0$\n*   $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = 0$\n\nThe resulting Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$. This corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) r=(1,1,0)\nB) r=(1,1,1)\nC) r=(0,0,1)\nD) r=(0,0,0)\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to find the geometrical position of the density matrix $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$ in the qubit space. This position is represented by the Bloch vector $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$.\n\n**2. Express the Density Matrix in Matrix Form**\nFirst, we convert the given density matrix from Dirac notation to its matrix representation.\n*   The basis states are: $\\left|0\\right\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\left|1\\right\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n*   The outer products (projection operators) are:\n    *   $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   $\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   Substituting these into the expression for $\\rho$:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   This is equivalent to $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$, where $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix. This state is known as the **maximally mixed state**.\n\n**3. Relate the Density Matrix to the Bloch Vector**\nAny single-qubit density matrix can be expressed using the Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$ with the formula:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$, where $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n\n**4. Calculate the Bloch Vector**\nThere are two common methods to find $\\vec{r}$.\n\n*   **Method A: Direct Comparison**\n    We equate our specific density matrix with the general form:\n    $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n    Multiplying both sides by 2 gives:\n    $I = I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$\n    Subtracting $I$ from both sides leaves:\n    $\\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = 0$\n    Since the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, this equation can only be true if all the coefficients $r_x, r_y, r_z$ are zero.\n    Therefore, $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n*   **Method B: Using the Trace Formula**\n    The components of the Bloch vector can be calculated individually using the formula $r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_k)$.\n    *   $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_x) = \\text{Tr}\\left( \\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$\n    *   $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_y) = \\text{Tr}\\left( \\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$\n    *   $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_z) = \\text{Tr}\\left( \\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$\n    This also gives the result $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion and Careful Points**\n*   **Calculation:** The unanimous conclusion from all candidate answers and our own analysis is that the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$. This represents the center of the Bloch sphere.\n*   **Matching to Options:** The most critical step is to match this result to the options provided in the question.\n    *   A) r=(0,0,0)\n    *   B) r=(1,1,1)\n    *   C) r=(0,0,1)\n    *   D) r=(1,1,0)\n*   The calculated vector (0,0,0) directly matches option A. Many of the candidate answers performed the calculation correctly but failed at this final matching step, likely due to re-ordering the options.\n\nThe correct geometrical position is r=(0,0,0).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nAn analysis of the provided answers reveals a unanimous consensus on the calculation, despite some discrepancies in the final letter choice due to apparent variations in the option listings they were working with.

Therefore, the density matrix simplifies to $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$. This is known as the **maximally mixed state**.\n\n3.  **Relate to the Bloch Vector:** Any single-qubit density matrix can be represented by a point in the Bloch sphere via the Bloch vector $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$. The relationship is given by the formula:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n    where $\\vec{\\sigma}$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Bloch Vector:** There are two common methods to find $\\vec{r}$:\n    *   **Method 1: Direct Comparison.** We equate our specific density matrix with the general form:\n        $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n        This simplifies to $\\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = 0$. Since the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, the only solution is for the vector $\\vec{r}$ to be the zero vector: $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n    *   **Method 2: Using the Trace Formula.** The components of the Bloch vector can be calculated using $r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_k)$.\n        *   $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_x) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$.\n        *   $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_y) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$.\n        *   $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_z) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}(1-1) = 0$.\n    Both methods correctly yield $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The geometrical position of the state is the origin of the Bloch sphere, represented by the vector r=(0,0,0).\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The expression $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|$ must be correctly identified as the identity matrix $I$.\n*   The relationship between the density matrix and the Bloch vector, $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$, is fundamental.\n*   The calculation, whether by comparison or using the trace formula, must be executed correctly.\n*   The final calculated vector must be correctly matched with the provided options.\n\nBased on the unanimous and correct calculation across all candidate answers, the geometrical position is r=(0,0,0).

Relate the Density Matrix to the Bloch Vector**\n\nThe geometrical position of a single-qubit state is represented by the Bloch vector, $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$, in the Bloch sphere. The relationship between the density matrix $\\rho$ and the Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$ is given by the equation:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$, where $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n\n**3. Calculate the Bloch Vector**\n\nWe can find the Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$ by equating the two expressions for $\\rho$:\n$\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 gives:\n$I = I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$\n\nSubtracting $I$ from both sides yields:\n$\\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = 0$\n\nThis equation, $r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z = 0$, can only be true if all the coefficients are zero, because the Pauli matrices are linearly independent.\nTherefore, $r_x = 0$, $r_y = 0$, and $r_z = 0$.\n\nThe resulting Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n**4. Identify the Geometrical Position**\n\nThe Bloch vector $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$ corresponds to the origin, or the exact center, of the Bloch sphere. This is the well-known position for the maximally mixed state.\n\n**5. Match with the Given Options**\n\nThe calculated geometrical position is the vector r=(0,0,0). Comparing this with the provided options:\nA) r=(1,1,1)\nB) r=(0,0,1)\nC) r=(0,0,0)\nD) r=(1,1,0)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n**Careful Points and Analysis of Candidate Answers:**\n*   All candidate answers correctly calculated the Bloch vector to be (0,0,0).\n*   The primary source of error in the candidate answers was incorrectly matching the calculated vector to the lettered options. Several candidates seemed to be working from a shuffled list of options, leading them to select an incorrect letter (A, B, or D) despite having the correct numerical result.\n*   The physics and mathematics are unambiguous: the density matrix $\\frac{1}{2}I$ corresponds to the Bloch vector $(0,0,0)$, which is the center of the Bloch sphere.\n\nBased on a correct calculation and proper matching with the provided options, the final answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to find the geometrical position, represented by the Bloch vector $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$, for the given density matrix:\n$\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$\n\n**2. Simplify the Density Matrix**\nFirst, we express the density matrix in its matrix form. In the standard computational basis:\n*   $\\left|0\\right\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\left|1\\right\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   The outer products are projection operators:\n    *   $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   $\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\rho$:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ is the 2x2 identity matrix, $I$.\nSo, the density matrix is $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$. This is the definition of the **maximally mixed state**.\n\n**3. Relate the Density Matrix to the Bloch Vector**\nAny single-qubit density matrix can be written in terms of its Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$ as:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\nwhere $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n\n**4. Solve for the Bloch Vector**\nWe can now equate our specific density matrix with the general form:\n$\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 gives:\n$I = I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$\n\nSubtracting $I$ from both sides leaves:\n$0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$\n\nThis equation states that the linear combination of the Pauli matrices ($r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z$) must equal the zero matrix. Since the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, the only way for this to be true is if all the coefficients are zero:\n$r_x = 0$\n$r_y = 0$\n$r_z = 0$\n\nTherefore, the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n**5. Match with the Options**\nThe calculated geometrical position is $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$. We compare this with the given options:\nA) r=(0,0,1)\nB) r=(1,1,1)\nC) r=(0,0,0)\nD) r=(1,1,0)\n\nThe result matches option C.\n\n**Analysis of Candidate Answers**\nAll candidate answers correctly perform the calculation and arrive at the result $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$. The discrepancies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) are due to inconsistent labeling of the options in their internal processing. However, the underlying physics and mathematical derivation are unanimously correct. The maximally mixed state corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere, which is the origin point (0,0,0).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1.

Calculate the Bloch Vector**\nWe can find $\\vec{r}$ by equating the two expressions for $\\rho$:\n$\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 gives:\n$I = I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$\n\nSubtracting $I$ from both sides yields:\n$\\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = 0$\n\nSince the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, this equation can only be true if all the components of the vector $\\vec{r}$ are zero.\nTherefore, $r_x = 0$, $r_y = 0$, and $r_z = 0$.\n\nThe Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n**5.

The underlying physics and mathematical steps are unanimously agreed upon.\n*   **Mapping to Options:** The primary source of error among the candidates is incorrectly mapping the calculated vector (0,0,0) to the lettered choices. Several answers either misread the options or used a different ordering.\n*   **Conclusion:** The state $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$ is the maximally mixed state, which by definition is located at the center of the Bloch sphere. The center of the sphere corresponds to a Bloch vector of zero length, which is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo decide the final answer, I will analyze the problem step-by-step, highlighting the key calculations and concepts.\n\n**Step 1: Express the Density Matrix in Matrix Form**\nThe given density matrix is $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$.\nIn the standard computational basis, the basis states are represented as vectors:\n$|0\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $|1\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe term $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|$ is the completeness relation for a single-qubit system, which is equal to the 2x2 identity matrix, $I$.\n$\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = I$.\n\nTherefore, the density matrix simplifies to:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$.\nThis is the density matrix for the **maximally mixed state**.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Density Matrix to the Bloch Vector**\nAny single-qubit density matrix can be represented by a point in the Bloch sphere using the Bloch vector $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$. The relationship is given by:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$, where $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Bloch Vector**\nWe can find the Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$ by equating the two expressions for $\\rho$.\n\n**Method A: Direct Comparison**\n$\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\nMultiplying both sides by 2 gives:\n$I = I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$\nSubtracting $I$ from both sides yields:\n$\\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = 0$\nSince the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, this equation can only be true if all the coefficients are zero: $r_x = 0$, $r_y = 0$, and $r_z = 0$.\nThus, the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n**Method B: Using the Trace Formula**\nThe components of the Bloch vector can also be calculated using the formula $r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_k)$.\n*   $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_x) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$.\n*   $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_y) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$.\n*   $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_z) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$.\nBoth methods confirm that the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n**Step 4: Match the Result with the Options**\nThe calculated geometrical position is the vector r=(0,0,0). This corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere. Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) r=(1,1,1)\nB) r=(0,0,1)\nC) r=(0,0,0)\nD) r=(1,1,0)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n**Analysis of Candidate Answers**\nA vast majority of the provided answers correctly calculate the Bloch vector as (0,0,0). However, several of them incorrectly map this result to the final letter choice (e.g., selecting D, B, or A). This indicates a likely confusion with the ordering of the options. The answers that correctly perform the calculation and select the right option letter are the most reliable.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The expression $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|$ must be correctly identified as the identity matrix $I$.\n*   The relationship between the density matrix and the Bloch vector, $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$, must be known.\n*   The calculation of the Bloch vector components, whether by direct comparison or using the trace formula, must be performed accurately. The fact that all Pauli matrices are traceless is a key property here.\n*   The final calculated vector must be correctly matched to the corresponding option letter from the question.\n\nThe consistent result from the correct physical and mathematical analysis is that the Bloch vector is (0,0,0).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
