In water, these salts dissociate to form a buffer solution composed of the weak acid H₂PO₄⁻ (dihydrogen phosphate) and its conjugate base HPO₄²⁻ (hydrogen phosphate).\n\n2.  **Calculate Moles of Buffer Components:**\n    *   **Moles of H₂PO₄⁻** (from KH₂PO₄):\n        *   Mass = 1.00 g\n        *   Molar Mass = 136.09 g/mol\n        *   Moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   **Moles of HPO₄²⁻** (from Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O):\n        *   Mass = 1.00 g\n        *   Molar Mass = 177.99 g/mol\n        *   Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n3.  **Calculate Initial Concentrations:**\n    *   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which must be converted to liters: 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L.\n    *   **[H₂PO₄⁻]** = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   **[HPO₄²⁻]** = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n4.  **Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]:**\n    *   The pH of the buffer is controlled by the equilibrium between the acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻). This corresponds to the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, governed by Ka₂.\n    *   Equilibrium: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   Equilibrium expression: Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   Rearranging to solve for [H⁺]:\n        [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n        [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n        [H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n5.  **Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]:**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed in the third dissociation step, which is the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻.

Together, they form a buffer solution.\n\n**3. Outline the Calculation Strategy**\nThis is a two-step equilibrium problem:\n*   **Step A:** The primary equilibrium is between the buffer components H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻. This equilibrium, governed by the second acid dissociation constant (Ka₂), determines the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] of the solution.\n*   **Step B:** The secondary equilibrium is the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻ into H⁺ and the orthophosphate ion, PO₄³⁻.

This requires a two-step equilibrium calculation.\n\n1.  **Establish the primary buffer equilibrium:** The solution contains significant amounts of dihydrogen phosphate (H₂PO₄⁻, from KH₂PO₄) and hydrogen phosphate (HPO₄²⁻, from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O). These form a buffer system governed by the second dissociation constant of phosphoric acid, Ka₂.\n    *   H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ (Equilibrium constant = Ka₂)\n\n2.  **Establish the secondary equilibrium:** The target ion, orthophosphate (PO₄³⁻), is formed from the dissociation of hydrogen phosphate (HPO₄²⁻). This is governed by the third dissociation constant, Ka₃.\n    *   HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻ (Equilibrium constant = Ka₃)\n\nThe strategy is to first use the primary buffer equilibrium to find the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺], and then use that [H⁺] in the second equilibrium equation to solve for [PO₄³⁻].\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**1. Calculate Moles and Concentrations of Buffer Components:**\n*   Volume of solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L\n*   Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄) = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n*   Moles of HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O) = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n*   Initial concentration [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n*   Initial concentration [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**2. Calculate the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]:**\nUsing the equilibrium expression for Ka₂:\nKa₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\nRearranging to solve for [H⁺]:\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n[H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**3. Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]:**\nUsing the equilibrium expression for Ka₃:\nKa₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\nRearranging to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\nWe use the initial concentration of [HPO₄²⁻] and the calculated [H⁺]. This is a valid assumption because the very small value of Ka₃ means a negligible amount of HPO₄²⁻ will dissociate.\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Molar Mass:** It is essential to use the molar mass of the hydrated salt (Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O), which is 177.99 g/mol.\n*   **Correct Ka Values:** The calculation correctly uses Ka₂ to find the [H⁺] of the main buffer and then uses Ka₃ to find the concentration of the minor species, PO₄³⁻.\n*   **Numerical Accuracy:** The calculation yields a result of approximately 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n*   **Option Matching:** The calculated value, 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M, corresponds directly to option B. Many of the candidate answers performed the calculation correctly but failed to match the result to the correct letter option from the prompt.\n\nThe analysis confirms that the concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
