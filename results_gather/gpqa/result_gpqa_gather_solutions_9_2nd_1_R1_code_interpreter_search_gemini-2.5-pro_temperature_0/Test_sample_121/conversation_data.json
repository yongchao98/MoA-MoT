One hydrogen on the α-carbon is replaced by bromine.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Product 1 + Ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH), H₂SO₄ → Product 2:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid is converted to an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Product 2 + Sodium cyanide (NaCN) → Product 3:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2). The cyanide ion displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Product 3 + excess NaH + 1,5-dibromopentane → Product 4:** This is a tandem alkylation and cyclization reaction.\n    *   First, the strong base NaH removes an acidic proton from the α-carbon (the CH₂ between the -CN and -COOEt groups).\n    *   The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule.\n    *   The excess NaH removes the second α-proton.\n    *   The new carbanion undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the carbon chain to form a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4\n\nThe core of the question is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals for **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**. The key to this analysis is understanding the molecule's symmetry and how it affects chemical equivalence.\n\nThe structure is a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents (-CN and -COOCH₂CH₃) on the same carbon (C1).\n\nThere are two main ways to analyze this, leading to different answers. The prompt's parenthetical note, \"(...the desired answer is the number of chemically distinct hydrogens)\", suggests a rigorous approach is needed.\n\n**Analysis Method 1: The \"Effective Symmetry\" Model (Most Common Textbook Approach)**\n\nThis model assumes that at room temperature, due to rapid chair-flipping, the molecule has an *effective* plane of symmetry passing through C1 and C4. This is a common simplification for such problems.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are rendered enantiotopic by the effective symmetry plane. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, they are chemically equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The symmetry plane makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The axial and equatorial protons on C2 are diastereotopic (chemically distinct). The symmetry makes the two axial protons (on C2 and C6) equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons equivalent to each other. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these carbons give **2 signals** (one for the axials, one for the equatorials).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the symmetry plane. Its axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Count (Method 1):** 2 (from ethyl) + 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) = **8 signals**.\n\n**Analysis Method 2: The \"Strictly Asymmetric\" Model**\n\nThis model recognizes that since the two substituents on C1 are different, the molecule is chiral and has no plane of symmetry.\n\n1.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   With no symmetry, C2 is not equivalent to C6, and C3 is not equivalent to C5. All five CH₂ groups on the ring are in unique environments.\n    *   On each of these five unique CH₂ groups, the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic.\n    *   This means all 10 protons on the ring are chemically distinct. **(10 signals)**\n\n2.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are in a chiral molecule, making them diastereotopic and chemically distinct. **(2 signals)**\n\n*   **Total Count (Strictly Rigorous):** 10 (ring) + 1 (CH₃) + 2 (CH₂)= **13 signals**. This is not an option.\n*   **Total Count (with simplification):** If we apply the common simplification of treating the ethyl CH₂ protons as equivalent, we get: 10 (ring) + 1 (CH₃) + 1 (CH₂) = **12 signals**. This matches option B.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have two plausible interpretations leading to answers provided in the options: 8 and 12.\n*   The path to **8 signals** uses a standard textbook simplification (the \"effective symmetry\" model) and applies it consistently.\n*   The path to **12 signals** is more rigorous about the ring's asymmetry but then makes an inconsistent simplification for the ethyl group to match an answer choice.\n\nThe \"effective symmetry\" model (leading to 8 signals) is a very common and self-consistent way such problems are treated in academic settings. The overwhelming consensus of the provided agent answers also points to 8. This suggests it is the intended answer.\n\nFinal Count:\n*   Ethyl -CH₃: 1 signal\n*   Ethyl -OCH₂-: 1 signal\n*   Ring C2/C6 axial H's: 1 signal\n*   Ring C2/C6 equatorial H's: 1 signal\n*   Ring C3/C5 axial H's: 1 signal\n*   Ring C3/C5 equatorial H's: 1 signal\n*   Ring C4 axial H: 1 signal\n*   Ring C4 equatorial H: 1 signal\n*   **Total: 8 signals**\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe synthesis proceeds through four distinct steps:\n\n1.  **Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride.** This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid, a variant of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. The α-carbon of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is brominated.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Product 1 is heated with ethanol and sulfuric acid.** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid group reacts with ethanol to form an ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide.** This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Product 3 is treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane.** This is a tandem reaction involving deprotonation, alkylation, and cyclization.\n    *   First, the strong base (NaH) removes an acidic proton from the carbon atom situated between the two electron-withdrawing groups (-CN and -COOEt).\n    *   The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule.\n    *   The use of *excess* NaH ensures that the second, and now only, proton on that α-carbon is also removed.\n    *   This new carbanion undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentane chain to form a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe core of the question is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires an analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃), attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** For determining the number of signals in an NMR spectrum, we consider the time-averaged structure at room temperature. The cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This rapid flipping creates an effective plane of symmetry that passes through C1, the two substituents, and the opposite carbon, C4.\n\n*   **Counting the Distinct Signals:** Protons that can be interchanged by this plane of symmetry are chemically equivalent. Protons that cannot be interchanged are chemically distinct.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are related by the molecule's plane of symmetry. This makes them enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent and give a single signal. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes the carbons C2 and C6 equivalent. It also makes C3 and C5 equivalent. C4 is unique as it lies on the plane.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** On any single carbon (like C2), the axial and equatorial protons are in different spatial environments. They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. Because C2 and C6 are equivalent by symmetry, the two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial-like protons are equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** from these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons give rise to **2 distinct signals** (one for the two axial-like protons, one for the two equatorial-like protons).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** The two protons on C4 are also diastereotopic. One is axial-like and one is equatorial-like, and they are not interchangeable. Therefore, they are chemically distinct. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Total from cyclohexane ring = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Step 3: Final Calculation**\n\nBy summing the distinct signals from all parts of the molecule, we get:\n*   Signals from ethyl group: 2\n*   Signals from cyclohexane ring: 6\n*   **Total distinct signals = 2 + 6 = 8**\n\nThis analysis, which assumes rapid ring-flipping and correctly applies the principles of stereotopicity, is the standard and most chemically sound approach for this type of problem. It leads directly to the answer of 8 distinct signals.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis task requires a two-part analysis: first, determining the structure of the final product from a multi-step synthesis, and second, analyzing that structure to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms for its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Trace the Reaction Sequence:** I will follow the four reaction steps to identify the structure of the final product, Product 4.\n2.  **Analyze Product 4 for Symmetry:** I will examine the structure of Product 4 to determine its symmetry elements. The number of distinct hydrogen signals depends on which protons are chemically equivalent and which are not.\n3.  **Count Distinct Proton Environments:** Based on the symmetry analysis, I will count every set of chemically non-equivalent protons. This count will be the answer to the question.\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script that outlines the counting logic and prints the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Execution:\n\n1.  **Step 1 -> Product 1:** Acetic acid undergoes alpha-bromination (a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky type reaction) to yield **bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)**.\n2.  **Step 2 -> Product 2:** Bromoacetic acid undergoes Fischer esterification with ethanol to yield **ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n3.  **Step 3 -> Product 3:** Ethyl bromoacetate undergoes an Sₙ2 reaction with sodium cyanide, where the cyanide ion displaces the bromide, yielding **ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n4.  **Step 4 -> Product 4:** Ethyl cyanoacetate has acidic α-protons. The strong base (NaH) removes one proton, and the resulting carbanion attacks the 1,5-dibromopentane. The excess NaH removes the second α-proton, and the new carbanion performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction to form a six-membered ring. The final product is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### ¹H NMR Analysis of Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate:\n\nThe key to counting the signals is to analyze the molecule's symmetry. At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. This creates a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through the substituted carbon (C1), the opposite carbon (C4), and the two substituents on C1.\n\nBased on this symmetry:\n*   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal **-CH₃** group are equivalent. (1 signal)\n    *   The two protons of the **-OCH₂-** group are enantiotopic due to the plane of symmetry. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, they are chemically equivalent. (1 signal)\n*   **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5.\n    *   **C2/C6 Protons:** The axial and equatorial protons on C2 are diastereotopic (not interchangeable by symmetry). The same is true for C6. The symmetry makes the two axial protons (on C2 and C6) equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons equivalent to each other. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **C3/C5 Protons:** The same logic applies. The two axial protons are one set, and the two equatorial protons are another. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **C4 Protons:** The two protons on C4 are also diastereotopic and are not equivalent to each other. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n**Total Signal Count:**\n*   Ethyl group signals: 1 + 1 = 2\n*   Cyclohexane ring signals: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6\n*   **Total = 2 + 6 = 8 signals**\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1.

To determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry and the chemical equivalence of its protons. The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens, which requires careful consideration of stereochemistry.\n\nThere are two main, chemically sound ways to analyze this molecule that lead to one of the given answers.\n\n**Method 1: Locked Conformation with Assumed Symmetry (Common Textbook Approach)**\n\n1.  **Conformation:** Assume the cyclohexane ring is \"locked\" in a single chair conformation due to the bulky substituents. In this state, axial (ax) and equatorial (eq) protons are chemically distinct.\n2.  **Symmetry:** Assume a simplified model with a plane of symmetry passing through C1 and C4. This makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5.\n3.  **Counting Signals:**\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three -CH₃ protons are equivalent. (1 signal)\n        *   The two -OCH₂- protons are treated as equivalent (a common simplification). (1 signal)\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n        *   **C2/C6 Protons:** The two axial protons are equivalent, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent. This gives 2 signals (H-ax, H-eq).\n        *   **C3/C5 Protons:** Similarly, this gives 2 signals (H-ax, H-eq).\n        *   **C4 Protons:** The axial and equatorial protons are distinct. This gives 2 signals (H-ax, H-eq).\n    *   **Total:** 2 (from ethyl) + 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) = **8 signals**.\n\n**Method 2: Rapid Flipping with No Symmetry**\n\n1.  **Conformation:** Assume the ring is rapidly flipping at room temperature, which averages the axial and equatorial positions for any given carbon.\n2.  **Symmetry:** The two substituents on C1 (-CN and -COOEt) are different, so the molecule is chiral and has no plane of symmetry. Therefore, C2 is not equivalent to C6, and C3 is not equivalent to C5.\n3.  **Counting Signals:**\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three -CH₃ protons are equivalent. (1 signal)\n        *   The two -OCH₂- protons are in a chiral molecule, making them diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. (2 signals)\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n        *   The protons on C2 are averaged by flipping to give one signal.\n        *   The protons on C6 are in a different environment from C2 and give a second signal.\n        *   The protons on C3 give a third signal.\n        *   The protons on C5 give a fourth signal.\n        *   The protons on C4 give a fifth signal.\n        *   This gives a total of 5 signals from the ring.\n    *   **Total:** 3 (from ethyl) + 5 (from ring) = **8 signals**.\n\nBoth plausible analysis methods converge on the same answer. The overwhelming consensus among the provided candidate answers also points to 8 signals.\n\nFinal Count:\n*   Ethyl group: 2 signals (CH₃ and CH₂)\n*   Cyclohexane ring: 6 signals (C2-ax/eq, C3-ax/eq, C4-ax/eq, with C2=C6 and C3=C5)\n*   Total = 2 + 6 = 8\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\n1.  **Acetic acid + Br₂, pyridine, acetic anhydride → Product 1:** This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid, a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) type reaction. The α-carbon of acetic acid is brominated.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)\n\n2.  **Product 1 + ethanol, H₂SO₄ → Product 2:** This is a Fischer esterification.

The cyanide ion (CN⁻) displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n4.  **Product 3 + excess NaH + 1,5-dibromopentane → Product 4:** This is a tandem reaction involving deprotonation, alkylation, and cyclization.\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, removes a proton from the acidic α-carbon (the CH₂ group between the -CN and -COOEt groups).\n    *   The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule.\n    *   The use of *excess* NaH ensures that the second α-proton is also removed from the intermediate.\n    *   The new carbanion undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain to form a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. The number of distinct environments corresponds to the number of signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe structure is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\nTo count the signals, we must consider the molecule's symmetry. At room temperature, cyclohexane rings undergo rapid chair-chair interconversion. This rapid flipping creates a time-averaged structure that possesses a plane of symmetry.

This requires an analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with two different substituents (a cyano group, -CN, and an ethoxycarbonyl group, -COOCH₂CH₃) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** At room temperature, cyclohexane rings undergo rapid chair-chair interconversion. This rapid flipping creates a *time-averaged* plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group. Protons that are equivalent under this symmetry will produce a single signal. Protons that are not interchangeable are chemically distinct.\n\nLet's count the distinct proton environments based on this symmetry:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are related by the molecule's plane of symmetry. This makes them *enantiotopic*. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent and give a single signal. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes the carbons on one side of the ring equivalent to the carbons on the other side (i.e., C2 is equivalent to C6, and C3 is equivalent to C5).\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** In any given chair conformation, the two protons on C2 (one axial, one equatorial) are *diastereotopic* and thus chemically distinct. The plane of symmetry makes the axial proton on C2 equivalent to the axial proton on C6, and the equatorial proton on C2 equivalent to the equatorial proton on C6. This results in **2 distinct signals** for these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons also give **2 distinct signals** (one for the two axial protons, one for the two equatorial protons).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** Carbon 4 lies on the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons attached to it (one axial, one equatorial) are *diastereotopic*. They are in different chemical environments relative to the rest of the molecule and are not interchangeable. Therefore, they give **2 distinct signals**.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Signals**\n\nSumming the distinct environments:\n*   From the ethyl group: 1 (CH₃) + 1 (CH₂) = 2 signals\n*   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = 6 signals\n*   **Total = 2 + 6 = 8 distinct hydrogen signals.**\n\nThis analysis, which is the most common and chemically sound for this type of molecule under standard NMR conditions, leads to 8 signals. This corresponds to option A. While other interpretations exist (e.g., assuming a locked, asymmetric conformation leading to 12 signals, or oversimplifying symmetry leading to 5 signals), the analysis yielding 8 signals correctly balances the concepts of time-averaged symmetry and diastereotopicity.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1.

NaH, a strong base, removes an acidic proton from the carbon between the -CN and -COOEt groups.\n        2.  The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        3.  The excess NaH removes the second acidic proton from the same carbon.\n        4.  The new carbanion performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 attack on the other end of the pentane chain, forming a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe core of the question is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. The key to this is analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with two different substituents (-CN and -COOCH₂CH₃) on the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** Because the two substituents on C1 are different, the molecule lacks a true plane of symmetry and is chiral. However, in the context of typical NMR problems, there are two common ways to analyze such a system, both of which lead to the same answer.\n\n**Method A: The \"Pseudo-Symmetry\" Model (Most Common Textbook Approach)**\n\nThis model assumes an \"effective\" plane of symmetry passing through C1 and C4 of the ring. This simplifies the analysis while still accounting for the most important distinctions.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are rendered enantiotopic by the pseudo-plane of symmetry. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, they are chemically equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   The pseudo-symmetry makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The axial and equatorial protons on these carbons are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. The two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent to each other. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** Similarly, the four protons on these two carbons give **2 signals** (one for the two axial H's, one for the two equatorial H's).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** The axial and equatorial protons on C4 are diastereotopic and thus non-equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Count (Method A):** 2 (from ethyl) + 6 (from ring) = **8 signals**.\n\n**Method B: The \"Chiral, Rapid-Flipping\" Model**\n\nThis model correctly identifies the molecule as chiral (no symmetry) and considers the effect of rapid chair-flipping at room temperature.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n    *   Because the molecule is chiral, the two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are diastereotopic and chemically distinct. **(2 signals)**\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   Because there is no symmetry, C2 is not equivalent to C6, and C3 is not equivalent to C5. All five methylene groups (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are in unique chemical environments.\n    *   Rapid chair-flipping averages the signals of the axial and equatorial protons on each carbon. Therefore, each of the five unique CH₂ groups gives one time-averaged signal. This gives **5 signals** from the ring.\n\n*   **Total Count (Method B):** 3 (from ethyl) + 5 (from ring) = **8 signals**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBoth plausible chemical models for analyzing the molecule's ¹H NMR spectrum converge on the same answer: 8 distinct hydrogen signals. The analysis leading to 5 signals is an oversimplification, and the analysis leading to 12 signals relies on inconsistent assumptions. Therefore, 8 is the most chemically sound answer among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n**1.

This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies.

Determine the Structure of the Final Product**\n\nThe reaction sequence is a standard multi-step synthesis in organic chemistry.\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid → Bromoacetic acid (Product 1).** This is an α-bromination reaction, a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction.\n2.  **Step 2: Bromoacetic acid → Ethyl bromoacetate (Product 2).** This is a Fischer esterification, converting the carboxylic acid to an ethyl ester.\n3.  **Step 3: Ethyl bromoacetate → Ethyl cyanoacetate (Product 3).** This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) where a cyanide ion replaces the bromide.\n4.  **Step 4: Ethyl cyanoacetate → Final Product (4).** This is a tandem reaction. The acidic α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate is deprotonated by the strong base sodium hydride (NaH). The resulting carbanion attacks one end of 1,5-dibromopentane. The use of *excess* NaH ensures the second α-proton is also removed, and the resulting carbanion performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, closing a six-membered ring.\n\nThe final product (4) is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### **2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of the Final Product**\n\nThe key to this problem is to correctly determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in the final product. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n**Structure and Symmetry:**\nThe final product has a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃), attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n*   **Chirality:** Because the two substituents on C1 are different, C1 is a chiral center. A molecule with a single chiral center is chiral and therefore lacks any plane of symmetry.\n*   **Consequences of Chirality:** In a chiral molecule, protons that are not related by simple bond rotation are chemically distinct. This has important implications for the ¹H NMR spectrum at room temperature:\n    1.  The two sides of the cyclohexane ring are not equivalent (i.e., the environment of C2 is different from C6, and C3 is different from C5).\n    2.  The two protons on the methylene group of the ethyl ester (-OCH₂-) are **diastereotopic** and thus chemically non-equivalent.\n\n**Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Signals (at Room Temperature):**\nWe assume a standard room-temperature spectrum where the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping.

This requires an analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with two different substituents, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃), attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This rapid flipping creates a time-averaged structure. For the purpose of counting signals, we can consider a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, the two substituents, and the opposite carbon, C4. Protons that can be interchanged through this symmetry plane are equivalent. Protons that cannot are distinct. We must also consider that protons on the same carbon can be distinct (diastereotopic).\n\nLet's count the distinct proton environments based on this model:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are rendered enantiotopic by the molecular plane of symmetry. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent and give a single signal. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes the ring positions C2 and C6 equivalent. Likewise, C3 and C5 are equivalent. C4 is unique.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The two protons on C2 (one axial, one equatorial in any given chair conformation) are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. The same is true for C6. Because C2 and C6 are equivalent by symmetry, the two axial protons (H₂-ax and H₆-ax) form one set, and the two equatorial protons (H₂-eq and H₆-eq) form another. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons give **2 signals** (one for the two axial protons, one for the two equatorial protons).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. The two protons attached to it (H₄-ax and H₄-eq) are diastereotopic because they have a different spatial relationship to the substituents on C1. They are not interchangeable and are therefore chemically distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Signals**\n\nSumming the distinct environments:\n*   From the ethyl group: 1 (CH₃) + 1 (OCH₂) = 2 signals\n*   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = 6 signals\n*   **Total = 2 + 6 = 8 distinct hydrogen signals.**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Final Product Structure**\n\nThe reaction sequence described is a standard multi-step synthesis in organic chemistry. All candidate answers correctly identify the reaction steps and the final product.\n\n1.  **Acetic acid → Product 1:** Alpha-bromination (a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky type reaction) of acetic acid yields **bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)**.\n2.  **Product 1 → Product 2:** Fischer esterification of bromoacetic acid with ethanol yields **ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n3.  **Product 2 → Product 3:** Nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) with sodium cyanide yields **ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n4.  **Product 3 → Product 4:** The acidic α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate is deprotonated twice by excess sodium hydride (NaH) and undergoes a tandem alkylation-cyclization with 1,5-dibromopentane. This forms a six-membered ring. The final product is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of the Final Product**\n\nThe core of the question is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires an analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** The final product has a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃), attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\nThere are two primary models for analyzing the NMR spectrum of such a molecule, and the correct choice often depends on the assumptions common in academic problems.\n\n**Model A: The \"Pseudo-Symmetry\" Model**\n\nThis is the most common approach for this type of problem. It assumes that at room temperature, the rapid chair-flipping of the cyclohexane ring creates an *effective* plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, and the two substituents.\n\n1.  **Consequences of Symmetry:** This plane of symmetry makes the two sides of the ring equivalent. Therefore, C2 is equivalent to C6, and C3 is equivalent to C5.\n2.  **Counting the Signals:**\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n        *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are rendered enantiotopic by the plane of symmetry. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n        *   Even with the symmetry plane, the axial and equatorial protons on any given carbon are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.\n        *   **C2/C6 Protons:** The two axial protons (at C2 and C6) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent to each other. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   **C3/C5 Protons:** Similarly, the axial protons are equivalent, and the equatorial protons are equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   **C4 Protons:** The axial and equatorial protons on C4 are diastereotopic and distinct from each other. This gives **2 signals**.\n3.  **Total Count:** 1 (CH₃) + 1 (OCH₂) + 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = **8 signals**.\n\n**Model B: The \"Rigorous Chirality\" Model**\n\nThis model correctly notes that since the two substituents on C1 are different, the molecule is chiral and has no true plane of symmetry.\n\n1.  **Consequences of Chirality (with rapid ring flip):**\n    *   Because the molecule is chiral, the two protons of the ethyl's methylene group (-OCH₂-) are diastereotopic. **(2 signals)**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group remain equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n    *   The lack of symmetry means C2 is not equivalent to C6, and C3 is not equivalent to C5. However, rapid ring-flipping averages the axial and equatorial positions for each carbon. This results in five distinct signals for the five CH₂ groups of the ring (one for C2, one for C3, one for C4, one for C5, and one for C6). **(5 signals)**\n2.  **Total Count:** 1 (CH₃) + 2 (OCH₂) + 5 (ring CH₂ groups) = **8 signals**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBoth plausible analytical models—the common \"pseudo-symmetry\" approach and the more rigorous \"chiral/rapid-flip\" model—converge on the same answer. This provides strong evidence that 8 is the intended answer. The analyses leading to 5 or 12 signals rely on either oversimplification or inconsistent assumptions.\n\nTherefore, there are 8 chemically distinct hydrogen signals.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (Product 4)**\n\nThe reaction sequence is as follows:\n1.  **Acetic acid + Br₂, pyridine, acetic anhydride → Product 1:** This is an α-bromination of the carboxylic acid (a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky type reaction).\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n2.  **Product 1 + ethanol, H₂SO₄ → Product 2:** This is a Fischer esterification.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n3.  **Product 2 + NaCN → Product 3:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) where cyanide displaces bromide.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n4.  **Product 3 + excess NaH + 1,5-dibromopentane → Product 4:** This is a tandem alkylation and cyclization. The acidic α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate is deprotonated twice and reacts with both ends of the 1,5-dibromopentane. This forms a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\nThis reaction sequence and the final product structure are correctly identified by all candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Symmetry and ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. The key is to correctly analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with two different substituents, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃), attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** At room temperature, cyclohexane rings undergo rapid chair-chair interconversion. This rapid flipping creates a time-averaged structure. For ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate, this time-averaged structure possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group.\n*   **Counting Distinct Protons:** We must count the sets of protons that are not interchangeable by this symmetry plane or by rapid rotation. The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens, which requires us to identify diastereotopic protons as being distinct.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are rendered enantiotopic by the molecular plane of symmetry. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent (isochronous). This gives **1 signal**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** In any given chair conformation, the axial and equatorial protons on C2 are diastereotopic. The symmetry plane makes the axial proton on C2 equivalent to the axial proton on C6, and the equatorial proton on C2 equivalent to the equatorial proton on C6. Therefore, these four protons give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons also give rise to **2 distinct signals** (one for the two axial protons, one for the two equatorial protons).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons attached to it (one axial, one equatorial in a chair form) are diastereotopic. They are in different chemical environments relative to the rest of the molecule and are not interchangeable. Therefore, they are chemically distinct and give **2 signals**.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Signals**\n\nSumming the distinct proton environments:\n*   From the ethyl group: 1 (CH₃) + 1 (OCH₂) = 2 signals\n*   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = 6 signals\n*   **Total = 2 + 6 = 8 distinct hydrogen signals.**\n\nThis analysis, which assumes a standard room-temperature spectrum with rapid conformational averaging, is the most chemically sound and is supported by the reasoning in the majority of the candidate answers. The other interpretations either oversimplify the structure (leading to 5 signals) or make an unstated assumption of a \"locked\" conformation (leading to 12 signals).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

In a standard achiral NMR solvent, they are chemically equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The symmetry plane makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The axial and equatorial protons on C2 are diastereotopic (chemically distinct). The symmetry makes the two axial protons (on C2 and C6) equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons equivalent to each other. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these carbons give **2 signals** (one for the axials, one for the equatorials).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the symmetry plane. Its axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Count (Method 1):** 2 (from ethyl) + 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) = **8 signals**.\n\n**Analysis Method 2: The \"Strictly Asymmetric\" Model**\n\nThis model recognizes that since the two substituents on C1 are different, the molecule is chiral and has no plane of symmetry.\n\n1.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   With no symmetry, C2 is not equivalent to C6, and C3 is not equivalent to C5. All five CH₂ groups on the ring are in unique environments.\n    *   On each of these five unique CH₂ groups, the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic.\n    *   This means all 10 protons on the ring are chemically distinct. **(10 signals)**\n\n2.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are in a chiral molecule, making them diastereotopic and chemically distinct. **(2 signals)**\n\n*   **Total Count (Strictly Rigorous):** 10 (ring) + 1 (CH₃) + 2 (CH₂)= **13 signals**. This is not an option.\n*   **Total Count (with simplification):** If we apply the common simplification of treating the ethyl CH₂ protons as equivalent, we get: 10 (ring) + 1 (CH₃) + 1 (CH₂) = **12 signals**. This matches option B.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have two plausible interpretations leading to answers provided in the options: 8 and 12.\n*   The path to **8 signals** uses a standard textbook simplification (the \"effective symmetry\" model) and applies it consistently.\n*   The path to **12 signals** is more rigorous about the ring's asymmetry but then makes an inconsistent simplification for the ethyl group to match an answer choice.\n\nThe \"effective symmetry\" model (leading to 8 signals) is a very common and self-consistent way such problems are treated in academic settings. The overwhelming consensus of the provided agent answers also points to 8. This suggests it is the intended answer.\n\nFinal Count:\n*   Ethyl -CH₃: 1 signal\n*   Ethyl -OCH₂-: 1 signal\n*   Ring C2/C6 axial H's: 1 signal\n*   Ring C2/C6 equatorial H's: 1 signal\n*   Ring C3/C5 axial H's: 1 signal\n*   Ring C3/C5 equatorial H's: 1 signal\n*   Ring C4 axial H: 1 signal\n*   Ring C4 equatorial H: 1 signal\n*   **Total: 8 signals**\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe synthesis proceeds through four distinct steps:\n\n1.  **Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride.** This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid, a variant of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. The α-carbon of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is brominated.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Product 1 is heated with ethanol and sulfuric acid.** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid group reacts with ethanol to form an ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide.** This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Product 3 is treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane.** This is a tandem reaction involving deprotonation, alkylation, and cyclization.\n    *   First, the strong base (NaH) removes an acidic proton from the carbon atom situated between the two electron-withdrawing groups (-CN and -COOEt).\n    *   The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule.\n    *   The use of *excess* NaH ensures that the second, and now only, proton on that α-carbon is also removed.\n    *   This new carbanion undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentane chain to form a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe core of the question is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires an analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃), attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** For determining the number of signals in an NMR spectrum, we consider the time-averaged structure at room temperature. The cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This rapid flipping creates an effective plane of symmetry that passes through C1, the two substituents, and the opposite carbon, C4.\n\n*   **Counting the Distinct Signals:** Protons that can be interchanged by this plane of symmetry are chemically equivalent. Protons that cannot be interchanged are chemically distinct.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are related by the molecule's plane of symmetry. This makes them enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent and give a single signal. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes the carbons C2 and C6 equivalent. It also makes C3 and C5 equivalent. C4 is unique as it lies on the plane.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** On any single carbon (like C2), the axial and equatorial protons are in different spatial environments. They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. Because C2 and C6 are equivalent by symmetry, the two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial-like protons are equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** from these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons give rise to **2 distinct signals** (one for the two axial-like protons, one for the two equatorial-like protons).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** The two protons on C4 are also diastereotopic. One is axial-like and one is equatorial-like, and they are not interchangeable. Therefore, they are chemically distinct. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Total from cyclohexane ring = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Step 3: Final Calculation**\n\nBy summing the distinct signals from all parts of the molecule, we get:\n*   Signals from ethyl group: 2\n*   Signals from cyclohexane ring: 6\n*   **Total distinct signals = 2 + 6 = 8**\n\nThis analysis, which assumes rapid ring-flipping and correctly applies the principles of stereotopicity, is the standard and most chemically sound approach for this type of problem. It leads directly to the answer of 8 distinct signals.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis task requires a two-part analysis: first, determining the structure of the final product from a multi-step synthesis, and second, analyzing that structure to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms for its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Trace the Reaction Sequence:** I will follow the four reaction steps to identify the structure of the final product, Product 4.\n2.  **Analyze Product 4 for Symmetry:** I will examine the structure of Product 4 to determine its symmetry elements. The number of distinct hydrogen signals depends on which protons are chemically equivalent and which are not.\n3.  **Count Distinct Proton Environments:** Based on the symmetry analysis, I will count every set of chemically non-equivalent protons. This count will be the answer to the question.\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script that outlines the counting logic and prints the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Execution:\n\n1.  **Step 1 -> Product 1:** Acetic acid undergoes alpha-bromination (a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky type reaction) to yield **bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)**.\n2.  **Step 2 -> Product 2:** Bromoacetic acid undergoes Fischer esterification with ethanol to yield **ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n3.  **Step 3 -> Product 3:** Ethyl bromoacetate undergoes an Sₙ2 reaction with sodium cyanide, where the cyanide ion displaces the bromide, yielding **ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n4.  **Step 4 -> Product 4:** Ethyl cyanoacetate has acidic α-protons. The strong base (NaH) removes one proton, and the resulting carbanion attacks the 1,5-dibromopentane. The excess NaH removes the second α-proton, and the new carbanion performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction to form a six-membered ring. The final product is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### ¹H NMR Analysis of Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate:\n\nThe key to counting the signals is to analyze the molecule's symmetry. At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. This creates a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through the substituted carbon (C1), the opposite carbon (C4), and the two substituents on C1.\n\nBased on this symmetry:\n*   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal **-CH₃** group are equivalent. (1 signal)\n    *   The two protons of the **-OCH₂-** group are enantiotopic due to the plane of symmetry. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, they are chemically equivalent. (1 signal)\n*   **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5.\n    *   **C2/C6 Protons:** The axial and equatorial protons on C2 are diastereotopic (not interchangeable by symmetry). The same is true for C6. The symmetry makes the two axial protons (on C2 and C6) equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons equivalent to each other. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **C3/C5 Protons:** The same logic applies. The two axial protons are one set, and the two equatorial protons are another. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **C4 Protons:** The two protons on C4 are also diastereotopic and are not equivalent to each other. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n**Total Signal Count:**\n*   Ethyl group signals: 1 + 1 = 2\n*   Cyclohexane ring signals: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6\n*   **Total = 2 + 6 = 8 signals**\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1.

To determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry and the chemical equivalence of its protons. The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens, which requires careful consideration of stereochemistry.\n\nThere are two main, chemically sound ways to analyze this molecule that lead to one of the given answers.\n\n**Method 1: Locked Conformation with Assumed Symmetry (Common Textbook Approach)**\n\n1.  **Conformation:** Assume the cyclohexane ring is \"locked\" in a single chair conformation due to the bulky substituents. In this state, axial (ax) and equatorial (eq) protons are chemically distinct.\n2.  **Symmetry:** Assume a simplified model with a plane of symmetry passing through C1 and C4. This makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5.\n3.  **Counting Signals:**\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three -CH₃ protons are equivalent. (1 signal)\n        *   The two -OCH₂- protons are treated as equivalent (a common simplification). (1 signal)\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n        *   **C2/C6 Protons:** The two axial protons are equivalent, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent. This gives 2 signals (H-ax, H-eq).\n        *   **C3/C5 Protons:** Similarly, this gives 2 signals (H-ax, H-eq).\n        *   **C4 Protons:** The axial and equatorial protons are distinct. This gives 2 signals (H-ax, H-eq).\n    *   **Total:** 2 (from ethyl) + 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) = **8 signals**.\n\n**Method 2: Rapid Flipping with No Symmetry**\n\n1.  **Conformation:** Assume the ring is rapidly flipping at room temperature, which averages the axial and equatorial positions for any given carbon.\n2.  **Symmetry:** The two substituents on C1 (-CN and -COOEt) are different, so the molecule is chiral and has no plane of symmetry. Therefore, C2 is not equivalent to C6, and C3 is not equivalent to C5.\n3.  **Counting Signals:**\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three -CH₃ protons are equivalent. (1 signal)\n        *   The two -OCH₂- protons are in a chiral molecule, making them diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. (2 signals)\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n        *   The protons on C2 are averaged by flipping to give one signal.\n        *   The protons on C6 are in a different environment from C2 and give a second signal.\n        *   The protons on C3 give a third signal.\n        *   The protons on C5 give a fourth signal.\n        *   The protons on C4 give a fifth signal.\n        *   This gives a total of 5 signals from the ring.\n    *   **Total:** 3 (from ethyl) + 5 (from ring) = **8 signals**.\n\nBoth plausible analysis methods converge on the same answer. The overwhelming consensus among the provided candidate answers also points to 8 signals.\n\nFinal Count:\n*   Ethyl group: 2 signals (CH₃ and CH₂)\n*   Cyclohexane ring: 6 signals (C2-ax/eq, C3-ax/eq, C4-ax/eq, with C2=C6 and C3=C5)\n*   Total = 2 + 6 = 8\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\n1.  **Acetic acid + Br₂, pyridine, acetic anhydride → Product 1:** This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid, a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) type reaction.

The number of distinct environments corresponds to the number of signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe structure is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\nTo count the signals, we must consider the molecule's symmetry. At room temperature, cyclohexane rings undergo rapid chair-chair interconversion. This rapid flipping creates a time-averaged structure that possesses a plane of symmetry. This plane passes through C1, the two substituents (-CN and -COOEt), and the opposite carbon, C4.\n\nWe count the distinct proton environments based on this time-averaged symmetry:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are related by the plane of symmetry, making them enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent and give a single signal. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** On any single carbon (like C2), the axial and equatorial protons are in different chemical environments. They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. Since C2 and C6 are equivalent by symmetry, the two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** from these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons give rise to **2 distinct signals** (one for the two axial protons, one for the two equatorial protons).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons attached to it (one axial, one equatorial in any given conformation) are diastereotopic. They are in different chemical environments and are not interchangeable. Therefore, they give **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Total from cyclohexane ring = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Signals**\n\nAdding the signals from the ethyl group and the cyclohexane ring:\nTotal Signals = (Signals from ethyl group) + (Signals from ring)\nTotal Signals = 2 + 6 = **8**\n\nTherefore, there are 8 chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\n1.  **Acetic acid + Br₂, pyridine, acetic anhydride → Product 1:** This is an alpha-bromination of a carboxylic acid (a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky or similar reaction).

C4 is unique as it lies on the plane.\n        *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** On any given carbon of the ring (e.g., C2), the axial and equatorial protons are in different spatial environments. They are not interchangeable by symmetry and are therefore diastereotopic. Since C2 and C6 are equivalent, the two axial protons (at C2 and C6) form one set, and the two equatorial protons form another.

All candidate answers correctly identify the reaction steps and the final product.\n\n1.  **Acetic acid → Product 1:** Alpha-bromination (a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky type reaction) yields **bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)**.\n2.  **Product 1 → Product 2:** Fischer esterification with ethanol yields **ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n3.  **Product 2 → Product 3:** Nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) with sodium cyanide yields **ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n4.  **Product 3 → Product 4:** This is a tandem alkylation-cyclization. The acidic α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate is deprotonated by the strong base, sodium hydride (NaH). The resulting carbanion attacks one end of 1,5-dibromopentane. The use of *excess* NaH ensures the second α-proton is also removed, and the resulting carbanion performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction to form a stable six-membered ring.\n\nThe final product (4) is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of the Final Product**\n\nThe core of the question is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires an analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with two different substituents (a cyano group, -CN, and an ethoxycarbonyl group, -COOCH₂CH₃) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** At room temperature, cyclohexane rings undergo rapid chair-chair interconversion. This rapid flipping creates a *time-averaged* plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group. Protons that are equivalent under this symmetry will produce a single signal. Protons that are not interchangeable are chemically distinct.\n\nLet's count the distinct proton environments based on this symmetry:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are related by the molecule's plane of symmetry. This makes them *enantiotopic*. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent and give a single signal. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes the carbons on one side of the ring equivalent to the carbons on the other side (i.e., C2 is equivalent to C6, and C3 is equivalent to C5).\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** In any given chair conformation, the two protons on C2 (one axial, one equatorial) are *diastereotopic* and thus chemically distinct. The plane of symmetry makes the axial proton on C2 equivalent to the axial proton on C6, and the equatorial proton on C2 equivalent to the equatorial proton on C6. This results in **2 distinct signals** for these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons also give **2 distinct signals** (one for the two axial protons, one for the two equatorial protons).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** Carbon 4 lies on the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons attached to it (one axial, one equatorial) are *diastereotopic*. They are in different chemical environments relative to the rest of the molecule and are not interchangeable. Therefore, they give **2 distinct signals**.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Signals**\n\nSumming the distinct environments:\n*   From the ethyl group: 1 (CH₃) + 1 (CH₂) = 2 signals\n*   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = 6 signals\n*   **Total = 2 + 6 = 8 distinct hydrogen signals.**\n\nThis analysis, which is the most common and chemically sound for this type of molecule under standard NMR conditions, leads to 8 signals. This corresponds to option A. While other interpretations exist (e.g., assuming a locked, asymmetric conformation leading to 12 signals, or oversimplifying symmetry leading to 5 signals), the analysis yielding 8 signals correctly balances the concepts of time-averaged symmetry and diastereotopicity.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe reaction sequence is as follows:\n\n*   **Step 1: Acetic acid → Product 1**\n    *   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH), Bromine (Br₂), Pyridine, Acetic Anhydride.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid, a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. One hydrogen on the α-carbon is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 → Product 2**\n    *   **Reactants:** Bromoacetic acid, Ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH), H₂SO₄ (catalyst).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol to form an ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3**\n    *   **Reactants:** Ethyl bromoacetate, Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction.

NaH, a strong base, removes an acidic proton from the carbon between the -CN and -COOEt groups.\n        2.  The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        3.  The excess NaH removes the second acidic proton from the same carbon.\n        4.  The new carbanion performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 attack on the other end of the pentane chain, forming a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe core of the question is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. The key to this is analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with two different substituents (-CN and -COOCH₂CH₃) on the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** Because the two substituents on C1 are different, the molecule lacks a true plane of symmetry and is chiral. However, in the context of typical NMR problems, there are two common ways to analyze such a system, both of which lead to the same answer.\n\n**Method A: The \"Pseudo-Symmetry\" Model (Most Common Textbook Approach)**\n\nThis model assumes an \"effective\" plane of symmetry passing through C1 and C4 of the ring. This simplifies the analysis while still accounting for the most important distinctions.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are rendered enantiotopic by the pseudo-plane of symmetry. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, they are chemically equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   The pseudo-symmetry makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The axial and equatorial protons on these carbons are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. The two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent to each other. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** Similarly, the four protons on these two carbons give **2 signals** (one for the two axial H's, one for the two equatorial H's).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** The axial and equatorial protons on C4 are diastereotopic and thus non-equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Count (Method A):** 2 (from ethyl) + 6 (from ring) = **8 signals**.\n\n**Method B: The \"Chiral, Rapid-Flipping\" Model**\n\nThis model correctly identifies the molecule as chiral (no symmetry) and considers the effect of rapid chair-flipping at room temperature.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n    *   Because the molecule is chiral, the two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are diastereotopic and chemically distinct. **(2 signals)**\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   Because there is no symmetry, C2 is not equivalent to C6, and C3 is not equivalent to C5. All five methylene groups (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are in unique chemical environments.\n    *   Rapid chair-flipping averages the signals of the axial and equatorial protons on each carbon. Therefore, each of the five unique CH₂ groups gives one time-averaged signal. This gives **5 signals** from the ring.\n\n*   **Total Count (Method B):** 3 (from ethyl) + 5 (from ring) = **8 signals**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBoth plausible chemical models for analyzing the molecule's ¹H NMR spectrum converge on the same answer: 8 distinct hydrogen signals. The analysis leading to 5 signals is an oversimplification, and the analysis leading to 12 signals relies on inconsistent assumptions. Therefore, 8 is the most chemically sound answer among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n**1.

They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. Because C2 and C6 are equivalent by symmetry, the two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) form one set, and the two equatorial protons form another set. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The two axial protons are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent to each other. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry.

Determine the Structure of the Final Product**\n\nThe reaction sequence is a standard multi-step synthesis in organic chemistry.\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid → Bromoacetic acid (Product 1).** This is an α-bromination reaction, a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction.\n2.  **Step 2: Bromoacetic acid → Ethyl bromoacetate (Product 2).** This is a Fischer esterification, converting the carboxylic acid to an ethyl ester.\n3.  **Step 3: Ethyl bromoacetate → Ethyl cyanoacetate (Product 3).** This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) where a cyanide ion replaces the bromide.\n4.  **Step 4: Ethyl cyanoacetate → Final Product (4).** This is a tandem reaction. The acidic α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate is deprotonated by the strong base sodium hydride (NaH). The resulting carbanion attacks one end of 1,5-dibromopentane. The use of *excess* NaH ensures the second α-proton is also removed, and the resulting carbanion performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, closing a six-membered ring.\n\nThe final product (4) is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### **2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of the Final Product**\n\nThe key to this problem is to correctly determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in the final product. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n**Structure and Symmetry:**\nThe final product has a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃), attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n*   **Chirality:** Because the two substituents on C1 are different, C1 is a chiral center. A molecule with a single chiral center is chiral and therefore lacks any plane of symmetry.\n*   **Consequences of Chirality:** In a chiral molecule, protons that are not related by simple bond rotation are chemically distinct. This has important implications for the ¹H NMR spectrum at room temperature:\n    1.  The two sides of the cyclohexane ring are not equivalent (i.e., the environment of C2 is different from C6, and C3 is different from C5).\n    2.  The two protons on the methylene group of the ethyl ester (-OCH₂-) are **diastereotopic** and thus chemically non-equivalent.\n\n**Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Signals (at Room Temperature):**\nWe assume a standard room-temperature spectrum where the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. This rapid interconversion averages the chemical shifts of the axial and equatorial protons on any *single* carbon atom.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene (-OCH₂-) group are diastereotopic because they are in a chiral molecule. They are chemically non-equivalent and will produce **2 distinct signals**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   Because the molecule is chiral, the five methylene (CH₂) groups of the ring (at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6) are all in unique chemical environments.\n    *   The rapid chair-flip averages the two protons on each of these carbons into a single signal for that specific carbon.\n    *   Therefore, the five non-equivalent CH₂ groups give rise to **5 distinct signals**.\n\n**Total Signal Count:**\nAdding the signals from all parts of the molecule:\n*   From the ethyl group: 1 (for -CH₃) + 2 (for -OCH₂-) = 3 signals\n*   From the five distinct ring CH₂ groups: 5 signals\n*   **Total = 3 + 5 = 8 distinct hydrogen signals.**\n\nThis result corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Final Product Structure**\n\nThe reaction sequence is as follows:\n\n1.  **Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) + Br₂, pyridine, acetic anhydride → Product 1**: This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid (a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky type reaction).\n    *   **Product 1**: Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Product 1 + ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH), H₂SO₄ → Product 2**: This is a Fischer esterification.\n    *   **Product 2**: Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Product 2 + NaCN → Product 3**: This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) where cyanide displaces bromide.\n    *   **Product 3**: Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Product 3 + excess NaH + 1,5-dibromopentane → Product 4**: This is a tandem reaction.\n    *   First, the strong base NaH deprotonates the acidic α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate.\n    *   The resulting carbanion attacks one end of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    *   The use of *excess* NaH ensures the second α-proton is also removed, and the resulting carbanion performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, closing a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4**: Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**. To determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze its structure for chemical equivalence, considering symmetry and stereochemistry.\n\nThe question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens, which requires a rigorous analysis beyond simple approximations.\n\n1.  **Symmetry of the Molecule**: At room temperature, cyclohexane rings undergo rapid chair-chair interconversion. This creates a time-averaged structure. For ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate, this time-averaged structure possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C1 (the substituted carbon), C4 (the opposite carbon), the cyano group, and the ester group.\n\n2.  **Counting the Distinct Proton Environments**:\n\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃)**:\n        *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are related by the molecule's plane of symmetry, making them enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent and give a single signal. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons**:\n        *   The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n        *   **Protons on C2 and C6**: On any single carbon of the ring (e.g., C2), the axial and equatorial protons are in different spatial environments. They are diastereotopic and therefore chemically distinct. Since C2 and C6 are equivalent by symmetry, the two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** from these four protons.\n        *   **Protons on C3 and C5**: The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons give rise to **2 distinct signals** (one for the two axial protons, one for the two equatorial protons).\n        *   **Protons on C4**: This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons attached to it (one axial, one equatorial in any given conformation) are not interchanged by the symmetry operation. They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. This results in **2 distinct signals**.\n        *   *Total from the ring = 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) = 6 signals.*\n\n3.  **Total Number of Signals**:\n    *   Adding the signals from the ethyl group and the cyclohexane ring:\n    *   Total Signals = 2 (ethyl) + 6 (ring) = **8**\n\nThis analysis is the most chemically sound approach for a standard room-temperature NMR spectrum, as it correctly applies the principles of symmetry and diastereotopicity.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe reaction sequence described is a standard multi-step synthesis in organic chemistry.\n\n1.  **Acetic acid + Br₂, pyridine, acetic anhydride → Product 1:** This is an alpha-bromination of a carboxylic acid, a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is brominated.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Product 1 + ethanol, H₂SO₄ → Product 2:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid is converted to an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Product 2 + NaCN → Product 3:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Product 3 + excess NaH + 1,5-dibromopentane → Product 4:** This is a tandem alkylation-cyclization reaction.\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, deprotonates the acidic α-carbon located between the two electron-withdrawing groups (-CN and -COOEt).\n    *   The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane chain.\n    *   The use of *excess* NaH ensures the deprotonation of the remaining α-hydrogen.\n    *   The new carbanion undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentane chain to form a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe core of the question is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires an analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with two different substituents, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃), attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This rapid flipping creates a time-averaged structure. For the purpose of counting signals, we can consider a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, the two substituents, and the opposite carbon, C4. Protons that can be interchanged through this symmetry plane are equivalent. Protons that cannot are distinct. We must also consider that protons on the same carbon can be distinct (diastereotopic).\n\nLet's count the distinct proton environments based on this model:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are rendered enantiotopic by the molecular plane of symmetry. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent and give a single signal. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes the ring positions C2 and C6 equivalent. Likewise, C3 and C5 are equivalent. C4 is unique.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The two protons on C2 (one axial, one equatorial in any given chair conformation) are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. The same is true for C6. Because C2 and C6 are equivalent by symmetry, the two axial protons (H₂-ax and H₆-ax) form one set, and the two equatorial protons (H₂-eq and H₆-eq) form another. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons give **2 signals** (one for the two axial protons, one for the two equatorial protons).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. The two protons attached to it (H₄-ax and H₄-eq) are diastereotopic because they have a different spatial relationship to the substituents on C1. They are not interchangeable and are therefore chemically distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Signals**\n\nSumming the distinct environments:\n*   From the ethyl group: 1 (CH₃) + 1 (OCH₂) = 2 signals\n*   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = 6 signals\n*   **Total = 2 + 6 = 8 distinct hydrogen signals.**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Final Product Structure**\n\nThe reaction sequence described is a standard multi-step synthesis in organic chemistry. All candidate answers correctly identify the reaction steps and the final product.\n\n1.  **Acetic acid → Product 1:** Alpha-bromination (a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky type reaction) of acetic acid yields **bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)**.\n2.  **Product 1 → Product 2:** Fischer esterification of bromoacetic acid with ethanol yields **ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n3.  **Product 2 → Product 3:** Nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) with sodium cyanide yields **ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n4.  **Product 3 → Product 4:** The acidic α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate is deprotonated twice by excess sodium hydride (NaH) and undergoes a tandem alkylation-cyclization with 1,5-dibromopentane. This forms a six-membered ring. The final product is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of the Final Product**\n\nThe core of the question is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires an analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** The final product has a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃), attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\nThere are two primary models for analyzing the NMR spectrum of such a molecule, and the correct choice often depends on the assumptions common in academic problems.\n\n**Model A: The \"Pseudo-Symmetry\" Model**\n\nThis is the most common approach for this type of problem. It assumes that at room temperature, the rapid chair-flipping of the cyclohexane ring creates an *effective* plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, and the two substituents.\n\n1.  **Consequences of Symmetry:** This plane of symmetry makes the two sides of the ring equivalent. Therefore, C2 is equivalent to C6, and C3 is equivalent to C5.\n2.  **Counting the Signals:**\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n        *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are rendered enantiotopic by the plane of symmetry. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n        *   Even with the symmetry plane, the axial and equatorial protons on any given carbon are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.\n        *   **C2/C6 Protons:** The two axial protons (at C2 and C6) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent to each other. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   **C3/C5 Protons:** Similarly, the axial protons are equivalent, and the equatorial protons are equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   **C4 Protons:** The axial and equatorial protons on C4 are diastereotopic and distinct from each other. This gives **2 signals**.\n3.  **Total Count:** 1 (CH₃) + 1 (OCH₂) + 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = **8 signals**.\n\n**Model B: The \"Rigorous Chirality\" Model**\n\nThis model correctly notes that since the two substituents on C1 are different, the molecule is chiral and has no true plane of symmetry.\n\n1.  **Consequences of Chirality (with rapid ring flip):**\n    *   Because the molecule is chiral, the two protons of the ethyl's methylene group (-OCH₂-) are diastereotopic. **(2 signals)**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group remain equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n    *   The lack of symmetry means C2 is not equivalent to C6, and C3 is not equivalent to C5. However, rapid ring-flipping averages the axial and equatorial positions for each carbon. This results in five distinct signals for the five CH₂ groups of the ring (one for C2, one for C3, one for C4, one for C5, and one for C6). **(5 signals)**\n2.  **Total Count:** 1 (CH₃) + 2 (OCH₂) + 5 (ring CH₂ groups) = **8 signals**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBoth plausible analytical models—the common \"pseudo-symmetry\" approach and the more rigorous \"chiral/rapid-flip\" model—converge on the same answer. This provides strong evidence that 8 is the intended answer. The analyses leading to 5 or 12 signals rely on either oversimplification or inconsistent assumptions.\n\nTherefore, there are 8 chemically distinct hydrogen signals.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (Product 4)**\n\nThe reaction sequence is as follows:\n1.  **Acetic acid + Br₂, pyridine, acetic anhydride → Product 1:** This is an α-bromination of the carboxylic acid (a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky type reaction).\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n2.  **Product 1 + ethanol, H₂SO₄ → Product 2:** This is a Fischer esterification.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n3.  **Product 2 + NaCN → Product 3:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) where cyanide displaces bromide.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n4.  **Product 3 + excess NaH + 1,5-dibromopentane → Product 4:** This is a tandem alkylation and cyclization. The acidic α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate is deprotonated twice and reacts with both ends of the 1,5-dibromopentane. This forms a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\nThis reaction sequence and the final product structure are correctly identified by all candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Symmetry and ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. The key is to correctly analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with two different substituents, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃), attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** At room temperature, cyclohexane rings undergo rapid chair-chair interconversion. This rapid flipping creates a time-averaged structure. For ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate, this time-averaged structure possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group.\n*   **Counting Distinct Protons:** We must count the sets of protons that are not interchangeable by this symmetry plane or by rapid rotation. The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens, which requires us to identify diastereotopic protons as being distinct.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are rendered enantiotopic by the molecular plane of symmetry. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent (isochronous). This gives **1 signal**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** In any given chair conformation, the axial and equatorial protons on C2 are diastereotopic. The symmetry plane makes the axial proton on C2 equivalent to the axial proton on C6, and the equatorial proton on C2 equivalent to the equatorial proton on C6. Therefore, these four protons give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons also give rise to **2 distinct signals** (one for the two axial protons, one for the two equatorial protons).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons attached to it (one axial, one equatorial in a chair form) are diastereotopic. They are in different chemical environments relative to the rest of the molecule and are not interchangeable. Therefore, they are chemically distinct and give **2 signals**.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Signals**\n\nSumming the distinct proton environments:\n*   From the ethyl group: 1 (CH₃) + 1 (OCH₂) = 2 signals\n*   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = 6 signals\n*   **Total = 2 + 6 = 8 distinct hydrogen signals.**\n\nThis analysis, which assumes a standard room-temperature spectrum with rapid conformational averaging, is the most chemically sound and is supported by the reasoning in the majority of the candidate answers. The other interpretations either oversimplify the structure (leading to 5 signals) or make an unstated assumption of a \"locked\" conformation (leading to 12 signals).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
