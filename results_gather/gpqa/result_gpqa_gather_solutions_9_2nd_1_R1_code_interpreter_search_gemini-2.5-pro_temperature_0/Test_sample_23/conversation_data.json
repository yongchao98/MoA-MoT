This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. A hydrocarbon with a mass ratio of H:Total of 1:7 has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ. Since Z does not react further with hydrogen, it must be a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂₂ must be a cycloalkane. The problem also states Z is a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). This fits all the given information.\n\n2.  **Determine the Carbon Skeleton**: The hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane). This is a critical piece of information, as it implies that all compounds in both mixtures have the same carbon skeleton: a six-membered ring.\n\n3.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are either saturated or aromatic. We know one component is Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a C₆ skeleton and not react with bromine water, but it must be different from cyclohexane. The most logical candidate is benzene (C₆H₆), which is aromatic and does not react with bromine water under normal conditions. Hydrogenation of a mixture of cyclohexane and benzene would yield only cyclohexane, which matches the problem description. Therefore, mixture Y consists of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n\n4.  **Analyze the Reaction and Identify Mixture X**: Mixture X is converted to mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n    *   Reaction: `Component A + Component B (from Mixture X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆) (Mixture Y)`\n    *   Since this is a 1:1 reaction of equimolar mixtures, we can balance the atoms. The total number of hydrogen atoms in the products is 12 (from cyclohexane) + 6 (from benzene) = 18.\n    *   By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two reactant molecules from mixture X must also be 18.\n\n5.  **Answer the Question**: The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Based on the atom balance from the reaction, this sum is 18.\n\nTo confirm this is plausible, we can identify the components of X. They must be unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds without conjugated bonds. The pair that fits is cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 18. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identification of Substance Z**\n\n*   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is a very close approximation of the fraction 1/7.\n*   Let the molecular formula of Z be CₓHᵧ. Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n*   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   This formula corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane. The problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which means it is a saturated compound. This rules out alkenes, so Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The additional information that Z is \"widely used as a solvent\" and is the central compound in all the reactions strongly suggests it is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**, the most common cycloalkane solvent.\n\n**2. Identification of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is one of the components of Y.\n*   The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation on a platinum catalyst. This is a classic catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction, where an unsaturated cyclic compound is converted into a mixture of a fully saturated cycloalkane and a fully dehydrogenated aromatic compound.\n*   Therefore, the other component of Y must be **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   Let's check if this fits: Mixture Y = {cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), benzene (C₆H₆)}. Neither component decolorizes bromine water under normal conditions. Hydrogenation of this mixture would convert the benzene to cyclohexane, resulting in only cyclohexane (Z) as the final product. This is fully consistent with the problem description.\n\n**3. Identification of Mixture X and Calculation of the Final Answer**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that, upon heating with platinum, disproportionates into mixture Y.\n*   The overall reaction is: **Mixture X → Mixture Y**\n*   Substituting the identified components, the reaction is: **Component A + Component B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)**\n*   According to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms on the reactant side must equal the total on the product side.\n*   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the products (one molecule of cyclohexane and one molecule of benzene) is 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Since the reaction starts with an equimolar mixture (X) and produces an equimolar mixture (Y), the stoichiometry is 1:1 for all four compounds. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of component A and one molecule of component B) must also be 18.\n\n**4. Verification of the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   The problem states that mixture X decolorizes bromine water (so its components are unsaturated) and has no conjugated multiple bonds. Also, hydrogenation of X gives only cyclohexane, meaning both components are C₆ cyclic compounds.\n*   We need to find two non-conjugated, unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18.\n*   The most logical candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   Cyclohexene has one double bond and is not conjugated.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene has two isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds. (The other isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, is conjugated and thus excluded).\n*   The sum of the hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This confirms that our deduction from the conservation of atoms is consistent with a plausible chemical scenario.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Based on the atom balance of the reaction, this value is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan to solve this problem is to follow a logical deduction based on the chemical properties described in the question. The core of the solution lies in identifying the key substances and then applying the principle of conservation of atoms to the chemical reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:** I will first use the given mass fraction of hydrogen (14.28%) to determine the empirical formula of hydrocarbon Z. Combining this with the fact that Z is a saturated, common solvent, I can deduce its exact molecular formula and structure.\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y:** Knowing Z, I can identify the components of mixture Y. Y is an equimolar mixture containing Z, does not decolorize bromine water, and its components hydrogenate to Z. This strongly points to a mixture of a cycloalkane (Z) and its corresponding aromatic compound.\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Find the Answer:** The reaction where mixture X forms mixture Y is a disproportionation, which is a hydrogen transfer in this context. By applying the law of conservation of atoms to this reaction (`X₁ + X₂ → Y₁ + Y₂`), I can determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two molecules of mixture X without needing to identify their exact structures. The Python code will perform this final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the problem by deducing the number of hydrogen atoms\n    based on the conservation of atoms in the described chemical reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1 & 2: Identify the products of the reaction (Mixture Y).\n    # Based on the problem description:\n    # - Substance Z is a saturated hydrocarbon with H mass fraction ~14.28% (1/7),\n    #   making it a cycloalkane (CnH2n).

Identify Substance Z**\n*   **Information:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. It is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen) and is a common solvent.\n*   **Analysis:** A mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28% is equivalent to 1/7. For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `y = 2x`. The general formula is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   Since Z is saturated, it must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The most common cycloalkane used as a solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   **Conclusion:** All agents correctly identify Z as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n\n**2. Identify the Carbon Skeleton**\n*   **Information:** Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a critical point. It means that all components in both mixtures must have a six-carbon ring skeleton that can be converted to cyclohexane upon adding hydrogen.\n*   **Conclusion:** All compounds involved are C₆ cyclic compounds.\n\n**3. Identify Mixture Y**\n*   **Information:** Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. It does not decolorize bromine water. One component is Z (cyclohexane). Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** Since one component is cyclohexane, the other component must also be a C₆ cyclic compound that does not decolorize bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. The only compound that fits this description is benzene (C₆H₆). Benzene is aromatic and thus unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, but it hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   **Conclusion:** All agents correctly identify mixture Y as an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n\n**4. Analyze the Reaction and Identify Mixture X**\n*   **Information:** Mixture X is converted to mixture Y in a disproportionation reaction. `X₁ + X₂ → Y₁ + Y₂`.\n*   **Analysis:** Substituting the known components of Y, the reaction is: `X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total number in the products.\n*   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of each) must also be 18.\n\n**5. Verify the Components of Mixture X**\n*   **Information:** The components of X decolorize bromine water (they are unsaturated) and have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   **Analysis:** We need two different unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The logical candidates are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and a non-conjugated cyclohexadiene. The non-conjugated isomer is 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n*   Let's check the sum of hydrogen atoms: 10 + 8 = 18. This matches the requirement from the reaction balance.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture X consists of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. As determined from the conservation of atoms in the reaction `X → Y`, this is the sum of hydrogen atoms in the products, cyclohexane (12 H) and benzene (6 H).\nTotal H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\nThis is also confirmed by identifying the components of X as cyclohexene (10 H) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (8 H).\nTotal H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThe calculated answer is 18. Looking at the options:\nA) 12\nB) 16\nC) 18\nD) 22\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided solutions.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:** All candidate answers correctly deduce the identity of substance Z. The mass fraction of hydrogen (14.28% ≈ 1/7) and the fact that it's a saturated hydrocarbon lead to the general formula CₙH₂ₙ, which corresponds to a cycloalkane. The additional clues that it's a common solvent and the final product of all hydrogenations strongly point to **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This is a consistent and correct starting point in all analyses.\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y:** All candidate answers correctly identify mixture Y.\n    *   It's an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   One component is Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   It does not decolorize bromine water. This means the second component is saturated or aromatic.\n    *   The reaction forming Y is a disproportionation (hydrogen transfer). If one product is the fully hydrogenated cyclohexane, the other must be the fully dehydrogenated product, which is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n    *   This fits all conditions: benzene doesn't decolorize bromine water, and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane.\n    *   Therefore, Mixture Y = {cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), benzene (C₆H₆)}.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Find the Answer:** The core of the problem lies in the conservation of atoms during the disproportionation reaction.\n    *   Reaction: Mixture X → Mixture Y\n    *   Since both are equimolar mixtures, the reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n        `X₁ + X₂ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`\n    *   By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms on the reactant side must equal the total on the product side.\n    *   Let's balance the hydrogen atoms:\n        Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene)\n        Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (one molecule of X₁ and one molecule of X₂) must also be 18.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The question asks for \"the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\". This is precisely the sum we calculated from the atom balance of the reaction. The answer is 18.\n\n5.  **Reviewing Candidate Choices:** The provided options are A) 16, B) 22, C) 12, D) 18. The calculated answer, 18, corresponds to option D. While several candidate answers correctly perform the logical deduction to arrive at the number 18, some of them incorrectly map this number to the wrong letter option. The reasoning across all solutions is sound and consistently points to 18.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identification of Substance Z**\n\n*   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (since 1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n*   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CₓHᵧ. Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n*   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ. This formula corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem specifies that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" meaning it is a saturated compound. This rules out alkenes, so Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The clues that Z is \"widely used as a solvent\" and that all other compounds in the problem can be hydrogenated to it strongly suggest a common and stable structure. Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) is the most common cycloalkane solvent and fits the CₙH₂ₙ formula. This is a very strong candidate for Z.\n\n**2. Identification of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. Since cyclohexane is already saturated, it does not react. Therefore, the other component of Y must also be converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   This second component must not decolorize bromine water, which points to it being an aromatic compound. The aromatic compound with a six-carbon skeleton is benzene (C₆H₆). Benzene does not react with bromine water under normal conditions and is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Reaction and Identification of Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is converted to mixture Y upon heating with platinum in a disproportionation reaction. This type of reaction involves a hydrogen transfer where one molecule is reduced and another is oxidized.\n*   The overall reaction, given that the mixtures are equimolar, is:\n    `Liquid A (from X) + Liquid B (from X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total number in the products.\n*   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be 18.\n\n**4. Verification of the Properties of Mixture X**\n\n*   The problem states that mixture X decolorizes bromine water (so its components are unsaturated) and has no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Since hydrogenation of X yields only cyclohexane, its components must be C₆ cyclic compounds.\n*   We need two unsaturated, non-conjugated C₆ cyclic compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The most logical candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   Cyclohexene has one double bond and is not conjugated.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene has two isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds. The other isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, is conjugated and thus excluded.\n*   The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This confirms the result from the atom balance and fits all the problem's constraints.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Based on the conservation of atoms in the disproportionation reaction, this value is 18.\n\nThe options are:\nA) 22\nB) 18\nC) 16\nD) 12\n\nThe correct answer is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the logic from the provided answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\n*   **Information**: Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. It is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen) and is a common solvent.\n*   **Analysis**: The mass fraction of 14.28% is equivalent to 1/7. For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is approximately `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point**: A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Conclusion**: The most common cycloalkane used as a solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). This fits the formula (n=6, 2n=12) and all other descriptions. Therefore, **Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n*   **Information**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. Z (cyclohexane) is one of its components. Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n*   **Analysis**: One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must not decolorize bromine water (suggesting it is saturated or aromatic) and must hydrogenate to form cyclohexane.\n*   **Careful Point**: The reaction forming Y is a disproportionation, which often involves creating a fully saturated compound and a fully unsaturated (aromatic) one.\n*   **Conclusion**: The only logical second component is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions, and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane. Therefore, **Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Properties of Mixture X\n*   **Information**: An equimolar mixture X undergoes disproportionation upon heating with platinum to form the equimolar mixture Y.\n*   **Analysis**: The reaction is:\n    (Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)\n*   **Careful Point**: The law of conservation of atoms must apply. The total number of atoms on the reactant side must equal the total on the product side.\n*   **Conclusion**: The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two product molecules is 12 + 6 = 18. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two reactant molecules (the two liquids of mixture X) must also be **18**.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Components of Mixture X (for consistency)\n*   **Information**: The components of X decolorize bromine water (are unsaturated), have no conjugated bonds, and both hydrogenate to form only cyclohexane.\n*   **Analysis**: This means the components must be unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds without conjugated double bonds. The two most plausible candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**. The other isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, is conjugated and thus excluded.\n*   **Careful Point**: Check if this pair fits the hydrogen count derived in Step 3.\n*   **Conclusion**: The sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene (10) and one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (8) is 10 + 8 = 18. This is perfectly consistent with the conclusion from Step 3.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Based on the conservation of atoms in the reaction, this value is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z**: The problem states Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage is approximately equal to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ. Since Z does not react further with hydrogen, it must be a saturated compound, which means it is a cycloalkane. The problem also states Z is a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), which fits the formula and description.\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One of its components is Z (cyclohexane). The entire mixture Y, when hydrogenated, yields only Z. This means the second component of Y must also be a C₆ compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Since this second component does not decolorize bromine water, it must be aromatic. The only C₆ aromatic compound is benzene (C₆H₆). Therefore, mixture Y consists of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction**: Mixture X is converted to mixture Y upon heating with a platinum catalyst. This is a disproportionation reaction, which in this context is a hydrogen transfer. Since both mixtures are equimolar, the reaction can be written as:\n    `Component of X₁ + Component of X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**: According to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms must be the same on both sides of the chemical equation. We can balance the hydrogen atoms:\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of each) must also be 18.\n\n5.  **Verify the Components of Mixture X**: The components of X must be unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds without conjugated bonds. The pair that fits this description and whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18 is cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This confirms the result from the atom balance.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is 18.

This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n*   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CₓHᵧ. Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n*   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits all the given information.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means the other component of Y must also be converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   Since this second component does not decolorize bromine water, it is not a typical alkene. The most logical candidate is an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton. For a C₆ skeleton, this is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions and hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   Therefore, **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Total Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**\n*   Mixture X is converted to mixture Y upon heating with a platinum catalyst. This is described as a disproportionation reaction, which in this context is a hydrogen transfer.\n*   The overall reaction, given that both mixtures are equimolar, is:\n    `Component of X₁ + Component of X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   According to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms must be the same on both sides of the reaction.\n*   Let's balance the hydrogen atoms:\n    *   Total H atoms in the products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (one molecule of each of the two liquids in mixture X) must also be 18.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Components of Mixture X (Optional but Confirmatory)**\n*   The components of X must be C₆ cyclic compounds (since they hydrogenate to cyclohexane), they must be unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water), and they must not have conjugated bonds.\n*   The two compounds that fit this description and whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18 are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   Check: 10 + 8 = 18. Both are unsaturated, have a C₆ ring, and are non-conjugated (1,3-cyclohexadiene is the conjugated isomer and is excluded). This confirms the entire chemical scheme is plausible.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Based on the atom balance from the disproportionation reaction, this sum is 18.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 12\nB) 16\nC) 22\nD) 18\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct logical steps identified by the various agents.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance Z**\n\n*   **Composition:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage is a very close approximation of the fraction 1/7.\n*   **Formula Derivation:** Let the formula be CₓHᵧ. Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n    *   `7y = 12x + y`\n    *   `6y = 12x`\n    *   `y = 2x`\n*   **Structure Type:** The general formula is CₙH₂ₙ. The problem states Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" meaning it is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Specific Identity:** Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). This fits the CₙH₂ₙ formula and all other descriptions. Therefore, **Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   **Properties:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   **Composition:** One component of Y is Z (cyclohexane). Let the other component be Y₂.\n*   **Hydrogenation:** Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). Since cyclohexane is already saturated, it does not react. Therefore, the hydrogenation of Y₂ must also produce cyclohexane.\n*   **Identity of Y₂:** Y₂ must be a C₆ compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane but does not react with bromine water. The only compound that fits this description is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic and thus unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, but it can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Identify Mixture X**\n\n*   **The Reaction:** Mixture X is converted to mixture Y upon heating with platinum. This is a disproportionation reaction, which in this context is a catalytic hydrogen transfer.\n    *   `Mixture X (X₁ + X₂) → Mixture Y (Cyclohexane + Benzene)`\n*   **Conservation of Atoms:** Since the reaction starts with an equimolar mixture (X₁ + X₂) and produces an equimolar mixture (Y), we can write the reaction for single molecules:\n    *   `X₁ + X₂ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`\n*   **Hydrogen Balance:** By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of hydrogen atoms on the reactant side must equal the total on the product side.\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   **Conclusion:** The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of X₁ and one molecule of X₂) must be **18**.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Identities of Components in X (Optional but Confirmatory)**\n\n*   **Properties of X:** The components of X decolorize bromine water (unsaturated), have no conjugated bonds, and both hydrogenate to cyclohexane (meaning they are C₆ cyclic compounds).\n*   **Possible Structures:** We need two C₆ cyclic compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The most logical candidates are:\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**: Has one double bond (non-conjugated).\n    *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**: Has two non-conjugated double bonds. (The 1,3-isomer is conjugated and thus excluded).\n*   **Verification:** The sum of hydrogens is 10 + 8 = 18. This pair fits all conditions. The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a chemically sound hydrogen transfer.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

This value is a very close approximation of the fraction 1/7.\n2.  **Determine Empirical Formula:** Let the formula be CₓHᵧ. Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) ≈ 1/7`\n    *   `7y ≈ 12x + y`\n    *   `6y ≈ 12x`\n    *   `y/x ≈ 2`\n    *   The empirical formula is CH₂, so the molecular formula is CₙH₂ₙ.\n3.  **Determine Compound Type:** The problem states Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" meaning it is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a **cycloalkane**.\n4.  **Identify the Specific Compound:** Z is a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits the formula CₙH₂n (where n=6) and all other descriptions.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n1.  **Analyze Properties:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n2.  **Identify Components:**\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of Y.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives *only* Z. Since cyclohexane is already saturated, the other component of Y must also be converted to Z upon hydrogenation.\n    *   This second component does not decolorize bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. This is characteristic of an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton. The aromatic compound with a six-carbon ring is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions and hydrogenates to cyclohexane under \"severe conditions.\"\n3.  **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Final Answer**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction:** Mixture X is converted to mixture Y upon heating with a platinum catalyst. This is a **disproportionation** reaction, which in this context is a hydrogen transfer.\n2.  **Apply Conservation of Atoms:** Since both mixtures are equimolar, the reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `Liquid A (from X) + Liquid B (from X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n3.  **Balance Hydrogen Atoms:** The total number of atoms must be conserved.\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H in cyclohexane) + (H in benzene) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must also be 18.\n4.  **Answer the Question:** The question asks for \"the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\" This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two components, which we have determined to be 18.\n\n**(Verification):** The components of X must be unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds without conjugated bonds. The pair that fits this and the hydrogen count is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.

This value is approximately 1/7. For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. Since Z is saturated (it does not react further with hydrogen), it must be a cycloalkane. The problem also states it's a common solvent, and all components have the same carbon skeleton. This strongly points to Z being **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**, a classic C₆ system.\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One component is Z (cyclohexane). The other component must also have a C₆ skeleton (since hydrogenation of Y gives only Z) and must not react with bromine water. The most logical candidate is **benzene (C₆H₆)**, which is aromatic and unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions. Hydrogenation of benzene does indeed yield cyclohexane. Therefore, mixture Y is {cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), benzene (C₆H₆)}.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Mixture X:** Mixture X is converted to mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. Since both mixtures are equimolar, the reaction can be written as:\n    `Component of X₁ + Component of X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n\n4.  **Apply the Law of Conservation of Atoms:** The total number of atoms must be the same on both sides of the reaction. We are interested in the hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n5.  **Determine the Answer:** By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must also be 18.

Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n*   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. This formula corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which means it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem also states that Z is \"widely used as a solvent\" and is the sole product of several hydrogenations. This strongly suggests Z is the common and stable solvent, **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**2. Identification of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means the other component of Y must also be converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   Since this second component does not decolorize bromine water, it is not a simple alkene. The most logical candidate is an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton. For a C₆ skeleton, this is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.

Analysis of the Reaction and Identification of Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is converted to mixture Y upon heating with platinum in a disproportionation reaction. Since both are equimolar mixtures, the reaction can be written as:\n    `Component A + Component B (from Mixture X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆) (Mixture Y)`\n*   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms on both sides of the equation must be equal.\n*   Let's balance the hydrogen atoms:\n    *   Total H atoms in the products = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two reactant molecules from mixture X must also be 18.\n\n**4. Final Answer Calculation**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   Based on the atom balance from the reaction, this sum is 18.\n*   To confirm this, we can identify the components of X. They must be C₆ cyclic compounds (since they hydrogenate to cyclohexane), be unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water), and have no conjugated bonds. The pair that fits is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18, which confirms the result from the reaction balance.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer. The reasoning is synthesized from the common logical steps found in the candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\n*   **Careful Point**: The first crucial step is to correctly identify the central substance, Z.\n*   **Analysis**: Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   The problem states that Z is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The clues that Z is a \"widely used as a solvent\" and is the sole product of all hydrogenations strongly point to the most common and stable C₆ cycloalkane, **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n*   **Careful Point**: The properties of mixture Y allow for the deduction of its second component.\n*   **Analysis**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One component is Z (cyclohexane). The other component must also have a C₆ skeleton (since hydrogenation of Y gives only Z) and must not react with bromine water. The only compound that fits this description is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n*   Therefore, **Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Apply the Law of Conservation of Atoms\n*   **Careful Point**: The core of the problem is understanding the stoichiometry and applying the conservation of atoms to the disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Analysis**: Mixture X is converted to mixture Y in a disproportionation reaction. Since both are equimolar mixtures, the reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms on the reactant side must equal the total on the product side. We can balance the hydrogen atoms.\n*   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n*   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be **18**.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Plausibility of Mixture X (Optional Confirmation)\n*   **Careful Point**: The problem states that the components of X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   **Analysis**: The components of X must be C₆ cyclic compounds that are unsaturated.

This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. A hydrocarbon with a mass ratio of H:Total of 1:7 has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ. Since Z does not react further with hydrogen, it must be a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂₂ must be a cycloalkane. The problem also states Z is a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). This fits all the given information.\n\n2.  **Determine the Carbon Skeleton**: The hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane). This is a critical piece of information, as it implies that all compounds in both mixtures have the same carbon skeleton: a six-membered ring.\n\n3.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are either saturated or aromatic. We know one component is Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a C₆ skeleton and not react with bromine water, but it must be different from cyclohexane. The most logical candidate is benzene (C₆H₆), which is aromatic and does not react with bromine water under normal conditions. Hydrogenation of a mixture of cyclohexane and benzene would yield only cyclohexane, which matches the problem description. Therefore, mixture Y consists of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n\n4.  **Analyze the Reaction and Identify Mixture X**: Mixture X is converted to mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n    *   Reaction: `Component A + Component B (from Mixture X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆) (Mixture Y)`\n    *   Since this is a 1:1 reaction of equimolar mixtures, we can balance the atoms. The total number of hydrogen atoms in the products is 12 (from cyclohexane) + 6 (from benzene) = 18.\n    *   By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two reactant molecules from mixture X must also be 18.\n\n5.  **Answer the Question**: The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Based on the atom balance from the reaction, this sum is 18.\n\nTo confirm this is plausible, we can identify the components of X. They must be unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds without conjugated bonds. The pair that fits is cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 18. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identification of Substance Z**\n\n*   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is a very close approximation of the fraction 1/7.\n*   Let the molecular formula of Z be CₓHᵧ. Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n*   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   This formula corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane. The problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which means it is a saturated compound. This rules out alkenes, so Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The additional information that Z is \"widely used as a solvent\" and is the central compound in all the reactions strongly suggests it is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**, the most common cycloalkane solvent.\n\n**2. Identification of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is one of the components of Y.\n*   The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation on a platinum catalyst. This is a classic catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction, where an unsaturated cyclic compound is converted into a mixture of a fully saturated cycloalkane and a fully dehydrogenated aromatic compound.\n*   Therefore, the other component of Y must be **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   Let's check if this fits: Mixture Y = {cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), benzene (C₆H₆)}. Neither component decolorizes bromine water under normal conditions. Hydrogenation of this mixture would convert the benzene to cyclohexane, resulting in only cyclohexane (Z) as the final product. This is fully consistent with the problem description.\n\n**3. Identification of Mixture X and Calculation of the Final Answer**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that, upon heating with platinum, disproportionates into mixture Y.\n*   The overall reaction is: **Mixture X → Mixture Y**\n*   Substituting the identified components, the reaction is: **Component A + Component B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)**\n*   According to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms on the reactant side must equal the total on the product side.\n*   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the products (one molecule of cyclohexane and one molecule of benzene) is 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Since the reaction starts with an equimolar mixture (X) and produces an equimolar mixture (Y), the stoichiometry is 1:1 for all four compounds. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of component A and one molecule of component B) must also be 18.\n\n**4. Verification of the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   The problem states that mixture X decolorizes bromine water (so its components are unsaturated) and has no conjugated multiple bonds. Also, hydrogenation of X gives only cyclohexane, meaning both components are C₆ cyclic compounds.\n*   We need to find two non-conjugated, unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18.\n*   The most logical candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   Cyclohexene has one double bond and is not conjugated.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene has two isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds. (The other isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, is conjugated and thus excluded).\n*   The sum of the hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This confirms that our deduction from the conservation of atoms is consistent with a plausible chemical scenario.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Based on the atom balance of the reaction, this value is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan to solve this problem is to follow a logical deduction based on the chemical properties described in the question. The core of the solution lies in identifying the key substances and then applying the principle of conservation of atoms to the chemical reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:** I will first use the given mass fraction of hydrogen (14.28%) to determine the empirical formula of hydrocarbon Z. Combining this with the fact that Z is a saturated, common solvent, I can deduce its exact molecular formula and structure.\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y:** Knowing Z, I can identify the components of mixture Y. Y is an equimolar mixture containing Z, does not decolorize bromine water, and its components hydrogenate to Z. This strongly points to a mixture of a cycloalkane (Z) and its corresponding aromatic compound.\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Find the Answer:** The reaction where mixture X forms mixture Y is a disproportionation, which is a hydrogen transfer in this context. By applying the law of conservation of atoms to this reaction (`X₁ + X₂ → Y₁ + Y₂`), I can determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two molecules of mixture X without needing to identify their exact structures. The Python code will perform this final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the problem by deducing the number of hydrogen atoms\n    based on the conservation of atoms in the described chemical reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1 & 2: Identify the products of the reaction (Mixture Y).\n    # Based on the problem description:\n    # - Substance Z is a saturated hydrocarbon with H mass fraction ~14.28% (1/7),\n    #   making it a cycloalkane (CnH2n).

Identify Substance Z**\n*   **Information:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. It is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen) and is a common solvent.\n*   **Analysis:** A mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28% is equivalent to 1/7. For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `y = 2x`. The general formula is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   Since Z is saturated, it must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The most common cycloalkane used as a solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   **Conclusion:** All agents correctly identify Z as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n\n**2. Identify the Carbon Skeleton**\n*   **Information:** Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a critical point. It means that all components in both mixtures must have a six-carbon ring skeleton that can be converted to cyclohexane upon adding hydrogen.\n*   **Conclusion:** All compounds involved are C₆ cyclic compounds.\n\n**3. Identify Mixture Y**\n*   **Information:** Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. It does not decolorize bromine water. One component is Z (cyclohexane). Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** Since one component is cyclohexane, the other component must also be a C₆ cyclic compound that does not decolorize bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. The only compound that fits this description is benzene (C₆H₆). Benzene is aromatic and thus unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, but it hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   **Conclusion:** All agents correctly identify mixture Y as an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n\n**4. Analyze the Reaction and Identify Mixture X**\n*   **Information:** Mixture X is converted to mixture Y in a disproportionation reaction. `X₁ + X₂ → Y₁ + Y₂`.\n*   **Analysis:** Substituting the known components of Y, the reaction is: `X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total number in the products.\n*   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of each) must also be 18.\n\n**5. Verify the Components of Mixture X**\n*   **Information:** The components of X decolorize bromine water (they are unsaturated) and have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   **Analysis:** We need two different unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The logical candidates are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and a non-conjugated cyclohexadiene. The non-conjugated isomer is 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n*   Let's check the sum of hydrogen atoms: 10 + 8 = 18. This matches the requirement from the reaction balance.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture X consists of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. As determined from the conservation of atoms in the reaction `X → Y`, this is the sum of hydrogen atoms in the products, cyclohexane (12 H) and benzene (6 H).\nTotal H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\nThis is also confirmed by identifying the components of X as cyclohexene (10 H) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (8 H).\nTotal H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThe calculated answer is 18. Looking at the options:\nA) 12\nB) 16\nC) 18\nD) 22\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided solutions.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:** All candidate answers correctly deduce the identity of substance Z. The mass fraction of hydrogen (14.28% ≈ 1/7) and the fact that it's a saturated hydrocarbon lead to the general formula CₙH₂ₙ, which corresponds to a cycloalkane. The additional clues that it's a common solvent and the final product of all hydrogenations strongly point to **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This is a consistent and correct starting point in all analyses.\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y:** All candidate answers correctly identify mixture Y.\n    *   It's an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   One component is Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   It does not decolorize bromine water. This means the second component is saturated or aromatic.\n    *   The reaction forming Y is a disproportionation (hydrogen transfer). If one product is the fully hydrogenated cyclohexane, the other must be the fully dehydrogenated product, which is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n    *   This fits all conditions: benzene doesn't decolorize bromine water, and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane.\n    *   Therefore, Mixture Y = {cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), benzene (C₆H₆)}.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Find the Answer:** The core of the problem lies in the conservation of atoms during the disproportionation reaction.\n    *   Reaction: Mixture X → Mixture Y\n    *   Since both are equimolar mixtures, the reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n        `X₁ + X₂ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`\n    *   By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms on the reactant side must equal the total on the product side.\n    *   Let's balance the hydrogen atoms:\n        Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene)\n        Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (one molecule of X₁ and one molecule of X₂) must also be 18.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The question asks for \"the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\". This is precisely the sum we calculated from the atom balance of the reaction. The answer is 18.\n\n5.  **Reviewing Candidate Choices:** The provided options are A) 16, B) 22, C) 12, D) 18. The calculated answer, 18, corresponds to option D. While several candidate answers correctly perform the logical deduction to arrive at the number 18, some of them incorrectly map this number to the wrong letter option. The reasoning across all solutions is sound and consistently points to 18.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identification of Substance Z**\n\n*   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (since 1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n*   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CₓHᵧ. Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n*   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ. This formula corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem specifies that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" meaning it is a saturated compound. This rules out alkenes, so Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The clues that Z is \"widely used as a solvent\" and that all other compounds in the problem can be hydrogenated to it strongly suggest a common and stable structure. Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) is the most common cycloalkane solvent and fits the CₙH₂ₙ formula. This is a very strong candidate for Z.\n\n**2. Identification of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. Since cyclohexane is already saturated, it does not react. Therefore, the other component of Y must also be converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   This second component must not decolorize bromine water, which points to it being an aromatic compound. The aromatic compound with a six-carbon skeleton is benzene (C₆H₆). Benzene does not react with bromine water under normal conditions and is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Reaction and Identification of Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is converted to mixture Y upon heating with platinum in a disproportionation reaction. This type of reaction involves a hydrogen transfer where one molecule is reduced and another is oxidized.\n*   The overall reaction, given that the mixtures are equimolar, is:\n    `Liquid A (from X) + Liquid B (from X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total number in the products.\n*   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be 18.\n\n**4. Verification of the Properties of Mixture X**\n\n*   The problem states that mixture X decolorizes bromine water (so its components are unsaturated) and has no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Since hydrogenation of X yields only cyclohexane, its components must be C₆ cyclic compounds.\n*   We need two unsaturated, non-conjugated C₆ cyclic compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The most logical candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   Cyclohexene has one double bond and is not conjugated.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene has two isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds. The other isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, is conjugated and thus excluded.\n*   The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This confirms the result from the atom balance and fits all the problem's constraints.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Based on the conservation of atoms in the disproportionation reaction, this value is 18.\n\nThe options are:\nA) 22\nB) 18\nC) 16\nD) 12\n\nThe correct answer is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the logic from the provided answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\n*   **Information**: Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. It is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen) and is a common solvent.\n*   **Analysis**: The mass fraction of 14.28% is equivalent to 1/7. For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is approximately `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point**: A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Conclusion**: The most common cycloalkane used as a solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). This fits the formula (n=6, 2n=12) and all other descriptions. Therefore, **Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n*   **Information**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. Z (cyclohexane) is one of its components. Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n*   **Analysis**: One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must not decolorize bromine water (suggesting it is saturated or aromatic) and must hydrogenate to form cyclohexane.\n*   **Careful Point**: The reaction forming Y is a disproportionation, which often involves creating a fully saturated compound and a fully unsaturated (aromatic) one.\n*   **Conclusion**: The only logical second component is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions, and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane. Therefore, **Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Properties of Mixture X\n*   **Information**: An equimolar mixture X undergoes disproportionation upon heating with platinum to form the equimolar mixture Y.\n*   **Analysis**: The reaction is:\n    (Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)\n*   **Careful Point**: The law of conservation of atoms must apply. The total number of atoms on the reactant side must equal the total on the product side.\n*   **Conclusion**: The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two product molecules is 12 + 6 = 18. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two reactant molecules (the two liquids of mixture X) must also be **18**.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Components of Mixture X (for consistency)\n*   **Information**: The components of X decolorize bromine water (are unsaturated), have no conjugated bonds, and both hydrogenate to form only cyclohexane.\n*   **Analysis**: This means the components must be unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds without conjugated double bonds. The two most plausible candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**. The other isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, is conjugated and thus excluded.\n*   **Careful Point**: Check if this pair fits the hydrogen count derived in Step 3.\n*   **Conclusion**: The sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene (10) and one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (8) is 10 + 8 = 18.

Setting this to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ. Since Z does not react further with hydrogen, it must be a saturated compound, which means it is a cycloalkane. The problem also states Z is a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), which fits the formula and description.\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One of its components is Z (cyclohexane). The entire mixture Y, when hydrogenated, yields only Z. This means the second component of Y must also be a C₆ compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Since this second component does not decolorize bromine water, it must be aromatic. The only C₆ aromatic compound is benzene (C₆H₆). Therefore, mixture Y consists of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction**: Mixture X is converted to mixture Y upon heating with a platinum catalyst. This is a disproportionation reaction, which in this context is a hydrogen transfer. Since both mixtures are equimolar, the reaction can be written as:\n    `Component of X₁ + Component of X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**: According to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms must be the same on both sides of the chemical equation. We can balance the hydrogen atoms:\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of each) must also be 18.\n\n5.  **Verify the Components of Mixture X**: The components of X must be unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds without conjugated bonds. The pair that fits this description and whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18 is cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This confirms the result from the atom balance.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is 18.

This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n*   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CₓHᵧ. Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n*   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits all the given information.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means the other component of Y must also be converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   Since this second component does not decolorize bromine water, it is not a typical alkene. The most logical candidate is an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton. For a C₆ skeleton, this is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions and hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   Therefore, **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Total Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**\n*   Mixture X is converted to mixture Y upon heating with a platinum catalyst. This is described as a disproportionation reaction, which in this context is a hydrogen transfer.\n*   The overall reaction, given that both mixtures are equimolar, is:\n    `Component of X₁ + Component of X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   According to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms must be the same on both sides of the reaction.\n*   Let's balance the hydrogen atoms:\n    *   Total H atoms in the products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (one molecule of each of the two liquids in mixture X) must also be 18.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Components of Mixture X (Optional but Confirmatory)**\n*   The components of X must be C₆ cyclic compounds (since they hydrogenate to cyclohexane), they must be unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water), and they must not have conjugated bonds.\n*   The two compounds that fit this description and whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18 are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   Check: 10 + 8 = 18. Both are unsaturated, have a C₆ ring, and are non-conjugated (1,3-cyclohexadiene is the conjugated isomer and is excluded). This confirms the entire chemical scheme is plausible.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

This percentage is a very close approximation of the fraction 1/7.\n*   **Formula Derivation:** Let the formula be CₓHᵧ. Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n    *   `7y = 12x + y`\n    *   `6y = 12x`\n    *   `y = 2x`\n*   **Structure Type:** The general formula is CₙH₂ₙ. The problem states Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" meaning it is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Specific Identity:** Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). This fits the CₙH₂ₙ formula and all other descriptions. Therefore, **Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   **Properties:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   **Composition:** One component of Y is Z (cyclohexane). Let the other component be Y₂.\n*   **Hydrogenation:** Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). Since cyclohexane is already saturated, it does not react. Therefore, the hydrogenation of Y₂ must also produce cyclohexane.\n*   **Identity of Y₂:** Y₂ must be a C₆ compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane but does not react with bromine water. The only compound that fits this description is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic and thus unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, but it can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Identify Mixture X**\n\n*   **The Reaction:** Mixture X is converted to mixture Y upon heating with platinum. This is a disproportionation reaction, which in this context is a catalytic hydrogen transfer.\n    *   `Mixture X (X₁ + X₂) → Mixture Y (Cyclohexane + Benzene)`\n*   **Conservation of Atoms:** Since the reaction starts with an equimolar mixture (X₁ + X₂) and produces an equimolar mixture (Y), we can write the reaction for single molecules:\n    *   `X₁ + X₂ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`\n*   **Hydrogen Balance:** By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of hydrogen atoms on the reactant side must equal the total on the product side.\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   **Conclusion:** The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of X₁ and one molecule of X₂) must be **18**.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Identities of Components in X (Optional but Confirmatory)**\n\n*   **Properties of X:** The components of X decolorize bromine water (unsaturated), have no conjugated bonds, and both hydrogenate to cyclohexane (meaning they are C₆ cyclic compounds).\n*   **Possible Structures:** We need two C₆ cyclic compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The most logical candidates are:\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**: Has one double bond (non-conjugated).\n    *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**: Has two non-conjugated double bonds. (The 1,3-isomer is conjugated and thus excluded).\n*   **Verification:** The sum of hydrogens is 10 + 8 = 18. This pair fits all conditions. The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a chemically sound hydrogen transfer.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

This value is a very close approximation of the fraction 1/7.\n2.  **Determine Empirical Formula:** Let the formula be CₓHᵧ. Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) ≈ 1/7`\n    *   `7y ≈ 12x + y`\n    *   `6y ≈ 12x`\n    *   `y/x ≈ 2`\n    *   The empirical formula is CH₂, so the molecular formula is CₙH₂ₙ.\n3.  **Determine Compound Type:** The problem states Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" meaning it is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a **cycloalkane**.\n4.  **Identify the Specific Compound:** Z is a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits the formula CₙH₂n (where n=6) and all other descriptions.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n1.  **Analyze Properties:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n2.  **Identify Components:**\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of Y.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives *only* Z. Since cyclohexane is already saturated, the other component of Y must also be converted to Z upon hydrogenation.\n    *   This second component does not decolorize bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. This is characteristic of an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton. The aromatic compound with a six-carbon ring is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions and hydrogenates to cyclohexane under \"severe conditions.\"\n3.  **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Final Answer**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction:** Mixture X is converted to mixture Y upon heating with a platinum catalyst. This is a **disproportionation** reaction, which in this context is a hydrogen transfer.\n2.  **Apply Conservation of Atoms:** Since both mixtures are equimolar, the reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `Liquid A (from X) + Liquid B (from X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n3.  **Balance Hydrogen Atoms:** The total number of atoms must be conserved.\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H in cyclohexane) + (H in benzene) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must also be 18.\n4.  **Answer the Question:** The question asks for \"the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\" This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two components, which we have determined to be 18.\n\n**(Verification):** The components of X must be unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds without conjugated bonds. The pair that fits this and the hydrogen count is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**. The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18, confirming the result.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:** The problem states Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This value is approximately 1/7. For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. Since Z is saturated (it does not react further with hydrogen), it must be a cycloalkane. The problem also states it's a common solvent, and all components have the same carbon skeleton. This strongly points to Z being **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**, a classic C₆ system.\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One component is Z (cyclohexane). The other component must also have a C₆ skeleton (since hydrogenation of Y gives only Z) and must not react with bromine water. The most logical candidate is **benzene (C₆H₆)**, which is aromatic and unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions. Hydrogenation of benzene does indeed yield cyclohexane. Therefore, mixture Y is {cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), benzene (C₆H₆)}.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Mixture X:** Mixture X is converted to mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. Since both mixtures are equimolar, the reaction can be written as:\n    `Component of X₁ + Component of X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n\n4.  **Apply the Law of Conservation of Atoms:** The total number of atoms must be the same on both sides of the reaction. We are interested in the hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n5.  **Determine the Answer:** By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must also be 18.

Identification of Substance Z**\n\n*   Substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n*   Let the molecular formula of Z be CₓHᵧ. Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n*   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. This formula corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which means it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem also states that Z is \"widely used as a solvent\" and is the sole product of several hydrogenations. This strongly suggests Z is the common and stable solvent, **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**2. Identification of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means the other component of Y must also be converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   Since this second component does not decolorize bromine water, it is not a simple alkene. The most logical candidate is an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton. For a C₆ skeleton, this is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions and hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Reaction and Identification of Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is converted to mixture Y upon heating with platinum in a disproportionation reaction. Since both are equimolar mixtures, the reaction can be written as:\n    `Component A + Component B (from Mixture X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆) (Mixture Y)`\n*   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms on both sides of the equation must be equal.\n*   Let's balance the hydrogen atoms:\n    *   Total H atoms in the products = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two reactant molecules from mixture X must also be 18.\n\n**4. Final Answer Calculation**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   Based on the atom balance from the reaction, this sum is 18.\n*   To confirm this, we can identify the components of X. They must be C₆ cyclic compounds (since they hydrogenate to cyclohexane), be unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water), and have no conjugated bonds. The pair that fits is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18, which confirms the result from the reaction balance.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.

It is also a common solvent.\n*   **Analysis:** A hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28% is equivalent to 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is approximately `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The empirical formula is CH₂.\n*   A saturated hydrocarbon with the general formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Given that Z is a widely used solvent, the most common and logical candidate is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.

By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total in the products.\n    *   Total atoms in products = (C₆H₁₂) + (C₆H₆) = C₁₂H₁₈.\n    *   Therefore, the two molecules making up mixture X must also have a total of 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Since hydrogenation of X yields only cyclohexane, both components of X must have a C₆ carbon skeleton. Let the components be C₆Hₐ and C₆Hₑ.\n*   From the atom balance, we can conclude: **a + b = 18**.\n\n**4.
