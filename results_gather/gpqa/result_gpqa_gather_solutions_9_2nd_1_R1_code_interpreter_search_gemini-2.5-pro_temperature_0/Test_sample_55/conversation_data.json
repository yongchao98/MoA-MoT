Understand the Physical Process**\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay happens via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, which implies there is an intermediate state.

Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate $l'=1$ state. Since there are three equally probable outcomes, the probability (or branching ratio) for the atom to decay into any single one of them is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Probability of the second step ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p subshell), its only allowed E1 decay channel to a lower principal quantum number is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the 1s state).

The probability is incorrect (it should be $\\frac{1}{3}$).\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Physical Process\n\nThe problem describes a two-step decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition. This means the decay proceeds through an intermediate state, let's call it $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 2. Application of Electric Dipole Selection Rules\n\nThe selection rules for an E1 transition are:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   For a decay process, the principal quantum number must decrease ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n### 3. Determining the Intermediate State\n\nLet's apply the selection rules to both transitions.\n\n**First transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n*   **Initial state:** $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** Since $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** Since $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta n < 0$:** The intermediate state must have $n' < 3$. The options provided all point to an intermediate state with $n'=2$.\n\n**Second transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   **Final state:** $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** The change is $l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is consistent with the intermediate state having $l'=1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** The change is $m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This is allowed for all possible intermediate $m'$ values ($-1, 0, 1$).\n\nCombining these conditions, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This confirms that the transition routes listed in the options are all physically possible.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)\n\nThe crucial part of the question is to determine the probability of a specific route.\n\n*   **First Step Probability:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. When it decays, the emission of the photon is isotropic (equal in all directions). Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels of the intermediate state ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$). Since there are three equally probable outcomes, the probability (or branching ratio) for the atom to decay into any single one of these states is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Second Step Probability:** Once the atom is in an intermediate state, for example $|2,1,0\\rangle$, it will decay to a lower energy level. The only state with $n<2$ that it can decay to via an E1 transition is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only available decay channel, the probability of this second step is 1.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of the individual steps.\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2})$\n    $P(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n### 5. Conclusion and Final Answer Selection\n\nThe analysis shows that any of the three possible routes has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. We must now find the option that matches this result.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (**Correct** route and probability)\n\nAll candidate answers, through correct physical reasoning, arrive at the same conclusion that the probability is 1/3. Option D is the only choice that reflects this correct result.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nOf course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the task:\n\nFirst, I will analyze the physics of the problem. The decay of a hydrogen atom from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two dipole transitions is governed by specific quantum mechanical selection rules. I will apply these rules step-by-step to determine the possible intermediate states.\n\nSecond, I will calculate the probability, also known as the branching ratio, for each possible decay path. This involves a key insight about the symmetry of the initial state. The $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state is spherically symmetric, which implies that the decay to the possible intermediate states must be equally probable.\n\nFinally, I will write a Python script to formalize this reasoning. The script will define the options, calculate the correct probability based on the number of possible decay channels, and then iterate through the options to find the one that matches both the valid transition route and the correct probability. The script will then print the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_hydrogen_decay_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the two-step dipole decay of a hydrogen atom from |3,0,0> to |1,0,0>\n    to determine the correct transition route and its probability.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the problem and selection rules.\n    # The process is |3,0,0> -> |n',l',m'> -> |1,0,0>\n    # Selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions are:\n    # delta_l = +/- 1\n    # delta_m = 0, +/- 1\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the possible intermediate states |n',l',m'>.\n    # First transition: |3,0,0> -> |n',l',m'>\n    # Initial state has l=0, m=0.\n    # Applying delta_l = +/- 1 gives l' = 1.\n    # Applying delta_m = 0, +/- 1 gives m' = -1, 0, or 1.\n    # For decay, n' must be < 3.

Understand the Physical Process**\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (the 3s state) to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (the 1s ground state). The decay is not direct but occurs via a two-step process, with each step being an electric dipole (E1) transition. This implies the existence of an intermediate state.\n\n**2. Apply the Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules**\nFor an E1 transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to the following rules:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number: $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number: $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay process (emission of a photon), the principal quantum number must decrease: $\\Delta n < 0$.\n\n**3. Determine the Possible Intermediate States**\nLet the intermediate state be $|n', l', m'\\rangle$. We apply the selection rules to both transitions in the cascade: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   Initial state: $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: Since $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: Since $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, 1, \\text{ or } -1$.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta n < 0$: The intermediate state must have $n' < 3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   Final state: $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: The change is $l_f - l' = 0 - l' = \\pm 1$. This requires $l'=1$, which is consistent with the first transition.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta n < 0$: The change is $n_f - n' = 1 - n' < 0$, which requires $n' > 1$.\n\n*   **Combining the conditions:** We need an intermediate state with $l'=1$, $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, and a principal quantum number $n'$ that satisfies both $n'<3$ and $n'>1$. The only integer value for $n'$ is 2.\n*   **Conclusion:** The possible intermediate states are the three degenerate 2p states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All routes listed in the options are physically possible based on the selection rules.\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This probability is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition.\n\n*   **Key Point: Symmetry.** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means its wavefunction has no angular dependence, and there is no preferred direction in space.\n*   **Implication of Symmetry:** When an atom in a spherically symmetric state decays, the emission of the photon is isotropic (equal in all directions). Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the available degenerate final states. In this case, the three intermediate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are degenerate and differ only in their spatial orientation (the value of $m'$).\n*   **Calculating the Branching Ratio:** Since there are three equally probable decay channels for the first step, and these are the only allowed channels to the n=2 shell, the probability of the atom taking any single one of these paths is exactly $1/3$.\n*   **Probability of the Second Step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, its only allowed E1 decay channel is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Therefore, the probability of this second transition is 1.\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps. For the route via $|2,1,0\\rangle$:\n    $P = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    The same probability of $1/3$ applies to the routes via $|2,1,1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n**5. Compare with the Given Options**\nWe need to find the option that lists a valid route with the correct probability of $1/3$.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. **This is a valid route with the correct probability.**\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect (it should be $1/3$).\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect (it should be $1/3$).\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physical Process\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay does not happen in a single step but through a two-step process, where each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition. This implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 2. Applying the Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\nFor an E1 transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to the following selection rules:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum:** $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in principal quantum number:** For a decay (emission of a photon), the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n### 3. Determining the Intermediate State $|n',l',m'\\rangle$\n\n**First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n*   The initial state has $l=0$. Applying the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n*   The initial state has $m=0$. Applying the $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, 1, \\text{ or } -1$.\n*   The initial state has $n=3$. The intermediate state must have $n' < 3$. The options suggest $n'=2$.\n\n**Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   Let's verify if a transition from the potential intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n*   The change in orbital angular momentum is $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   The change in magnetic quantum number is $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m' = 0 - m'$. This is allowed for all possible intermediate values of $m'$ (i.e., for $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$).\n\nCombining these, we find that there are three possible, physically allowed, intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This means there are three possible decay routes.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Probability of a Specific Route\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route, for example, the one passing through the intermediate state $|2,1,0\\rangle$. This probability is the branching ratio for the first step of the decay.\n\n*   **The key insight lies in the symmetry of the initial state.** The state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space.\n*   Because the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) cannot favor one direction over another. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels of the intermediate state: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n*   Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first transition, and these are the only allowed E1 channels to the $n=2$ shell, the probability of the atom decaying into any *single specific* intermediate state is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   The probability of the second step (e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$) is 1, because once the atom is in the $2p$ state, the only allowed E1 decay channel to a lower energy level is to the $1s$ ground state.\n\nTherefore, the total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is:\n$P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 5. Comparing with the Options\nWe now check the given options against our result that any valid route has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1.

This is not a direct transition but a two-step process, also known as a cascade decay, involving two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies the existence of an intermediate state.\n\nThe overall process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n### 2. Applying the Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\nFor an E1 transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to the following rules:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in principal quantum number:** For a decay (emission), energy must be lost, so $n$ must decrease.\n\n### 3. Determining the Intermediate State $|n',l',m'\\rangle$\nWe apply the selection rules to both steps of the decay.\n\n**Step 1: Transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n*   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   The initial state has $n=3$. The intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n**Step 2: Transition from $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   The final state has $l_f=0$. Since the intermediate state has $l'=1$, the change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n*   The final state has $n_f=1$. The intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\nCombining the conditions on the principal quantum number $n'$, we have $n'<3$ and $n'>1$. The only integer that satisfies this is $n'=2$.\n\nTherefore, there are three possible intermediate states, all with $n'=2$ and $l'=1$:\n1.  $|2,1,-1\\rangle$\n2.  $|2,1,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|2,1,1\\rangle$\n\nAll three corresponding decay routes are physically possible.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Probability of a Specific Route\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is the branching ratio for the first step of the decay, multiplied by the probability of the second step.\n\n*   **Probability of the first step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$):**\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. When such a state decays, the emission is isotropic, and it is equally likely to transition into any of the available magnetic sublevels of the final state. Since there are three possible intermediate states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) that are degenerate in energy (in the absence of external fields), the total probability is split equally among them.\n    Therefore, the probability of transitioning to any single specific intermediate state is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Probability of the second step ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    Once the atom is in one of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p level), the only lower-energy state it can decay to via an E1 transition is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the 1s level). Since this is the only allowed decay channel, the probability of this transition is 1.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    The total probability for any specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps.\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 5. Evaluating the Options\nWe must find the option that lists a valid route with the correct probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ — The probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ — The probability is incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ — The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ — The probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical Process:** The problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. This decay happens via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, which implies there is an intermediate state.\n\n2.  **Apply E1 Selection Rules:** The rules for an E1 transition are:\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l$, must be $\\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m$, must be $0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   For a decay process, the principal quantum number, $n$, must decrease.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State:** Let the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n    *   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n        *   The initial state has $l=0$.

For a decay, $n'$ must be less than 3.\n    *   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For the transition to be allowed from the intermediate state with $l'=1$, the change is $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is a valid change.\n        *   The final state has $n_f=1$. For this to be a decay from the intermediate state, we must have $n' > 1$.\n    *   **Combining the conditions:** We need $n' < 3$ and $n' > 1$. The only integer value for $n'$ is 2. Thus, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.

This means the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the available degenerate final states.\n    *   The available states for the first transition are the three degenerate magnetic sublevels: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n    *   Since there are three equally likely outcomes for the first step, the probability (or branching ratio) of transitioning to any single one of them is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   For the second step (e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$), this is the only allowed E1 decay channel to a lower energy level.

Understanding the Physical Process\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay does not happen in a single step but through a two-step process, with each step being an electric dipole (E1) transition. This implies the existence of an intermediate state.\n\nThe overall process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 transition}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 transition}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n### 2. Applying the Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\nFor an E1 transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to the following selection rules:\n*   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   For a decay (emission), the principal quantum number *n* must decrease.\n\n### 3. Determining the Intermediate State $|n',l',m'\\rangle$\nWe apply the selection rules to both transitions to constrain the properties of the intermediate state.\n\n**First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n*   **Initial state:** $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** Since the initial $l=0$, the orbital quantum number must increase. Thus, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** Since the initial $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, 1,$ or $-1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta n < 0$:** The principal quantum number must be less than 3, so $n'<3$.\n\n**Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   **Final state:** $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** The change is $l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is consistent with the rule and confirms that the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta n < 0$:** The change is $n_f - n' = 1 - n' < 0$, which means $n'>1$.\n\nCombining the conditions on $n'$ ($n'<3$ and $n'>1$), the only possible integer value for the intermediate principal quantum number is $n'=2$.\n\nTherefore, there are three possible intermediate states, leading to three possible decay routes:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nAll routes listed in the options are physically possible.

Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of the first step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$):**\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. When such a state decays, the emission is isotropic (equal in all directions), and there is no preference for which magnetic sublevel ($m'$) of the final state is populated. The three possible intermediate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are therefore populated with equal probability. Since these are the only three allowed outcomes for the first step, their probabilities must sum to 1. Thus, the probability of transitioning to any single one of them is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Probability of the second step ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p level), the only allowed E1 decay to a lower principal quantum number is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the 1s level). Since this is the only possible decay channel, the probability of this transition is 1.\n\n*   **Total Probability for a specific route:**\n    The total probability is the product of the probabilities of the two steps. For any of the three routes:\n    Total Probability = (Probability of first step) $\\times$ (Probability of second step) = $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 5.

Understanding the Physical Process\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay does not happen in a single step but through a two-step process, with each step being an electric dipole (E1) transition. This implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state.\nThe process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n### 2. Applying the Selection Rules\nThe electric dipole (E1) transitions are governed by a set of selection rules that dictate which transitions are \"allowed\":\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l$, must be $\\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m$, must be $0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay process (emission), the principal quantum number, $n$, must decrease.\n\n### 3. Determining the Intermediate State\nLet's analyze the first transition from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n*   **Initial State:** $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** Since the initial $l=0$, the only possibility is $\\Delta l = +1$. Therefore, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** Since the initial $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, 1,$ or $-1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta n < 0$:** The principal quantum number must decrease, so $n'<3$. The options provided all point to an intermediate state with $n'=2$. This is also the most common decay path ($3s \\to 2p$).\n*   **Conclusion:** The possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\nNext, we verify that a transition from these intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n*   **Intermediate State:** $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n*   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** The change is $l_{final} - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed transition.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** The change is $m_{final} - m' = 0 - m'$. This is allowed for all possible intermediate $m'$ values ($-1, 0, 1$).\n*   **Conclusion:** All three routes are physically possible.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Probability\nThe core of the question is to determine the probability of a specific route. This is the branching ratio of the first transition.\n*   **Key Insight:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space.\n*   **Symmetry Argument:** Because the initial state is isotropic, the decay process must also be isotropic (when averaged over all photon directions and polarizations). This means there can be no preference for decaying into one of the magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) over the others.\n*   **Equal Probabilities:** The three possible intermediate states, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, must be populated with equal probability.\n*   **Branching Ratio:** Since there are three equally likely outcomes for the first transition, and these are the only significant decay channels, the probability for any single specific channel is $1/3$.\n*   **Second Transition:** Once the atom is in an intermediate state like $|2,1,0\\rangle$, the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps. For the route via $|2,1,0\\rangle$:\n    $P = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 5.

Understand the Physical Process**\n\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The decay happens via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, which implies there is an intermediate state.

Apply the Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules**\n\nFor a transition to be allowed by the E1 mechanism, the quantum numbers must change according to these rules:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   For decay (emission), the principal quantum number must decrease: $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n**3. Determine the Possible Intermediate States**\n\nWe apply the selection rules to both steps of the decay.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. The rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. The intermediate state must have $n'<3$. The options provided all point to an intermediate state with $n'=2$, which is the most common decay path ($3s \\rightarrow 2p$). This is also consistent with the second transition, which requires $n'>1$.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   Let's check if a transition from the possible intermediate states to the final state is allowed.\n    *   The change in $l$ is $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n    *   The change in $m$ is $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m' = 0 - m'$. This is allowed for all possible intermediate values of $m'$ (i.e., for $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$).\n    *   This confirms that all three routes are physically possible.\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is determined by the branching ratio of the first step of the decay.\n\n*   The crucial physical principle is that the initial state, $|3,0,0\\rangle$, is an s-state. Its wavefunction is spherically symmetric, meaning it has no preferred orientation in space.\n*   The decay process (spontaneous emission), when averaged over all photon directions and polarizations, is isotropic.\n*   Because the initial state and the interaction are both isotropic, there can be no preference for decaying into one of the three degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$) over the others.\n*   Therefore, the three possible decay paths for the first step must be **equally probable**.\n*   Since these are the only three allowed E1 decay channels to the $n=2$ level, their probabilities must sum to 1. The probability for any single channel is therefore $1/3$.\n*   The probability of the second step (e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$) is 1, as this is the only allowed E1 decay path to a lower energy level.\n*   The total probability for any one of the specific cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of each step: $P_{total} = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**5.

Understand the Physical Process**\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay happens via a two-step process, with each step being an electric dipole (E1) transition. This implies the existence of an intermediate state. The overall process is:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**2. Apply the Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules**\nFor a transition to be allowed under the E1 approximation, the quantum numbers must change as follows:\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum:** $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$.\n*   **Magnetic Quantum Number:** $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   **Principal Quantum Number:** For a decay (emission of a photon), the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n**3. Determine the Intermediate State $|n',l',m'\\rangle$**\nWe apply the selection rules to both steps of the decay.\n\n*   **For Step 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   Initial state has $l=0$. The rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n    *   Initial state has $m=0$. The rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Initial state has $n=3$. The rule $n'<n$ means $n'$ must be 1 or 2. However, for a state to exist, we must have $l' \\le n'-1$. Since $l'=1$, we need $n' \\ge 2$. Combining these, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are the three degenerate $2p$ states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n*   **For Step 2: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   Let's verify this transition is allowed. The change in $l$ is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed. The change in $m$ is $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$, which is also allowed for all possible $m'$ values ($-1, 0, 1$).\n    *   This confirms that all three routes via the $2p$ sublevels are physically possible.\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is determined by the branching ratio of the first step, as the second step has a probability of 1 (it's the only available decay channel from the $2p$ state).\n\n*   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space.\n*   Due to this symmetry, the decay process must be isotropic. This means the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$).\n*   Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first transition, and they are the only allowed channels, the probability for any single channel is exactly $1/3$.\n\n**5.

Understanding the Physical Process\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay does not happen in a single step but through a two-step process, with each step being an electric dipole (E1) transition. This implies the existence of an intermediate state.\n\nThe overall process is:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 2. Applying the Electric Dipole Selection Rules\nFor an E1 transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to the following selection rules:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   For a decay process, the principal quantum number must decrease ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n### 3. Determining the Intermediate State $|n',l',m'\\rangle$\n\n*   **Analysis of Step 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. The intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Analysis of Step 2: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For the transition to be allowed from an intermediate state with $l'=1$, the change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is a valid change.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. The intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n*   **Combining the conditions:** We need an intermediate state with $l'=1$ and $1 < n' < 3$. The only integer value for $n'$ is 2. Therefore, the possible intermediate states are the three degenerate states of the 2p subshell: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All three routes are physically possible.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific decay route. This is determined by the branching ratio of the first step, as the second step is guaranteed to happen with probability 1 (it's the only allowed E1 decay channel from the 2p state).\n\n*   The initial state, $|3,0,0\\rangle$, is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space.\n*   Due to this symmetry, when the atom decays, the emission of the photon is isotropic. There is no preference for the atom to be left in any particular magnetic sublevel ($m'$) of the intermediate state.\n*   Therefore, the probabilities of transitioning to each of the three possible intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$) are equal.\n*   Since these are the only three possible outcomes for the first step, and their probabilities must sum to 1, the probability for any single specific route is exactly $1/3$.\n\n### 5. Evaluating the Options\nWe need to find the option that lists a valid route with the correct probability of $1/3$.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n\nBased on the analysis, option D is the only one that correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Process:** The problem describes a two-step decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition, which means there must be an intermediate state.\n\n2.  **Apply E1 Selection Rules:** Electric dipole transitions are governed by a set of selection rules that dictate how the quantum numbers can change:\n    *   The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by one: $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   The magnetic quantum number must change by zero or one: $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   For a decay process (emission of a photon), the principal quantum number *n* must decrease.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State:** Let the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n    *   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n        *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n        *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n        *   The principal quantum number must decrease ($n'<3$). The options suggest $n'=2$.\n    *   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For the transition from the intermediate state to be allowed, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$ (since $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$). This is consistent with the first step.\n        *   The final state has $n_f=1$, so the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n    *   **Conclusion for the Intermediate State:** Combining the conditions ($n'<3$ and $n'>1$), the intermediate state must have $n'=2$. Therefore, the three possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All routes listed in the options are physically possible according to the selection rules.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio):** The question asks for the probability of a specific decay route. This is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    *   **Probability of the First Step:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. When it decays, the emission is isotropic (equal in all directions). Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$). Since there are three equally probable outcomes, the probability of transitioning to any single one of them is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   **Probability of the Second Step:** Once the atom is in an intermediate state, for example $|2,1,0\\rangle$, it must decay to a lower energy level. The only state it can decay to via an E1 transition is the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n    *   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps: $P_{total} = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:** We must find the option that lists a valid route with the correct probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   B) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. This option presents a valid route with the correctly calculated probability.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physical Process\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay occurs through two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, which implies the existence of an intermediate state. The overall process is:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 transition 1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 transition 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 2. Applying the Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\nThe selection rules for an E1 transition are:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay process (emission), the principal quantum number must decrease ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n### 3. Determining the Intermediate State $|n',l',m'\\rangle$\nWe apply the selection rules to both transitions.\n\n*   **Transition 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   **Initial state:** $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** Since $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** Since $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, 1, \\text{ or } -1$.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta n < 0$:** The intermediate state must have $n' < 3$.\n\n*   **Transition 2: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   **Final state:** $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** The change is $l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is consistent with the requirement that $l'=1$.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta n < 0$:** The change is $n_f - n' = 1 - n' < 0$, which means $n' > 1$.\n\n*   **Combining the conditions:** We need an intermediate state with $l'=1$, $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, and a principal quantum number $n'$ that satisfies both $n'<3$ and $n'>1$. The only integer value for $n'$ is 2.\n*   **Conclusion:** There are three possible intermediate states, leading to three possible decay routes:\n    1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 4. Calculating the Probability of a Specific Route\nThe question asks for the probability of a single, specific transition route. This is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition.\n\n*   **Symmetry Argument:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. It has no preferred orientation in space. The decay interaction, when averaged over all photon emission directions, is also isotropic. Therefore, there can be no preference for the atom to decay into one of the three degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$) over the others.\n*   **Equal Probabilities:** The three possible decay paths for the first step are equally likely. Since these are the only allowed E1 transitions to the $n=2$ shell, their probabilities must sum to 1.\n*   **Branching Ratio:** The probability (branching ratio) for the atom to decay into any single one of these intermediate states is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   **Total Cascade Probability:** The probability of the second step (e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$) is 1, as this is the only allowed decay channel to a lower energy level. Therefore, the total probability for any one of the three complete cascade routes is $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 5. Evaluating the Options\nWe must find the option that lists a valid route with the correct probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: This option presents a valid route and the correct probability.\n*   **B) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: The probability is incorrect.\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, option A is the only one that is fully correct.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Physical Process and Selection Rules\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the physical process as a two-step cascade decay from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition.\n\nThere is a unanimous agreement on the E1 selection rules that govern this process:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in principal quantum number:** For decay, $n$ must decrease.\n\n### 2. Determination of the Intermediate State\nAll candidate answers correctly apply the selection rules to determine the properties of the intermediate state, which we can denote as $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$, so the intermediate state must have $l'=1$ (to satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$).\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$, so the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ (to satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$).\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$, so the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$, so the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n*   **Conclusion on the Intermediate State:** Combining the conditions on $n'$ ($1 < n' < 3$), all agents correctly conclude that the intermediate state must have $n'=2$. Therefore, there are three possible, physically allowed intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Transition Probability\nThis is the most critical part of the problem, and again, there is a complete consensus on the reasoning.\n\n*   **Symmetry of the Initial State:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state. Its wavefunction is spherically symmetric, meaning it has no angular dependence and no preferred orientation in space.\n*   **Isotropic Decay:** Because the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) does not favor any particular direction. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$), which differ only in their spatial orientation.\n*   **Branching Ratio:** Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first transition, and these are the only allowed E1 channels to the $n=2$ shell, the probability (or branching ratio) for the atom to decay into any *single specific* intermediate state is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   **Total Probability:** The probability of the second step (e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$) is 1, because this is the only allowed E1 decay channel to a lower energy level. Therefore, the total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is $P_{total} = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 4. Final Decision\nThe unanimous conclusion derived from the reasoning of all candidate answers is that any valid transition route has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. The task is now to select the option that matches this conclusion.\n\nLet's examine the options provided in the question:\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: This option presents a valid route and the correctly calculated probability.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **C) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: The probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nBased on the consistent and correct physical reasoning presented across all candidate answers, only option A is correct.\n\n<<<A>>>"

This means it has no preferred orientation in space. When it decays, the emission is isotropic. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate $l'=1$ state. Since there are three equally probable outcomes, the probability (or branching ratio) for the atom to decay into any single one of them is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Probability of the second step ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p subshell), its only allowed E1 decay channel to a lower principal quantum number is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the 1s state).

The probability is incorrect (it should be $\\frac{1}{3}$).\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Physical Process\n\nThe problem describes a two-step decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition. This means the decay proceeds through an intermediate state, let's call it $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 2. Application of Electric Dipole Selection Rules\n\nThe selection rules for an E1 transition are:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   For a decay process, the principal quantum number must decrease ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n### 3. Determining the Intermediate State\n\nLet's apply the selection rules to both transitions.\n\n**First transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n*   **Initial state:** $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** Since $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** Since $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta n < 0$:** The intermediate state must have $n' < 3$. The options provided all point to an intermediate state with $n'=2$.\n\n**Second transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   **Final state:** $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** The change is $l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is consistent with the intermediate state having $l'=1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** The change is $m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This is allowed for all possible intermediate $m'$ values ($-1, 0, 1$).\n\nCombining these conditions, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This confirms that the transition routes listed in the options are all physically possible.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)\n\nThe crucial part of the question is to determine the probability of a specific route.\n\n*   **First Step Probability:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. When it decays, the emission of the photon is isotropic (equal in all directions). Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels of the intermediate state ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$). Since there are three equally probable outcomes, the probability (or branching ratio) for the atom to decay into any single one of these states is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Second Step Probability:** Once the atom is in an intermediate state, for example $|2,1,0\\rangle$, it will decay to a lower energy level. The only state with $n<2$ that it can decay to via an E1 transition is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only available decay channel, the probability of this second step is 1.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of the individual steps.\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2})$\n    $P(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n### 5. Conclusion and Final Answer Selection\n\nThe analysis shows that any of the three possible routes has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. We must now find the option that matches this result.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (**Correct** route and probability)\n\nAll candidate answers, through correct physical reasoning, arrive at the same conclusion that the probability is 1/3. Option D is the only choice that reflects this correct result.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nOf course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the task:\n\nFirst, I will analyze the physics of the problem. The decay of a hydrogen atom from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two dipole transitions is governed by specific quantum mechanical selection rules. I will apply these rules step-by-step to determine the possible intermediate states.\n\nSecond, I will calculate the probability, also known as the branching ratio, for each possible decay path. This involves a key insight about the symmetry of the initial state. The $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state is spherically symmetric, which implies that the decay to the possible intermediate states must be equally probable.\n\nFinally, I will write a Python script to formalize this reasoning. The script will define the options, calculate the correct probability based on the number of possible decay channels, and then iterate through the options to find the one that matches both the valid transition route and the correct probability. The script will then print the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_hydrogen_decay_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the two-step dipole decay of a hydrogen atom from |3,0,0> to |1,0,0>\n    to determine the correct transition route and its probability.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the problem and selection rules.\n    # The process is |3,0,0> -> |n',l',m'> -> |1,0,0>\n    # Selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions are:\n    # delta_l = +/- 1\n    # delta_m = 0, +/- 1\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the possible intermediate states |n',l',m'>.\n    # First transition: |3,0,0> -> |n',l',m'>\n    # Initial state has l=0, m=0.\n    # Applying delta_l = +/- 1 gives l' = 1.\n    # Applying delta_m = 0, +/- 1 gives m' = -1, 0, or 1.\n    # For decay, n' must be < 3.

Understand the Physical Process**\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (the 3s state) to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (the 1s ground state). The decay is not direct but occurs via a two-step process, with each step being an electric dipole (E1) transition. This implies the existence of an intermediate state.\n\n**2. Apply the Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules**\nFor an E1 transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to the following rules:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number: $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number: $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay process (emission of a photon), the principal quantum number must decrease: $\\Delta n < 0$.\n\n**3. Determine the Possible Intermediate States**\nLet the intermediate state be $|n', l', m'\\rangle$. We apply the selection rules to both transitions in the cascade: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   Initial state: $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: Since $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: Since $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, 1, \\text{ or } -1$.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta n < 0$: The intermediate state must have $n' < 3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   Final state: $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: The change is $l_f - l' = 0 - l' = \\pm 1$. This requires $l'=1$, which is consistent with the first transition.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta n < 0$: The change is $n_f - n' = 1 - n' < 0$, which requires $n' > 1$.\n\n*   **Combining the conditions:** We need an intermediate state with $l'=1$, $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, and a principal quantum number $n'$ that satisfies both $n'<3$ and $n'>1$. The only integer value for $n'$ is 2.\n*   **Conclusion:** The possible intermediate states are the three degenerate 2p states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All routes listed in the options are physically possible based on the selection rules.\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This probability is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition.\n\n*   **Key Point: Symmetry.** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means its wavefunction has no angular dependence, and there is no preferred direction in space.\n*   **Implication of Symmetry:** When an atom in a spherically symmetric state decays, the emission of the photon is isotropic (equal in all directions). Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the available degenerate final states. In this case, the three intermediate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are degenerate and differ only in their spatial orientation (the value of $m'$).\n*   **Calculating the Branching Ratio:** Since there are three equally probable decay channels for the first step, and these are the only allowed channels to the n=2 shell, the probability of the atom taking any single one of these paths is exactly $1/3$.\n*   **Probability of the Second Step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, its only allowed E1 decay channel is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Therefore, the probability of this second transition is 1.\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps. For the route via $|2,1,0\\rangle$:\n    $P = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    The same probability of $1/3$ applies to the routes via $|2,1,1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n**5. Compare with the Given Options**\nWe need to find the option that lists a valid route with the correct probability of $1/3$.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. **This is a valid route with the correct probability.**\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect (it should be $1/3$).\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect (it should be $1/3$).\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physical Process\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay does not happen in a single step but through a two-step process, where each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition. This implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 2. Applying the Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\nFor an E1 transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to the following selection rules:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum:** $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in principal quantum number:** For a decay (emission of a photon), the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n### 3. Determining the Intermediate State $|n',l',m'\\rangle$\n\n**First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n*   The initial state has $l=0$. Applying the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n*   The initial state has $m=0$. Applying the $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, 1, \\text{ or } -1$.\n*   The initial state has $n=3$. The intermediate state must have $n' < 3$. The options suggest $n'=2$.\n\n**Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   Let's verify if a transition from the potential intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n*   The change in orbital angular momentum is $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   The change in magnetic quantum number is $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m' = 0 - m'$. This is allowed for all possible intermediate values of $m'$ (i.e., for $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$).\n\nCombining these, we find that there are three possible, physically allowed, intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This means there are three possible decay routes.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Probability of a Specific Route\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route, for example, the one passing through the intermediate state $|2,1,0\\rangle$. This probability is the branching ratio for the first step of the decay.\n\n*   **The key insight lies in the symmetry of the initial state.** The state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space.\n*   Because the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) cannot favor one direction over another. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels of the intermediate state: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n*   Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first transition, and these are the only allowed E1 channels to the $n=2$ shell, the probability of the atom decaying into any *single specific* intermediate state is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   The probability of the second step (e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$) is 1, because once the atom is in the $2p$ state, the only allowed E1 decay channel to a lower energy level is to the $1s$ ground state.\n\nTherefore, the total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is:\n$P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 5. Comparing with the Options\nWe now check the given options against our result that any valid route has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physical Process\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This is not a direct transition but a two-step process, also known as a cascade decay, involving two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies the existence of an intermediate state.\n\nThe overall process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n### 2. Applying the Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\nFor an E1 transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to the following rules:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in principal quantum number:** For a decay (emission), energy must be lost, so $n$ must decrease.\n\n### 3. Determining the Intermediate State $|n',l',m'\\rangle$\nWe apply the selection rules to both steps of the decay.\n\n**Step 1: Transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n*   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   The initial state has $n=3$. The intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n**Step 2: Transition from $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   The final state has $l_f=0$. Since the intermediate state has $l'=1$, the change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n*   The final state has $n_f=1$. The intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\nCombining the conditions on the principal quantum number $n'$, we have $n'<3$ and $n'>1$. The only integer that satisfies this is $n'=2$.\n\nTherefore, there are three possible intermediate states, all with $n'=2$ and $l'=1$:\n1.  $|2,1,-1\\rangle$\n2.  $|2,1,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|2,1,1\\rangle$\n\nAll three corresponding decay routes are physically possible.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Probability of a Specific Route\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is the branching ratio for the first step of the decay, multiplied by the probability of the second step.\n\n*   **Probability of the first step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$):**\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space.

Understanding the Physical Process\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay does not happen in a single step but through a two-step process, with each step being an electric dipole (E1) transition. This implies the existence of an intermediate state.\n\nThe overall process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 transition}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 transition}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n### 2. Applying the Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\nFor an E1 transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to the following selection rules:\n*   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   For a decay (emission), the principal quantum number *n* must decrease.\n\n### 3. Determining the Intermediate State $|n',l',m'\\rangle$\nWe apply the selection rules to both transitions to constrain the properties of the intermediate state.\n\n**First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n*   **Initial state:** $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** Since the initial $l=0$, the orbital quantum number must increase. Thus, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** Since the initial $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, 1,$ or $-1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta n < 0$:** The principal quantum number must be less than 3, so $n'<3$.\n\n**Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   **Final state:** $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** The change is $l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is consistent with the rule and confirms that the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta n < 0$:** The change is $n_f - n' = 1 - n' < 0$, which means $n'>1$.\n\nCombining the conditions on $n'$ ($n'<3$ and $n'>1$), the only possible integer value for the intermediate principal quantum number is $n'=2$.\n\nTherefore, there are three possible intermediate states, leading to three possible decay routes:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nAll routes listed in the options are physically possible. The final step is to determine the probability.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of the first step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$):**\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. When such a state decays, the emission is isotropic (equal in all directions), and there is no preference for which magnetic sublevel ($m'$) of the final state is populated. The three possible intermediate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are therefore populated with equal probability. Since these are the only three allowed outcomes for the first step, their probabilities must sum to 1. Thus, the probability of transitioning to any single one of them is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Probability of the second step ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p level), the only allowed E1 decay to a lower principal quantum number is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the 1s level). Since this is the only possible decay channel, the probability of this transition is 1.\n\n*   **Total Probability for a specific route:**\n    The total probability is the product of the probabilities of the two steps. For any of the three routes:\n    Total Probability = (Probability of first step) $\\times$ (Probability of second step) = $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 5.

Understanding the Physical Process\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay does not happen in a single step but through a two-step process, with each step being an electric dipole (E1) transition. This implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state.\nThe process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n### 2. Applying the Selection Rules\nThe electric dipole (E1) transitions are governed by a set of selection rules that dictate which transitions are \"allowed\":\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l$, must be $\\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m$, must be $0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay process (emission), the principal quantum number, $n$, must decrease.\n\n### 3. Determining the Intermediate State\nLet's analyze the first transition from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n*   **Initial State:** $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** Since the initial $l=0$, the only possibility is $\\Delta l = +1$. Therefore, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** Since the initial $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, 1,$ or $-1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta n < 0$:** The principal quantum number must decrease, so $n'<3$. The options provided all point to an intermediate state with $n'=2$. This is also the most common decay path ($3s \\to 2p$).\n*   **Conclusion:** The possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\nNext, we verify that a transition from these intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n*   **Intermediate State:** $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n*   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** The change is $l_{final} - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed transition.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** The change is $m_{final} - m' = 0 - m'$. This is allowed for all possible intermediate $m'$ values ($-1, 0, 1$).\n*   **Conclusion:** All three routes are physically possible.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Probability\nThe core of the question is to determine the probability of a specific route. This is the branching ratio of the first transition.\n*   **Key Insight:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space.\n*   **Symmetry Argument:** Because the initial state is isotropic, the decay process must also be isotropic (when averaged over all photon directions and polarizations). This means there can be no preference for decaying into one of the magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) over the others.\n*   **Equal Probabilities:** The three possible intermediate states, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, must be populated with equal probability.\n*   **Branching Ratio:** Since there are three equally likely outcomes for the first transition, and these are the only significant decay channels, the probability for any single specific channel is $1/3$.\n*   **Second Transition:** Once the atom is in an intermediate state like $|2,1,0\\rangle$, the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps. For the route via $|2,1,0\\rangle$:\n    $P = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 5.

Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route.

Its wavefunction is spherically symmetric, meaning it has no preferred orientation in space.\n*   The decay process (spontaneous emission), when averaged over all photon directions and polarizations, is isotropic.\n*   Because the initial state and the interaction are both isotropic, there can be no preference for decaying into one of the three degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$) over the others.\n*   Therefore, the three possible decay paths for the first step must be **equally probable**.\n*   Since these are the only three allowed E1 decay channels to the $n=2$ level, their probabilities must sum to 1.

The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physical Process\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay does not happen in a single step but through a two-step process, with each step being an electric dipole (E1) transition. This implies the existence of an intermediate state.\n\nThe overall process is:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 2. Applying the Electric Dipole Selection Rules\nFor an E1 transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to the following selection rules:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   For a decay process, the principal quantum number must decrease ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n### 3. Determining the Intermediate State $|n',l',m'\\rangle$\n\n*   **Analysis of Step 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. The intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Analysis of Step 2: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For the transition to be allowed from an intermediate state with $l'=1$, the change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is a valid change.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. The intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n*   **Combining the conditions:** We need an intermediate state with $l'=1$ and $1 < n' < 3$. The only integer value for $n'$ is 2. Therefore, the possible intermediate states are the three degenerate states of the 2p subshell: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All three routes are physically possible.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific decay route. This is determined by the branching ratio of the first step, as the second step is guaranteed to happen with probability 1 (it's the only allowed E1 decay channel from the 2p state).\n\n*   The initial state, $|3,0,0\\rangle$, is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space.\n*   Due to this symmetry, when the atom decays, the emission of the photon is isotropic. There is no preference for the atom to be left in any particular magnetic sublevel ($m'$) of the intermediate state.\n*   Therefore, the probabilities of transitioning to each of the three possible intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$) are equal.\n*   Since these are the only three possible outcomes for the first step, and their probabilities must sum to 1, the probability for any single specific route is exactly $1/3$.\n\n### 5. Evaluating the Options\nWe need to find the option that lists a valid route with the correct probability of $1/3$.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n\nBased on the analysis, option D is the only one that correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Process:** The problem describes a two-step decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition, which means there must be an intermediate state.\n\n2.  **Apply E1 Selection Rules:** Electric dipole transitions are governed by a set of selection rules that dictate how the quantum numbers can change:\n    *   The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by one: $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   The magnetic quantum number must change by zero or one: $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   For a decay process (emission of a photon), the principal quantum number *n* must decrease.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State:** Let the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n    *   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n        *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n        *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n        *   The principal quantum number must decrease ($n'<3$). The options suggest $n'=2$.\n    *   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For the transition from the intermediate state to be allowed, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$ (since $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$). This is consistent with the first step.\n        *   The final state has $n_f=1$, so the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n    *   **Conclusion for the Intermediate State:** Combining the conditions ($n'<3$ and $n'>1$), the intermediate state must have $n'=2$. Therefore, the three possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All routes listed in the options are physically possible according to the selection rules.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio):** The question asks for the probability of a specific decay route. This is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    *   **Probability of the First Step:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. When it decays, the emission is isotropic (equal in all directions). Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$). Since there are three equally probable outcomes, the probability of transitioning to any single one of them is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   **Probability of the Second Step:** Once the atom is in an intermediate state, for example $|2,1,0\\rangle$, it must decay to a lower energy level. The only state it can decay to via an E1 transition is the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n    *   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps: $P_{total} = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:** We must find the option that lists a valid route with the correct probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   B) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. This option presents a valid route with the correctly calculated probability.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physical Process\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay occurs through two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, which implies the existence of an intermediate state. The overall process is:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 transition 1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 transition 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 2. Applying the Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\nThe selection rules for an E1 transition are:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay process (emission), the principal quantum number must decrease ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n### 3. Determining the Intermediate State $|n',l',m'\\rangle$\nWe apply the selection rules to both transitions.\n\n*   **Transition 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   **Initial state:** $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** Since $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** Since $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, 1, \\text{ or } -1$.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta n < 0$:** The intermediate state must have $n' < 3$.\n\n*   **Transition 2: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   **Final state:** $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** The change is $l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is consistent with the requirement that $l'=1$.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta n < 0$:** The change is $n_f - n' = 1 - n' < 0$, which means $n' > 1$.\n\n*   **Combining the conditions:** We need an intermediate state with $l'=1$, $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, and a principal quantum number $n'$ that satisfies both $n'<3$ and $n'>1$. The only integer value for $n'$ is 2.\n*   **Conclusion:** There are three possible intermediate states, leading to three possible decay routes:\n    1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 4. Calculating the Probability of a Specific Route\nThe question asks for the probability of a single, specific transition route. This is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition.\n\n*   **Symmetry Argument:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. It has no preferred orientation in space. The decay interaction, when averaged over all photon emission directions, is also isotropic. Therefore, there can be no preference for the atom to decay into one of the three degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$) over the others.\n*   **Equal Probabilities:** The three possible decay paths for the first step are equally likely. Since these are the only allowed E1 transitions to the $n=2$ shell, their probabilities must sum to 1.\n*   **Branching Ratio:** The probability (branching ratio) for the atom to decay into any single one of these intermediate states is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   **Total Cascade Probability:** The probability of the second step (e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$) is 1, as this is the only allowed decay channel to a lower energy level. Therefore, the total probability for any one of the three complete cascade routes is $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 5. Evaluating the Options\nWe must find the option that lists a valid route with the correct probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: This option presents a valid route and the correct probability.\n*   **B) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: The probability is incorrect.\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, option A is the only one that is fully correct.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
