Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is calculated to find the number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 strongly suggests a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the presence of two oxygen atoms.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is a classic signature for the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its frequency is typical for an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring. It is too high for a typical amide and too low for a phenyl ester.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm indicates that the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-). This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This confirms the interpretation from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in chemical shifts indicates the two substituents have different electronic effects. The amine (-NH₂) is an electron-donating group, which shields its ortho protons, shifting them upfield (to 7.0 ppm). The ester (-COOEt) is an electron-withdrawing group, which deshields its ortho protons, shifting them downfield (to 8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate Options**\nThe combined evidence points to a single structure:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   The other substituent is an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nThis structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Now, we match this conclusion with the given options:\n\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide.\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an isomer. The NMR for the ethyl group's methylene (-CH₂-) would be adjacent to the carbonyl, appearing around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all pieces of spectral evidence: the molecular formula, the primary amine and conjugated ester from the IR, and the ethyl ester, primary amine, and para-substituted ring from the NMR.\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the structure as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate through their analysis. The discrepancies in their final letter choices are due to inconsistent ordering of the options in their individual write-ups. Based on the original question's list, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n*   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to understand the number of rings and/or pi bonds.\n*   The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   Plugging in the values: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the presence of oxygen.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This rules out structures with secondary or tertiary amines/amides.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is typical for an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (which is usually below 1700 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet and a quartet is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The triplet at 1.20 ppm is the methyl group (-CH₃) split by the adjacent two protons of the methylene group.\n    *   The quartet at 4.5 ppm is the methylene group (-CH₂) split by the adjacent three protons of the methyl group.\n    *   The very downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) is crucial; it indicates the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, forming an **ethyl ester fragment (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is a characteristic signal for the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the interpretation from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in chemical shifts indicates one substituent is electron-donating and the other is electron-withdrawing.\n    *   The electron-donating -NH₂ group shields its ortho protons, shifting them upfield (to 7.0 ppm).\n    *   The electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its ortho protons, shifting them downfield (to 8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating the Options**\n*   The combined data points to a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine group (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) located in a para (1,4) arrangement. This structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   Let's evaluate the given options:\n    *   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, which contradicts the IR data (primary amine, not amide) and the NMR aromatic pattern (para, not meta).\n    *   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H band in the IR and have a different NMR spectrum.\n    *   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an isomer. The NMR for the methylene group of the propionate chain (-COCH₂CH₃) would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all aspects of the provided spectral data: the molecular formula, the primary amine and conjugated ester from the IR, and the ethyl ester, primary amine, and para-substituted ring from the NMR.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first analyze the provided candidate answers to find a consensus on the chemical structure.

Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n*   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), also known as the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD). This tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n*   The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   Plugging in the values: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a very strong clue. A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation (5 - 4 = 1) suggests the presence of one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O), which is a common feature in molecules containing two oxygens.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the classic signature for the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is typical for a conjugated **ester** (Ar-COOR).\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   A secondary amine (-NH-) would only show one band in the N-H region.\n    *   An amide C=O stretch is usually at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm⁻¹).\n    *   The combination of a primary amine and an ester group is strongly suggested.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This pair of signals is a classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The triplet (t) at 1.20 ppm is the methyl group (-CH₃) split by the adjacent two protons of the methylene group.\n    *   The quartet (q) at 4.5 ppm is the methylene group (-CH₂) split by the adjacent three protons of the methyl group.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm is very downfield. This indicates the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-). This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This confirms the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   These signals are in the aromatic region. The total integration is four protons (2H + 2H), indicating a disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The pattern of two doublets is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents are electronically different, causing the protons on the ring to split into two distinct sets.\n    *   The amine group (-NH₂) is electron-donating, which shields the adjacent (ortho) protons, shifting them upfield. This corresponds to the doublet at **7.0 ppm**.\n    *   The ester group (-COOEt) is electron-withdrawing, which deshields the adjacent (ortho) protons, shifting them downfield. This corresponds to the doublet at **8.0 ppm**.\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate Options**\n*   The combined data points to a structure with:\n    1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  A primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n    3.  An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group.\n*   Assembling these fragments gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n*   Now, let's check this against the given options:\n    *   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide.\n    *   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide.\n    *   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: the molecular formula, the primary amine and conjugated ester in the IR, and the ethyl ester, primary amine, and para-substituted ring in the NMR.\n    *   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. In this isomer, the NMR signal for the methylene group next to the carbonyl would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe analysis of the molecular formula, IR spectrum, and ¹H NMR spectrum all consistently and unambiguously point to the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\n*   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to understand the number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule.\n*   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`\n*   Plugging in the values: `DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5`.\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the presence of oxygen.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**. This rules out structures with secondary or tertiary amines/amides.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is typical for an **ester group that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for an amide (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (~1760 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of signals is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The triplet at 1.20 ppm is the methyl group (-CH₃) split by the adjacent two protons of the methylene group.\n    *   The quartet at 4.5 ppm is the methylene group (-CH₂-) split by the adjacent three protons of the methyl group.\n    *   The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates that the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester group **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is a characteristic signal for the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both doublets and each integrating to two protons, are a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The difference in chemical shifts indicates that the two substituents have opposing electronic effects. The amine group (-NH₂) is electron-donating, shielding its ortho protons and shifting them upfield (to 7.0 ppm). The ester group (-COOEt) is electron-withdrawing, deshielding its ortho protons and shifting them downfield (to 8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating the Options**\n\nThe combined analysis of all spectral data points to a single structure:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   The other substituent is an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nThis structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer, but the ethyl group is part of the acid chain (-COCH₂CH₃). The NMR signal for this methylene group would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is an amide (inconsistent with IR) and is meta-substituted (inconsistent with the NMR aromatic pattern).\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: the molecular formula, the primary amine and conjugated ester in the IR, and the ethyl ester, primary amine, and para-substituted ring signals in the NMR.\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the two N-H bands in the IR and the 2H integration for the amine protons in the NMR.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe evidence from the molecular formula, IR, and ¹H NMR spectra unequivocally identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a comprehensive review of the provided analyses, the correct compound can be determined by systematically interpreting the given spectral data.\n\n**1.

Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is a definitive characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂), corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches.

Conclusion and Evaluation of Options**\nThe combined spectral data points unequivocally to a structure containing a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group as the substituents. This structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's evaluate this against the given options:\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, which contradicts the NMR aromatic pattern and the IR data.\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. In this isomer, the ethyl group would be part of a propionate chain. The NMR signal for the methylene group adjacent to the carbonyl would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Correct.

Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of medium-to-strong bands is a definitive indicator of a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.

This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is a characteristic signal for the exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH₂), which corroborates the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in chemical shifts indicates the two substituents have opposing electronic effects. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is ortho to the electron-donating amine group (-NH₂), while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options**\nThe combined spectral data points to a structure with the following components:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n*   An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group.\n\nAssembling these fragments leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n*   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, which contradicts the para-substitution pattern in the NMR and the ester functional group identified by IR and NMR.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an isomer and a phenyl ester. The NMR signal for the methylene group next to the carbonyl would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Correct. This structure perfectly matches all aspects of the provided data: the molecular formula, the primary amine, the conjugated ethyl ester, and the 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring with the expected electronic effects on the proton chemical shifts.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound from the provided spectral data.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is calculated to find the total number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the IR data.\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is a definitive characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂). These two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its frequency is typical for an ester that is conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is too high for a typical amide and too low for a phenyl ester.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet and a quartet is the classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   The triplet at 1.20 ppm is the methyl group (-CH₃) split by the adjacent two protons of the methylene group.\n    *   The quartet at 4.5 ppm is the methylene group (-CH₂) split by the adjacent three protons of the methyl group. The very downfield chemical shift (4.5 ppm) is crucial, indicating that this methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative oxygen atom, as in an ethyl ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is a characteristic signal for the exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH₂), confirming the interpretation from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The significant difference in their chemical shifts indicates that one substituent is electron-donating (shifting its ortho protons upfield to 7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (shifting its ortho protons downfield to 8.0 ppm).\n\n### **4. Assembling the Structure and Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis of the spectral data provides the following structural fragments:\n1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  A primary amine group (-NH₂), which is an electron-donating group.\n3.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃), which is an electron-withdrawing group.\n\nAssembling these fragments leads to a single possible structure: **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This structure perfectly aligns with all the provided data, including the electronic effects observed in the NMR spectrum.\n\n### **5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure is fully consistent with the molecular formula, IR spectrum, and ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, which contradicts the NMR aromatic pattern and the IR carbonyl frequency.\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. In this isomer, the ethyl group is part of the acyl chain. The NMR signal for the methylene group adjacent to the carbonyl would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The calculation `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)` gives `9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5`. This is a critical piece of information. A DoU of 4 typically indicates a benzene ring, and the remaining 1 degree suggests an additional pi bond, such as a C=O carbonyl group. All candidate answers correctly perform this calculation and reach the same conclusion.\n\n*   **IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of bands is a definitive signature for a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands represent the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches. This single piece of data rules out any secondary or tertiary amines/amides.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong band is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. Its frequency is characteristic of a conjugated ester (an ester attached to a benzene ring). It is generally too high for a conjugated amide and too low for a phenyl ester.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ester.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination is the unmistakable pattern of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The triplet is the methyl group split by the methylene, and the quartet is the methylene group split by the methyl. The very downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) is crucial; it indicates the methylene group is attached to an ester oxygen (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons confirms the presence of the primary amine (-NH₂) group identified in the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each for two protons, is a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The difference in chemical shifts indicates one substituent is electron-donating (the -NH₂ group, shifting its ortho protons upfield to 7.0 ppm) and one is electron-withdrawing (the ester group, shifting its ortho protons downfield to 8.0 ppm).\n\n**2. Assemble the Structure**\n\nCombining all the fragments deduced from the data:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nThe only possible structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Candidate Answers and Options**\n\n*   **Consensus on Structure:** All 15 candidate answers correctly analyze the spectral data and conclude that the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The chemical reasoning is universally sound.\n*   **Discrepancy in Final Answer:** The candidate answers provide different final letters (A, B, C, or D). This is due to a failure in some agents to correctly map the identified structure to the original list of options.\n*   **Matching to Original Options:**\n    *   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide - Incorrect (amide, meta-substituted)\n    *   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide - Incorrect (secondary amide)\n    *   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate - Incorrect (isomer with different ester linkage)\n    *   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate - Correct**\n\nThe structure that matches all the data is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**, which is option D in the question's list. Agents 3, 8, and 13 correctly identified this. The other agents, despite correct chemical analysis, made a clerical error in selecting the final letter.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis is a classic analytical chemistry problem that involves interpreting spectroscopic data to determine the structure of an unknown molecule.

The chemical shift difference indicates one substituent is electron-donating (the -NH₂ group, whose ortho protons are upfield at 7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (the ester group, whose ortho protons are downfield at 8.0 ppm).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll pieces of evidence point to a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group located in a para (1,4) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### Matching with Options\n\nNow, we match this conclusion with the options provided in the question:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**\n\nThe correct structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which corresponds to option D.

Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region are a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**. This rules out structures with secondary or tertiary amines/amides, such as option D.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region.

This is incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided spectroscopic data and a review of the candidate answers, the correct identification of the compound C9H11NO2 is determined as follows.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n    *   The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, which is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis**\n    *   The two medium-to-strong bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are a definitive signature of a primary amine (-NH₂), corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its frequency is characteristic of an ester that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectrum Analysis**\n    *   The signals at **1.20 ppm (triplet, 3H)** and **4.5 ppm (quartet, 2H)** together form the classic pattern of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates that the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a highly electronegative oxygen atom, confirming the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   The signal at **4.0 ppm (broad singlet, 2H)** is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH₂), which corroborates the IR data.\n    *   The signals at **7.0 ppm (doublet, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H)** are in the aromatic region. This symmetrical pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing ester group, while the upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent to the electron-donating amine group.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAssembling all the identified fragments—a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine group, and an ethyl ester group—leads to a single possible structure: **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nThis structure is perfectly consistent with all provided data points. A review of the other options confirms this conclusion:\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Is an amide (incorrect functional group) and is meta-substituted (incorrect NMR aromatic pattern).\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Is a secondary amide (incorrect functional group).\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Is a phenyl ester. The NMR signal for the methylene group adjacent to the carbonyl would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound from the provided spectral data, including careful points to consider during the evaluation.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three pi bonds) plus one additional pi bond.\n*   **Careful Point:** Given the presence of two oxygen atoms, this extra pi bond is most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of distinct, medium-to-strong bands is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Careful Point:** This observation immediately rules out any structures that are not primary amines, such as secondary amides (e.g., N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide) which would show only one N-H band.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its frequency is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR).\n*   **Careful Point:** This frequency helps distinguish between ester and amide isomers. A conjugated amide C=O stretch is typically at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm⁻¹), making an amide structure (like 3-ethoxybenzamide) unlikely.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The triplet (t) is the methyl (-CH₃) group, and the quartet (q) is the methylene (-CH₂-) group.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is crucial. This very downfield position indicates the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, forming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This rules out the isomer 4-aminophenyl propionate, where the methylene group would be next to the carbonyl (-CO-CH₂CH₃) and appear around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) that integrates to two protons is a characteristic signal for the two exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the interpretation from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The difference in chemical shifts confirms the electronic nature of the substituents. The electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm. The electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm. This confirms the para arrangement and the identity of the two groups.\n\n### **Step 4: Assemble the Structure and Select the Correct Option**\n\n1.  **Structure Assembly:** The combined evidence from all spectra points unequivocally to a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group attached in a para (1,4) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n2.  **Option Evaluation:** Now, we match this identified structure to the options provided in the question.\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n    *   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. This is an isomer with a different ester linkage, which is inconsistent with the NMR chemical shift of the ethyl group.\n    *   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n    *   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a primary amide (inconsistent IR) and is meta-substituted (inconsistent NMR aromatic pattern).\n\nThe correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"

Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm indicates that the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-).

The difference in chemical shifts indicates the two substituents have different electronic effects. The amine (-NH₂) is an electron-donating group, which shields its ortho protons, shifting them upfield (to 7.0 ppm). The ester (-COOEt) is an electron-withdrawing group, which deshields its ortho protons, shifting them downfield (to 8.0 ppm).\n\n**4.

Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n*   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to understand the number of rings and/or pi bonds.\n*   The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   Plugging in the values: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the presence of oxygen.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This rules out structures with secondary or tertiary amines/amides.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is typical for an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (which is usually below 1700 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3.

Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n*   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), also known as the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD). This tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n*   The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   Plugging in the values: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a very strong clue. A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation (5 - 4 = 1) suggests the presence of one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O), which is a common feature in molecules containing two oxygens.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the classic signature for the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is typical for a conjugated **ester** (Ar-COOR).\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   A secondary amine (-NH-) would only show one band in the N-H region.\n    *   An amide C=O stretch is usually at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm⁻¹).\n    *   The combination of a primary amine and an ester group is strongly suggested.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This pair of signals is a classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The triplet (t) at 1.20 ppm is the methyl group (-CH₃) split by the adjacent two protons of the methylene group.\n    *   The quartet (q) at 4.5 ppm is the methylene group (-CH₂) split by the adjacent three protons of the methyl group.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm is very downfield. This indicates the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-). This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This confirms the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   These signals are in the aromatic region. The total integration is four protons (2H + 2H), indicating a disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The pattern of two doublets is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents are electronically different, causing the protons on the ring to split into two distinct sets.\n    *   The amine group (-NH₂) is electron-donating, which shields the adjacent (ortho) protons, shifting them upfield. This corresponds to the doublet at **7.0 ppm**.\n    *   The ester group (-COOEt) is electron-withdrawing, which deshields the adjacent (ortho) protons, shifting them downfield. This corresponds to the doublet at **8.0 ppm**.\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate Options**\n*   The combined data points to a structure with:\n    1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  A primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n    3.  An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group.\n*   Assembling these fragments gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n*   Now, let's check this against the given options:\n    *   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide.\n    *   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide.\n    *   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: the molecular formula, the primary amine and conjugated ester in the IR, and the ethyl ester, primary amine, and para-substituted ring in the NMR.\n    *   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. In this isomer, the NMR signal for the methylene group next to the carbonyl would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe analysis of the molecular formula, IR spectrum, and ¹H NMR spectrum all consistently and unambiguously point to the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\n*   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to understand the number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule.\n*   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`\n*   Plugging in the values: `DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5`.\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the presence of oxygen.\n\n**2.

Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is calculated to find the number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the IR data.\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region are a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**. This rules out structures with secondary amines, tertiary amines, or amides that don't fit this pattern.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is typical for an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (~1760 cm⁻¹).\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet and a quartet is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The triplet at 1.20 ppm is the methyl group (-CH₃) split by the adjacent two protons of the methylene group.\n    *   The quartet at 4.5 ppm is the methylene group (-CH₂) split by the adjacent three protons of the methyl group.\n    *   Crucially, the chemical shift of the quartet at a very downfield 4.5 ppm indicates that the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-). This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is a classic signal for the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the interpretation from the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both doublets and each integrating to two protons, are the signature pattern of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The difference in chemical shifts indicates the two substituents have opposing electronic effects. The electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its ortho protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm. The electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its ortho protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm.\n\n### **4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options**\n\nThe combined spectral data points to a single structure composed of:\n1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n3.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nAssembling these fragments yields **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options against this conclusion:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an isomer, but the ethyl group is part of the acid portion (-COCH₂CH₃). The NMR signal for this methylene group would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all spectral data: the molecular formula, the primary amine and conjugated ester in the IR, and the ethyl ester, primary amine, and para-substituted ring signals in the NMR.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is an amide (inconsistent IR) and is meta-substituted (inconsistent NMR aromatic pattern).\n\nThe evidence from all spectra unequivocally identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the correct compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n*   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to understand the number of rings and/or pi bonds.\n*   The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n*   Plugging in the values: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, which is likely a carbonyl (C=O) group, as suggested by the IR data.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**. This rules out structures with secondary amines or amides that would show a different pattern.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is typical for an **ester group that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for a conjugated amide and too low for a phenyl ester.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The triplet at 1.20 ppm is the methyl group (-CH₃) split by the adjacent two protons of the methylene group.\n    *   The quartet at 4.5 ppm is the methylene group (-CH₂) split by the adjacent three protons of the methyl group.\n    *   The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates that the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, forming an **ethyl ester fragment (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is a characteristic signal for the two exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This confirms the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both doublets and each integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents have different electronic effects.\n    *   The electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its ortho protons, shifting them upfield to the 7.0 ppm region.\n    *   The electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its ortho protons, shifting them downfield to the 8.0 ppm region.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options**\nThe combined spectral data points to a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group attached in a para (1,4) arrangement. This structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options:\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer, but the ethyl group is part of the propionate chain (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The NMR signal for this methylene group would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. This is incorrect.\n*   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a meta-substituted amide. The IR and NMR data for the functional groups and substitution pattern are inconsistent with this structure. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: the molecular formula, the primary amine and conjugated ester from the IR, and the ethyl ester, primary amine, and para-substituted ring from the NMR. **This is the correct structure.**\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the IR data showing a primary amine. This is incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided spectroscopic data and a review of the candidate answers, the correct identification of the compound C9H11NO2 is determined as follows.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n    *   The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, which is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis**\n    *   The two medium-to-strong bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are a definitive signature of a primary amine (-NH₂), corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its frequency is characteristic of an ester that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectrum Analysis**\n    *   The signals at **1.20 ppm (triplet, 3H)** and **4.5 ppm (quartet, 2H)** together form the classic pattern of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates that the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a highly electronegative oxygen atom, confirming the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   The signal at **4.0 ppm (broad singlet, 2H)** is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH₂), which corroborates the IR data.\n    *   The signals at **7.0 ppm (doublet, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H)** are in the aromatic region. This symmetrical pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing ester group, while the upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent to the electron-donating amine group.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAssembling all the identified fragments—a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine group, and an ethyl ester group—leads to a single possible structure: **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nThis structure is perfectly consistent with all provided data points. A review of the other options confirms this conclusion:\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Is an amide (incorrect functional group) and is meta-substituted (incorrect NMR aromatic pattern).\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Is a secondary amide (incorrect functional group).\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Is a phenyl ester. The NMR signal for the methylene group adjacent to the carbonyl would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
