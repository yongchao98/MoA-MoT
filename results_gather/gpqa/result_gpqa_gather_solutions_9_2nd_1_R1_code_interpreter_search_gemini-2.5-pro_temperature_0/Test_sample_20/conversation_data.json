For a carbonyl compound (keto form) to exhibit this, it must have at least one \"alpha-hydrogen\" – a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group. This alpha-carbon is typically sp³ hybridized.\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons. Each of these carbons is a CH₂ group, meaning they have two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these hydrogens allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerism to form its highly stable aromatic enol, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** This molecule is a six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the ketone groups are part of these double bonds (they are sp² hybridized). These carbons do not have the typical alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon required for keto-enol tautomerism. The conversion to its corresponding phenol (hydroquinone) is a reduction reaction (change in molecular formula from C₆H₄O₂ to C₆H₆O₂), not an isomerization. Therefore, benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism.\n\n1.  **Principle of Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (C-2) is bonded to four different groups:\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and therefore **will** show optical isomerism.\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral. It has no chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate **will not** show optical isomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Final Decision\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part A: Analysis of Tautomerism**\n\nThe core principle for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n1.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This molecule has a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. The carbon atoms at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons, and each is bonded to two hydrogen atoms. The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo tautomerism. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is particularly stable due to aromaticity. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Benzoquinone**: This molecule has a six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the ketone groups are part of the ring's double bonds (they are sp² hybridized). These carbons do not have the typical alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon required for keto-enol tautomerism. The conversion to its corresponding \"enol\" (hydroquinone) is a reduction reaction that changes the molecular formula (from C₆H₄O₂ to C₆H₆O₂), not an isomerization. Therefore, benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common indicator of chirality is a chiral center: a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (C-2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **will show** optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene, CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. It is a planar molecule and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral. It does not have a chiral center. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate **will not show** optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for B**: The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nMatching this result with the given options:\n*   A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   B) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   C) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   D) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy thinking process to arrive at the final answer is as follows:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Task:** The main goal is to identify two compounds based on specific chemical properties and then select the correct multiple-choice option that matches both identifications.\n    *   **Property A:** The compound that does *not* show tautomerism. Candidates are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.\n    *   **Property B:** The compound that *does* show optical isomerism. Candidates are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.\n\n2.  **Analyze Part A (Tautomerism):**\n    *   **Key Concept:** Keto-enol tautomerism, the most common type, requires an \"alpha-hydrogen\" – a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). This alpha-carbon is typically sp³ hybridized.\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has CH₂ groups at positions 2, 4, and 6, which are alpha to the carbonyl groups. These carbons are sp³ hybridized and have alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, it *does* show tautomerism, readily forming the very stable aromatic enol, phloroglucinol.\n    *   **Benzoquinone:** The carbons alpha to the carbonyl groups are part of C=C double bonds (sp² hybridized). They lack the typical alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon needed for keto-enol tautomerism. The conversion to its corresponding diol (hydroquinone) is a reduction (change in molecular formula), not tautomerism (which is an isomerization).\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Part B (Optical Isomerism):**\n    *   **Key Concept:** Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A common feature of a chiral molecule is a chiral center – a carbon atom bonded to four *different* groups.\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (C2) is bonded to four distinct groups: 1) -H, 2) -OH, 3) -CH₃, and 4) -COOCH₃. Since the four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, it *does* show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is a planar molecule (trans-alkene) with a center of symmetry. It has no chiral centers. Molecules with a plane or center of symmetry are achiral. Therefore, it does *not* show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:**\n    *   Compound A (no tautomerism) = **benzoquinone**\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) = **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   Now, I will match this pair with the given options.\n        *   A) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n        *   B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate  <-- This is the correct match.\n        *   C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n        *   D) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\n5.  **Final Verification:** The analysis consistently points to option B.

Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n3.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** The structure is a six-membered ring with three C=O groups. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups. These carbons are alpha to the carbonyl groups, are sp³ hybridized, and possess alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these hydrogens allows the compound to readily tautomerize to its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene).

The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound with a carbonyl group (keto form) to exhibit this type of tautomerism, it must have at least one hydrogen atom on the alpha-carbon (the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group). This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen, and the alpha-carbon is typically sp³ hybridized.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.

Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is particularly stable due to the formation of an aromatic ring.\n    *   Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.**\n\n3.  **Analyzing Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds.\n    *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (alpha-carbons) are part of the ring's double bonds, meaning they are sp² hybridized.\n    *   For standard keto-enol tautomerism, an alpha-hydrogen on an sp³ carbon is required. The conversion of benzoquinone (C₆H₄O₂) to its corresponding phenol-like structure, hydroquinone (C₆H₆O₂), involves a change in the molecular formula (a gain of two hydrogens). This is a reduction reaction, not an isomerization (tautomerism).\n    *   Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.**\n\n**Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism.\n\n1.  **Understanding Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules.

For a carbonyl compound (keto form) to exhibit this, it must have at least one \"alpha-hydrogen\"—a hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O). This alpha-carbon is typically sp³ hybridized.\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This molecule has a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. The carbon atoms at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons. Each of these carbons is a CH₂ group, meaning they possess two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerism to form its highly stable aromatic enol, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone**: The structure of p-benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of these double bonds (sp² hybridized) and are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms that can participate in standard keto-enol tautomerism. The conversion of benzoquinone (C₆H₄O₂) to hydroquinone (C₆H₆O₂) is a reduction reaction, not an isomerization, as the molecular formula changes. Therefore, benzoquinone *does not* show tautomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism**\n\n1.  **Principle of Optical Isomerism**: Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (C-2) is bonded to four different groups:\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and therefore *will* show optical isomerism.\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This molecule is the *trans*-isomer and is planar. It possesses a center of symmetry and is therefore achiral. Achiral molecules do not show optical isomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B**: The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n1.  **Understand Tautomerism:** The most common form relevant here is keto-enol tautomerism.

This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen, and the carbon it's attached to is an alpha-carbon.\n2.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. The carbons between the ketone groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are alpha-carbons. Each of these carbons has two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these hydrogens allows the compound to undergo tautomerism to form its highly stable aromatic enol, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n3.  **Analyze Benzoquinone:** This molecule has a six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the ketone groups are part of the ring's double bonds. They are sp² hybridized and do not have the typical alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon that are required for keto-enol tautomerism. The conversion to its corresponding phenol (hydroquinone) is a reduction reaction (change in molecular formula from C₆H₄O₂ to C₆H₆O₂), not an isomerization. Therefore, benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Understand Optical Isomerism:** This property is exhibited by chiral molecules.

Let's examine the central carbon (C-2), which is bonded to the -OH group. The four groups attached to it are:\n    *   -H (hydrogen)\n    *   -OH (hydroxyl)\n    *   -CH₃ (methyl)\n    *   -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and **will** show optical isomerism.\n3.  **Analyze Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃ (the *trans* isomer). The molecule is planar and has a center of symmetry. It does not have any chiral centers.

For a carbonyl compound (keto form) to exhibit this, it must have at least one \"alpha-hydrogen\" – a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group. This alpha-carbon is typically sp³ hybridized.\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons. Each of these carbons is a CH₂ group, meaning they have two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these hydrogens allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerism to form its highly stable aromatic enol, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** This molecule is a six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the ketone groups are part of these double bonds (they are sp² hybridized). These carbons do not have the typical alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon required for keto-enol tautomerism. The conversion to its corresponding phenol (hydroquinone) is a reduction reaction (change in molecular formula from C₆H₄O₂ to C₆H₆O₂), not an isomerization. Therefore, benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism.\n\n1.  **Principle of Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (C-2) is bonded to four different groups:\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and therefore **will** show optical isomerism.\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral. It has no chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate **will not** show optical isomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Final Decision\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part A: Analysis of Tautomerism**\n\nThe core principle for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n1.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This molecule has a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. The carbon atoms at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons, and each is bonded to two hydrogen atoms. The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo tautomerism. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is particularly stable due to aromaticity. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Benzoquinone**: This molecule has a six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the ketone groups are part of the ring's double bonds (they are sp² hybridized). These carbons do not have the typical alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon required for keto-enol tautomerism. The conversion to its corresponding \"enol\" (hydroquinone) is a reduction reaction that changes the molecular formula (from C₆H₄O₂ to C₆H₆O₂), not an isomerization. Therefore, benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common indicator of chirality is a chiral center: a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (C-2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **will show** optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene, CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. It is a planar molecule and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral. It does not have a chiral center. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate **will not show** optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for B**: The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nMatching this result with the given options:\n*   A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   B) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   C) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   D) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy thinking process to arrive at the final answer is as follows:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Task:** The main goal is to identify two compounds based on specific chemical properties and then select the correct multiple-choice option that matches both identifications.\n    *   **Property A:** The compound that does *not* show tautomerism.

Candidates are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.\n\n2.  **Analyze Part A (Tautomerism):**\n    *   **Key Concept:** Keto-enol tautomerism, the most common type, requires an \"alpha-hydrogen\" – a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). This alpha-carbon is typically sp³ hybridized.\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has CH₂ groups at positions 2, 4, and 6, which are alpha to the carbonyl groups. These carbons are sp³ hybridized and have alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, it *does* show tautomerism, readily forming the very stable aromatic enol, phloroglucinol.\n    *   **Benzoquinone:** The carbons alpha to the carbonyl groups are part of C=C double bonds (sp² hybridized). They lack the typical alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon needed for keto-enol tautomerism. The conversion to its corresponding diol (hydroquinone) is a reduction (change in molecular formula), not tautomerism (which is an isomerization).\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Part B (Optical Isomerism):**\n    *   **Key Concept:** Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A common feature of a chiral molecule is a chiral center – a carbon atom bonded to four *different* groups.\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (C2) is bonded to four distinct groups: 1) -H, 2) -OH, 3) -CH₃, and 4) -COOCH₃. Since the four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, it *does* show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is a planar molecule (trans-alkene) with a center of symmetry. It has no chiral centers. Molecules with a plane or center of symmetry are achiral. Therefore, it does *not* show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:**\n    *   Compound A (no tautomerism) = **benzoquinone**\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) = **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   Now, I will match this pair with the given options.\n        *   A) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n        *   B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate  <-- This is the correct match.\n        *   C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n        *   D) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\n5.  **Final Verification:** The analysis consistently points to option B.

The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound with a carbonyl group (keto form) to exhibit this type of tautomerism, it must have at least one hydrogen atom on the alpha-carbon (the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group).

Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is particularly stable due to the formation of an aromatic ring.\n    *   Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.**\n\n3.  **Analyzing Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds.\n    *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (alpha-carbons) are part of the ring's double bonds, meaning they are sp² hybridized.\n    *   For standard keto-enol tautomerism, an alpha-hydrogen on an sp³ carbon is required. The conversion of benzoquinone (C₆H₄O₂) to its corresponding phenol-like structure, hydroquinone (C₆H₆O₂), involves a change in the molecular formula (a gain of two hydrogens). This is a reduction reaction, not an isomerization (tautomerism).\n    *   Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.**\n\n**Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism.\n\n1.  **Understanding Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules.

For a carbonyl compound (keto form) to exhibit this, it must have at least one \"alpha-hydrogen\"—a hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O). This alpha-carbon is typically sp³ hybridized.\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This molecule has a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. The carbon atoms at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons. Each of these carbons is a CH₂ group, meaning they possess two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerism to form its highly stable aromatic enol, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone**: The structure of p-benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of these double bonds (sp² hybridized) and are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms that can participate in standard keto-enol tautomerism. The conversion of benzoquinone (C₆H₄O₂) to hydroquinone (C₆H₆O₂) is a reduction reaction, not an isomerization, as the molecular formula changes. Therefore, benzoquinone *does not* show tautomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism**\n\n1.  **Principle of Optical Isomerism**: Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (C-2) is bonded to four different groups:\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and therefore *will* show optical isomerism.\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This molecule is the *trans*-isomer and is planar. It possesses a center of symmetry and is therefore achiral. Achiral molecules do not show optical isomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B**: The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n1.  **Understand Tautomerism:** The most common form relevant here is keto-enol tautomerism.

This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen, and the carbon it's attached to is an alpha-carbon.\n2.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. The carbons between the ketone groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are alpha-carbons. Each of these carbons has two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these hydrogens allows the compound to undergo tautomerism to form its highly stable aromatic enol, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n3.  **Analyze Benzoquinone:** This molecule has a six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the ketone groups are part of the ring's double bonds. They are sp² hybridized and do not have the typical alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon that are required for keto-enol tautomerism. The conversion to its corresponding phenol (hydroquinone) is a reduction reaction (change in molecular formula from C₆H₄O₂ to C₆H₆O₂), not an isomerization.
