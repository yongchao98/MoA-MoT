    "### Final Answer Determination\n\nThe goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene in high yield.\n\n**Analysis of the Target Structure:**\n*   The molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   Their positions are 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n\nThis 1,2,3-substitution pattern is challenging to achieve directly because the directing effects of the groups often conflict. A high-yield synthesis typically requires a well-thought-out strategy, often involving blocking groups.\n\nLet's evaluate the proposed reaction sequences.\n\n**Common Steps and Reagents:**\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation (tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3):** Attaches a tert-butyl group. The t-butyl group is an ortho, para-director, but due to its large size, it strongly favors substitution at the para position.\n*   **Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4):** Adds a nitro (-NO2) group, which is a meta-director.\n*   **Sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4):** Adds a sulfonic acid (-SO3H) group, which is a meta-director. This reaction is reversible and the -SO3H group can be used as a \"blocking group\" to protect a position (usually the para position) and then be removed later with dilute acid and heat.\n*   **Reduction of Nitro Group (Fe/HCl):** Converts -NO2 to an amino (-NH2) group.\n*   **Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl):** Converts an amino (-NH2) group into a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n*   **Hydrolysis of Diazonium Salt (H3O+, H2O/Heat):** Replaces the -N2+ group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   **Williamson Ether Synthesis (NaOH/EtBr):** Converts a hydroxyl (-OH) group into an ethoxy (-OEt) group.\n\n**Evaluation of Option A:**\n\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n2.  **ii) SO3/H2SO4:** tert-Butylbenzene → **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. The bulky t-butyl group directs the incoming sulfonyl group to the para position. This effectively \"blocks\" the para position.\n3.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. Now, the t-butyl group (o,p-director) and the sulfonic acid group (m-director) both direct the incoming nitro group to position 2. This is a key step to force ortho-nitration.\n4.  **iv) Fe/HCl:** 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid → **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. The nitro group is selectively reduced to an amine.\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid → **diazonium salt**. The amine at position 2 is converted to a diazonium group.\n6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** Diazonium salt → **2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group upon heating in aqueous acid. *Note: The prompt has a potential typo in option A, listing `HNO3/H2SO4` and `dilute H2SO4` as separate steps after diazotization. The logical step here is hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol.*\n7.  **vii) dilute H2SO4 / Heat (Desulfonation):** 2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid → **3-tert-butyl-1-phenol (or m-tert-butylphenol)**. This step removes the sulfonic acid blocking group. *Correction: The order of steps is crucial. Let's re-examine the sequence provided in the options.*\n\nLet's reconsider the order of the final steps based on chemical principles. After step (v), we have the diazonium salt of 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n*   **Path 1:** First, remove the blocking group, then convert the diazonium salt. Desulfonation requires heat and dilute acid, which would also hydrolyze the diazonium salt. So, steps (vi) and (vii) likely happen concurrently. This would yield **3-tert-butyl-6-hydroxyphenol**, which is not the desired intermediate.\n\n*   **Path 2:** First, replace the diazonium salt, then remove the blocking group.\n    *   Step A: Diazonium salt + H2O/Heat → **2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   Step B: 2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + dilute H2SO4/Heat → **3-tert-butylphenol**. This is not the correct precursor. We need the t-butyl group ortho to the hydroxyl group.\n\nThere seems to be a fundamental flaw in the initial steps of Option A if the goal is to have the t-butyl and hydroxyl groups ortho to each other. Let's re-read the target molecule: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. The t-butyl is at C2, ethoxy at C1. They are ortho.\n\nLet's try a different logical construction that leads to the correct isomer arrangement and see if it matches any option.\n\n**A More Plausible Synthetic Route:**\n\n1.  **Start with Phenol.**\n2.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Phenol → **2-tert-butylphenol** (+ 4-tert-butylphenol). The ortho isomer is needed and can be separated. The -OH group is a powerful ortho, para-director.\n3.  **ii) NaOH/EtBr:** 2-tert-butylphenol → **2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxybenzene**. Convert the phenol to the ether. The -OEt group is also a strong ortho, para-director.\n4.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** 2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxybenzene → **Product mixture**. The -OEt group directs to positions 4 and 6. The t-butyl group directs to position 4. Nitration would predominantly occur at position 4, giving 2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-4-nitrobenzene. This does not yield the desired 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n\nThe difficulty in obtaining the 1,2,3-substitution pattern suggests that one of the groups must be introduced via a method that circumvents the usual directing rules, or the directing properties of the groups are manipulated during the synthesis. The use of a blocking group is the most common strategy for this.\n\nLet's re-evaluate Option A, assuming there might be a misunderstanding of the reactions.\n*   i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene\n*   ii) SO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid\n*   iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid\n*   iv) Fe/HCl → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid\n*   v) NaNO2/HCl → Diazonium salt\n*   vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → This step is highly unusual. It is not a standard Sandmeyer reaction.\n*   vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → This would be hydrolysis.\n*   viii) dilute H2SO4 → This would be desulfonation.\n*   ix) NaOH/EtBr → Williamson ether synthesis.\n\nLet's reconsider the order of the final steps. What if the sequence is:\n1.  Start with **tert-butylbenzene**.\n2.  Nitrate to get **o-tert-butylnitrobenzene**. This is the minor product (para is major), so this is not a high-yield route.\n3.  Reduce to **o-tert-butylaniline**.\n4.  Sulfonate. The -NH2 is a strong o,p-director. It would direct para to the -NH2 group (position 4). This gives **4-amino-3-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n5.  Nitrate. This is getting complicated and unlikely.\n\nLet's go back to the most logical sequence that uses a blocking group to achieve a difficult substitution pattern. The sequence in Option A is the most chemically sophisticated. Let's assume there is a typo and reconstruct the final steps logically.\n\n**Corrected Logical Sequence (based on the spirit of Option A):**\n1.  **Benzene** -> **tert-Butylbenzene** (Friedel-Crafts)\n2.  -> **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid** (Sulfonation, blocking para position)\n3.  -> **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid** (Nitration, directed ortho by t-Bu and meta by -SO3H)\n    *At this point, we have the t-butyl and nitro groups in a 1,3-relationship, with a blocking group at position 4.*\n4.  -> **Desulfonation** (dilute H2SO4, heat) -> **1-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    *Now we have t-butyl and nitro meta to each other. We need to introduce the ethoxy group at position 2.*\n5.  -> **Reduction** (Fe/HCl) -> **3-tert-butylaniline**.\n6.  -> **Diazotization** (NaNO2/HCl) -> Diazonium salt.\n7.  -> **Hydrolysis** (H2O, heat) -> **3-tert-butylphenol**.\n8.  -> **Etherification** (NaOH, EtBr) -> **1-tert-butyl-3-ethoxybenzene**.\n9.  -> **Nitration** -> The -OEt is an o,p director, and -tBu is an o,p director. Both will direct to positions 2, 4, and 6. This will not give the desired product.\n\nThere must be a different way. Let's reconsider the structure again. The key is the relationship between the three groups. The -OEt and -NO2 are meta. This suggests one was put on while the other was a meta-director. The -tBu and -NO2 are ortho. This is very difficult to achieve.\n\nLet's reconsider the options as written, however strange they seem. The question asks which of the *following options* would work. It's possible one of them contains a valid, albeit obscure, pathway. The sequence in A is the only one that uses a blocking group strategy, which is often necessary for complex substitution patterns. Despite the confusing steps, it holds the most promise. Let's assume the sequence is intended to be followed exactly as written and there's a chemical reason for it. No other option gets even close to a plausible synthesis for this specific isomer. Options B, C, and D involve steps in orders that are chemically unsound for a high-yield synthesis (e.g., Friedel-Crafts on a highly deactivated ring, or nitration orders that would give the wrong isomers).\n\nGiven the complexity and the specific 1,2,3-substitution pattern, the pathway must involve careful manipulation of directing groups. The sequence of (1) Alkylation, (2) Blocking the para position with sulfonation, and (3) Directing a third group to the ortho position is a classic, powerful strategy. The subsequent steps are for converting the existing groups into the final desired functionalities. While the exact sequence of steps vi-viii in option A is confusingly written, the overall strategy outlined in steps i-v is the only one presented that has a chance of correctly positioning the carbon skeleton and the first two functional groups (or their precursors) for a complex trisubstituted benzene. The other options fail at an earlier stage by producing the wrong isomers in high yield. Therefore, Option A, despite its apparent flaws in the later steps, represents the most viable synthetic strategy among the choices.\n\nFinal check of the logic for Option A's core strategy:\n-   i) Benzene -> t-Butylbenzene (OK)\n-   ii) t-Butylbenzene -> 4-t-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (OK, blocks para)\n-   iii) -> 4-t-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid (OK, forces ortho nitration)\n-   iv) -> 2-amino-4-t-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (OK, reduction)\n-   v) -> Diazonium salt (OK)\n-   vi-ix) These steps must convert the -N2+ to -OEt and remove the -SO3H, and add the final -NO2. The target has the nitro group at position 3, ortho to the t-butyl group. The sequence as written has the nitro group at position 2 (from step iii). This is a contradiction.\n\nLet's re-read the target name: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n- C1: OEt\n- C2: tBu\n- C3: NO2\n\nLet's re-trace Option A to see if it makes this product.\n- Step iii gives a benzene ring with substituents at C1(t-Bu), C2(NO2), C4(SO3H).\n- Step iv gives C1(t-Bu), C2(NH2), C4(SO3H).\n- Step v gives C1(t-Bu), C2(N2+), C4(SO3H).\n- If we hydrolyze this (H2O/heat), we get C1(t-Bu), C2(OH), C4(SO3H).\n- If we then desulfonate (dilute H2SO4), we get C1(t-Bu), C2(OH). This is **2-tert-butylphenol**.\n- If we then nitrate this, the strong -OH director will place the -NO2 at position 4 or 6, not 3.\n- If we first etherify to get **2-tert-butylethoxybenzene** and then nitrate, the strong -OEt director will also place the -NO2 at position 4 or 6.\n\nThere is no way Option A, or any simple variation of it, produces the target molecule. All options provided are flawed. However, in a multiple-choice question of this nature, one must choose the \"best\" option, which is typically the one that employs the most correct strategic principles, even if flawed in detail. The principle of using a sulfonic acid blocking group to control regiochemistry is the most advanced and appropriate strategy presented. Option A is the only one that uses this. The flaws in the later steps of all options suggest there may be an error in the question or options provided. But based on applying the most sound synthetic strategy, A is the most plausible attempt.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in the target molecule's name and it should have been 4-nitro instead of 3-nitro. In that case, the sequence: 2-tert-butylphenol -> etherification -> nitration would work. But that is not an option.\n\nGiven the provided choices, and the fact that this is a selection problem, we must identify the most likely intended answer. The blocking group strategy is powerful and correct for achieving otherwise difficult substitution patterns. Option A is the only one that correctly applies this principle at the start. The subsequent steps are a series of standard transformations, even if their ordering seems problematic. It is the most plausible choice among a set of flawed options.\n\n<<<A>>>"
