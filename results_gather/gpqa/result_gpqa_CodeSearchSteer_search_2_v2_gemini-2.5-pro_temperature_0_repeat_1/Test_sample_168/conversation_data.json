    "The analysis of the problem leads to a clear conclusion based on the principles of nuclear decay kinematics. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:\n\nFirst, it's essential to determine if the energy spectrum of the emitted 'E' particles remains continuous or becomes discrete. In the original decay (2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V), the available decay energy is shared among four light particles (2E and 2V), in addition to the recoil of the two heavy 'B' nucleons. When energy is shared among three or more particles in the final state, the energy of any single particle (or a subset of particles) will have a continuous distribution. The modified decay is 2A -> 2B + 2E + M. Here, the energy is shared among three light particles (2E and M). Since the final state still consists of multiple bodies, the total energy spectrum of the two 'E' particles will remain continuous. This eliminates options A and D, which suggest a discrete spectrum. A discrete spectrum is characteristic of a two-body decay, where the energies of the outgoing particles are fixed by conservation laws.\n\nNext, we must compare the endpoint energy of the 'E' particles' spectrum in both decay scenarios. The endpoint energy corresponds to the maximum possible combined kinetic energy of the two 'E' particles. This maximum is achieved when the other light emitted particles (2V in the first case, M in the second) carry away the minimum possible energy.\n\nThe total energy released in the decay, known as the Q-value, is determined by the mass difference between the initial and final nuclei: Q_value = [mass(2A) - mass(2B)] * c². This energy must account for the rest mass and kinetic energy of all emitted particles.\n\n*   **Original Decay (2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V):** The total released energy is distributed as:\n    Q_value = KE(2E) + KE(2V) + 2*m_E*c² + 2*m_V*c² (ignoring the negligible recoil kinetic energy of the heavy nuclei).\n    The endpoint of the summed kinetic energy for the 'E' particles occurs when the kinetic energy of the 'V' particles is zero. Therefore, the endpoint is:\n    Endpoint_original = Q_value - 2*m_E*c² - 2*m_V*c². The problem refers to this value as 'Q'.\n\n*   **Modified Decay (2A -> 2B + 2E + M):** The total released energy is distributed as:\n    Q_value = KE(2E) + KE(M) + 2*m_E*c² + m_M*c².\n    The problem states that particle M is massless (m_M = 0). The endpoint of the summed kinetic energy for the 'E' particles occurs when the kinetic energy of M is zero. Therefore, the new endpoint is:\n    Endpoint_modified = Q_value - 2*m_E*c².\n\nComparing the two endpoints, we see that Endpoint_modified is greater than Endpoint_original by the amount 2*m_V*c². The problem is analogous to the real-world comparison between two-neutrino double beta decay (2νββ) and Majoron-emitting neutrinoless double beta decay (0νββM). In this context, the 'V' particles are neutrinos, which have a small but non-zero mass. Therefore, the term 2*m_V*c² is positive, which means the endpoint of the energy spectrum increases in the modified decay.\n\nThe shape of the continuous spectrum is also adjusted, primarily because the available phase space is different for a three-body final state (2E + M) compared to a five-body final state (2E + 2V).\n\nThus, the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.\n\n<<<C>>>"
