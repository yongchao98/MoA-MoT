    "Here is a breakdown of each statement's accuracy based on the search results:\n\n*   **Statement A:** This statement is correct. Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, use a -1 programmed ribosomal frameshift (-1 PRF) to produce their essential proteins. This process involves a \"slippery sequence\" and a downstream RNA pseudoknot. Small-angle X-ray scattering analyses have shown that the pseudoknots in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share the same conformation.\n\n*   **Statement B:** This statement is incorrect. The nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex functions as a 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease, which is involved in a proofreading or mismatch repair mechanism. This enzymatic activity *degrades* or *digests* double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), particularly to remove mismatched nucleotides. It does not *prevent* the breakdown of dsRNA; its function is the opposite. The ability to digest dsRNA may also help the virus evade the host's innate immune sensors.\n\n*   **Statement C:** This statement is correct. Studies have shown a correlation between the efficiency of frameshifting and the conformational plasticity of the pseudoknot, meaning its tendency to form alternate structures. Specifically for SARS-CoV-2, studies using optical tweezers have revealed that its frameshift signal can form at least two distinct pseudoknotted conformations when under tension.\n\n*   **Statement D:** This statement is correct. The SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a protein has been shown to induce apoptosis. Studies confirm that ORF3a can activate caspase-8 without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. The activation of caspase-8 is a hallmark of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, while Bcl-2 is a key regulator of the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway. Therefore, this evidence strongly suggests that ORF3a induces apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway. Some research indicates that this extrinsic activation can then lead to the activation of the intrinsic pathway through the cleavage of Bid.\n\nThe incorrect statement is B because the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex actively degrades dsRNA as part of its proofreading function, rather than preventing its breakdown.\n\n<<<B>>>"
