    "An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' approaches a circle of radius 'a' as the number of sides N becomes infinitely large. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The angular positions of the dark rings (minima) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind.\n\nFor a circular aperture of diameter D, the angular positions of the minima are given by the formula:\nsin(θ) ≈ θ = c * (λ / D)\nwhere λ is the wavelength of the light and 'c' is a constant that depends on the order of the minimum.\n\nIn this problem, the radius of the aperture is 'a', so its diameter is D = 2a. The formula for the angular position of the minima becomes:\nθ = c * (λ / 2a)\n\nThe constants 'c' for the first few minima are derived from the zeros of the Bessel functions and are approximately 1.22, 2.23, 3.24, and so on.\n\n1.  **Angular position of the first minimum (θ₁):**\n    Using the constant for the first minimum, c₁ ≈ 1.22, we get:\n    θ₁ = 1.22 * (λ / 2a) = 0.610 * (λ / a)\n\n2.  **Angular position of the second minimum (θ₂):**\n    Using the constant for the second minimum, c₂ ≈ 2.23, we get:\n    θ₂ = 2.23 * (λ / 2a) = 1.115 * (λ / a)\n\n3.  **Angular distance between the first two minima (Δθ):**\n    The angular distance is the difference between the positions of the second and first minima:\n    Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁\n    Δθ = (1.115 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\n    Δθ = (1.115 - 0.610) * (λ / a)\n    Δθ = 0.505 * (λ / a)\n\nThis value is closest to 0.506 λ / a. The minor difference is due to using more precise values for the constants, which are derived from the zeros of the Bessel functions (c₁ ≈ 1.2197 and c₂ ≈ 2.233).\n\n<<<A>>>"
