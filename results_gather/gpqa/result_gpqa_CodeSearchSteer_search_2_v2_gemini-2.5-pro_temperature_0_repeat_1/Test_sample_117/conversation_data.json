    "The starting material, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, is an enol. Enols exist in equilibrium with their corresponding keto tautomers. In this case, the enol will tautomerize to the more stable ketone, 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. While the equilibrium heavily favors the keto form, the enol is very reactive.\n\nThe reaction of a ketone with bromine (Brâ‚‚) in the presence of acid or even under neutral conditions results in the halogenation at the alpha-carbon (the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group). This reaction proceeds through the enol intermediate. The electron-rich double bond of the enol acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic bromine.\n\nIn 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone, the carbonyl carbon is at position 1. The alpha-carbons are at positions 2 and 5. Since the molecule is symmetrical, these positions are equivalent. Therefore, a bromine atom will substitute for a hydrogen atom at the alpha-position, leading to the formation of 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n*   A) 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone: Bromination occurs at the alpha-position, not at position 4.\n*   B) (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol: This would be the product of an addition reaction to the double bond of the enol. However, the alpha-halogenation of the keto tautomer is the major pathway.\n*   C) 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone: This is the correct product resulting from the alpha-halogenation of the ketone tautomer.\n*   D) (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol: This is a stereoisomer of option B and is also an incorrect product.\n\nTherefore, the major outcome of the reaction is the formation of the alpha-bromo ketone.\n\n<<<C>>>"
