    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by:\n    T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n2.  **Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n    We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2*a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2*a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]\n\n    Since T_star, R_star, and the albedo (A1 = A2) are the same for both planets, the equation simplifies to:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^(1/2)\n\n3.  **Kepler's Third Law**\n    Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period (P) to the semi-major axis (a):\n    P² ∝ a³\n    This means a ∝ P^(2/3).\n    Therefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes is:\n    a2 / a1 = (P2 / P1)^(2/3)\n\n4.  **Connecting Temperature Ratio and Period Ratio**\n    Substituting the result from Kepler's Third Law into the temperature ratio equation:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [(P2 / P1)^(2/3)]^(1/2) = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)\n\n5.  **Radial Velocity (RV) Formula**\n    The semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) induced by a planet on its star is given by:\n    K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))\n    where:\n    *   `P` is the orbital period.\n    *   M_p is the planet's mass.\n    *   M_star is the star's mass.\n    *   `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n    Since the planets were detected by the transit method, their orbital inclination `i` is approximately 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1. As M_star is the same for both planets, we can establish a proportionality:\n    K ∝ M_p / P^(1/3)\n\n6.  **Relating Period to Mass and RV**\n    Rearranging the proportionality:\n    P^(1/3) ∝ M_p / K\n    So, for our two planets:\n    P1^(1/3) ∝ M_p1 / K1\n    P2^(1/3) ∝ M_p2 / K2\n\n7.  **Final Calculation**\n    Now we can substitute these into the temperature ratio equation from step 4:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3) = (M_p2 / K2) / (M_p1 / K1)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K1 / K2)\n\n    The radial velocity amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the Doppler shift (Δλ), so K1/K2 = Δλ1/Δλ2.\n\n    Given values:\n    *   M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n    *   M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n    *   Δλ1 = 0.03 Å\n    *   Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n\n    Plugging in the values:\n    *   M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n    *   K1 / K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\n    The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>"
