    "### Decoding a Diels-Alder Reaction through NMR Spectroscopy\n\n**The reaction in question involves the dehydration of a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid to form a cyclic anhydride, which then participates in a Diels-Alder reaction with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The resulting major and minor products are analyzed by 2D NOESY NMR to determine their stereochemistry.**\n\nFirst, the starting anhydride is identified as maleic anhydride. This is deduced from its nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, which show a single proton peak at 7 ppm and two carbon peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. The symmetry of maleic anhydride accounts for the single proton signal and two distinct carbon environments (alkene and carbonyl carbons).\n\nThe subsequent Diels-Alder reaction pairs maleic anhydride (the dienophile) with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (the diene). This cycloaddition is known to produce two diastereomeric products: an *endo* and an *exo* adduct. Typically, the *endo* product is formed faster and is considered the major, or kinetic, product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions during the reaction. The *exo* product is the more stable, thermodynamic product and is generally minor.\n\nThe products, with a molecular formula of C13H16O3, are derivatives of bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene. The key to distinguishing the *endo* and *exo* isomers lies in the spatial arrangement of the atoms, which can be elucidated using Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY). A NOESY spectrum reveals protons that are close to each other in space. A cross-peak between two proton signals indicates their spatial proximity (typically less than 5 Ã…).\n\nThe problem states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product's spectrum but absent in the minor one. This indicates a unique spatial relationship in the major (*endo*) isomer that does not exist in the minor (*exo*) isomer.\n\nIn the *endo* adduct, the anhydride portion of the molecule is tucked underneath the main bicyclic framework, on the same side as the C7 bridge (which originates from the CH2 group of the cyclopentadiene). This geometry brings the two protons on the anhydride ring into close proximity with the *syn* proton on the C7 bridge.\n\nConversely, in the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented away from the C7 bridge. This results in a much greater distance between the anhydride protons and the C7 bridge protons.\n\nBased on typical chemical shifts for such bicyclic systems, the signals can be assigned as follows:\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** The two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** The two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond (vinylic methyls).\n*   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** The two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n*   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** The *syn* proton on the C7 bridge (the other bridge proton, *anti*, would be a separate signal).\n\nThe distinctive NOESY cross-peak observed only in the major (*endo*) product must therefore connect the protons that are uniquely close in this isomer. This corresponds to the interaction between the anhydride protons and the *syn*-C7 proton.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connects the 2H singlet at approximately 3.5 ppm and the 1H doublet at approximately 1.5 ppm.\n\n<<<A>>>"
