    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], among all cobalt-containing species, we can use the provided stability constants and the concentration of the thiocyanate ligand.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co(II) ion and all the thiocyanato complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nUsing the overall stability constants (β), we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion, [Co²⁺], and the thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻]:\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nThe percentage of a specific complex, in this case [Co(SCN)₂], is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration, multiplied by 100. The formula for the mole fraction (α₂) of the [Co(SCN)₂] complex is:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe percentage is simply this fraction multiplied by 100. The total cobalt concentration, c(Co), is not needed for this calculation as the [Co²⁺] term cancels out.\n\nGiven the values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nWe can calculate the terms for the denominator:\n*   1\n*   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 × (0.1) = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 63 × 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 16 × 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nThe sum of these terms (the denominator) is:\n1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator is the term corresponding to the [Co(SCN)₂] complex:\nβ₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n\nNow, we can calculate the percentage:\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = (0.4 / 2.3646) × 100 ≈ 16.916%\n\nThis value is closest to 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
