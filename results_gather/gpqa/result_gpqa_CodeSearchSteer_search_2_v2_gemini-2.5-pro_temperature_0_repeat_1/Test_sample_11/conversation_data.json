    "The problem asks for the kinetic energies of the product particles, a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν), from the decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺). The rest masses are given in units of energy (MeV), which simplifies the calculations.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation based on the principles of conservation of energy and momentum:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy**: Since the pion is stationary, its total energy is its rest energy. This energy is conserved and converted into the total energies of the decay products.\n    *   E_π = E_μ + E_ν\n    *   m_π * c² = (KE_μ + m_μ * c²) + KE_ν\n    *   Note: The neutrino is considered massless, so its total energy is purely kinetic (E_ν = KE_ν), and its rest mass is zero.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum**: The initial momentum of the stationary pion is zero. Therefore, the final momentum of the system must also be zero. This implies that the muon and the neutrino must travel in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude.\n    *   p_π = 0\n    *   p_μ + p_ν = 0\n    *   |p_μ| = |p_ν|\n\n3.  **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**: The relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n    *   For the muon: E_μ² = (p_μc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    *   For the massless neutrino: E_ν² = (p_νc)²\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nFrom the conservation laws, we can derive a formula for the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_μ).\n\n*   From momentum conservation, (p_μc)² = (p_νc)².\n*   Since E_ν = p_νc, we have (p_μc)² = E_ν².\n*   From energy conservation, we can express the neutrino's energy as: E_ν = m_πc² - E_μ = m_πc² - (KE_μ + m_μc²).\n*   Substitute this into the energy-momentum relation for the muon: (KE_μ + m_μc²)² = E_ν² + (m_μc²)².\n*   (KE_μ + m_μc²)² = (m_πc² - (KE_μ + m_μc²))² + (m_μc²)²\n\nExpanding and solving this equation for KE_μ yields the formula:\n\nKE_μ = (m_πc² - m_μc²)² / (2 * m_πc²)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n*   Rest mass of Pi(+) (m_πc²): 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass of mu(+) (m_μc²): 105.7 MeV\n\nKE_μ = (139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV)² / (2 * 139.6 MeV)\nKE_μ = (33.9 MeV)² / (279.2 MeV)\nKE_μ = 1149.21 MeV² / 279.2 MeV\nKE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV.\n\nNext, we find the kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_ν). The total kinetic energy released in the decay is the difference between the initial rest mass energy and the final rest mass energies.\n\nTotal KE = m_πc² - m_μc² = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the muon and the neutrino:\n\nTotal KE = KE_μ + KE_ν\n33.9 MeV = 4.12 MeV + KE_ν\nKE_ν = 33.9 MeV - 4.12 MeV\nKE_ν ≈ 29.78 MeV, which can be rounded to 29.8 MeV.\n\nThus, the kinetic energies of the product particles are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino.\n\n<<<D>>>"
