    "When racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst, it undergoes self-metathesis. Since the starting material is a racemic mixture, it contains equal amounts of (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene. The metathesis reaction will result in dimers, excluding the co-product ethene.\n\nThere are three possible reaction pairings for the dimerization:\n1.  (R)-enantiomer with another (R)-enantiomer.\n2.  (S)-enantiomer with another (S)-enantiomer.\n3.  (R)-enantiomer with an (S)-enantiomer.\n\nThe product of this dimerization is 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. The reaction creates a new carbon-carbon double bond at the C4 position, which can have either E or Z geometry. The original chiral centers from the reactants are retained at the C3 and C6 positions.\n\nLet's analyze the stereochemistry of the products from each pairing:\n\n1.  **(R) + (R) reaction**: This pairing produces (3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. Since the new double bond can be E or Z, two diastereomeric products are formed:\n    *   (E)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral)\n    *   (Z)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral)\n\n2.  **(S) + (S) reaction**: This pairing produces (3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. Again, two diastereomeric products are formed:\n    *   (E)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral, the enantiomer of the E-(3R,6R) product)\n    *   (Z)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral, the enantiomer of the Z-(3R,6R) product)\n    Together, the (R,R) and (S,S) reactions produce two pairs of enantiomers (two racemic mixtures).\n\n3.  **(R) + (S) reaction**: This pairing produces (3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. The E and Z isomers of this product have different properties:\n    *   **(E)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene**: This molecule possesses a center of inversion and is therefore a meso compound (achiral). It is a single product.\n    *   **(Z)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene**: This molecule is chiral. Since the overall reaction starts from an achiral racemic mixture, any chiral product must be formed as a racemic mixture. Therefore, its enantiomer, (Z)-(3S,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene, is also formed in an equal amount.\n\nIn total, the possible products are:\n*   A racemic mixture of E-(3R,6R) and E-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n*   A racemic mixture of Z-(3R,6R) and Z-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n*   The meso compound E-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n*   A racemic mixture of Z-(3R,6S) and Z-(3S,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n\nThese four sets of products (one meso compound and three racemic pairs) are all diastereomers of each other. In chemical terms, this means they have different physical properties and can be separated. Therefore, there are four possible, distinct products.\n\n<<<C>>>"
