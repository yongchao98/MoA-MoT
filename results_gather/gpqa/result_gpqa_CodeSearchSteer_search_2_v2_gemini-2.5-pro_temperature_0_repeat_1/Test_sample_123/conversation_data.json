    "The problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay. The fraction of particles that survive after traveling a certain distance is dependent on their proper lifetime and their Lorentz factor.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n\n1.  **Survival Probability:** The probability `P` that a particle survives after a time `t` in the laboratory frame is given by the exponential decay law. This law is expressed in terms of the particle's proper mean lifetime, `τ`, and its Lorentz factor, `γ`. The lifetime as observed in the lab is dilated to `γτ`. The time `t` it takes for a particle to travel the detector radius `L` (30 m) at a velocity `v` is `t = L/v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`. Therefore, `t ≈ L/c`.\n\n    The survival probability `P` is given by the formula:\n    `P = exp(-t / (γτ)) = exp(-L / (γvcτ))`\n    Approximating `v` with `c`, we get:\n    `P = exp(-L / (γcτ))`\n\n2.  **Initial Condition:** We are given that for a Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, one-third of the particles reach the detector wall.\n    *   `L = 30` m\n    *   `γ₁ = 20`\n    *   `P₁ = 1/3`\n\n    Plugging these values into the equation:\n    `1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * cτ))`\n\n    To solve for the unknown `cτ` term, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * cτ)`\n    `-ln(3) = -1.5 / (cτ)`\n    `ln(3) = 1.5 / (cτ)`\n\n3.  **Target Condition:** We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, for which two-thirds of the particles reach the detector.\n    *   `L = 30` m\n    *   `P₂ = 2/3`\n    *   `γ₂ = ?`\n\n    Using the same survival equation:\n    `2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * cτ))`\n\n    Again, taking the natural logarithm:\n    `ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n    `-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n    `ln(1.5) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n\n4.  **Solving for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂):** We now have two equations:\n    i) `ln(3) = 1.5 / (cτ)`\n    ii) `ln(1.5) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n\n    From equation (i), we can express the constant term `cτ` as `cτ = 1.5 / ln(3)`.\n    Now, substitute this expression for `cτ` into equation (ii):\n    `ln(1.5) = 30 / (γ₂ * (1.5 / ln(3)))`\n    `ln(1.5) = (30 * ln(3)) / (1.5 * γ₂)`\n\n    Now, we solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = (30 * ln(3)) / (1.5 * ln(1.5))`\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(1.5))`\n\n    Using the approximate values for the natural logarithms (`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`):\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThis calculated value is extremely close to 54.\n\n<<<C>>>"
