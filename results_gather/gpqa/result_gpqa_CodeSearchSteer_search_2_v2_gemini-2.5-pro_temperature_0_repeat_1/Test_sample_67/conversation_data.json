    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the oscillation frequency:\n\n1.  **Initial State:** The spin-1/2 particle is initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in the spin-up eigenstate of the Z-component of the spin operator, S​z​. We denote this state as |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩​z​.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian:** The magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude B. The Hamiltonian of the system, which describes the interaction of the magnetic moment (μ) with the magnetic field (B), is given by H = -μ ⋅ B. Since the magnetic moment is related to the spin by μ = γS (where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and S is the spin operator), the new Hamiltonian is H = -γ(S ⋅ B) = -γB S​y​, where S​y​ is the Y-component of the spin operator.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution of the Expectation Value:** We are interested in the time evolution of the average (or expectation value) of the Z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μ​z​(t)⟩. This is given by ⟨μ​z​(t)⟩ = γ⟨S​z​(t)⟩. To find how ⟨S​z​⟩ changes with time, we can use the Heisenberg equation of motion for the expectation value of an operator:\n\n    d⟨A⟩/dt = (i/ħ)⟨[H, A]⟩\n\n    In our case, the operator A is S​z​. So we have:\n\n    d⟨S​z​⟩/dt = (i/ħ)⟨[-γB S​y​, S​z​]⟩ = (-iγB/ħ)⟨[S​y​, S​z​]⟩\n\n4.  **Commutation Relations:** The spin operators satisfy the commutation relation [S​y​, S​z​] = iħS​x​. Substituting this into the equation above:\n\n    d⟨S​z​⟩/dt = (-iγB/ħ)(iħ⟨S​x​⟩) = γB⟨S​x​⟩\n\n5.  **Coupled Equations:** To solve for ⟨S​z​⟩, we also need to find how ⟨S​x​⟩ evolves in time. We apply the same equation of motion for A = S​x​:\n\n    d⟨S​x​⟩/dt = (i/ħ)⟨[-γB S​y​, S​x​]⟩ = (-iγB/ħ)⟨[S​y​, S​x​]⟩\n\n    Using the commutation relation [S​y​, S​x​] = -iħS​z​, we get:\n\n    d⟨S​x​⟩/dt = (-iγB/ħ)(-iħ⟨S​z​⟩) = -γB⟨S​z​⟩\n\n6.  **Harmonic Oscillator Equation:** We now have a system of two coupled first-order differential equations:\n    *   d⟨S​z​⟩/dt = γB⟨S​x​⟩\n    *   d⟨S​x​⟩/dt = -γB⟨S​z​⟩\n\n    To find the oscillation frequency of ⟨S​z​⟩, we can differentiate the first equation with respect to time:\n\n    d²⟨S​z​⟩/dt² = γB(d⟨S​x​⟩/dt)\n\n    Now, substitute the second equation into this new equation:\n\n    d²⟨S​z​⟩/dt² = γB(-γB⟨S​z​⟩) = -(γB)²⟨S​z​⟩\n\n7.  **Oscillation Frequency:** This is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, d²x/dt² = -ω²x, where ω is the angular frequency of oscillation. By comparing the two equations, we can identify the angular frequency as:\n\n    ω = γB\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession, where the spin vector precesses around the direction of the magnetic field at the Larmor frequency, ω = γB. The projection of the spin onto any other axis will oscillate at this frequency.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle's moment is γB.\n\n<<<B>>>"
