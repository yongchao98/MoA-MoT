    "The detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic data allows for a definitive identification of the unknown compound's chemical formula.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring (C₆) with two substituents, which means there are four hydrogens directly attached to the ring (C₆H₄). The 1H NMR spectrum confirms this with two signals corresponding to these aromatic hydrogens.\n\n2.  **FTIR Spectrum:** The presence of an ester group (-COO-) is confirmed. This functional group contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n3.  **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** Corresponds to the four protons on the di-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals):** The presence of two vinyl hydrogen signals, one a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets, is a classic pattern for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). The doublet arises from the vinyl proton adjacent to the ring, split by the other vinyl proton. The doublet of quartets arises from the second vinyl proton, which is split into a doublet by the first vinyl proton and into a quartet by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group.\n    *   **-CH₃ groups (2 signals):** One methyl signal corresponds to the propenyl group (-CH=CH-**CH₃**). The second methyl signal must belong to the ester group. To avoid having any -CH₂- groups (which are explicitly stated as absent), this must be either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetoxy group (-OCOCH₃).\n    *   **No -CH₂ groups:** This is a crucial piece of information that rules out other possibilities like an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n### Structure Determination and Formula Calculation\n\nBased on the fragments identified from the spectra, we can construct the molecule. The two substituents on the C₆H₄ ring are a propenyl group and an ester-containing group.\n\n*   **Fragment 1:** C₆H₄ (di-substituted benzene ring)\n*   **Fragment 2:** -CH=CH-CH₃ (propenyl group)\n*   **Fragment 3:** An ester group with a methyl group and no methylene groups. This can be either a methyl ester group (-COOCH₃) or an acetoxy group (-OCOCH₃).\n\nLet's calculate the molecular formula for a structure composed of these fragments:\n\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from the ring) + 3 (from the propenyl group) + 2 (from an acetoxy group, -OCOCH₃) OR 6 (from the ring) + 3 (from the propenyl group) + 1 (from a carbonyl, -**C**O) + 1 (from a methyl ester, -O**C**H₃). Both possibilities sum to **11 carbons**.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from the ring) + 5 (from the propenyl group, H+H+H₃) + 3 (from the methyl/acetoxy group). This sums to **12 hydrogens**.\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group).\n\nCombining these atoms gives the molecular formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\nThis formula is consistent with all the provided spectral data. Comparing this to the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
