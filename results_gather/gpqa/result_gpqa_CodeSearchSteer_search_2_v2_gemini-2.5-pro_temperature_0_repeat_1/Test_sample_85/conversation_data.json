    "Here is a breakdown of the reactions based on the established selectivity of the reducing agents:\n\n*   **Reaction A: Starting material A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n    *   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Mechanism:** LiBH4 will reduce the isobutyl ester group at the C5 position of the starting material to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The carboxylic acid group at the C1 position will remain unchanged. The resulting molecule is a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    *   **Lactonization:** Under acidic conditions (H+), the newly formed hydroxyl group at C5 will attack the carboxylic acid at C1 in an intramolecular esterification reaction. This cyclization forms the six-membered ring of the lactone product.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the ester and the subsequent lactonization do not affect the chiral center at C3 of the starting material. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product at C4 will be the same as the stereochemistry of the starting material at C3. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n*   **Reaction B: Starting material B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n    *   **Reagent:** Borane (BH3) is a reducing agent known to selectively reduce carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n    *   **Mechanism:** BH3 will reduce the carboxylic acid group at the C1 position of the starting material to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The isobutyl ester group at the C5 position will remain intact. The resulting molecule is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    *   **Lactonization:** This intermediate, an alcohol-ester, cannot directly form the desired lactone. However, under the reaction conditions (often involving workup), the ester can be hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid, or transesterification can occur. A more direct pathway involves the initial reduction of the carboxylic acid to the alcohol, followed by an intramolecular transesterification where the newly formed C1-OH attacks the C5-ester carbonyl. This displaces the isobutanol and forms the lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to the first reaction, the reduction and cyclization steps do not alter the original chiral center at C3. Thus, the stereochemistry of the product at C4 will be identical to that of the starting material at C3. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
