    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the permitted and non-permitted partial waves based on the provided principles of nuclear physics.\n\n### 1. Initial State Analysis: `1S0`\nThe initial state of the two-nucleon (NN) system is given by the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   **State:** `1S0`\n*   **Total Spin (S):** `2S+1 = 1` implies `S = 0`.\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L):** The letter 'S' corresponds to `L = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (J):** `J = 0`.\n*   **Parity (P):** The parity of the NN system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. For the initial state, `P_initial = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Properties of the Transition\n*   **Emitted Particle (X):** It has an intrinsic parity of `P(X) = -1`. Its orbital angular momentum is denoted by a lowercase letter (`s` for l=0, `p` for l=1, etc.).\n*   **Final NN State:** It is specified to have an isospin of `T(NN) = 0`.\n\n### 3. Conservation Laws and Principles\n\n1.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state. The initial state has `J_initial = 0`. The final state's total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J(NN)`) and the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum (`l(X)`). Therefore, `J(NN)` and `l(X)` must be able to couple to zero, which implies `J(NN) = l(X)`.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n    *   `P_initial = P_final`\n    *   `P(initial NN) = P(final NN) * P(X) * (-1)^l(X)`\n    *   `+1 = ((-1)^L(NN)) * (-1) * (-1)^l(X)`\n    *   This simplifies to `(-1) = (-1)^(L(NN) + l(X))`, which means that `L(NN) + l(X)` must be an odd number. Consequently, `L(NN)` and `l(X)` must have different parity (one must be even, the other odd).\n\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** For a system of two identical fermions like nucleons, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. This leads to the condition that `L + S + T` must be an odd integer. The problem provides this condition in the form `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`, which is equivalent. Since the final state has `T(NN) = 0`, the condition for the final NN state simplifies to `L(NN) + S(NN)` must be an odd integer.\n\n4.  **Composition of Two Nucleons:** Nucleons are spin-1/2 particles. A system of two nucleons can only have a total spin `S` of 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet).\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Options\n\nLet's check each option against these rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   **Final NN state (3D3):** S=1, L=2, J=3.\n*   **Emitted particle (f):** l(X)=3.\n*   **Angular Momentum:** `J(NN) = 3` and `l(X) = 3`. These can couple to `J_total = 0`. This is conserved.\n*   **Parity:** `L(NN) = 2` (even) and `l(X) = 3` (odd). They have different parity. This is conserved.\n*   **Pauli Principle:** `L(NN) + S(NN) = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). This is satisfied for T=0.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   **Final NN state (7D1):** `2S+1 = 7` implies `S=3`.\n*   **Composition:** A total spin of S=3 is not possible for a two-nucleon system. Therefore, this final state cannot exist.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is not permitted because the final NN state is physically impossible.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   **Final NN state (3P0):** S=1, L=1, J=0.\n*   **Emitted particle (s):** l(X)=0.\n*   **Angular Momentum:** `J(NN) = 0` and `l(X) = 0`. These couple to `J_total = 0`. This is conserved.\n*   **Parity:** `L(NN) = 1` (odd) and `l(X) = 0` (even). They have different parity. This is conserved.\n*   **Pauli Principle:** `L(NN) + S(NN) = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This violates the Pauli principle for a T=0 final state, which requires `L+S` to be odd.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is not permitted because it violates the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   **Final NN state (3S1):** S=1, L=0, J=1.\n*   **Emitted particle (p):** l(X)=1.\n*   **Angular Momentum:** `J(NN) = 1` and `l(X) = 1`. These can couple to `J_total = 0`. This is conserved.\n*   **Parity:** `L(NN) = 0` (even) and `l(X) = 1` (odd). They have different parity. This is conserved.\n*   **Pauli Principle:** `L(NN) + S(NN) = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). This is satisfied for T=0.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is permitted.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBoth options B and C describe transitions that are not permitted.\n*   Option B is impossible because the final state `7D1` (with S=3) cannot be formed by two nucleons.\n*   Option C is impossible because the transition violates the Pauli exclusion principle for the specified final isospin `T=0`.\n\nThe question explicitly asks to use the Pauli statistics condition (`T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`), conservation of angular momentum, and parity. Option C is the only one that fails the explicitly stated Pauli condition. Option B fails based on a more fundamental, but unstated, premise of the system's composition. In the context of such physics problems, the intended answer is typically the one that violates the specific rules given for the process.\n\nThe transition `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` violates the Pauli principle for the final state (`L+S = 1+1=2`, which is not odd).\n\n<<<C>>>"
