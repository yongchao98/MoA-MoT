    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition reaction. The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will deprotonate the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate will then attack the α,β-unsaturated ester, ethyl acrylate.\n2.  **Enolate Formation**: The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The alpha-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group) are C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group, so it has no acidic protons and cannot form an enolate.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and has one acidic proton.\n    *   Therefore, the t-BuOK base will exclusively remove the proton from C6, forming a single, specific enolate.\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The enolate is nucleophilic at C6. It will attack the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (H₂C=CH-COOEt) in a conjugate addition.\n4.  **Product Structure**: A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate moiety. The resulting product is **6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one**.\n5.  **Product Naming**: The options provided use a different IUPAC naming convention where the propanoate is the parent chain. Let's analyze the structure of our product and compare it to the names given.\n    *   Our product has a carbonyl group (C1), an adjacent quaternary carbon with ethyl and methyl groups (C2), and another adjacent quaternary carbon with a methyl group and the newly added chain (C6).\n    *   The name in option A/B is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. Let's deconstruct the cyclohexyl substituent part:\n        *   The ring is attached to the propanoate chain at its C1 position.\n        *   C1 has a methyl group.\n        *   C2 is a carbonyl (oxo) group.\n        *   C3 has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    *   This structure has a carbonyl at C2, an adjacent carbon (C1) substituted with a methyl group and the main chain, and another adjacent carbon (C3) substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group. This substitution pattern perfectly matches the product formed in the reaction, just with a different numbering scheme. Therefore, this is the correct name for product A among the choices.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the carbon alpha to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane. The resulting nitronate anion acts as the nucleophile.\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation**: 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) has two acidic protons on the carbon adjacent to the NO₂ group. KOH removes one of these protons to form the nucleophilic nitronate anion, `CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂`.\n3.  **Electrophile**: The electrophile is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), which has the structure CH₃-CH=CH-CN. It is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n4.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The nucleophilic carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n5.  **Product Structure**: A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. The resulting structure is `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n6.  **Product Naming**: To name this product according to IUPAC rules, we identify the longest carbon chain that includes the principal functional group (the nitrile, -CN).\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   The chain is `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\n    *   This is a six-carbon chain, so it is a hexanenitrile.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group on C3 and a nitro group on C4.\n    *   The correct IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is correctly named **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is correctly named **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nMatching these products with the given options leads to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
