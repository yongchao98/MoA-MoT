    "### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Define the condition for transit:** A planet transits its star if its projected distance from the star's center is less than or equal to the sum of the star's radius (R_s) and the planet's radius (R_p). This projected distance is given by `a * cos(i)`, where `a` is the semi-major axis and `i` is the orbital inclination. For a transit to occur:\n    `a * cos(i) ≤ R_s + R_p`\n\n2.  **Use the impact parameter:** The impact parameter `b` is the projected distance normalized by the star's radius: `b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s`. The condition for transit can be rewritten in terms of the impact parameter:\n    `b ≤ (R_s + R_p) / R_s = 1 + R_p / R_s`\n\n3.  **Use information from Planet 1:** We are given that Planet 1 has an impact parameter `b1 = 0.2`. Since both planets share the same orbital plane, their orbital inclination `i` is the same. From the definition of the impact parameter for Planet 1:\n    `b1 = (a1 * cos(i)) / R_s = 0.2`\n    We can express `cos(i)` as:\n    `cos(i) = 0.2 * R_s / a1`\n\n4.  **Apply the transit condition to Planet 2:** For Planet 2 to exhibit a transit, its impact parameter `b2` must satisfy the transit condition. The maximum orbital period will occur at the maximum possible impact parameter, which is when the planet just grazes the star's limb.\n    `b2_max = (a2 * cos(i)) / R_s = 1 + R_p2 / R_s`\n\n5.  **Substitute `cos(i)`:** Now, substitute the expression for `cos(i)` from Planet 1 into the equation for Planet 2:\n    `(a2 / R_s) * (0.2 * R_s / a1) = 1 + R_p2 / R_s`\n    `0.2 * (a2 / a1) = 1 + R_p2 / R_s`\n\n6.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`). For two planets orbiting the same star, we can write the ratio:\n    `(P2 / P1)² = (a2 / a1)³`\n    Therefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes is:\n    `a2 / a1 = (P2 / P1)^(2/3)`\n\n7.  **Combine the equations:** Substitute the expression for `a2 / a1` into the equation from step 5:\n    `0.2 * (P2 / P1)^(2/3) = 1 + R_p2 / R_s`\n\n8.  **Plug in the known values:**\n    *   `P1 = 3` days\n    *   `R_s = 1.5 * R_sun`\n    *   `R_p2 = 2.5 * R_earth`\n    *   The ratio of the Sun's radius to Earth's radius is approximately 109. So, `R_sun ≈ 109 * R_earth`.\n    *   `R_s = 1.5 * (109 * R_earth) = 163.5 * R_earth`\n\n    Now calculate the ratio `R_p2 / R_s`:\n    `R_p2 / R_s = (2.5 * R_earth) / (163.5 * R_earth) ≈ 0.01529`\n\n9.  **Solve for P2:** Substitute the values into the combined equation:\n    `0.2 * (P2 / 3)^(2/3) = 1 + 0.01529`\n    `0.2 * (P2 / 3)^(2/3) = 1.01529`\n    `(P2 / 3)^(2/3) = 1.01529 / 0.2`\n    `(P2 / 3)^(2/3) = 5.07645`\n    `P2 / 3 = (5.07645)^(3/2)`\n    `P2 / 3 = 5.07645 * sqrt(5.07645)`\n    `P2 / 3 ≈ 5.07645 * 2.2531`\n    `P2 / 3 ≈ 11.438`\n    `P2 ≈ 3 * 11.438`\n    `P2 ≈ 34.314` days\n\nThe maximum orbital period for the second planet is approximately 34.3 days. This value is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
