    "To determine the momentum of the absorbed photon, we first need to calculate the energy difference (ΔE) between the initial and final states of the molecule. The energy of the photon will be equal to this energy difference.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Molecular States and Transition\n\nThe energy of a diatomic molecule in the quantum rotation-vibration model is given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n*   **Vibrational Energy (Ev):** Ev = ħω(v + 1/2), where `v` is the vibrational quantum number (v = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   **Rotational Energy (Er):** Er = (ħ² / 2I) * J(J + 1), where `J` is the rotational quantum number (J = 0, 1, 2, ...) and `I` is the moment of inertia.\n\nThe total energy is E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * J(J + 1).\n\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its fundamental (ground) state, which corresponds to the lowest possible energy. This occurs when both quantum numbers are at their minimum: v = 0 and J = 0.\n    *   E_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + 0 = (1/2)ħω\n\n*   **Final State:** The question asks for the transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" In the context of rovibrational spectroscopy, this implies a transition where the vibrational quantum number changes. The selection rules for the absorption of a photon by a heteronuclear diatomic molecule are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1.\n    *   Starting from J=0, a transition with ΔJ = -1 is not possible.\n    *   Therefore, the only allowed transition is Δv = +1 and ΔJ = +1.\n    *   This means the final state is v = 1 and J = 1.\n    *   E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * 1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I\n\n### 2. Calculating the Transition Energy (ΔE)\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon is the difference between the final and initial energy states:\nΔE = E_final - E_initial\nΔE = [ (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I ] - [ (1/2)ħω ]\nΔE = ħω + ħ²/I\n\nTo calculate this, we need the moment of inertia, `I`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Moment of Inertia (I)\n\nThe moment of inertia is given by I = μR², where μ is the reduced mass.\n\n*   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n    μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n    μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n    Converting to kilograms (1 amu ≈ 1.6605 × 10⁻²⁷ kg):\n    μ ≈ 1.818 * (1.6605 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n*   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n    I = μR²\n    I ≈ (3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\n    I ≈ (3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (4 × 10⁻²⁰ m²)\n    I ≈ 1.208 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n### 4. Final Energy and Momentum Calculation\n\nNow we can calculate the two parts of the energy change, using the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n\n*   **Vibrational Energy Part (ħω):**\n    ħω = (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 × 10¹⁴ rad/s) = 4.216 × 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n*   **Rotational Energy Part (ħ²/I):**\n    ħ²/I = (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.208 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²)\n    ħ²/I ≈ (1.111 × 10⁻⁶⁸ J²·s²) / (1.208 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 9.20 × 10⁻²³ J\n\n*   **Total Transition Energy (ΔE):**\n    ΔE = (4.216 × 10⁻²⁰ J) + (9.20 × 10⁻²³ J) ≈ 4.225 × 10⁻²⁰ J\n    (Note: The rotational energy contribution is very small compared to the vibrational energy).\n\nFinally, the momentum of a photon (`p`) is related to its energy (`E`) by the equation p = E/c, where `c` is the speed of light (c ≈ 3 × 10⁸ m/s).\n\n*   **Photon Momentum (p):**\n    p = ΔE / c\n    p ≈ (4.225 × 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3 × 10⁸ m/s)\n    p ≈ 1.408 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis value is approximately 1.4 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s.\n\n<<<B>>>"
