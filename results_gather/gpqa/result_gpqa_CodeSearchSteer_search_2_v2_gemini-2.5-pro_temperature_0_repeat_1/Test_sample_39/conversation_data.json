    "In a synthetic organic chemistry lab, the phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other\" is a common colloquialism used to describe a failed or difficult separation of two or more substances. This situation most frequently arises during chromatography, a fundamental technique for purifying compounds.\n\nThe most common forms of chromatography in this setting are Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) and column chromatography. Both of these techniques separate compounds based on their differential partitioning between a stationary phase (often polar silica gel) and a mobile phase (a solvent of varying polarity). Compounds with different polarities will travel at different rates, allowing for their separation.\n\nWhen a chemist says their compounds are \"on top of each other,\" it means that the compounds are moving at very similar rates during the chromatographic process. On a TLC plate, this would appear as spots that have not resolved into distinct entities but instead overlap significantly. In column chromatography, it means the different compounds are eluting from the column at the same time, resulting in mixed fractions instead of pure substances.\n\nThis lack of separation is a direct consequence of the compounds having very similar polarities. Because they have similar polarities, they interact with the stationary and mobile phases in a nearly identical manner, making them difficult to distinguish and separate using this technique.\n\nWhile other properties can pose separation challenges, they are less likely to be described in this specific way:\n*   **A) Non-covalent/van der Waals interactions:** These forces are the basis of how chromatography works, influencing the interaction of compounds with the stationary phase, but the phrase itself describes the outcome of the separation attempt, not the underlying principle.\n*   **B) Similar optical rotations:** Optical rotation is a property of chiral compounds and is measured with a polarimeter. It is not a property that is directly used for common separation techniques like silica gel chromatography.\n*   **C) Similar boiling points:** Compounds with similar boiling points are difficult to separate by distillation. However, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is much more evocative of the visual representation of a chromatogram than the process of distillation.\n\nTherefore, the chemist is most likely referring to the fact that their compounds have similar polarities, leading to poor separation during chromatography.\n\n<<<D>>>"
