    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Define Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:** An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is given as:\n    *   E_initial = M * c² = 300 GeV\n\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses m₁ and m₂.\n    *   The problem states that one fragment is twice as massive as the other: m₁ = 2 * m₂.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest-Masses of the Fragments\n\nWe have a system of two linear equations:\n1.  m₁ = 2 * m₂\n2.  m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n(2 * m₂) + m₂ = 0.99 * M\n3 * m₂ = 0.99 * M\nm₂ = 0.33 * M\n\nNow, find m₁:\nm₁ = 2 * m₂ = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M\n\nNext, we determine the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m₁):\n    E₁ = m₁ * c² = 0.66 * (M * c²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (m₂):\n    E₂ = m₂ * c² = 0.33 * (M * c²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\nQ = E_initial - (E₁ + E₂)\nQ = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\nQ = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments:\nQ = T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV\n\n### 4. Calculate T₁ using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum of the system is zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the final total momentum must also be zero. This means the two fragments move in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude.\np₁ = p₂\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (E_total), momentum (p), and rest-mass energy (m*c²) is E_total² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)². The total energy is also the sum of rest-mass energy and kinetic energy (T): E_total = T + m*c².\n\nTherefore:\n(T + m*c²)² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²\n(p*c)² = (T + m*c²)² - (m*c²)² = T² + 2*T*(m*c²)\n\nSince p₁ = p₂, we have (p₁*c)² = (p₂*c)²:\nT₁² + 2*T₁*(m₁*c²) = T₂² + 2*T₂*(m₂*c²)\n\nWe know T₂ = 3 - T₁. Substituting this and the rest-mass energies:\nT₁² + 2*T₁*(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2*(3 - T₁)*(99)\nT₁² + 396*T₁ = (9 - 6*T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198*T₁)\nT₁² + 396*T₁ = T₁² - 204*T₁ + 603\n396*T₁ = -204*T₁ + 603\n600*T₁ = 603\nT₁ (relativistic) = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV\n\n### 5. Calculate T₁ using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p² / (2m).\nFrom the conservation of momentum, p₁ = p₂. Therefore:\nT₁ = p₁² / (2m₁)\nT₂ = p₂² / (2m₂)\n\nThe ratio of the kinetic energies is:\nT₁ / T₂ = (p₁² / (2m₁)) / (p₂² / (2m₂)) = m₂ / m₁\n\nSince m₁ = 2 * m₂, we have:\nT₁ / T₂ = m₂ / (2*m₂) = 1/2\nT₂ = 2 * T₁\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy Q = T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV:\nT₁ + 2*T₁ = 3 GeV\n3*T₁ = 3 GeV\nT₁ (classical) = 1 GeV\n\n### 6. Calculate the Difference\n\nThe difference between the relativistic and classical values for T₁ is:\nDifference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)\nDifference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n\nFinally, convert the difference to MeV:\nDifference = 0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
