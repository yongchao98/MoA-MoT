    "The interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is described by the Lagrangian:\n\n$\\mathcal{L}\\left(y\\right)=-\\lambda{f}\\bar{\\psi}{f}\\left(y\\right)\\left(\\upsilon+X\\left(y\\right)\\right)\\psi_{f}\\left(y\\right)$\n\nFor the boson X to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair ($f\\bar{f}$), it must be kinematically allowed. This means the mass of the boson X must be greater than the sum of the masses of the decay products. Since a fermion and its corresponding antifermion have identical masses, the condition is:\n\n$m_X > 2 \\cdot m_f$\n\nGiven that the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, a decay is possible if the mass of the fermion ($m_f$) is less than 3 GeV.\n\nLet's examine the masses of the fermions listed in the options:\n\n**Leptons:**\n*   **Electron ($e$):** The mass is approximately 0.511 MeV/c², which is about 0.000511 GeV/c². This is less than 3 GeV.\n*   **Muon ($\\mu$):** The mass is approximately 105.7 MeV/c², or about 0.106 GeV/c². This is less than 3 GeV.\n*   **Tau ($\\tau$):** The mass is approximately 1777 MeV/c², which is about 1.777 GeV/c². This is less than 3 GeV.\n\n**Quarks:**\n*   **Up ($u$):** The mass is approximately 2.2 MeV/c², or about 0.0022 GeV/c². This is less than 3 GeV.\n*   **Down ($d$):** The mass is approximately 4.7 MeV/c², or about 0.0047 GeV/c². This is less than 3 GeV.\n*   **Strange ($s$):** The mass is approximately 95 MeV/c², or about 0.095 GeV/c². This is less than 3 GeV.\n*   **Charm ($c$):** The mass is approximately 1.27 GeV/c². This is less than 3 GeV.\n*   **Bottom ($b$):** The mass is approximately 4.18 GeV/c². This is greater than 3 GeV.\n*   **Top ($t$):** The mass is approximately 172.76 GeV/c². This is significantly greater than 3 GeV.\n\nBased on this, the decays of the boson X that are kinematically allowed are into pairs of up, down, strange, and charm quarks, as well as electron, muon, and tau leptons. The decay into bottom quarks and top quarks is not allowed because their mass is too high.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) Includes the forbidden decay into a bottom-antibottom pair ($b\\bar{b}$).\n*   B) Correctly lists the allowed decays: $c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$.\n*   C) Includes the forbidden decay into a top-antitop pair ($t\\bar{t}$).\n*   D) Includes the forbidden decay into a bottom-antibottom pair ($b\\bar{b}$) and omits the allowed decays into a charm-anticharm pair ($c\\bar{c}$) and a muon-antimuon pair ($\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$).\n\nTherefore, the correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
