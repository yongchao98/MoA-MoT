    "Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism where molecules have the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in the three-dimensional arrangement of their atoms, resulting in non-superimposable mirror images. For a molecule to exhibit optical isomerism, it must be chiral, meaning it lacks an internal plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This compound is a substituted biphenyl. Due to the presence of bulky substituents (nitro groups and dimethyl carboxylate groups) at all four ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'), the rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is severely restricted. This hindered rotation, known as atropisomerism, results in two stable, non-superimposable mirror-image conformations (enantiomers). Therefore, this molecule is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism. A similar compound, 6,6'-dinitro-2,2'-diphenic acid, is a well-known example of a molecule with this type of chirality.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule is the methyl ester of lactic acid. The second carbon atom in the chain is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. As the molecule possesses a single chiral center and lacks any elements of symmetry, it is chiral and exists as a pair of enantiomers, (R)-methyl lactate and (S)-methyl lactate. Thus, it shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The benzophenone molecule consists of a central carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings. While the molecule can adopt a twisted conformation in its crystalline state, leading to chiral crystals, the individual molecule in solution or gas phase is achiral. This is because the phenyl rings can rotate freely, and the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbonyl group, making it superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of inversion, a point of symmetry through which any atom can be reflected to an identical atom on the opposite side. The presence of this symmetry element makes the molecule achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\nBased on the analysis, only dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n<<<C>>>"
