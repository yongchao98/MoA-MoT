    "The total minimum energy of the system is the sum of the potential energy of the 12 charges on the sphere and the potential energy from the interaction between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n\n1.  **Interaction Energy (U_interaction)**: This is the energy between the central charge (`q_center = 2e`) and the 12 charges on the sphere (each `q_sphere = 2e`). The distance for each interaction is the radius `R = 2 m`.\n\n    The potential energy of a pair of charges is given by `U = k * q1 * q2 / r`, where `k` is Coulomb's constant (`8.98755 x 10^9 N·m²/C²`) and `e` is the elementary charge (`1.602176634 x 10^-19 C`).\n\n    *   `U_interaction = 12 * (k * (2e) * (2e) / R)`\n    *   `U_interaction = 12 * (4 * k * e² / 2)`\n    *   `U_interaction = 24 * k * e²`\n    *   `U_interaction = 24 * (8.98755 x 10^9) * (1.602176634 x 10^-19)²`\n    *   `U_interaction ≈ 5.537 x 10^-27 J`\n\n2.  **Sphere Self-Energy (U_sphere)**: To achieve minimum energy, the 12 charges on the sphere will arrange themselves into an icosahedron, which is the solution to the Thomson problem for N=12. The total energy of this configuration is the sum of the potential energies of all unique pairs of charges. There are `12 * 11 / 2 = 66` pairs.\n\n    The vertices of an icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius `R` have specific distances between them. For a unit radius sphere (`R=1`), the distances and number of pairs are well-documented. We can scale these to our radius `R=2 m`.\n    *   From any vertex, there are 5 vertices at a distance `r1`.\n    *   There are 5 other vertices at a distance `r2`.\n    *   There is 1 antipodal vertex at a distance `r3 = 2R`.\n\n    The total energy is the sum over all 66 pairs:\n    *   `U_sphere = (k * (2e)²) * [ (Number of pairs at r1) / r1 + (Number of pairs at r2) / r2 + (Number of pairs at r3) / r3 ]`\n\n    A known result for the dimensionless energy sum for an icosahedron on a unit sphere is approximately 49.165. To get the energy for our system, we use the formula:\n    *   `U_sphere = (k * q_sphere²) / R * (Dimensionless Energy Sum)`\n    *   `U_sphere = (k * (2e)²) / 2 * 49.165`\n    *   `U_sphere = 2 * k * e² * 49.165`\n    *   `U_sphere = 98.33 * k * e²`\n    *   `U_sphere ≈ 98.33 * (8.98755 x 10^9) * (1.602176634 x 10^-19)²`\n    *   `U_sphere ≈ 2.269 x 10^-26 J`\n\n3.  **Total Minimum Energy (U_total)**: The total energy is the sum of the two components.\n\n    *   `U_total = U_interaction + U_sphere`\n    *   `U_total ≈ 5.537 x 10^-27 J + 2.269 x 10^-26 J`\n    *   `U_total ≈ 0.5537 x 10^-26 J + 2.269 x 10^-26 J`\n    *   `U_total ≈ 2.8227 x 10^-26 J`\n\n    Rounding to three decimal places gives `2.823 x 10^-26 J`. This value is closest to option A.\n\nFinal calculation:\n`U_total = (24 * k * e²) + (98.33 * k * e²) = 122.33 * k * e²`\n`U_total = 122.33 * (8.98755 x 10^9 N·m²/C²) * (1.602176634 x 10^-19 C)²`\n`U_total ≈ 2.822 x 10^-26 J`\n\n<<<A>>>"
