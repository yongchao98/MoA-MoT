    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can follow these steps:\n\n**1. Understand the Relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance:**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates back into space. The formula for equilibrium temperature is proportional to the inverse square root of the planet's distance (d) from its star. This can be expressed as:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1/√d\n\nThis relationship holds true when the planets have the same albedo, as stated in the problem.\n\n**2. Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period:**\n\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion describes the relationship between a planet's orbital period (P) and its semi-major axis (a). For a system of planets orbiting the same star, the law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:\n\nP² ∝ a³\n\nSince the planets are in circular orbits, their semi-major axis is equal to their orbital distance (d). Therefore, we can write:\n\nd ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n**3. Use the Given Orbital Period Ratios:**\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods for the five planets as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. We are interested in the ratio of the orbital periods of Planet_4 and Planet_2:\n\nP₄ / P₂ = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures:**\n\nNow, we can combine the relationships from the previous steps to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T₄ / T₂).\n\nFirst, let's express the temperature ratio in terms of the distance ratio:\n\nT₄ / T₂ = (d₄ / d₂)⁻¹/²\n\nNext, substitute the relationship between distance and orbital period:\n\nT₄ / T₂ = ((P₄ / P₂)⅔)⁻¹/²\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nT₄ / T₂ = (P₄ / P₂)⁻¹/³\n\nFinally, plug in the known ratio of the orbital periods:\n\nT₄ / T₂ = (1.75)⁻¹/³\n\nCalculating the value:\n\nT₄ / T₂ = 1 / (1.75)¹/³ ≈ 1 / 1.205 ≈ 0.83\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy analyzing the relationships between equilibrium temperature, orbital distance, and orbital period, we find that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<D>>>"
