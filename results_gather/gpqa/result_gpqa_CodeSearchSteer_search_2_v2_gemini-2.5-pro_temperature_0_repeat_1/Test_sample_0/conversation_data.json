    "To clearly distinguish between two quantum energy levels, the difference in their energies must be greater than the uncertainty in the energy of each level. This is a direct consequence of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nThe relationship between the lifetime of a state (τ) and the uncertainty in its energy (ΔE), often called the natural line width (Γ), is given by the formula:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s). A shorter lifetime leads to a larger uncertainty in the energy.\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy uncertainty for each state:\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nFor the two energy levels to be clearly resolved, the energy difference between them, |E₁ - E₂|, must be larger than the broader of the two energy widths. In this case, the broader width corresponds to the shorter lifetime, so the energy difference must be greater than ΔE₁.\n\n|E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options:\n*   A) 10⁻⁹ eV is less than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   B) 10⁻⁸ eV is less than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV is less than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   D) 10⁻⁴ eV is greater than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option D provides an energy difference large enough to clearly distinguish the two energy levels.\n\n<<<D>>>"
