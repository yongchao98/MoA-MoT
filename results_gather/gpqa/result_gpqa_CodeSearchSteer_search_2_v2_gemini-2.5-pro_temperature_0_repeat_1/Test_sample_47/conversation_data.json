    "The reaction sequence and the final product have been correctly identified. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reactions and the determination of the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine**\nThis reaction is the α-bromination of a ketone. One of the α-hydrogens of cyclohexanone is substituted by a bromine atom to yield 2-bromocyclohexanone (Product 1).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide**\nWhen 2-bromocyclohexanone is heated with a base like sodium hydroxide, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate, which then rearranges to form a ring-contracted product. The six-membered ring of cyclohexanone contracts to a five-membered ring, yielding cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine**\nCyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2) is a carboxylic acid. Its reaction with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. Pyridine is added to neutralize the HCl gas produced during the reaction. The product formed is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3).\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) is a mild reducing agent. It is used to reduce highly reactive acyl chlorides to aldehydes. The reaction stops at the aldehyde stage and does not proceed to form an alcohol. Therefore, cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3) is reduced to cyclopentanecarbaldehyde (Product 4).\n\n**Determining the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in Product 4**\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\nCyclopentanecarbaldehyde has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the C-C bond connecting it to the ring, the C1-H bond, and bisects the C3-C4 bond of the cyclopentane ring.\n\nLet's count the distinct sets of hydrogens:\n1.  **The aldehyde hydrogen (CHO):** This is a unique hydrogen. (1 type)\n2.  **The hydrogen on C1:** This is the hydrogen on the carbon of the ring attached to the aldehyde group. It is also unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The hydrogens on C2 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two hydrogens on C2 (and C5) are not equivalent to each other; they are diastereotopic. One is *cis* to the aldehyde group and the other is *trans*. Therefore, these four hydrogens constitute two distinct types. (2 types)\n4.  **The hydrogens on C3 and C4:** These two carbons are also equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the two hydrogens on C3 (and C4) are diastereotopic. This gives two more distinct types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n\nIn total, the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\n<<<B>>>"
