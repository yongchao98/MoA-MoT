    "The initial reasoning is sound and the calculations for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state energies are correct based on the principles of quantum mechanics for fermions in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\nThe energy levels for a single particle are given by E_n = n^2 * E, where E = π²ħ²/2mL².\nSince the particles are spin-1/2 fermions, the Pauli exclusion principle applies, allowing a maximum of two particles (one spin-up, one spin-down) in each energy level.\n\n*   **Ground State:** The four particles are placed in the lowest possible energy states.\n    *   Two particles occupy the n=1 level, with a total energy of 2 * (1² * E) = 2E.\n    *   Two particles occupy the n=2 level, with a total energy of 2 * (2² * E) = 8E.\n    *   The total ground state energy is 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n*   **First Excited State:** To achieve the first excited state, one particle is promoted from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n    *   Two particles remain in the n=1 level, with an energy of 2 * (1² * E) = 2E.\n    *   One particle remains in the n=2 level, with an energy of 1 * (2² * E) = 4E.\n    *   One particle is in the n=3 level, with an energy of 1 * (3² * E) = 9E.\n    *   The total energy of the first excited state is 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n*   **Second Excited State:** This state is the next lowest energy configuration above the first excited state. We must consider different possibilities for excitation from the ground state.\n    *   **Possibility 1:** Excite one particle from n=2 to n=4. The configuration would be two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. The energy would be 2*(1²*E) + 1*(2²*E) + 1*(4²*E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n    *   **Possibility 2:** Excite one particle from n=1 to n=3. The configuration would be one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. The energy would be 1*(1²*E) + 2*(2²*E) + 1*(3²*E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n    *   **Possibility 3:** Excite both particles from n=2 to n=3. The configuration would be two particles in n=1 and two in n=3. The energy would be 2*(1²*E) + 2*(3²*E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n\n    Comparing the energies of these excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E), the second lowest energy after the ground state is 18E. Therefore, the second excited state energy is 18E.\n\nThe calculated energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
