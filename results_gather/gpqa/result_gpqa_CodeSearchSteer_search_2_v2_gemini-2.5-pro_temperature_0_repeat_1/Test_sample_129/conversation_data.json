    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds so they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to consider two key factors: the rest wavelength of the light being absorbed and the wavelength range that ground-based optical telescopes can observe.\n\nThe absorption of light from background quasars by neutral hydrogen occurs at the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) wavelength, which has a rest wavelength of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å). This wavelength falls in the ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nGround-based optical telescopes are limited by the Earth's atmosphere, which blocks most UV radiation. The \"optical window\" through which these telescopes can observe typically starts at a wavelength of about 3500 Å to 4000 Å. For an object to be detectable, its light must be redshifted enough to fall within this observable range.\n\nThe redshift (z) is calculated using the formula:\nz = (λ_observed - λ_rest) / λ_rest\n\nTo find the *lower limit* of the redshift, we use the shortest possible observed wavelength (λ_observed), which is the lower end of the optical window. Let's use an approximate value of 3600 Å for the atmospheric cutoff.\n\nUsing the formula:\n*   λ_rest = 1216 Å\n*   λ_observed = 3600 Å\n\nz = (3600 Å - 1216 Å) / 1216 Å\nz = 2384 Å / 1216 Å\nz ≈ 1.96\n\nThis calculated redshift of approximately 1.96 is the minimum value required for the Lyman-alpha line to be shifted into the range detectable by ground-based optical telescopes. Comparing this to the given options, 1.9 is the closest estimate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
