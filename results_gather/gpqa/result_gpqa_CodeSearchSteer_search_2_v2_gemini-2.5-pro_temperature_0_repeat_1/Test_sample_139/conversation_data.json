    "The detailed analysis of the chemical clues strongly points to Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄). The search results confirm the chemical properties required to solve the puzzle:\n\n*   **Substance X (LiAlD₄):** This is a powerful reducing agent used in organic chemistry, analogous to Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). It is known to react violently with water.\n*   **Liquid Y (D₂O - Heavy Water):** LiAlH₄ reacts violently with normal water (H₂O). By analogy, LiAlD₄ would react violently with heavy water (D₂O).\n*   **Gas W (D₂ - Dideuterium):** The reaction between LiAlD₄ and D₂O would be: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. The resulting gas, D₂, consists of two deuterium atoms, each with one proton and one neutron, meaning the molecule has a total of two protons and two neutrons, fitting the description.\n*   **Precipitate G (Al(OD)₃ - Aluminum Deuteroxide):** The reaction produces aluminum deuteroxide, which is analogous to aluminum hydroxide, a known precipitate.\n*   **Substance B (D₂O - Heavy Water):** Heating aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)₃) causes it to decompose and release water. Therefore, heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) would release B (D₂O).\n*   **Melting Point of B:** The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C, which is 276.97 K. This is very close to the stated 277 K.\n*   **Reaction with a Keto Acid:** LiAlH₄ is a strong reducing agent capable of reducing both the ketone and carboxylic acid functional groups of a keto acid into alcohols (a diol). The resulting diol product contains two oxygen atoms, matching the clue.\n\nWith Substance X identified as LiAlD₄, the final calculation can be performed.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄), summing the masses of all atoms of those elements.\n\n1.  **Identify the elements in LiAlD₄:** The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (of which Deuterium, D, is an isotope).\n2.  **Determine atomic masses (using integer approximations):**\n    *   Deuterium (D): ~2 amu\n    *   Lithium (Li): ~7 amu\n    *   Aluminum (Al): ~27 amu\n3.  **Identify the lightest and heaviest elements:**\n    *   Lightest element: Hydrogen\n    *   Heaviest element: Aluminum\n4.  **Calculate the cumulative mass for each of these elements in the molecule:**\n    *   **Lightest (Hydrogen):** There are four atoms of its isotope, Deuterium (D).\n        Cumulative Mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Heaviest (Aluminum):** There is one atom of Aluminum (Al).\n        Cumulative Mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n5.  **Sum the cumulative masses:**\n    *   Total Cumulative Mass = 8 (from Deuterium) + 27 (from Aluminum) = 35.\n\n<<<A>>>"
