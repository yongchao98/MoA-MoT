    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the two stars.\n\n1.  **Recall the Boltzmann Equation:** For a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited energy state (`N_excited`) to the number of atoms in the ground state (`N_ground`) is given by the Boltzmann equation:\n\n    `N_excited / N_ground = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n\n    where:\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n    *   `g_excited` and `g_ground` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the respective energy levels. The ratio `(g_excited / g_ground)` is a constant for the specific transition.\n\n2.  **Set up the equations for both stars:**\n    Let T₁ be the temperature of star_1 and T₂ be the temperature of star_2. We can write the excitation ratio for each star:\n\n    *   For star_1: `(N_excited / N_ground)₁ = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))`\n    *   For star_2: `(N_excited / N_ground)₂ = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))`\n\n    Here, `C` represents the constant ratio of degeneracies `(g_excited / g_ground)`.\n\n3.  **Use the information from the problem:** The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. This means:\n\n    `(N_excited / N_ground)₁ = 2 * (N_excited / N_ground)₂`\n\n4.  **Substitute and simplify:** Now, substitute the expressions from step 2 into the equation from step 3:\n\n    `C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * [C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]`\n\n    The constant `C` cancels out from both sides:\n\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))`\n\n5.  **Solve for the relationship between T₁ and T₂:** To solve for the temperatures, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:\n\n    `ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]`\n\n    Using the logarithm properties `ln(e^x) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n\n    `-ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) + ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]`\n    `-ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T₂)`\n\n6.  **Isolate ln(2):** Rearrange the equation to match the format of the given options:\n\n    `ΔE / (k * T₂) - ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2)`\n\n    Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n\n    `(ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) = ln(2)`\n\n    Combine the fractions inside the parenthesis:\n\n    `(ΔE / k) * [(T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂)] = ln(2)`\n\n7.  **Incorporate the given physical constants:** The problem provides the energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`. The Boltzmann constant `k` is `k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K`.\n\n    Therefore, the ratio `ΔE / k` is:\n\n    `ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 1 K`\n\n    The problem is designed so that this pre-factor becomes unity.\n\n8.  **Final Equation:** Substituting `ΔE / k = 1` into the equation from step 6 gives the final result:\n\n    `ln(2) = [(T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂)]`\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
