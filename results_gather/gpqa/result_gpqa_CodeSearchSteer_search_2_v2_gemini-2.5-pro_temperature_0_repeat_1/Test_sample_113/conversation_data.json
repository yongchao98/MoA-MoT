    "Here is the step-by-step analysis of the reagents for the given reactions:\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone. The mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate. In the next step, this intermediate is protonated to yield the final product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which is a cyanohydrin.\n\nThe reagent 'A' must be a source of protons (H⁺). While the reaction can be slow with just HCN, it is often performed by mixing a cyanide salt like NaCN with an acid. The acid serves to generate HCN in situ and, crucially, to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. A general strong acid source, denoted as H₃O⁺, is the most appropriate choice for this step. NaHSO₃ is typically used in forming bisulfite addition products and is not the standard reagent for this specific synthesis. Therefore, reagent **A is H₃O⁺**.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis reaction shows the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). Specifically, a cyanohydrin is converted into an α-hydroxy carboxylic acid. This transformation can be achieved by heating the nitrile with water under either acidic or basic conditions.\n\nThe options for reagent 'B' are HCl (a strong acid) and CH₃COOH (a weak acid). The hydrolysis of nitriles is typically carried out by heating under reflux with a strong mineral acid like dilute hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric acid. A strong acid is effective in protonating the nitrile nitrogen, making the carbon atom more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water, thus facilitating the hydrolysis. While a weak acid like acetic acid could potentially work, it would be significantly less effective and require more severe conditions than a strong acid like HCl. Therefore, reagent **B is HCl**.\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Reagent A should be **H₃O⁺**.\n*   Reagent B should be **HCl**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
