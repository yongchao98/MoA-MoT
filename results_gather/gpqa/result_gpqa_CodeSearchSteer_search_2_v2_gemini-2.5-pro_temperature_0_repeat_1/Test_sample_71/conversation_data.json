    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, and sodium iodide (NaI).\n*   **Diene Generation:** The reaction of a 1,2-bis(dihalomethyl) compound with sodium iodide is a method for generating an o-xylylene or a related conjugated diene system. In this case, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene reacts with NaI to eliminate bromine atoms and form two new double bonds. The product is **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**. This is a reactive diene.\n*   **Diels-Alder Reaction:** The generated diene (5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene) then reacts with the dienophile, 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. The norbornadiene has two double bonds, and since two equivalents of the diene precursor are used, a double Diels-Alder reaction occurs. The diene acts as a protecting group for the double bonds of the norbornadiene. The resulting molecule is Product **1**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Transformation:** Strong aqueous acid cleaves tert-butyl ethers. The 7-(tert-butoxy) group on the bicyclic core is hydrolyzed to a 7-hydroxy group. The rest of the complex structure remains intact. Product **2** is the alcohol corresponding to Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO.\n*   **Transformation:** This set of reagents is used for the Parikh-Doering oxidation, which converts primary and secondary alcohols to aldehydes and ketones, respectively. The secondary alcohol at the 7-position of the bicyclic core is oxidized to a ketone. Product **3** is the corresponding ketone.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is heated to 150°C.\n*   **Transformation:** Heating a Diels-Alder adduct often leads to a retro-Diels-Alder reaction, which is the reverse of the initial cycloaddition. This reaction is entropically favored at higher temperatures. In this step, the protecting diene is removed.\n*   The thermolysis of Product **3** regenerates two molecules of the diene used in Step 1 and the dienophile core, which is now bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one.\n*   The question asks for the structure of product **4**. This could be either the regenerated diene or the dienophile.\n    *   If **4** were bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one, it would have a high degree of symmetry (C₂ᵥ), resulting in only two sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms: the two equivalent bridgehead protons and the four equivalent vinylic protons. This is not among the options.\n    *   Therefore, it is logical to conclude that product **4** is the other product of the retro-Diels-Alder reaction: **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**.\n\n**Analysis of Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4**\n\n*   **Structure of Product 4:** The final product is 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene. It consists of a six-membered ring with conjugated double bonds at C1-C2 and C3-C4, and exocyclic double bonds at C5 and C6.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry that passes through the midpoints of the C2=C3 and C5-C6 bonds. This symmetry element makes certain pairs of hydrogen atoms chemically equivalent.\n*   **Hydrogen Atoms:**\n    1.  There is one hydrogen on C1 and one on C4. Due to the C₂ symmetry, H1 is equivalent to H4. This is the **first** set of distinct hydrogens.\n    2.  There is one hydrogen on C2 and one on C3. The C₂ axis also makes H2 equivalent to H3. This is the **second** set.\n    3.  There are two exocyclic methylene (=CH₂) groups. The two protons on a single methylene group are not equivalent; they are diastereotopic. Let's call the protons on one group Hₐ and Hₑ, and on the other H'ₐ and H'ₑ.\n    4.  The C₂ rotation interchanges the two methylene groups. This means Hₐ is equivalent to H'ₐ, and Hₑ is equivalent to H'ₑ. This gives us two more sets of distinct hydrogens. The **third** set is (Hₐ, H'ₐ) and the **fourth** set is (Hₑ, H'ₑ).\n\nIn total, there are four sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.\n\nTherefore, the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4 is 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
