    "Here is a step-by-step determination of the final product and the number of signals in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\nAcetic acid is treated with bromine (Br₂) and a catalyst (here, pyridine and acetic anhydride). This is a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction, which causes the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group) to be halogenated.\n*   **Reactant:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH)\n*   **Reaction:** α-bromination\n*   **Product 1:** α-Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)\n\n### **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\nProduct 1 (α-bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) in the presence of an acid catalyst (H₂SO₄). This is a Fischer esterification reaction, where the carboxylic acid is converted into an ester.\n*   **Reactant:** α-Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH) and ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH)\n*   **Reaction:** Fischer Esterification\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n### **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\nProduct 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   **Reactant:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃) and sodium cyanide (NaCN)\n*   **Reaction:** Nucleophilic Substitution (Sₙ2)\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n### **Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\nProduct 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane.\n1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride is a strong base that removes an acidic α-proton from ethyl cyanoacetate. The protons on the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups are particularly acidic.\n    `NCCH₂COOEt + NaH → [NCCHCOOEt]⁻ Na⁺`\n2.  **First Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    `[NCCHCOOEt]⁻ + Br(CH₂)₅Br → NCCH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅Br`\n3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since excess NaH is used, the remaining acidic α-proton is also removed.\n    `NCCH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅Br + NaH → [NCC(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅Br]⁻ Na⁺`\n4.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The carbanion attacks the other end of the carbon chain, displacing the second bromine atom. This intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction forms a six-membered ring because the chain consists of the α-carbon and the five carbons of the pentyl group.\n*   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate\n\n### **¹H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals. This can depend on whether the molecule's conformations are rapidly interconverting (\"fast exchange\") or are static (\"slow exchange\") on the NMR timescale.\n\n*   **Structure 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\nLet's analyze the structure assuming a \"slow exchange\" or \"locked\" conformation, which is often implied in such problems when the alternative (fast exchange) does not yield one of the given options. In a single chair conformation, the molecule lacks any plane of symmetry.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene (-OCH₂-) group are also equivalent. They will produce **1 signal**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   In a fixed chair conformation, the ring has five methylene (-CH₂-) groups. For each methylene group, the axial (ax) and equatorial (eq) protons are in different chemical environments (they are diastereotopic).\n    *   Since the molecule as a whole is asymmetric in this conformation, none of the five methylene groups are equivalent to any other.\n    *   Therefore, each of the 10 protons on the cyclohexane ring (5 axial, 5 equatorial) is chemically distinct. This gives **10 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nAdding the signals from the ethyl group and the ring:\nTotal Signals = 2 (from ethyl group) + 10 (from ring) = 12 signals.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
