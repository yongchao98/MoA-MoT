    "To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the given compound, we can use the provided bond energies and enthalpies of atomization. The calculation involves determining the energy required to break the compound into its constituent atoms and the energy required to form those atoms from their elements in their standard states.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nThe compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** By counting the atoms, we find there are 12 carbon atoms and 22 hydrogen atoms. The formula is C12H22.\n*   **Molar Mass:** The approximate molar mass is (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 166 g/mol.\n*   **Bond Analysis:** We need to count the number of each type of bond in the molecule:\n    *   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 C-H bonds.\n    *   **C-C single bonds:** There are 9 C-C single bonds.\n    *   **C=C double bonds:** There are 2 C=C double bonds.\n\n**2. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization of the compound is the energy required to break all of its bonds. This is calculated by summing the bond energies of all the bonds in one mole of the substance.\n\n*   Energy from C-H bonds = 22 mol × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   Energy from C-C bonds = 9 mol × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from C=C bonds = 2 mol × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n\nTotal Enthalpy of Atomization (Compound) = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements**\n\nThis is the energy required to convert the elements from their standard states (C as solid graphite, H as H2 gas) into gaseous atoms. The formation reaction is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g).\n\n*   Energy to atomize Carbon = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Energy to atomize Hydrogen = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol (for H-H bond) = 1100 kJ\n\nTotal Enthalpy of Atomization (Elements) = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ**\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the elements and the energy released when the compound's bonds are formed (which is the negative of the compound's enthalpy of atomization). The formula is:\n\nΔH_f = (Enthalpy of atomization of elements) - (Enthalpy of atomization of compound)\n\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**5. Convert to kJ/g**\n\nThe options provided are in different units. Let's convert our result from kJ/mol to kJ/g using the molar mass (166 g/mol).\n\n*   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**\n\nThis value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
