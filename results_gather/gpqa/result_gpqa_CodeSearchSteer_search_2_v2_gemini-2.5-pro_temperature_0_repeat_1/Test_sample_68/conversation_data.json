    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance the particle X⁰ travels in the bubble chamber before it decays. This requires using principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n### 1. Understand the Given Information\n*   **Proper lifetime (τ₀):** The lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame is 8 x 10⁻¹⁶ s.\n*   **Rest mass (m₀):** The mass of the particle at rest is 3.41 GeV/c².\n*   **Total energy (E):** The energy of the particle in the laboratory (bubble chamber) frame is 27 GeV.\n*   **Decay observation:** We need to find the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)\nThe Lorentz factor, γ, relates the total energy of a particle to its rest mass energy (E = γm₀c²). Since the energy and mass are given in units of GeV and GeV/c², we can simplify the relation to E = γm₀.\n\nγ = E / m₀ = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.918\n\n### 3. Calculate the Particle's Velocity (v)\nThe Lorentz factor is also defined as γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²), where v is the particle's velocity and c is the speed of light. We can rearrange this to solve for v.\n\nv/c = √(1 - 1/γ²) = √(1 - 1/7.918²) ≈ √(1 - 0.0159) ≈ √0.9841 ≈ 0.992\nSo, the particle is traveling at approximately 99.2% of the speed of light.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Lifetime in the Lab Frame (τ)\nDue to time dilation, the particle's lifetime as observed in the bubble chamber is longer than its proper lifetime. The lifetime in the lab frame (τ) is given by:\n\nτ = γ * τ₀ = 7.918 * (8 x 10⁻¹⁶ s) ≈ 6.334 x 10⁻¹⁵ s\n\n### 5. Calculate the Mean Decay Length (L)\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It is calculated as the product of its velocity and its lifetime in the lab frame.\n\nL = v * τ ≈ (0.992 * 3 x 10⁸ m/s) * (6.334 x 10⁻¹⁵ s) ≈ 1.885 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\n### 6. Interpret the \"Resolution\" and \"30% Observation\"\nThe question asks for the \"minimum resolution\" needed to observe \"at least 30% of the decays.\" This can be interpreted in a few ways. A common interpretation in such problems is to calculate the mean decay length, as this represents the characteristic distance a particle travels. If a detector's resolution is on this order of magnitude, it can effectively measure the tracks of a significant fraction of decaying particles.\n\nLet's analyze the options based on our calculated mean decay length:\n*   L ≈ 1.89 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\nThe available options are:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n\nOur calculated mean decay length (1.89 x 10⁻⁶ m) is very close to option D (2.08 x 10⁻⁶ m). The small discrepancy might arise from slightly different interpretations or rounding in the problem's given values. For instance, if the given energy of 27 GeV were kinetic energy instead of total energy, the total energy would be 27 GeV + 3.41 GeV = 30.41 GeV. This would result in a mean decay length of approximately 2.13 x 10⁻⁶ m, which is even closer to option D. Given the choices, the mean decay length is the most plausible physical quantity being asked for.\n\nTherefore, the minimum resolution required is on the order of the particle's mean decay length.\n\n<<<D>>>"
