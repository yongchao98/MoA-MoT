    "To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to an observer in the laboratory, we must use the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the reference frames:**\n    *   The laboratory is the stationary reference frame (S).\n    *   The moving glass is the moving reference frame (S').\n\n2.  **Define the velocities:**\n    *   The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S) is `v`.\n    *   The speed of light within the glass, as measured in the rest frame of the glass (S'), is `u'`. The index of refraction `n` is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`). Given that the speed of light in a vacuum `c` is set to 1, we have:\n        `n = c / u' = 1 / u'`\n        Therefore, the speed of light in the glass, from the perspective of the glass itself, is `u' = 1/n`.\n\n3.  **Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula:**\n    The formula for adding velocities that are in the same direction is:\n    `u = (v + u') / (1 + v*u'/c^2)`\n    Where:\n    *   `u` is the speed of light in the glass as measured by the observer in the laboratory.\n    *   `v` is the velocity of the glass.\n    *   `u'` is the speed of light within the glass.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n4.  **Substitute the known values into the formula:**\n    We substitute `u' = 1/n` and `c = 1` into the equation:\n    `u = (v + 1/n) / (1 + v*(1/n)/1^2)`\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    `u = (v + 1/n) / (1 + v/n)`\n    To eliminate the fractions in the numerator and the denominator, we can multiply both by `n`:\n    `u = n * (v + 1/n) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (n*v + 1) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
