    "To find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle, we first need to express the given potential in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n\nThe transformation from polar to Cartesian coordinates is given by:\nx = r cos(θ)\ny = r sin(θ)\nFrom which we can derive:\nr^2 = x^2 + y^2\nx^2 = r^2 cos^2(θ)\n\nSubstituting these into the potential energy expression:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k(x^2)\nV(x, y) = 1/2 kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2 + 3/2 kx^2\nV(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2)kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\nV(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\nThis potential is recognizable as the potential for a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The potential is separable into two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators, one in the x-direction and one in the y-direction.\n\nV(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\n\nWhere:\nV_x(x) = 2kx^2 = 1/2 (4k)x^2\nV_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2\n\nThe energy of a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential of the form V(z) = 1/2 k_z z^2 is given by E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, where the angular frequency ω = sqrt(k_z/m).\n\nFor the x-direction, the effective spring constant is k_x = 4k. The corresponding angular frequency is:\nω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\nFor the y-direction, the spring constant is k_y = k. The corresponding angular frequency is:\nω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe total energy of the two-dimensional system is the sum of the energies of the independent one-dimensional oscillators.\nE = E_x + E_y\nE = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x + (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y\n\nSubstituting the expressions for ω_x and ω_y:\nE = (n_x + 1/2)ħ(2 * sqrt(k/m)) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ(sqrt(k/m))\nE = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
