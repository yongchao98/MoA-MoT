    "To determine the time it will take for the astronaut to reach Earth from their perspective, we must use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n### 1. Determine the Constants and Known Values:\n*   **Velocity of the spacecraft (v):** 0.99999987 * c\n*   **Speed of light (c):** Approximately 299,792,458 m/s\n*   **Distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (d):** The Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. Its distance from Earth is estimated to be between 160,000 and 163,000 light-years. For this calculation, we will use the value of approximately 160,000 light-years, as it aligns best with the provided options.\n*   **Astronaut's age:** 22 years\n*   **Astronaut's average lifespan:** 150 years\n\n### 2. Calculate the Time of Travel in Earth's Reference Frame:\nFirst, we calculate how long the journey would appear to take for an observer on Earth. Since the spacecraft is traveling at a speed extremely close to the speed of light, the time taken in Earth's frame (Δt) is approximately the distance in light-years.\n*   **Time (Earth frame) Δt** ≈ Distance / speed of light\n*   **Δt** ≈ 160,000 light-years / c ≈ 160,000 years\n\n### 3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):\nThe Lorentz factor is a crucial component of the time dilation formula and depends on the spacecraft's velocity.\n*   **Formula:** γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n*   Given v = 0.99999987c, the ratio v/c is 0.99999987.\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.99999987²)\n*   γ ≈ 1 / √(0.00000026)\n*   **γ ≈ 1961.15**\n\n### 4. Calculate the Time Experienced by the Astronaut:\nNow, we can calculate the proper time (Δt₀), which is the time that passes for the astronaut on the moving spacecraft.\n*   **Formula:** Δt₀ = Δt / γ\n*   Δt₀ = 160,000 years / 1961.15\n*   **Δt₀ ≈ 81.58 years**\n\n### 5. Conclusion:\nThe time elapsed from the astronaut's point of view is approximately 81.58 years. This value is closest to option B.\n\nTo ensure the astronaut survives, we can check their age upon arrival:\n*   Age at arrival = 22 years + 81.58 years = 103.58 years.\nSince 103.58 years is less than the average lifespan of 150 years, the astronaut will survive the journey, ruling out option A.\n\nTherefore, the journey will take approximately 81 years from the astronaut's perspective.\n\n<<<B>>>"
