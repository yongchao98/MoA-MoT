    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we must first identify the limiting apparent magnitude for each instrument and then calculate the apparent magnitude for each star.\n\n### Instrument Capabilities\n\n*   **ESPRESSO (Paranal Observatory):** Can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude brighter than 17 (V < 17).\n*   **HIRES (Keck Observatory):** Can observe stars brighter than a V magnitude of 16 (V < 16).\n\nFor a star to be observable by both instruments, it must meet the more stringent requirement, which is an apparent V magnitude brighter than 16.\n\n### Star Analysis\n\nThe apparent magnitude (m_V) of a star is calculated based on its absolute magnitude (M_V), its distance (d) in parsecs, and any extinction (A_V) caused by interstellar dust. The formula is: m_V = M_V + 5*log₁₀(d) - 5 + A_V. The term `5*log₁₀(d) - 5` is known as the distance modulus. Extinction (A_V) is related to the color excess E(B-V) by the formula A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V).\n\nThe problem specifies that the pointing limits of the telescopes should be disregarded, so the analysis will focus solely on whether each star is bright enough to be detected.\n\n*   **Star1:**\n    *   Absolute V magnitude (M_V) = 15.5 mag\n    *   Distance (d) = 10 pc\n    *   Apparent V magnitude (m_V) = 15.5 + 5*log₁₀(10) - 5 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 = **15.5 mag**.\n    *   Since 15.5 is brighter than 16, this star is observable by both instruments.\n\n*   **Star2:**\n    *   Apparent V magnitude (m_V) = **16.5 mag**.\n    *   Since 16.5 is not brighter than 16, this star cannot be observed by HIRES.\n\n*   **Star3:**\n    *   Apparent V magnitude (m_V) = **15.5 mag**.\n    *   The additional information about color excess and distance is not needed as the final apparent magnitude is given.\n    *   Since 15.5 is brighter than 16, this star is observable by both instruments.\n\n*   **Star4:**\n    *   Absolute V magnitude (M_V) = 15.5 mag\n    *   Distance (d) = 10 pc\n    *   Color Excess E(B-V) = 0.4 mag\n    *   Extinction (A_V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n    *   Apparent V magnitude (m_V) = 15.5 + 5*log₁₀(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 + 1.24 = **16.74 mag**.\n    *   Since 16.74 is not brighter than 16, this star cannot be observed by HIRES.\n\n*   **Star5:**\n    *   Absolute V magnitude (M_V) = 16.5 mag\n    *   Distance (d) = 5 pc\n    *   Apparent V magnitude (m_V) = 16.5 + 5*log₁₀(5) - 5 ≈ 16.5 + 5*(0.699) - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = **14.995 mag**.\n    *   Since 14.995 is brighter than 16, this star is observable by both instruments.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe stars that meet the brightness requirement (V < 16) for both observatories are Star1, Star3, and Star5. Reviewing the options provided, the only pair that consists exclusively of these observable stars is Star3 and Star5.\n\n<<<D>>>"
