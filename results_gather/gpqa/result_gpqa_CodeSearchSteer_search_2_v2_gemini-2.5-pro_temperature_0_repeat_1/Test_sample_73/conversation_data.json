    "This problem deals with the probability of radioactive decay, which follows an exponential distribution. A key characteristic of this type of decay is that it is a \"memoryless\" process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not change its future decay probability. We are asked to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, which, due to the memoryless property, is equivalent to calculating the probability of a new atom decaying within 150 minutes.\n\nFirst, we must determine the decay constant (λ) from the information provided. The probability of decay, P(t), within a certain time, t, is given by the formula:\n\nP(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or 0.32. We can set up the equation as follows:\n\n0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)\n\nBy rearranging the equation to solve for the exponential term, we get:\n\ne^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\nTo solve for λ, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\n-100λ = ln(0.68)\nλ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\nNow that we have the decay constant, we can calculate the probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes. As established by the memoryless property, this is the same as P(150):\n\nP(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nSubstitute the expression for λ we found earlier:\n\nP(150) = 1 - e^([-ln(0.68) / 100] * 150)\nP(150) = 1 - e^(1.5 * ln(0.68))\n\nUsing the logarithmic property that `a * ln(b) = ln(b^a)`, we can simplify the exponent:\n\nP(150) = 1 - e^(ln(0.68^1.5))\n\nSince the exponential function and the natural logarithm are inverse functions, they cancel each other out:\n\nP(150) = 1 - 0.68^1.5\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n\n0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607\n\nFinally, we find the probability:\n\nP(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393\n\nConverting this to a percentage gives approximately 43.93%, which rounds to 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>"
