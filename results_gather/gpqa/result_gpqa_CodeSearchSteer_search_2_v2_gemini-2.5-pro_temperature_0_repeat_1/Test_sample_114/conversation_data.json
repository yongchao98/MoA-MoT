    "The collision of an electron and a positron results in their mutual annihilation and the creation of two gamma-ray photons. To solve this problem, we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy**\n\n*   The total energy before the collision is the sum of the energies of the electron and the positron. The energy of a relativistic particle is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light.\n*   Initial Energy (E_initial) = (γ_electron + γ_positron) * m_e * c²\n*   Given γ_electron = 4 and γ_positron = 2,\n*   E_initial = (4 + 2) * m_e * c² = 6 * m_e * c²\n*   After the collision, two photons are produced with equal energy (E_photon).\n*   Final Energy (E_final) = 2 * E_photon\n*   By conservation of energy, E_initial = E_final, so 6 * m_e * c² = 2 * E_photon.\n*   Therefore, the energy of each photon is E_photon = 3 * m_e * c².\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum**\n\n*   The total momentum before the collision must equal the total momentum after the collision. The momentum of a relativistic particle is p = √(γ² - 1) * mc.\n*   The electron moves from the left (positive direction) and the positron from the right (negative direction).\n*   Initial Momentum (p_initial) = p_electron - p_positron\n*   p_initial = (√(4² - 1) - √(2² - 1)) * m_e * c\n*   p_initial = (√15 - √3) * m_e * c\n*   The momentum of a photon is p = E/c. For each photon produced, the momentum is p_photon = (3 * m_e * c²) / c = 3 * m_e * c.\n*   The photons move away at angles θ and -θ with respect to the horizontal axis. The total momentum in the horizontal direction is the sum of the horizontal components of each photon's momentum.\n*   Final Momentum (p_final) = p_photon * cos(θ) + p_photon * cos(-θ) = 2 * p_photon * cos(θ)\n*   p_final = 2 * (3 * m_e * c) * cos(θ) = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ)\n\n**3. Calculating the Angle**\n\n*   By equating the initial and final momentum:\n*   (√15 - √3) * m_e * c = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ)\n*   cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\n*   Using the approximate values √15 ≈ 3.873 and √3 ≈ 1.732:\n*   cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n*   θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°\n*   The question asks for the angle *between* the directions of the two photons, which is 2θ.\n*   Angle = 2 * 69.1° ≈ 138.2°\n\nThis value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
