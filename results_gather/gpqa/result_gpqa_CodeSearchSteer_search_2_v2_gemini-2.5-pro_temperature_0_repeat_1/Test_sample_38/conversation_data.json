    "To find the numerical value of \"a\", we must use the normalization condition of the wave function. This principle states that the total probability of finding the particle in all possible locations must be equal to 1. The probability of finding the particle in a specific region is given by the integral of the square of the modulus of the wave function over that region.\n\nThe given wave function is:\nΨ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nThe probability density, |Ψ(x)|², is calculated by multiplying the wave function by its complex conjugate. The complex conjugate, Ψ*(x), is found by changing the sign of the imaginary part:\nΨ*(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i\n\nNow, we calculate the probability density:\n|Ψ(x)|² = Ψ*(x) * Ψ(x)\n|Ψ(x)|² = [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i ] * [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i ]\n|Ψ(x)|² = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) )² - (0.5*i)²\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) - 0.25 * i²\nSince i² = -1:\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\nThe problem states that the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, the integral of the probability density from 1 to 3 must be equal to 1.\n\n∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nWe solve the integral:\n∫ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = a² * ∫ (1 / (1 + x)) dx + ∫ 0.25 dx\n= a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25 * x\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral from 1 to 3:\n[ a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25 * x ] from 1 to 3\n= (a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3) - (a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1)\n= (a² * ln(4) + 0.75) - (a² * ln(2) + 0.25)\n\nSet this expression equal to 1:\na² * ln(4) - a² * ln(2) + 0.75 - 0.25 = 1\na² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5 = 1\nUsing the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\na² * ln(4/2) = 0.5\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the value ln(2) ≈ 0.693:\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693\na² ≈ 0.7215\na ≈ sqrt(0.7215)\na ≈ 0.849\n\nThis value is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<C>>>"
