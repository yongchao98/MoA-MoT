    "To determine the total energy of the Lithium nucleus, we must follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the nucleus and determine its rest mass.**\n    The problem specifies the nucleus X as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Lithium has an atomic number (Z) of 3, meaning it contains 3 protons. With 3 neutrons, the mass number (A) is 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6. The nucleus is therefore Lithium-6 (⁶Li).\n\n2.  **Calculate the rest mass of the nucleus.**\n    The atomic mass of a Lithium-6 atom is approximately 6.015122 atomic mass units (amu). This mass includes the atom's 3 electrons. To find the nuclear mass, we must subtract the mass of these electrons.\n    *   Mass of a single electron: ~0.000549 amu.\n    *   Mass of 3 electrons: 3 * 0.000549 amu = 0.001647 amu.\n    *   Rest mass of the ⁶Li nucleus (m₀): 6.015122 amu - 0.001647 amu = 6.013475 amu.\n\n3.  **Convert the rest mass to energy.**\n    The energy equivalent of one atomic mass unit (amu) is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². We can use this to find the rest energy (E₀).\n    *   Rest Energy (E₀) = 6.013475 amu * 931.5 MeV/c²/amu\n    *   E₀ ≈ 5601.55 MeV\n    *   E₀ ≈ 5.60155 GeV\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    The nucleus travels at a speed (v) of 0.96c. The Lorentz factor is calculated with the formula:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96c)²/c²)\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\n    *   γ = 1 / √0.0784\n    *   γ = 1 / 0.28\n    *   γ ≈ 3.5714\n\n5.  **Calculate the total relativistic energy (E).**\n    The total energy is the product of the Lorentz factor and the rest energy (E = γE₀).\n    *   E ≈ 3.5714 * 5.60155 GeV\n    *   E ≈ 20.0055 GeV\n\nComparing this calculated value to the given options:\n*   A) 20.132 GeV\n*   B) 21.419 GeV\n*   C) 23.069 GeV\n*   D) 18.475 GeV\n\nThe calculated energy of approximately 20.006 GeV is closest to option A, 20.132 GeV. The small discrepancy may be due to the use of slightly different physical constants in the source of the problem.\n\n<<<A>>>"
