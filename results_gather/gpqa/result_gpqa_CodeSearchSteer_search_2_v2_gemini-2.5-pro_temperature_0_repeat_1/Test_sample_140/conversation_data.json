    "The reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed ammonia is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction pathways:\n\n**Step 1: Elimination to form Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe strong base, the amide anion (NH₂⁻) from NaNH₂, abstracts an acidic proton from the position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two different ortho atoms that can be removed: a hydrogen at position 6 and a deuterium at position 2. This leads to two competing elimination pathways:\n\n1.  **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the hydrogen (H) from position 6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from position 1 creates a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between carbons 1 and 6. The deuterium at position 2 remains untouched. This intermediate is called **3-deutero-benzyne**.\n2.  **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuterium (D) from position 2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from position 1 creates a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between carbons 1 and 2. In this process, the deuterium is removed from the molecule, resulting in a non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\nDue to the kinetic isotope effect, breaking a C-H bond is faster than breaking a C-D bond, so Pathway A is favored. However, both reactions occur, leading to the formation of two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n**Step 2: Addition of the Nucleophile**\n\nThe amide anion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the triple bond in each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deutero-benzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    *   Attack at carbon 1: This places the amino group (-NH₂) at position 1 and, after protonation, yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   Attack at carbon 6: This places the amino group at position 6. When the ring is renumbered to give the amino group the lowest number (position 1), the deuterium is now at position 3. This yields **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    *   Attack at either carbon 1 or 2 of the non-deuterated benzyne intermediate, followed by protonation, results in a single product: **aniline**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the outcomes of both pathways, three distinct organic products are possible:\n1.  2-deuteroaniline\n2.  3-deuteroaniline\n3.  Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
