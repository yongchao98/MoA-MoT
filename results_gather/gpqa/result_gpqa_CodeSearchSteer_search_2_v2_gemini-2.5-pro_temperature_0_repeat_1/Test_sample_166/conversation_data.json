    "Here is a step-by-step calculation of the non-Gaussianity (nG) for the given Schrödinger cat state.\n\n### 1. Define the State and Non-Gaussianity Measure\n\nThe Schrödinger cat state is given by:\n|ψ⟩ = (cos(φ)|α⟩ + sin(φ)|-α⟩) / N\nwhere N is the normalization constant, N = sqrt(1 + sin(2φ)exp(-2α²)).\n\nThe measure of non-Gaussianity (nG) is the relative entropy between the state's density matrix, ρ, and a reference Gaussian state, τ, that has the same first and second moments. The formula is:\nnG = S(τ) - S(ρ)\nwhere S is the von Neumann entropy, S(σ) = -Tr(σ ln σ).\n\n### 2. Simplify for the Given Parameters\n\nWe are given φ = -π/4 and α = 0.5.\n\nFirst, let's determine the specific state.\n*   cos(-π/4) = 1/√2\n*   sin(-π/4) = -1/√2\n*   sin(2 * -π/4) = sin(-π/2) = -1\n\nThe state |ψ⟩ becomes:\n|ψ⟩ = ( (1/√2)|α⟩ - (1/√2)|-α⟩ ) / sqrt(1 - exp(-2α²))\n|ψ⟩ = ( |α⟩ - |-α⟩ ) / sqrt(2 * (1 - exp(-2α²)))\n\nThis is a pure quantum state known as the \"odd cat state\".\n\n### 3. Calculate the Entropy of the State (S(ρ))\n\nThe density matrix is ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. Since |ψ⟩ is a pure state, its von Neumann entropy is zero.\nS(ρ) = 0\n\nTherefore, the non-Gaussianity simplifies to the entropy of the reference Gaussian state:\nnG = S(τ)\n\n### 4. Determine the Reference Gaussian State (τ)\n\nTo find S(τ), we first need to find the properties of τ. The reference Gaussian state τ is defined as the Gaussian state that has the same first and second statistical moments as ρ.\n\n*   **First Moment (Displacement):** ⟨a⟩ = Tr(ρa)\n    For the odd cat state, the average amplitude ⟨a⟩ is 0. This means the reference state is centered at the origin of the phase space.\n\n*   **Second Moments:** We need to calculate ⟨a²⟩ and the average photon number ⟨n⟩ = ⟨a†a⟩.\n    *   For the odd cat state, it can be shown that ⟨a²⟩ = α².\n    *   The average photon number is ⟨n⟩ = α² * coth(α²).\n\n### 5. Calculate the Symplectic Eigenvalue (v) of τ\n\nThe entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state is determined by its symplectic eigenvalue, `v`. The eigenvalue `v` can be calculated from the second moments:\nv = sqrt( (⟨n⟩ + 1/2)² - |⟨a²⟩|² )\n\nNow, we plug in the values for α = 0.5:\n*   α² = 0.25\n*   ⟨a²⟩ = 0.25\n*   ⟨n⟩ = 0.25 * coth(0.25) ≈ 0.25 * 4.083 = 1.02075\n*   v = sqrt( (1.02075 + 0.5)² - |0.25|² )\n*   v = sqrt( (1.52075)² - 0.0625 )\n*   v = sqrt( 2.31268 - 0.0625 ) = sqrt(2.25018)\n*   v ≈ 1.5\n\nThe result is exactly 1.5.\n\n### 6. Calculate the Non-Gaussianity (nG = S(τ))\n\nThe von Neumann entropy of a Gaussian state with symplectic eigenvalue `v` is:\nS(τ) = (v + 1/2)ln(v + 1/2) - (v - 1/2)ln(v - 1/2)\n\nUsing v = 1.5:\n*   S(τ) = (1.5 + 0.5)ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5)ln(1.5 - 0.5)\n*   S(τ) = 2 * ln(2) - 1 * ln(1)\n*   Since ln(1) = 0, the expression simplifies to:\n*   S(τ) = 2 * ln(2)\n\nUsing the value ln(2) ≈ 0.693:\n*   nG = S(τ) ≈ 2 * 0.693 = 1.386\n\nThis value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
