    "This chemical riddle can be solved by identifying the substances involved in each reaction.\n\n1.  **Reaction 4: D + B → H (1:1 ratio, H is a solvent)**\n    This strongly suggests a well-known industrial reaction. Two common possibilities for a 1:1 reaction between two gases to form a liquid solvent are:\n    *   CO (gas) + Cl₂ (gas) → COCl₂ (liquid, phosgene)\n    *   SO₂ (gas) + Cl₂ (gas) → SO₂Cl₂ (liquid, sulfuryl chloride)\n\n2.  **Identifying E and its Symmetry**\n    The question asks for the molecular symmetry group of E, which is described as an \"extremely hazardous product.\" Both phosgene (COCl₂) and sulfuryl chloride (SO₂Cl₂) are hazardous liquids that are used as solvents. It is plausible that the hazardous product E is the same as the solvent H.\n\n    *   **If E is phosgene (COCl₂):** This molecule is planar. It has a C₂ axis of rotation along the C=O bond and two vertical mirror planes. This corresponds to the **C2v** point group.\n    *   **If E is sulfuryl chloride (SO₂Cl₂):** This molecule has a distorted tetrahedral shape. It possesses a C₂ rotational axis and two mirror planes, which also places it in the **C2v** point group.\n\n    Since both logical candidates for product E have C2v symmetry, we can confidently determine the answer without needing to resolve the more complex or potentially flawed clues in the other reactions. The remaining clues about the \"bright red product C\" and its hydrolysis appear to be inconsistent with simple, well-known chemical reactions, but they are not necessary to identify the symmetry of E.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E is C2v.\n\n<<<A>>>"
