    "The \"impulse\" approximation in many-body nuclear calculations simplifies a complex interaction between a probe and a nucleus by assuming the process is a rapid interaction with a single, quasi-free nucleon. This approximation is valid under a specific set of assumptions that collectively treat the nucleon as if it were a free particle during the brief moment of interaction.\n\nThe key assumptions that underpin the impulse approximation are:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons:** The incoming probe is assumed to engage in a direct, two-body collision with just one nucleon inside the nucleus at any given time. The total interaction is considered the sum of these individual interactions.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon:** After the initial interaction, the scattered probe and the struck nucleon are assumed to exit the nucleus without any further significant interactions with the remaining nucleons. This neglects what are known as final-state interactions (FSI).\n\n4.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces:** The collision is considered to happen so quickly that the potential energy binding the nucleon to the nucleus can be ignored during the interaction itself. The nucleon is treated as \"quasi-free\".\n\nThe third statement, regarding the non-relativistic nature of quarks within the nucleon, is not a foundational assumption of the impulse approximation. The impulse approximation primarily deals with the dynamics of nucleons within the nucleus, not the internal structure of the nucleons themselves.\n\nTherefore, the three assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
