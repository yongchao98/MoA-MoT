    "The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-components of the orbital angular momentum, `L1z` and `L2z`, of two electrons and obtaining the eigenvalue `-ħ` for both. This corresponds to the quantum numbers `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1`.\n\nThe two-electron system is in a coupled angular momentum state represented by `|l1, l2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`. In this notation:\n*   `l1 = 1` and `l2 = 1` are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the individual electrons (since they are in p-orbitals).\n*   `l = 2` is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n*   `m = -1` is the magnetic quantum number corresponding to the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum.\n\nThe z-component of the total angular momentum, `Lz`, is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta, `L1z` and `L2z`. Therefore, the operator relationship is `Lz = L1z + L2z`.\n\nWhen a measurement is performed, the sum of the eigenvalues of the individual components must equal the eigenvalue of the total component. The eigenvalue of `Lz` is `mħ`, the eigenvalue of `L1z` is `m1ħ`, and the eigenvalue of `L2z` is `m2ħ`. This leads to the condition:\n`m1ħ + m2ħ = mħ`\nwhich simplifies to:\n`m1 + m2 = m`\n\nThis condition is a fundamental selection rule for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which are the expansion coefficients used to express a coupled state in terms of the uncoupled states. The probability of measuring a specific combination of `m1` and `m2` is zero if `m1 + m2 ≠ m`.\n\nIn this specific problem:\n*   The total magnetic quantum number is `m = -1`.\n*   The desired measurement outcome is `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1`.\n\nLet's check if the selection rule is satisfied:\n`m1 + m2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2`\n\nSince `m1 + m2 = -2` and `m = -1`, the condition `m1 + m2 = m` is not met.\n\nBecause the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers (`-2`) does not equal the total magnetic quantum number of the system (`-1`), it is impossible to obtain this measurement outcome. Therefore, the probability of jointly measuring `L1z` and `L2z` and finding the eigenvalues to be `-ħ` for both is zero.\n\n<<<D>>>"
