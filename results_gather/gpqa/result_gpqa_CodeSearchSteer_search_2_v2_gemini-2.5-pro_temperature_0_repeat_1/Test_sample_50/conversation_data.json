    "To calculate the net potential energy of a system consisting of a point charge *q* at a distance *d* from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius *R*, the method of image charges is employed.\n\nAn image charge, let's call it *q'*, is induced inside the sphere. The magnitude of this image charge is *q' = -q(R/d)*, and it is located at a distance *b = R²/d* from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the center to the point charge *q*.\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge *q* from infinity to the distance *d*. This work is equivalent to half the potential energy of the interaction between the real charge *q* and the image charge *q'*. The factor of 1/2 arises because the induced charge on the sphere is not a fixed point charge but is created as the external charge is brought in.\n\nThe potential energy *U* can be calculated as follows:\n\nU = (1/2) * (k * q * q') / (d - b)\n\nSubstituting the values for *q'* and *b*:\n\nU = (1/2) * k * q * (-qR/d) / (d - R²/d)\n\nU = -(1/2) * k * q² * (R/d) / ((d² - R²)/d)\n\nBy simplifying the expression, we get:\n\nU = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
