    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the expectation value of the operator O = 10σ_z + 5σ_x for the given spin state.\n\nThe spin state is given by the linear superposition:\n|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩\n\nIn vector notation, the spin-up and spin-down states are:\n|↑⟩ =ᵀ\n|↓⟩ =ᵀ\n\nSo, the state vector |ψ⟩ is:\n|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2]ᵀ\n\nThe Pauli matrices σ_z and σ_x are defined as:\nσ_z = [, [0, -1]]\nσ_x = [,]\n\nThe expectation value of an operator O is calculated as ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩. Due to the linearity of quantum mechanical operators, we can calculate the expectation value for each part of the operator separately and then sum them up.\n\n⟨O⟩ = ⟨ψ|(10σ_z + 5σ_x)|ψ⟩ = 10⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩ + 5⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩\n\nFirst, let's calculate the expectation value of σ_z, denoted as ⟨σ_z⟩:\n⟨σ_z⟩ = ⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩\nThis can be calculated as the difference between the squared magnitudes of the coefficients of the |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ states.\nLet the state be |ψ⟩ = c₁|↑⟩ + c₂|↓⟩, where c₁ = 0.5 and c₂ = √3/2.\n⟨σ_z⟩ = |c₁|² - |c₂|² = (0.5)² - (√3/2)² = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5\n\nNext, let's calculate the expectation value of σ_x, denoted as ⟨σ_x⟩:\n⟨σ_x⟩ = ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩\nσ_x|ψ⟩ = [,] * [0.5, √3/2]ᵀ = [√3/2, 0.5]ᵀ\n⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [√3/2, 0.5]ᵀ = (0.5 * √3/2) + (√3/2 * 0.5) = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2\n\nNow, we can find the total expectation value:\n⟨O⟩ = 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩\n⟨O⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (√3/2)\n⟨O⟩ = -5 + (5√3)/2\n\nUsing the approximation √3 ≈ 1.732:\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + (5 * 1.732) / 2\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 8.66 / 2\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -0.67\n\nRounding the result to one decimal place, we get -0.7.\n\n<<<D>>>"
