    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**1. Define the Initial State and Operators**\n\n*   The initial state of the system is given by the column matrix:\n    `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ`\n    The squared norm of this state is `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n\n*   The operator for observable P is:\n    `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n\n*   The operator for observable Q is:\n    `Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\n**2. First Measurement: Probability of getting 0 for P**\n\nTo find the probability of measuring the value 0 for the observable P, we first need to find the eigenvector of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector for P with eigenvalue 0:**\n    We need to solve the equation `P|v⟩ = 0|v⟩`. Let `|v⟩ = [x, y, z]ᵀ`.\n    `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] [x, y, z]ᵀ = [0, 0, 0]ᵀ`\n    This gives the system of equations:\n    1.  `(1/√2) * y = 0`  which implies `y = 0`.\n    2.  `(1/√2) * x + (1/√2) * z = 0` which implies `x + z = 0`, or `x = -z`.\n\n    So, the eigenvector is of the form `[x, 0, -x]ᵀ`. To normalize it, we set `x² + 0² + (-x)² = 1`, which gives `2x² = 1`, so `x = 1/√2`.\n    The normalized eigenvector `|p₀⟩` for the eigenvalue 0 is:\n    `|p₀⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]ᵀ`\n\n*   **Calculate the probability:**\n    The probability of measuring P=0 is the squared magnitude of the projection of the initial state `|ψ⟩` onto the eigenvector `|p₀⟩`, divided by the squared norm of `|ψ⟩`.\n    `Prob(P=0) = |⟨p₀|ψ⟩|² / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩`\n\n    First, calculate the inner product `⟨p₀|ψ⟩`:\n    `⟨p₀|ψ⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2] . [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ = (1/√2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)*1 = -1/√2 - 1/√2 = -2/√2 = -√2`\n\n    Now, calculate the probability:\n    `Prob(P=0) = (-√2)² / 6 = 2 / 6 = 1/3`\n\n**3. State Collapse After the First Measurement**\n\nAfter measuring the observable P and obtaining the result 0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding normalized eigenvector `|p₀⟩`.\nThe new state of the system, `|ψ'⟩`, is:\n`|ψ'⟩ = |p₀⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]ᵀ`\n\n**4. Second Measurement: Probability of getting -1 for Q**\n\nNow, we measure the observable Q in the new state `|ψ'⟩`. We want to find the probability of getting the value -1.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector for Q with eigenvalue -1:**\n    The operator Q is a diagonal matrix. Its eigenvalues are the diagonal entries (1, 0, -1), and its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. The normalized eigenvector `|q₋₁⟩` for the eigenvalue -1 is:\n    `|q₋₁⟩ = [0, 0, 1]ᵀ`\n\n*   **Calculate the probability:**\n    The probability of measuring Q=-1 in the state `|ψ'⟩` is the squared magnitude of the projection of `|ψ'⟩` onto `|q₋₁⟩`.\n    `Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = |⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩|²`\n\n    Calculate the inner product `⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩`:\n    `⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩ = [0, 0, 1] . [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]ᵀ = 0*(1/√2) + 0*0 + 1*(-1/√2) = -1/√2`\n\n    Now, calculate the probability:\n    `Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2`\n\n**5. Combined Probability**\n\nThe probability of the sequence of events (measuring P=0 and then measuring Q=-1) is the product of the individual probabilities calculated in the steps above.\n\n`Prob(P=0 and then Q=-1) = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 | P=0)`\n`Prob(total) = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`\n\nThus, the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements is 1/6.\n\n<<<C>>>"
