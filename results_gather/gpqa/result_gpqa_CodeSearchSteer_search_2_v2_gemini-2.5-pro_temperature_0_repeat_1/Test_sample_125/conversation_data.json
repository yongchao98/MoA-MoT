    "The analysis of the reactions and the resulting products is correct.\n\n*   **Reaction I:** The reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one with LAH creates a new stereocenter at the C3 position. Since the stereocenter at C5 is unaffected, the products are a pair of diastereomers: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Reaction II:** The reduction of the achiral pentane-2,4-dione with NaBH4 creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. This results in three stereoisomers: the enantiomeric pair of (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, and the achiral meso compound, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n\nThe final mixture, therefore, contains a total of five different stereoisomers.\n\nThe separation of these compounds by HPLC is determined by the type of column used:\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Therefore, the two diastereomers from Reaction I will produce two separate peaks.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated, eluting as a single peak.\n    *   The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have different physical properties, leading to its separation.\n    *   Thus, the products from Reaction II will show two peaks: one for the enantiomeric pair and one for the meso compound.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C7-methoxy-alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C5-diols) and will have different retention times.\n    *   In total, we expect **4 peaks**: two from Reaction I and two from Reaction II.\n\n*   **Chiral-Phase HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase to differentiate between enantiomers.\n    *   It can separate all five stereoisomers in the mixture as they will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated (2 peaks).\n    *   The two enantiomers from Reaction II will be separated (2 peaks).\n    *   The achiral meso compound will also be separated from the other compounds, giving its own peak (1 peak).\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **5 peaks**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>"
