    "Based on the analytical data provided, the most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. Here is a detailed breakdown of why this conclusion is reached:\n\n1.  **Analysis of 1H NMR Data:** The spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. In a standard NMR experiment (using an achiral solvent), enantiomers are indistinguishable and would produce a single peak. However, diastereomers are chemically distinct molecules and are expected to have different NMR spectra, with corresponding protons appearing at different chemical shifts. The observation of two peaks for the same proton, with roughly equal integrals, strongly suggests the presence of two diastereomers in a nearly 1:1 ratio.\n\n2.  **Analysis of LC-MS Data:** The liquid chromatography (LC) separates the crude material into two distinct peaks of equal intensity. Since diastereomers have different physical properties, they can be separated using standard (achiral) chromatography techniques. In contrast, enantiomers would not separate under these conditions and would elute as a single peak. The mass spectrometry (MS) data shows that both separated peaks have the same mass, which is consistent with the expected molecule. This confirms that the two components are isomers, not impurities like precursors or side-products with different molecular formulas.\n\n3.  **Context of Peptide Synthesis:** In the chemical synthesis of peptides, which are chiral molecules typically built from chiral amino acids, a common side reaction is the epimerization of an alpha-carbon. Epimerization is the change in configuration at a single stereocenter. If a peptide contains multiple stereocenters, the epimerization of just one of them results in the formation of a diastereomer. For example, if a peptide composed of all L-amino acids undergoes epimerization at one residue, a diastereomer containing one D-amino acid is formed.\n\n**Evaluating the Other Options:**\n\n*   **A) 'Double coupling':** This would result in a product with a significantly different (higher) mass, which contradicts the MS data.\n*   **B) Contamination with a precursor:** A precursor would also have a different mass and structure, which is inconsistent with the MS data showing both peaks have the expected mass.\n*   **C) Mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers would not be distinguishable by either standard 1H NMR or achiral LC, meaning only one peak would be observed in each analysis.\n\nTherefore, the presence of two peaks in both the NMR (for one proton) and the LC, coupled with identical mass spectra for both peaks, is the classic signature of a diastereomeric mixture.\n\n<<<D>>>"
