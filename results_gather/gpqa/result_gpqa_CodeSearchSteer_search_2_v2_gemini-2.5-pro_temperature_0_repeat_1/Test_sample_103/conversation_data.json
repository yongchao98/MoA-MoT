    "To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we can use the principles of the radial velocity (RV) method for detecting exoplanets.\n\n### Analysis of the Data\n\n1.  **Wavelength Shift and Velocity Amplitude:** The periodic shift in a star's spectral lines is caused by the Doppler effect as the star \"wobbles\" due to the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The amplitude of this wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K).\n    *   For planet #1, the shift is $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom.\n    *   For planet #2, the shift is $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom.\n    *   The ratio of the velocity amplitudes is therefore $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$.\n\n2.  **Radial Velocity and Orbital Parameters:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is related to the orbital period (P), the planet's mass ($m_p$), and the star's mass ($M_{star}$) by the following formula.\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n    where *G* is the gravitational constant and *i* is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Comparing the Two Systems:** We are given that the stellar masses are identical ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$) and the planetary masses are similar ($m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$). To solve the problem, we must also assume that the orbital inclinations (*i*) are similar, which is a standard simplifying assumption in such problems.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Period Ratio:** By setting up a ratio of the velocity amplitudes for the two systems, most terms cancel out:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p2} \\sin i_2}{M_{star2}^{2/3}}}{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p1} \\sin i_1}{M_{star1}^{2/3}}} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n5.  **Solving for the Ratio:** We can now substitute the known ratio of the velocity amplitudes:\n    $1.4 = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    To find the ratio of the periods, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n    $1.4^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n    $2.744 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n\n    The question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{1}{2.744} \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThis result indicates that the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\n<<<D>>>"
