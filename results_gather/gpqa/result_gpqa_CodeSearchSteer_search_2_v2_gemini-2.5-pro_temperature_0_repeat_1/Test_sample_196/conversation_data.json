    "The analysis of the provided spectroscopic data and the chemical reaction leads to the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of Compound X from IR and NMR Data\n\n*   **IR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   The broad absorption in the range of 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is a distinctive feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid dimer.\n    *   The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This highly deshielded, broad singlet is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region indicate a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is from the protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the signal at 7.2 ppm is from the protons adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:**\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons is consistent with a methylene group (-CH₂-) situated between the aforementioned methyl group and a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates another methyl group (-CH₃) attached to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the methine group (-CH-) which is bonded to the benzene ring, the methyl group (at 1.4 ppm), and the methylene group (at 1.7 ppm).\n    *   **Assembling the Structure:** The alkyl fragments form a *sec*-butyl group [-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)]. This group is attached to the benzene ring at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Identity of Compound X:** The data conclusively identifies Compound X as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option (D).\n\n### Step 2: Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI\n\n*   **Reagents and Reaction Type:** The combination of red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI) is a powerful reducing agent.\n*   **Function:** This reagent mixture is known to completely reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) to their corresponding alkanes (-CH₃). The reaction involves the reduction of the carboxyl group to a methyl group.\n*   **Transformation:** The starting material, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, will have its carboxylic acid group at position 1 reduced to a methyl group. The *sec*-butyl group at position 4 and the aromatic ring will remain unchanged.\n*   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the spectroscopic analysis, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Its reaction with red phosphorus and HI reduces the carboxylic acid to a methyl group, yielding 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene as the final product.\n\n<<<A>>>"
