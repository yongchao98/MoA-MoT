    "To solve this problem, we must analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each potential compound and then for the mixtures proposed in the options. The molecular formula for all candidate compounds is C10H14. The experimental spectrum of the 1:1 mixture shows two singlets in the aromatic region (~6.7 ppm) with a 1:1 integration ratio, and three singlets in the alkyl region (~2.2 ppm) with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### Analysis of Individual Compounds:\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, it has two equivalent aromatic protons, which would appear as a single singlet. The four methyl groups are also equivalent, leading to one singlet for all 12 methyl protons.\n    *   Aromatic signal: 1 singlet (2H)\n    *   Alkyl signal: 1 singlet (12H)\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes the two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) equivalent, resulting in one aromatic singlet. It has three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H), the one at C2 is unique (3H), and the one at C5 is unique (3H). This leads to three singlets in the alkyl region with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   Aromatic signal: 1 singlet (2H)\n    *   Alkyl signals: 3 singlets (6H, 3H, 3H; ratio 2:1:1)\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** The two aromatic protons (at C5 and C6) are adjacent and not equivalent, so they would form a system of two doublets, not singlets.\n    *   Aromatic signal: 2 doublets\n\n*   **1,4-Diethylbenzene:** The high symmetry makes all four aromatic protons equivalent, producing one singlet. The two ethyl groups are equivalent, but within each ethyl group, the CH2 and CH3 protons are different and couple with each other, resulting in a quartet (for the 4H of the two CH2 groups) and a triplet (for the 6H of the two CH3 groups).\n    *   Aromatic signal: 1 singlet (4H)\n    *   Alkyl signals: 1 quartet (4H) and 1 triplet (6H)\n\n### Analysis of the Mixtures:\n\nThe mixture's spectrum has **two aromatic singlets** and **three alkyl singlets**. This immediately eliminates any option containing 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (which gives doublets) or 1,4-diethylbenzene (which gives a quartet and a triplet).\n\nLet's evaluate the correct option based on this:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:** Incorrect. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene does not give an aromatic singlet.\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** Incorrect. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene does not give an aromatic singlet.\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Incorrect. 1,4-diethylbenzene produces a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region, not singlets. Also, in a 1:1 molar mixture, the aromatic proton ratio would be 2H:4H or 1:2, not 1:1.\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** Both compounds give a single aromatic singlet. Since they are different molecules, these singlets will have slightly different chemical shifts. In a 1:1 molar mixture, and since each molecule contributes 2 aromatic protons, the integration ratio of the two singlets will be 1:1. This matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Alkyl Region:** The total signals from the mixture would be the sum of the signals from each component.\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: 1 singlet (12H)\n        *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: 3 singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)\n    *   The problem states there are three resulting signals with a 2:1:1 ratio. For a 1:1 mixture, the total alkyl proton integration is 12H + 12H = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio of 24 protons corresponds to signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   This can be explained by an accidental overlap (degeneracy) of the two non-equivalent 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. This would result in three signals for the mixture: one from the 12 methyl protons of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (12H), one from the equivalent methyls at C1 and C3 of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (6H), and one from the combined, overlapping signals of the methyls at C2 and C5 of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (3H + 3H = 6H).\n    *   This combination gives three singlets with an integration ratio of 12:6:6, which simplifies to 2:1:1. This perfectly matches the provided spectral data.\n\nTherefore, the mixture contains 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>"
