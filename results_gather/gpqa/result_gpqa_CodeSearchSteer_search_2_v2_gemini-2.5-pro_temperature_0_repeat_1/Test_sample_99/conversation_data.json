    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and an evaluation of each statement:\n\n**Reaction Sequence:**\n\n*   **Compound A (C3H6)** is propene.\n*   **Compound A + Br2/CCl4 → Compound B:** Propene undergoes an addition reaction with bromine in carbon tetrachloride to form **1,2-dibromopropane (B)**.\n*   **Compound B + alcoholic KOH → Compound C:** 1,2-dibromopropane undergoes dehydrohalogenation (removal of two molecules of HBr) to form **propyne (C)**.\n*   **Compound C passed through a red-hot iron tube → Compound D:** Propyne undergoes cyclic polymerization (trimerization) to form **1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, also known as mesitylene (D)**.\n*   **Compound D + mixture of two strong acids → Compound E:** Mesitylene is nitrated using a mixture of concentrated nitric acid and sulfuric acid to produce **2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (E)**.\n*   **Compound E + Fe/HCl → Compound F:** The nitro group in compound E is reduced to an amino group, forming **2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, also known as mesidine (F)**.\n*   **Compound F + HNO2 → Compound G:** The primary aromatic amine (mesidine) reacts with nitrous acid (diazotization) to form a diazonium salt, **1,3,5-trimethylbenzene-2-diazonium chloride (G)**.\n*   **Compound G + NaOH → Compound H:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed with a base to form a phenol, specifically **2,4,6-trimethylphenol (H)**.\n\n**Evaluation of the Statements:**\n\n*   **A) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.** Compound D is mesitylene (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene). Due to its symmetrical structure, the nine protons of the three methyl groups are chemically equivalent and produce a single signal (a singlet). The three protons on the aromatic ring are also equivalent to each other and produce another singlet. Therefore, the 1H NMR spectrum of mesitylene shows two singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **B) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.** Compound F is mesidine (2,4,6-trimethylaniline), an aromatic amine. Aromatic amines are well-known starting materials for the synthesis of various dyes, particularly azo dyes. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **C) C is a flammable gas.** Compound C is propyne. Propyne has a boiling point of -23.1 °C, meaning it is a gas at room temperature. As a small alkyne, it is a highly flammable gas. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **D) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.** Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, typically producing a violet, blue, or green color due to the formation of a colored iron-phenol complex. However, for sterically hindered phenols like 2,4,6-trimethylphenol, where the hydroxyl group is flanked by two methyl groups, the formation of this complex is prevented. As a result, no color change occurs, and the solution retains the original yellow color of the ferric chloride reagent. The statement that it \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction that produces yellow, whereas it is the absence of a reaction that leaves the solution yellow. Phenols that give a positive test result do not turn yellow. Therefore, this statement inaccurately describes the chemical behavior in the context of a characteristic test. This statement is **incorrect**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
