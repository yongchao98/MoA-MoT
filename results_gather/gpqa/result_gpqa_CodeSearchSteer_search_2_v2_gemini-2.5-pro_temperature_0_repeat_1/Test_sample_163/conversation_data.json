    "The search results confirm the underlying physics and formulas used.\n\nSpecifically, result provides a worked example that uses the same formula for the sum of the masses:\n`mA + mB = (P / (2πG)) * ((vA,r + vB,r) / sin(i))^3`\n\nIt also confirms that for an eclipsing binary, it's appropriate to assume the inclination `i ≈ 90°`, which makes `sin(i) ≈ 1`.\n\nResult further clarifies this: \"In an eclipsing binary, then the shape and depth of the eclipses can be uniquely solved to give the inclination and hence the masses of the individual stars.\" and \"If the stars eclipse one another at a certain point in their orbit (eclipsing binaries) then we know that the Earth is in their orbital plane, so θ=0 and the measured velocity is v.\" (Note: their angle θ is complementary to the inclination angle i, so θ=0 corresponds to i=90°).\n\nThe other results all discuss Kepler's third law and its application to binary systems to find their total mass, reinforcing the general principle.\n\nThe calculation was:\nM1 / M2 = (P1 * (K1_total)^3) / (P2 * (K2_total)^3)\nM1 / M2 = (2 * (10 + 5)^3) / (1 * (15 + 10)^3)\nM1 / M2 = (2 * 15^3) / (1 * 25^3)\nM1 / M2 = (2 * 3375) / (15625)\nM1 / M2 = 6750 / 15625\nM1 / M2 = 0.432\n\nThe result is robust. The factor is approximately 0.432, which corresponds to option A.\n\nFinal check of the question and options.\nQuestion: \"By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?\" This means calculating the ratio M1/M2.\nSystem 1: P=2yr, K_amps = 10, 5 km/s -> K_total = 15 km/s\nSystem 2: P=1yr, K_amps = 15, 10 km/s -> K_total = 25 km/s\n\nRatio = (2 * 15^3) / (1 * 25^3) = 2 * (15/25)^3 = 2 * (3/5)^3 = 2 * (27/125) = 54/125 = 0.432.\n\nThe closest answer is A) ~ 0.4.\n\nThe logic is sound, the formula is confirmed by multiple sources, and the calculation is straightforward. I am ready to provide the final answer.To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to calculate the ratio of their total masses (M₁/M₂).\n\nThe total mass of a spectroscopic binary system can be determined using a form of Kepler's third law. The formula for the sum of the masses (M = m₁ + m₂) is:\n\nM = (P / (2πG)) * (K₁ + K₂ )³ / sin³(i)\n\nWhere:\n*   **P** is the orbital period of the system.\n*   **K₁** and **K₂** are the amplitudes of the radial velocities for the two stars.\n*   **G** is the gravitational constant.\n*   **i** is the inclination angle of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n\nThe problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This is a key piece of information, as eclipsing binaries are systems that we view nearly edge-on. This means their inclination angle, *i*, is very close to 90°, and therefore sin(i) is approximately 1. This simplifies the calculation significantly.\n\nLet's calculate the total mass for each system.\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Period (P₁): 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K₁_total): 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Period (P₂): 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K₂_total): 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, we can set up the ratio of the mass of system_1 (M₁) to the mass of system_2 (M₂).\n\nM₁ / M₂ = [ (P₁ / (2πG)) * (K₁_total)³ ] / [ (P₂ / (2πG)) * (K₂_total)³ ]\n\nThe constant term (1 / (2πG)) cancels out, leaving:\n\nM₁ / M₂ = (P₁ * (K₁_total)³) / (P₂ * (K₂_total)³)\n\nNow, we plug in the values for each system:\n\nM₁ / M₂ = (2 years * (15 km/s)³) / (1 year * (25 km/s)³)\n\nM₁ / M₂ = (2 * 3375) / (1 * 15625)\n\nM₁ / M₂ = 6750 / 15625\n\nCalculating the final value:\n\nM₁ / M₂ = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
