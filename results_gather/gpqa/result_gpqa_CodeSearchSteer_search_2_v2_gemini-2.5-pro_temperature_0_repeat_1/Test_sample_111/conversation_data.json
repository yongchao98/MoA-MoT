    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**1. Normalize the state |α>**\n\nThe given state is |α> ∝ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>.\nLet the normalization constant be N. So, |α> = N * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>].\nThe normalization condition is <α|α> = 1.\n\nThe bra is <α| = N* * [(1-i)<up| + (2+i)<down|].\n\n<α|α> = |N|² * [(1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)] = 1\n|N|² * [(1² - i²) + (2² - i²)] = 1\n|N|² * [(1 + 1) + (4 + 1)] = 1\n|N|² * (2 + 5) = 1\n|N|² * 7 = 1\nN = 1/√7\n\nSo, the normalized state is:\n|α> = (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]\n\nIn vector notation, with |up> =ᵀ and |down> =ᵀ, the state is:\n|α> = (1/√7) * [ (1+i), (2-i) ]ᵀ\n\n**2. Define the operator A and find its eigenstates and eigenvalues**\n\nThe operator A has matrix elements Aij = ħ/2 for i ≠ j and 0 for i = j. This gives the matrix:\nA = (ħ/2) * [,]\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0:\ndet([[ -λ, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, -λ ]]) = 0\n(-λ)(-λ) - (ħ/2)(ħ/2) = 0\nλ² - (ħ/2)² = 0\nλ = ± ħ/2\n\nThe eigenvalues are λ₁ = +ħ/2 and λ₂ = -ħ/2.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenstates:\n*   For λ₁ = +ħ/2:\n    (A - λ₁I)v₁ = 0\n    [[ -ħ/2, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, -ħ/2 ]] * [[x], [y]] = 0\n    This gives -x + y = 0, so x = y. The unnormalized eigenvector isᵀ.\n    Normalizing it gives the eigenstate |v₁> = (1/√2) *ᵀ = (1/√2) * (|up> + |down>).\n\n*   For λ₂ = -ħ/2:\n    (A - λ₂I)v₂ = 0\n    [[ ħ/2, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, ħ/2 ]] * [[x], [y]] = 0\n    This gives x + y = 0, so x = -y. The unnormalized eigenvector is [1, -1]ᵀ.\n    Normalizing it gives the eigenstate |v₂> = (1/√2) * [1, -1]ᵀ = (1/√2) * (|up> - |down>).\n\n**3. Calculate the probabilities**\n\nThe probability of measuring the system in an eigenstate |vᵢ> is given by Pᵢ = |<vᵢ|α>|².\n\n*   Probability of measuring λ₁ = +ħ/2 (state |v₁>):\n    P₁ = |<v₁|α>|²\n    <v₁|α> = [(1/√2) * (<up| + <down|)] * [(1/√7) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]\n    <v₁|α> = (1/√14) * [ (1+i)<up|up> + (2-i)<down|down> ]\n    <v₁|α> = (1/√14) * (1 + i + 2 - i) = 3/√14\n    P₁ = (3/√14)² = 9/14 ≈ 0.643\n\n*   Probability of measuring λ₂ = -ħ/2 (state |v₂>):\n    P₂ = |<v₂|α>|²\n    <v₂|α> = [(1/√2) * (<up| - <down|)] * [(1/√7) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]\n    <v₂|α> = (1/√14) * [ (1+i)<up|up> - (2-i)<down|down> ]\n    <v₂|α> = (1/√14) * (1 + i - 2 + i) = (-1 + 2i)/√14\n    P₂ = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1 + 4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n**4. Find the average value (expectation value) of A**\n\nThe average value <A> can be calculated in two ways:\n\n*   Method 1: Using eigenvalues and probabilities\n    <A> = Σ Pᵢλᵢ = P₁λ₁ + P₂λ₂\n    <A> = (9/14)(+ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2)\n    <A> = (ħ/2) * (9/14 - 5/14) = (ħ/2) * (4/14) = (ħ/2) * (2/7) = ħ/7\n\n*   Method 2: Using the formula <A> = <α|A|α>\n    <A> = (1/√7) * [ (1-i), (2+i) ] * (ħ/2) * [,] * (1/√7) * [[1+i], [2-i]]\n    <A> = (ħ/14) * [ (1-i), (2+i) ] * [[2-i], [1+i]]\n    <A> = (ħ/14) * [ (1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i) ]\n    <A> = (ħ/14) * [ (2 - 3i + i²) + (2 + 3i + i²) ]\n    <A> = (ħ/14) * [ (2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1) ]\n    <A> = (ħ/14) * [ (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) ]\n    <A> = (ħ/14) * 2 = ħ/7\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of the operator is ħ/7. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
