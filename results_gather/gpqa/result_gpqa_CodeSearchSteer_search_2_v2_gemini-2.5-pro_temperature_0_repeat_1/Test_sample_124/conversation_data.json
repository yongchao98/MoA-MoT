    "The energy eigenvalues for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by the formula $E_n = (n + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is a non-negative integer representing the energy level.\n\nThe energy levels are as follows:\n*   **Ground state (n=0):** $E_0 = (0 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (3/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First excited state (n=1):** $E_1 = (1 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (5/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Second excited state (n=2):** $E_2 = (2 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (7/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Third excited state (n=3):** $E_3 = (3 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (9/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ (the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to that energy) is given by the formula $g_n = (n+1)(n+2)/2$.\n\nFor the third excited state, we have n=3. Plugging this into the degeneracy formula:\n$g_3 = (3+1)(3+2)/2 = (4)(5)/2 = 10$.\n\nThis degeneracy can also be found by counting the number of ways the sum of three non-negative integers ($n_x, n_y, n_z$) can equal 3:\n*   (3, 0, 0) and its 2 permutations: 3 states.\n*   (2, 1, 0) and its 5 permutations: 6 states.\n*   (1, 1, 1): 1 state.\nThe total number of states is 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$, and it has a degeneracy of 10.\n\n<<<D>>>"
