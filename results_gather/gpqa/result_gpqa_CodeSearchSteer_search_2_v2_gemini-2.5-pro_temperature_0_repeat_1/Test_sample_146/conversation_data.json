    "To solve this problem, we apply the principle of conservation of energy. The annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) releases their total rest energy, which is then converted into the total energy of the resulting particles ($2A^{+}$ and $2A^{-}$).\n\n### 1. Calculate the Initial Energy\nThe problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. We can assume the proton is also at rest. Therefore, the total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n\nThe rest mass energy of a proton is approximately 938.27 MeV. An antiproton has the same rest mass.\n\n$E_i = E_{proton} + E_{antiproton}$\n$E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$\n$E_i = 938.27 \\text{ MeV} + 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n### 2. Set Up the Final Energy Equation\nThe final state consists of four particles of type A (two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$), each with a rest mass energy of $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$. The total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the total energies of these four particles. Since momentum is conserved (initially zero), the energy will be distributed equally among the four particles, meaning they will all have the same velocity, $v$.\n\nThe total energy of a single moving particle A is given by the relativistic energy equation:\n$E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$\nwhere $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\nThe total final energy for the four particles is:\n$E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n$E_f = 4 \\gamma (300 \\text{ MeV}) = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation of Energy\nBy equating the initial and final energies ($E_i = E_f$):\n$1876.54 \\text{ MeV} = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n### 4. Solve for the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1876.54}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n### 5. Calculate the Velocity (v)\nNow, we solve for the velocity, $v$, using the definition of the Lorentz factor. Let $\\beta = v/c$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n\nTherefore, the velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.77c\nB) 0.86c\nC) 0.96c\nD) 0.91c\n\nThe calculated velocity matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
