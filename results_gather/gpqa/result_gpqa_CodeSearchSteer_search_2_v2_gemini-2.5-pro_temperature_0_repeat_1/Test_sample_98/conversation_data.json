    "The identification of the unknown compound relies on a detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### Analysis of FTIR Data\nThe FTIR spectrum provides crucial information about the functional groups present in the molecule.\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\nThis information confirms that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid, which is true for all four possible options. Therefore, the 1H NMR data is essential to differentiate between the isomers.\n\n### Analysis of 1H NMR Data\nThe 1H NMR spectrum gives detailed information about the connectivity of atoms in the molecule through splitting patterns. The problem states that there are no vinyl hydrogens, which is consistent with all four saturated structures. The key to the identification lies in two specific complex splitting patterns observed.\n\n1.  **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This pattern arises from a single proton (a CH group) that is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (giving the **d**oublet).\n    *   A group of two equivalent protons, like a CH₂ group (giving the **t**riplet).\n    *   A group of three equivalent protons, like a CH₃ group (giving the **q**uartet).\n\n2.  **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern arises from a single proton (a CH group) coupled to:\n    *   One adjacent proton (giving the **d**oublet).\n    *   A group of two equivalent protons, like a CH₂ group (giving the first **t**riplet).\n    *   Another, different group of two equivalent protons (giving the second **t**riplet).\n\n### Evaluating the Candidate Structures\n\nLet's analyze the proton environments in each proposed structure to see which one matches both required splitting patterns.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (3,4-Dimethylhexanoic acid):** This molecule has a proton that would show a `dtq` pattern, but it lacks a proton environment that would produce a `dtt`.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-Dimethylpentanoic acid):** This structure also contains a proton that would result in a `dtq` signal. However, it does not have a proton that is adjacent to another CH and two different CH₂ groups, so it cannot produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid - assuming a typo and it should be 3-ethyl-4-**methyl**hexanoic acid to be C10, or if it is 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid):** Let's analyze the structure as 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid.\n    ```\n          CH₂CH₃      CH₂CH₃\n          |           |\n    CH₃ - CH -------- CH ------- CH₂COOH\n          (f)         (g)\n    ```\n    *   The proton at position **(g)** is adjacent to the proton at (f), the CH₂ group of the carboxylic acid, and the CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent. This environment perfectly matches the requirement for a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   The proton at position **(f)** is adjacent to the proton at (g), the terminal CH₃ group, and the CH₂ group of its ethyl substituent. This environment perfectly matches the requirement for a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    Since this molecule contains protons that would generate both of the observed complex signals, it is the correct structure.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-Diethylpentanoic acid):** This molecule has a proton that would give a `dtt` signal. However, it does not have any proton that is simultaneously adjacent to another CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group. Therefore, it cannot produce the `dtq` signal.\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis of the splitting patterns described, only structure C possesses the necessary combination of proton environments to account for both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>"
