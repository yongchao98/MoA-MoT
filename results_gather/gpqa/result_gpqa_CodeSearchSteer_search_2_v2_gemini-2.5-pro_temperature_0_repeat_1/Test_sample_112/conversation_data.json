    "### Deciphering the Molecular Identity\n\nBased on the provided spectroscopic data, the unknown compound is identified as having the chemical formula **C6H10O2**. This conclusion is reached by systematically interpreting the results from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry.\n\n#### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** The spectrum reveals three key absorption peaks. A very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid, where hydrogen bonding causes significant broadening. A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which is a component of a carboxylic acid. The third strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), suggesting the compound is unsaturated. The combination of a broad O-H stretch and a C=O stretch strongly points to the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:** The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens confirms the existence of a C=C double bond within the molecule. Vinyl hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbon atoms of a double bond.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:** A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a significant clue. This fragment is commonly attributed to the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺. While other fragments can have this m/z value, in the context of the FTIR data, the carboxylic acid fragment is the most logical interpretation.\n\n#### Evaluating the Chemical Formulas:\n\nTo determine the correct molecular formula, the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)** for each option was calculated. The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The presence of both a carbonyl group (C=O) and an alkene group (C=C) means the molecule must have at least two degrees of unsaturation.\n\nThe DoU for the potential formulas are as follows:\n*   **C6H12O:** DoU = 1\n*   **C6H10O2:** DoU = 2\n*   **C6H12O2:** DoU = 1\n*   **C6H10O:** DoU = 2\n\nBoth C6H10O2 and C6H10O have the required two degrees of unsaturation. However, the strong evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group from the FTIR (broad O-H and C=O peaks) and the mass spectrum (m/z = 45 fragment) necessitates the presence of two oxygen atoms. Therefore, C6H10O, with only one oxygen, is ruled out.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe formula **C6H10O2** is the only one that aligns with all the experimental evidence: it has two degrees of unsaturation to account for the alkene and carbonyl groups, and it contains two oxygen atoms, consistent with the identified carboxylic acid functionality.\n\n<<<B>>>"
