    "The relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature and its orbit is fundamental to solving this problem. For a planet in a circular orbit, the equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is determined by the balance between the energy absorbed from its star and the energy it radiates back into space.\n\nThe formula for equilibrium temperature is:\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / 2a)^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star is the star's temperature.\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   'a' is the semi-major axis of the orbit (the orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n*   'A' is the planet's albedo (the fraction of light reflected).\n\nIn this specific system, the planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are constant. The problem states that the albedo (A) is the same for all three planets. Therefore, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\nFrom this relationship, we can establish a ratio between the orbital distances of two planets based on their equilibrium temperatures:\n\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2)² = a2 / a1\n\nWe are given the following temperature ratios:\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 1.4\n*   T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3\n\nUsing these, we can find the ratios of their orbital distances:\n*   a2 / a1 = (1.4)² = 1.96\n*   a3 / a2 = (2.3)² = 5.29\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet3 to Planet1 (a3 / a1), we multiply the individual ratios:\na3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n\nThe final step is to relate the orbital distance to the orbital period using Kepler's Third Law. This law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a).\n\nP² ∝ a³\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the orbital periods is:\n(P3 / P1)² = (a3 / a1)³\nP3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2)\n\nPlugging in the calculated value for a3 / a1:\nP3 / P1 = (10.3684)^(1.5) ≈ 33.39\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4. The information regarding the planets' masses and their discovery via the Transit Timing Variation (TTV) method is not necessary for this calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
