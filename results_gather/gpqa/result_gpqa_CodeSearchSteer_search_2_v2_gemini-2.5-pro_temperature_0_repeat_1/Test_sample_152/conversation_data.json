  "question": "α-β unsaturated carbonyls have a much more electrophilic carbon double bond. These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions.

    "The analysis of the three reactions is as follows:\n\n**Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) → (A)**\n\n1.  **Michael Donor:** The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the acidic α-carbon of dimethyl malonate to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n2.  **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon (the carbon atom attached to the p-tolyl group).\n3.  **Product Formation:** The nucleophilic attack is followed by protonation from the ethanol (EtOH) solvent. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between the central carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n4.  **Product Structure (A):** The resulting product is MeOOC-CH₂-CH(p-tolyl)-CH(COOMe)₂. The IUPAC name for this structure is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) → (B)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Stork enamine synthesis, which is a variation of the Michael addition.\n2.  **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine, which serves as a carbon nucleophile.\n3.  **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN) is the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n4.  **Product Formation:** The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile. The subsequent workup with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the intermediate iminium salt back to a ketone.\n5.  **Product Structure (B):** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2) with the remnant of the nitrile. The substituent is -CH(CH₃)CH₂CN. The IUPAC name is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. The keto form is the major product over the enol form after acidic workup.\n\n**Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) → 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition where the product and the Michael acceptor are given. We must identify the Michael donor (C).\n2.  **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK).\n3.  **Product Analysis:** The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The \"3-oxobutyl\" group (-CH₂CH₂COCH₃) comes from the MVK after the addition. This group is attached to the C2 position of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring.\n4.  **Michael Donor (C):** The C2 position of cyclohexane-1,3-dione is highly acidic due to the two adjacent carbonyl groups. The base (KOH) deprotonates this carbon to form a stable enolate. This enolate is the nucleophile that attacks MVK. Therefore, reactant C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of each reaction:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
