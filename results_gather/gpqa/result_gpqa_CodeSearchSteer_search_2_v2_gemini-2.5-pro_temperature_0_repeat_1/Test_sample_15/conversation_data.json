    "A compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This property is most often caused by the presence of one or more chiral centers and the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is an alkene. The carbons of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. The molecule as a whole is planar and therefore has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name of this complex bicyclic compound includes stereochemical descriptors \"(3aR,7aS)\". These indicate the presence of specific configurations at chiral centers. A molecule with chiral centers is chiral and thus optically active, unless it is a meso compound (which has an internal plane of symmetry). The specification of a single enantiomer confirms its chiral nature. Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the molecule is symmetrical, with a carboxylic acid group at each end. The (2R,3S) configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry between the two chiral carbons. This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a stereoisomer of the previous compound. It has two chiral centers, but the (2R,3R) configuration does not result in an internal plane of symmetry. The molecule is chiral and its mirror image is the non-superimposable (2S,3S) enantiomer. Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), and two different carbon pathways around the ring (-CH=CH- and -CH2-CH2-). This makes C1 a chiral center. The \"(R)\" designation indicates that this is a specific enantiomer. Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through one of the C-OH bonds and the opposite CH2 group bisects the molecule into two identical halves. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: To determine if this compound is chiral, we look for chiral centers or other elements of chirality. The structure is (cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2. There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that includes the cyclopentyl ring and the carbonyl group, bisecting the isobutyl group. Therefore, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\nIn summary, three of the compounds listed will exhibit optical activity:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\n<<<B>>>"
