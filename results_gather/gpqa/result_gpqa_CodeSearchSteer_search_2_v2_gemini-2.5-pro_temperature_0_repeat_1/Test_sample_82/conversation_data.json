    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.\n\n### 1. Initial Dilution of Acetic Acid\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n*   **Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH):**\n    Volume × Concentration = 0.02000 L × 0.05 M = 0.001 mol\n*   **New volume of the solution:**\n    20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L\n*   **New concentration of acetic acid:**\n    Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M\n\n### 2. Titration Reaction\n\nAcetic acid, a weak acid, reacts with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base, in a neutralization reaction:\nCH₃COOH(aq) + NaOH(aq) → CH₃COONa(aq) + H₂O(l)\n\n### 3. Volume of NaOH at Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid.\n*   **Moles of acetic acid:** 0.001 mol\n*   **Volume of NaOH needed:**\n    Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n### 4. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH, forming its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This creates a buffer solution. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.\n\n*   **Ratio of conjugate base to acid:** At this point, 25% of the acid is converted to the conjugate base, and 75% remains. The ratio [CH₃COO⁻]/[CH₃COOH] is 25/75 = 1/3.\n*   **pKa of acetic acid:** The Ka is given as 1.85x10⁻⁵.\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85x10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   **Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:** pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])\n    pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.73 - 0.48\n    pH ≈ 4.25\n\nRounding to two decimal places gives a pH of **4.26**.\n\n### 5. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution now contains the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻), which is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water, producing hydroxide ions (OH⁻).\n\n*   **Total volume of the solution:**\n    40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n*   **Concentration of acetate ([CH₃COO⁻]):**\n    Initial moles of acid / Total volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M\n*   **Hydrolysis of acetate:**\n    CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n*   **Calculate Kb for acetate:** We use the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0x10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C) and the Ka of acetic acid.\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0x10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85x10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41x10⁻¹⁰\n*   **Calculate [OH⁻]:** We set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis.\n    Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    Let x = [OH⁻] = [CH₃COOH].\n    5.41x10⁻¹⁰ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n    Since Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n    x² ≈ (5.41x10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.082x10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.082x10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29x10⁻⁶ M\n*   **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29x10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are a pH of 4.26 at 25% titration and 8.52 at the equivalence point.\n\n<<<C>>>"
