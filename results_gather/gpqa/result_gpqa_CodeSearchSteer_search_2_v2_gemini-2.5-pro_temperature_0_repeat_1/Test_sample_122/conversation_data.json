    "To solve this problem, we must use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n### 1. Identify the Given Information:\n*   **Relative velocity (v):** The ejecta and the center of the Galaxy are moving relative to each other at 60,000 km/s.\n*   **Proper time (Δt₀):** The time that passes in the ejecta's reference frame is 50 seconds. This is the \"proper time\" because it's the time measured by an observer in the moving frame.\n*   **Speed of light (c):** For this calculation, we can approximate the speed of light as 300,000 km/s.\n\n### 2. Determine the Goal:\nThe question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame. To find this, we need to know two things from the Galaxy's perspective:\n*   The velocity of the ejecta (which is given as v = 60,000 km/s).\n*   The time elapsed on a clock in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).\n\n### 3. Apply the Time Dilation Formula:\nAccording to the theory of special relativity, an observer in a stationary reference frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval for an event occurring in a moving reference frame (the ejecta) than the observer in the moving frame. This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n\nThe formula for time dilation is:\nΔt = γ * Δt₀\n\nWhere:\n*   **Δt** is the time measured in the stationary frame (the Galaxy).\n*   **Δt₀** is the proper time measured in the moving frame (the ejecta), which is 50 s.\n*   **γ** (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):\nThe Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nFirst, let's find the ratio of the ejecta's velocity to the speed of light:\nv/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n\nNow, substitute this into the Lorentz factor formula:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)\n\n### 5. Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):\nNow we can calculate the time that has passed in the Galaxy's reference frame:\nΔt = (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s\n\n### 6. Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame:\nThe distance traveled is the velocity multiplied by the time elapsed in the same reference frame.\nDistance = v * Δt\nDistance = 60,000 km/s * [(1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s]\nDistance = (60,000 * 50) / √(0.96) km\nDistance = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) km\n\nTo get the final value, we can use the binomial approximation for (1-x)ⁿ when x is small, which is ≈ 1 + nx. Here, our expression is (1 - 0.04)⁻¹/², so x=0.04 and n=-1/2.\n1 / √(0.96) = (1 - 0.04)⁻¹/² ≈ 1 + (-1/2) * (-0.04) = 1 + 0.02 = 1.02\n\nNow, multiply this by the non-relativistic distance:\nDistance ≈ 3,000,000 km * 1.02 = 3,060,000 km.\n\nA precise calculation gives:\nDistance = 3,000,000 / 0.97979... ≈ 3,061,862 km.\n\nThis value is extremely close to 3,060,000 km.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame is approximately 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<A>>>"
