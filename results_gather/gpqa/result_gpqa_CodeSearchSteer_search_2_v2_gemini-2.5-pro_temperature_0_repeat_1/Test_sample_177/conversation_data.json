    "To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ and the renormalizability of the theory, we will analyze the given Lagrangian term using dimensional analysis in a 4-dimensional spacetime, using natural units where ħ = c = 1.\n\n1.  **Mass Dimension of the Lagrangian Density (\\(\\mathcal{L}\\))**: The action, S = ∫d⁴x \\(\\mathcal{L}\\), must be dimensionless. Since the spacetime volume element d⁴x has a mass dimension of [M]⁻⁴, the Lagrangian density \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) must have a mass dimension of [M]⁴ to compensate.\n\n2.  **Mass Dimension of the Fermion Field (ψ)**: The kinetic term for a fermion field in the Lagrangian is \\(\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu\\psi\\). For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, we have:\n    [\\(\\bar{\\psi}\\)] + [∂μ] + [ψ] = 4.\n    The derivative ∂μ has a mass dimension of [M]¹. The fields ψ and \\(\\bar{\\psi}\\) have the same mass dimension. Therefore, 2[ψ] + 1 = 4, which gives the mass dimension of the fermion field as [ψ] = 3/2.\n\n3.  **Mass Dimension of the Field Strength Tensor (F<sup>μν</sup>)**: The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is proportional to F<sub>μν</sub>F<sup>μν</sup>. For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, we have:\n    2[F<sup>μν</sup>] = 4, which means the mass dimension of the field strength tensor is [F<sup>μν</sup>] = 2.\n\n4.  **Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant (κ)**: Now we analyze the interaction term \\(\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}\\). The tensor \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is a dimensionless combination of gamma matrices. The total mass dimension of this term must be 4.\n    [\\(\\mathcal{L}_{int}\\)] = [κ] + [\\(\\bar{\\psi}\\)] + [ψ] + [F<sup>μν</sup>] = 4.\n    Substituting the known dimensions:\n    [κ] + 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 4.\n    [κ] + 3 + 2 = 4.\n    [κ] + 5 = 4.\n    Therefore, the mass dimension of κ is [κ] = -1.\n\n5.  **Renormalizability of the Theory**: The renormalizability of a quantum field theory is related to the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n    *   If the coupling constant has a positive mass dimension, the theory is super-renormalizable.\n    *   If the coupling constant is dimensionless (mass dimension 0), the theory is renormalizable.\n    *   If the coupling constant has a negative mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nSince the mass dimension of κ is -1, the theory is not renormalizable. This means that as we go to higher orders in perturbation theory, new types of divergences appear that cannot be absorbed by a finite number of counterterms, rendering the theory unpredictive at high energies.\n\nCombining our findings, the mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable.\n\n<<<C>>>"
