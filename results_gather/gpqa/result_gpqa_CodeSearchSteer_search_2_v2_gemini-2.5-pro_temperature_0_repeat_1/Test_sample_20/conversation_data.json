    "**A) Analysis of Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible isomers. In the context of keto-enol tautomerism, it typically requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen atom (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) that can migrate to the carbonyl oxygen.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone:** This molecule lacks alpha-hydrogens. The hydrogen atoms are attached to the double-bonded carbons of the ring (vinylic hydrogens). Shifting these hydrogens would lead to a highly unstable structure with cumulated double bonds within the ring. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has alpha-hydrogens located on the carbons between the carbonyl groups. It readily undergoes keto-enol tautomerism to form its enol tautomer, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). This enol form is particularly stable because it is aromatic.\n\nThus, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**B) Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center, a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure of this molecule, also known as methyl lactate, features a central carbon atom (at position 2) bonded to four distinct groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). This carbon is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral and capable of exhibiting optical isomerism as two enantiomers (R and S forms).\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the trans-isomer of butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. It possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the carbon-carbon double bond. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and cannot have a non-superimposable mirror image. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nThus, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nCombining these findings, A is benzoquinone and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
