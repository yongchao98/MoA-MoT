    "To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the wavelength of the emitted light.**\n    The relationship between energy (E), Planck's constant (h), the speed of light (c), and wavelength (λ) is given by the formula E = hc/λ. A convenient form of this equation for calculations involving energy in electron volts (eV) and wavelength in nanometers (nm) is:\n    λ (nm) = 1240 / E (eV)\n\n    Given the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV:\n    λ = 1240 / 2.3393 eV ≈ 530 nm\n\n2.  **Determine the color of the emitted light.**\n    We can find the color corresponding to a wavelength of 530 nm by looking at the visible light spectrum. A wavelength of 530 nm falls into the green region of the spectrum. Therefore, the textile dye emits green light.\n\n3.  **Relate the emitted light to the absorbed light.**\n    The process described is fluorescence, where a molecule absorbs a photon of light, and then emits a photon with less energy (a longer wavelength). This energy loss between absorption and emission is known as the Stokes shift. For the dye to emit green light (≈ 530 nm), it must first absorb light with a higher energy, which corresponds to a shorter wavelength.\n\n4.  **Identify the color of the absorbed light.**\n    We need to find a color that has a shorter wavelength (and thus higher energy) than green light (≈ 530 nm). Let's examine the options based on their approximate wavelengths in the visible spectrum:\n    *   **Violet:** ~380–450 nm (Higher energy than green)\n    *   **Blue:** ~450–495 nm (Higher energy than green)\n    *   **Yellow:** ~570–590 nm (Lower energy than green)\n    *   **Red:** ~620–750 nm (Lower energy than green)\n\n    Based on the principle of fluorescence, the absorbed light must be either blue or violet.\n\n5.  **Consider the complementary color concept.**\n    The color an object appears by reflecting light is the complementary color of the light it absorbs. For instance, a substance that absorbs red light appears green. However, in the case of light emission (fluorescence), the color we see is the color of the light being emitted directly. The rule of complementary colors does not apply to the relationship between absorbed and emitted light in fluorescence. The fundamental principle is that the absorbed energy must be greater than the emitted energy.\n\n6.  **Conclusion.**\n    Since the dye emits green light, it must absorb light of a higher energy. Both blue and violet light have higher energy than green light. A common example of this process is the dye fluorescein, which absorbs blue light and emits green light. Therefore, blue is a very plausible color for the absorbed light.\n\nBased on the analysis, the organic compound must absorb light with a higher energy than the green light it emits. From the given choices, blue light fits this requirement.\n\n<<<A>>>"
