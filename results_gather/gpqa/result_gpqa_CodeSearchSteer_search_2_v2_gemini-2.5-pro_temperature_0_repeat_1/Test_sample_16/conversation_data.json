    "To determine the concentration of calcium ions, we need to consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the following equilibrium:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe formation constant (K_f) for this reaction is given as:\nK_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nWe are starting with a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. The complex will dissociate slightly into its constituent ions. Let's set up an equilibrium table for the dissociation reaction: [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n| | [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ | [Ca²⁺] | [EDTA⁴⁻] |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Initial** | 0.02 M | 0 M | 0 M |\n| **Change** | -x | +x | +x |\n| **Equilibrium**| 0.02 - x | x | x |\n\nNow, we substitute these equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\nK_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nBecause the formation constant (K_f) is very large, the dissociation will be minimal. This means that 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can simplify the expression by approximating (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\n5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nNow, we can solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺ ions:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions in the solution is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\nB) 2.0x10⁻² M\nC) 5.0x10⁻³ M\nD) 1.0x10⁻² M\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
