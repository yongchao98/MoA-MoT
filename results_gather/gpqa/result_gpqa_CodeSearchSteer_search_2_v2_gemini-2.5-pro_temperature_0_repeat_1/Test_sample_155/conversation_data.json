    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a trans-alkene. When treated with mCPBA, it undergoes a syn-addition to form a trans-epoxide. Because the starting material is achiral and the reaction can occur from either face of the double bond, a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides is formed: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The epoxide mixture is then treated with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This is an Sₙ2-like ring-opening reaction that proceeds via backside attack by the water nucleophile. This anti-addition results in the inversion of stereochemistry at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n    *   Attack on (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane leads to (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack on (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane leads to (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 1:** The two products, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, are actually the same achiral meso compound. Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a cis-alkene. Its reaction with mCPBA is also a syn-addition, which results in a cis-epoxide. This product, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane, is a meso compound.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The meso-epoxide is then opened by aqueous acid. The water nucleophile can attack either of the two carbons of the epoxide ring from the opposite face.\n    *   Attack at one carbon results in the formation of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon results in the formation of (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 2:** The two products, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers. Since the reaction starts with an achiral reagent and proceeds through an achiral intermediate under achiral conditions, they are formed in equal amounts, yielding a **racemic mixture**.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n*   **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n*   **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n*   **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso compound is a diastereomer of the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers.\n\n### **Chromatographic Observation**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Standard HPLC columns separate compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity but cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   Consequently, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**: one for the meso-diol and a second peak for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S)).\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC columns have a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The column will separate the meso-diol from the enantiomeric pair (as they are diastereomers).\n    *   It will also separate the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, from each other.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **three peaks**: one for the meso-diol, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<D>>>"
