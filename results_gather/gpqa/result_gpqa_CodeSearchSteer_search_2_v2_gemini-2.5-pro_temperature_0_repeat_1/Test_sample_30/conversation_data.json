    "Here is the step-by-step determination of the final product and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\nToluene is treated with a mixture of nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically nitration. The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an ortho-, para-director. Due to less steric hindrance, the major product formed is **para-nitrotoluene**.\n\n*   **Product 1:** *p*-nitrotoluene\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\nProduct 1 (*p*-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is an oxidation reaction. While strong oxidation can convert the methyl group to a carboxylic acid, MnO₂/H₂SO₄ can be used for the milder oxidation of a benzylic methyl group to an aldehyde. For the subsequent reaction with acetone to proceed, an aldehyde is required. Therefore, the methyl group of *p*-nitrotoluene is oxidized to an aldehyde group.\n\n*   **Product 2:** *p*-nitrobenzaldehyde\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\nProduct 2 (*p*-nitrobenzaldehyde) is treated with acetone ((CH₃)₂CO) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, specifically known as the **Claisen-Schmidt condensation**. *p*-Nitrobenzaldehyde has no α-hydrogens, while acetone does. The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from acetone to form an enolate ion. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of *p*-nitrobenzaldehyde. The resulting product dehydrates to form an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n\nSince acetone has α-hydrogens on both sides of the carbonyl group, and two equivalents of the aldehyde are available, a double condensation occurs. The reaction happens on both sides of the acetone molecule.\n\nThe final product is **(1*E*,4*E*)-1,5-bis(4-nitrophenyl)penta-1,4-dien-3-one**.\n\n*   **Product 3:**\n    O₂N-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH=CH-C₆H₄-NO₂\n\n**Step 4: Determination of the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\nTo determine the molecular symmetry group (point group) of (1*E*,4*E*)-1,5-bis(4-nitrophenyl)penta-1,4-dien-3-one, we identify its symmetry elements, assuming the conjugated system is planar:\n\n1.  **Identity (E):** Present in all molecules.\n2.  **Two-fold rotation axis (C₂):** There is a C₂ axis that passes through the carbonyl carbon and oxygen atom. A 180° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n3.  **Center of inversion (i):** The molecule has a center of symmetry located at the carbonyl carbon atom. Inverting any point (x, y, z) through this center to (-x, -y, -z) results in an identical molecule.\n4.  **Horizontal mirror plane (σₙ):** There is a mirror plane perpendicular to the C₂ axis. In this case, it is the plane of the molecule itself.\n\nA molecule that possesses an identity element (E), a single C₂ axis, a center of inversion (i), and a horizontal mirror plane (σₙ) belongs to the **C₂ₙ** point group.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\n*   A) C₃\n*   B) D₂ₙ\n*   C) C₂ₙ\n*   D) Cₛ\n\nThe correct molecular symmetry group is C₂ₙ.\n\n<<<C>>>"
