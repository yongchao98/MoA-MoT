    "The presence of a positive charge, $+q$, inside the cavity of the uncharged spherical conductor induces a negative charge, $-q$, on the inner surface of the cavity and a positive charge, $+q$, on the outer surface of the spherical conductor. This is a consequence of electrostatic induction and the fact that the conductor is electrically neutral.\n\nA key principle of electrostatics is that the electric field inside the material of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is zero. This leads to the phenomenon of electrostatic shielding. The charges on the outer surface of the conductor will distribute themselves in such a way that they cancel the electric field from any charges outside the conductor within the conductor itself. Similarly, the charges on the inner surface of the cavity will arrange themselves to cancel the electric field from the charge $+q$ within the conductor material.\n\nDue to the spherical symmetry of the outer surface of the conductor, the induced positive charge $+q$ will be distributed uniformly over this outer surface. This uniform spherical distribution of charge creates an electric field at any external point as if the entire charge were concentrated at the center of the spherical conductor.\n\nTherefore, for a point P located at a distance $L$ from the center of the spherical conductor (where $L > R$), the electric field is determined solely by the total charge on the outer surface, which is $+q$, and it is treated as a point charge located at the center of the conductor. The details of the cavity's position and size ($r$, $s$, $l$, $\\theta$) are irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor due to this shielding effect.\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
