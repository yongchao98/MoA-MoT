    "The defining characteristic of an effective particle that arises from spontaneously broken symmetry is that it is a Nambu-Goldstone boson (or a pseudo-Goldstone boson if the symmetry is also explicitly broken). According to Goldstone's theorem, the spontaneous breaking of a continuous global symmetry results in the appearance of a massless, spinless particle for each broken generator of the symmetry.\n\n*   **Magnon:** In magnetic materials, the alignment of spins in a specific direction spontaneously breaks the global rotational symmetry. The resulting Goldstone bosons are magnons, which are quanta of spin waves.\n*   **Pion:** In the theory of strong interactions (QCD), the approximate chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken. Pions are the resulting pseudo-Goldstone bosons, which would be massless if the quarks were massless, but have a small mass due to the quarks' actual mass.\n*   **Phonon:** In a crystal, the continuous translational symmetry of free space is broken by the fixed positions of atoms in a lattice. Phonons, the quanta of lattice vibrations, are the Goldstone bosons associated with this broken symmetry.\n*   **Skyrmion:** A skyrmion is a topologically stable, particle-like configuration in a field of vectors, such as the magnetization in a magnetic material. It is classified as a topological soliton. While the existence of skyrmions is often tied to underlying broken symmetries in the material, the skyrmion itself is not the Goldstone boson. The Goldstone boson in a magnetic system that can host skyrmions is the magnon. The skyrmion is a more complex, non-linear excitation, whose stability is guaranteed by its topology, not by Goldstone's theorem directly.\n\nTherefore, the magnon, pion, and phonon are all examples of Goldstone or pseudo-Goldstone bosons that are a direct consequence of spontaneously broken continuous symmetries. The skyrmion, while related to symmetry breaking, is a topological soliton and not a Goldstone boson.\n\n<<<A>>>"
