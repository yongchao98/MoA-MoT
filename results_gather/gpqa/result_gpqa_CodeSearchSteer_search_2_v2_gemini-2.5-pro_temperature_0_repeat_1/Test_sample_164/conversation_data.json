    "C) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n*   **Statement A is incorrect.** While processes exist to make branched polyethylene, the specific \"combined systems\" (tandem catalysis in a single reactor) are a subject of intensive research but are not yet widely implemented on an industrial scale in the US. Industrial production typically involves separate steps for creating the comonomer and for polymerization.\n*   **Statement B is incorrect.** The essential additional step is the oligomerization of ethylene to create alpha-olefins (the branches). Aluminum-based activators, such as methylaluminoxane (MAO) and various alkylaluminum compounds, are widely used and are often essential co-catalysts for this reaction.\n*   **Statement C is correct.** Group VIa includes chromium (Cr). Chromium-based catalysts are well-known and used industrially for the selective oligomerization of ethylene to produce linear alpha-olefins like 1-hexene and 1-octene. These catalysts require activation by specific co-catalysts, often aluminum-based compounds like MAO. This process creates the short-chain branches for the final polymer.\n*   **Statement D is incorrect in the context of being the most accurate statement.** While noble metals like palladium can be used to create branched polyethylene from ethylene, and it is generally known they are expensive, the provided information and general knowledge point to statement C being a well-established and industrially relevant fact. The industrial viability of chromium catalysts for this purpose is a more definitive and correct statement than the economic limitation of noble metals, which is also true but less specific to the core of established industrial chemistry in this area.\n\n<<<C>>>"
