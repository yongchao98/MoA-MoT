    "To determine how many of the listed stars would be detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we must first establish the instrument's detection limit and then assess each star's visibility and brightness from the Paranal Observatory.\n\nA star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 can be achieved in a one-hour exposure using a single 8m Very Large Telescope (VLT) unit. According to the ESPRESSO User Manual and related documentation, this S/N ratio of 10 in a one-hour exposure (3600s) corresponds to an apparent visual magnitude (V) of approximately 17. Therefore, any star with an apparent magnitude of 17.0 or brighter will be considered detectable, provided it is visible from the observatory.\n\nThe Paranal Observatory is located in the Atacama Desert in Chile, at a latitude of approximately 24° South. This southern latitude is crucial for determining which stars are visible in the sky.\n\nHere is an analysis of each star:\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude**: Canopus is the second brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent visual magnitude of about -0.74.\n*   **Visibility**: It is a prominent star in the southern constellation of Carina, with a declination of about -52°. As a southern star, it is easily visible from Paranal's southern latitude.\n*   **Conclusion**: Being much brighter than the V=17 limit and visible from the observatory, **Canopus is detectable**.\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude**: Polaris, the North Star, has an apparent magnitude that varies around 2.0.\n*   **Visibility**: Polaris is located very close to the north celestial pole, with a declination of nearly +89°. Due to its extreme northern declination, it is not visible from the Paranal Observatory in the Southern Hemisphere.\n*   **Conclusion**: Since it is not visible from the observatory's location, **Polaris is not detectable**.\n\n**c) Star with Absolute V magnitude of 15 at 10 pc**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude Calculation**: The apparent magnitude (m) can be calculated from the absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d) in parsecs using the formula: m = M + 5 * log₁₀(d/10).\n    *   m = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(10/10) = 15 + 5 * 0 = 15.0\n*   **Conclusion**: With an apparent magnitude of 15.0, this star is brighter than the V=17 limit. **It is detectable**.\n\n**d) Star with Absolute V magnitude of 15 at 200 pc**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude Calculation**:\n    *   m = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(200/10) = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(20) ≈ 15 + 5 * 1.301 ≈ 21.5\n*   **Conclusion**: With an apparent magnitude of approximately 21.5, this star is much fainter than the V=17 limit. **It is not detectable**.\n\n**e) Star with Absolute V magnitude of 15 at 5 pc**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude Calculation**:\n    *   m = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(5/10) = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(0.5) ≈ 15 + 5 * (-0.301) ≈ 13.5\n*   **Conclusion**: With an apparent magnitude of approximately 13.5, this star is brighter than the V=17 limit. **It is detectable**.\n\n**f) Star with Absolute V magnitude of 15 at 50 pc**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude Calculation**:\n    *   m = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(50/10) = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(5) ≈ 15 + 5 * 0.699 ≈ 18.5\n*   **Conclusion**: With an apparent magnitude of approximately 18.5, this star is fainter than the V=17 limit. **It is not detectable**.\n\nIn summary, the detectable stars are Canopus, the star at 10 pc, and the star at 5 pc. This makes a total of three detectable stars.\n\n<<<A>>>"
