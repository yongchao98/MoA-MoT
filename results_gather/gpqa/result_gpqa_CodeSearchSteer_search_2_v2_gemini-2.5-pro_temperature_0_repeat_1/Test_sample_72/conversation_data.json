    "### Calculation of Relative Speed and Total Energy in a Relativistic System\n\nTo determine the correct option, we must calculate the relative speed of the two astronauts and the total energy of the system using the principles of special relativity.\n\n**1. Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nSince the astronauts are moving at relativistic speeds in the same direction, we use the Einstein velocity subtraction formula to find their relative speed. The formula is:\n\nv_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂) / c²)\n\nWhere:\n*   v₁ is the velocity of the first astronaut = 0.6c\n*   v₂ is the velocity of the second astronaut = 0.5c\n*   c is the speed of light\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3c² / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\n**v_rel ≈ 0.1429c**\n\nThis result, approximately 0.14c, is consistent with the relativistic principle that relative velocities do not simply add or subtract linearly at high speeds.\n\n**2. Total Energy (E_total)**\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic system is the sum of the total energies of its individual components. The total energy (E) of a single particle is given by the equation E = γmc², where γ (the Lorentz factor) is calculated as γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n\n**For the first astronaut (mass 2m, velocity 0.6c):**\n\n*   First, we calculate the Lorentz factor (γ₁):\n    γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)² / c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √0.64 = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n*   Next, we calculate the energy (E₁):\n    E₁ = γ₁ * (2m) * c² = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc²\n\n**For the second astronaut (mass 3m, velocity 0.5c):**\n\n*   First, we calculate the Lorentz factor (γ₂):\n    γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)² / c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √0.75 ≈ 1 / 0.866 = 1.1547\n*   Next, we calculate the energy (E₂):\n    E₂ = γ₂ * (3m) * c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m * c² ≈ 3.464 mc²\n\n**Total Energy of the System (E_total):**\n\n*   E_total = E₁ + E₂\n*   E_total = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc²\n*   **E_total ≈ 5.964 mc²**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately 0.14c, and the total energy of the system is approximately 5.96 mc². Comparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc²\n*   B) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc²\n*   C) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc²\n*   D) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc²\n\nThe values in option B match our calculations.\n\n<<<B>>>"
