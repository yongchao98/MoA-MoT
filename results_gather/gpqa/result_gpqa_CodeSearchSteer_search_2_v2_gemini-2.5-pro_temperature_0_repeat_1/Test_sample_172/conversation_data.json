    "To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of the electron, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp)**:\n    According to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the relationship between the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) is given by:\n    Δx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n\n    Given that the uncertainty in the electron's location is Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m, we can calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum:\n    Δp ≈ ħ / (2 * Δx)\n    Δp ≈ (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m)\n    Δp ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\n2.  **Relate the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) to the uncertainty in momentum (Δp)**:\n    For a particle, the relationship between the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in momentum can be approximated by:\n    ΔE ≈ v * Δp\n    where v is the velocity of the particle. This relationship arises from the relativistic energy-momentum equation, E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)², where the derivative of energy with respect to momentum (dE/dp) is the particle's velocity.\n\n3.  **Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE)**:\n    Using the given speed of the electron, v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s, and the calculated uncertainty in momentum, we can estimate the minimum uncertainty in energy:\n    ΔE ≈ (2 x 10⁸ m/s) * (5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s)\n    ΔE ≈ 10.54 x 10⁻¹⁷ J\n    ΔE ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\nB) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\nC) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\nD) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J is closest to 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n<<<C>>>"
