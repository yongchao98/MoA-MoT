    "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, let's analyze each option:\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** By definition, this planet has the same average density as Earth, which is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly stated as being about 5.5 g/cm³, which is comparable to Earth's density.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** For planets with the same basic composition, the more massive the planet, the greater its gravitational pull on its own material. This increased gravity compresses the material, leading to a higher overall density. Therefore, a planet that is five times more massive than Earth, but made of the same \"stuff,\" will be significantly denser than Earth due to this compression.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Conversely, a planet with less mass will have weaker self-gravity and therefore experience less internal compression. This would result in a lower average density compared to Earth.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the options, the planet in option (c) will be the densest. While options (a) and (b) have densities similar to Earth's, and option (d) would be less dense, the 5-Earth-mass planet's powerful gravity would compress its material to a much higher density.\n\n<<<C>>>"
