    "To correctly identify the unknown compound, a detailed analysis of the provided ¹H NMR data is necessary. The data points to a specific isomer among the choices by revealing the connectivity and spatial arrangement of the protons in the molecule.\n\n### Analysis of the ¹H NMR Data:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal is a singlet, meaning the three protons are equivalent and not coupled to any neighboring protons. This is characteristic of the methyl protons of an acetate group (CH₃-C=O). All four possible compounds are acetates, so this signal is expected in all of them.\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal is a doublet, indicating that these three equivalent protons (a methyl group) are coupled to a single adjacent proton. This corresponds to a methyl group attached to a double bond, specifically on a `CH` group (i.e., =CH-CH₃).\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal, a doublet of quartets, is for a single proton. The quartet splitting arises from coupling to the adjacent methyl group at 1.6 ppm (three protons). The doublet splitting arises from coupling to another single proton across the double bond. This pattern is characteristic of a proton in a `-CH=CH-CH₃` fragment.\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This signal is for a single proton and appears as a doublet due to coupling with one other proton. The chemical shift (7.0 ppm) is downfield, which is typical for a vinyl proton attached to an oxygen atom (-O-CH=). Most importantly, the coupling constant (J) of 16.0 Hz is a key indicator of the alkene's geometry.\n\n### Determining the Structure:\n\n1.  **Backbone Identification:** The combination of the acetate singlet (2.1 ppm), the vinyl methyl doublet (1.6 ppm), and the two distinct vinyl protons (5.5 and 7.0 ppm) strongly suggests a propenyl acetate structure (CH₃COOCH=CHCH₃). A butenyl acetate structure would present a different set of signals, likely involving additional methylene (-CH₂-) protons and different splitting patterns.\n\n2.  **Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):** The coupling constant between vinyl protons is highly dependent on their relative orientation.\n    *   *Trans* protons typically show a large coupling constant, in the range of 11-18 Hz.\n    *   *Cis* protons show a smaller coupling constant, usually between 6-15 Hz.\n\nThe observed coupling constant is **J = 16.0 Hz**, which falls squarely within the expected range for a *trans* configuration. This large value indicates that the two protons on the double bond are on opposite sides.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe ¹H NMR data, particularly the splitting patterns and the large coupling constant of 16.0 Hz, are fully consistent with the structure of **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
