    "Assuming a uniform spatial distribution of stars, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the parallax.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of this relationship:\n\n1.  **Uniform Star Distribution**: If we assume stars are uniformly distributed, it means that the number of stars per unit volume is a constant. Let's denote this constant stellar density by ρ.\n\n2.  **Number of Stars in a Volume**: The number of stars, N, within a given volume, V, is therefore N = ρV.\n\n3.  **Volume of a Spherical Shell**: We are interested in the number of stars at a certain distance, d.  Let's consider a thin spherical shell of radius d and thickness dd. The volume of this shell, dV, is approximately its surface area (4πd²) multiplied by its thickness (dd):\n    dV = 4πd² dd\n\n4.  **Number of Stars in the Shell**: The number of stars, dN, within this thin shell is the stellar density multiplied by the volume of the shell:\n    dN = ρ * 4πd² dd\n\n5.  **Relating Distance and Parallax**: The parallax of a star, plx, is inversely proportional to its distance, d. For small angles, this relationship is given by:\n    d = 1/plx\n\n6.  **Relating Differentials**: To express the number of stars in terms of parallax, we need to find the relationship between the thickness of the shell, dd, and the corresponding small range of parallax, d(plx). We can do this by differentiating the distance equation with respect to parallax:\n    dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²\n\n    The negative sign indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. Since we are interested in the number of stars in a given range, we can consider the magnitude:\n    dd = (1/plx²) d(plx)\n\n7.  **Substituting into the Number of Stars Equation**: Now we substitute the expressions for d and dd in terms of plx into our equation for dN:\n    dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx)\n\n8.  **Simplifying the Expression**:\n    dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) d(plx)\n\n9.  **Number of Stars per Unit Parallax**: The quantity dN/d(plx) represents the number of stars per unit range of parallax. From the equation above, we can see that:\n    dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴.\n\n<<<B>>>"
