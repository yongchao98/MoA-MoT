    "To eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar, the most effective mutation would be one that completely disrupts the function of the gene responsible for its synthesis. Let's analyze the impact of each mutation on the gene sequence.\n\nThe intact gene begins with the sequence `5’-ATG TTT CTC...`, which translates to Methionine (start codon), Phenylalanine, and Leucine. The goal is to introduce a change that stops the protein from being made correctly.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** The sequence `5’-ATG TTC TAC...` changes the third codon from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a missense mutation, which substitutes one amino acid for another. While this might alter the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** The sequence `5’-ATG TTC TAA...` changes the third codon from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAA`. `TAA` is a stop codon. This type of mutation is called a nonsense mutation. It signals the cell to stop protein synthesis prematurely, resulting in a severely shortened and likely non-functional protein. This is the most probable way to eliminate the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** This sequence contains multiple changes, resulting in several amino acid substitutions (missense mutations). While the cumulative effect of these changes might disrupt the protein, it is less certain than the definitive truncation caused by a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** The sequence `5’-ATG TTT TAC...` changes the third codon from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). Similar to Mutant 1, this is a missense mutation that results in a single amino acid change. This is unlikely to be as effective as the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\nTherefore, Mutant 2 is the most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound because it introduces a premature stop codon, halting protein production.\n\n<<<D>>>"
