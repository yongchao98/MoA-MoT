    "To determine the ratio of neutrino fluxes, we must first understand which solar reactions produce neutrinos in the specified energy bands and how the hypothetical stoppage of the pp-III branch affects them.\n\n### Solar Neutrino Sources and Energy Bands\n\nThe Sun produces neutrinos through several reactions in the proton-proton (pp) chain and the CNO cycle. The key reactions relevant to this problem are:\n\n1.  **pp-II Branch**: This branch involves the electron capture of Beryllium-7 (`⁷Be`). This reaction is part of the pp-II branch, which is assumed to continue functioning normally. It produces mono-energetic neutrinos, with the vast majority (about 90%) having an energy of **861 keV (0.861 MeV)**. This prominent spectral line falls squarely within **band 2 (800-900 keV)**.\n\n2.  **pp-III Branch**: This branch produces Boron-8 (`⁸B`), which then beta-decays. This decay is the defining source of neutrinos for the pp-III branch. It emits neutrinos with a continuous energy spectrum that extends up to about 15 MeV. These `⁸B` neutrinos contribute to the flux across a wide range of energies, including both band 1 (700-800 keV) and band 2 (800-900 keV).\n\n### Impact of Stopping the pp-III Branch\n\nThe problem states that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped. This means the production of `⁸B` ceases, and consequently, the flux of `⁸B` neutrinos disappears. We are observing the Sun from Earth about 8.5 minutes later, which is the travel time for neutrinos, so we would see this effect immediately.\n\nLet's analyze the flux in each band under this new condition:\n\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):** The primary contributor to this energy band is the continuous spectrum of `⁸B` neutrinos. Other significant neutrino sources, like the `pp` neutrinos (<420 keV) and the main `⁷Be` line (861 keV), fall outside this band. With the `⁸B` neutrinos gone, there are no other major sources of neutrinos in the 700-800 keV range. Therefore, the flux in this band becomes effectively zero.\n\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):** Before the change, this band received flux from both `⁸B` neutrinos and `⁷Be` neutrinos. After the pp-III branch stops, the `⁸B` contribution vanishes. However, the pp-II branch is unaffected, so the strong, mono-energetic neutrino line from `⁷Be` decay at 861 keV remains. This means a significant neutrino flux persists in this band.\n\n### Calculating the Flux Ratio\n\nWe need to find the ratio: Flux (band 1) / Flux (band 2).\n\n*   **Numerator (Flux in band 1):**  Approximately 0.\n*   **Denominator (Flux in band 2):** A significant, non-zero value from the `⁷Be` neutrinos.\n\nThe ratio is therefore approximately 0 / (non-zero value) ≈ 0.\n\nLooking at the given options:\nA) 0.01 (10⁻²)\nB) 10\nC) 1\nD) 0.1 (10⁻¹)\n\nThe value closest to zero is 0.01.\n\n<<<A>>>"
