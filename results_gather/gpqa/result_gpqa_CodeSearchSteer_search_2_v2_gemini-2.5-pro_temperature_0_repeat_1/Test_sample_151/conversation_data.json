    "When yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* is treated with a mating pheromone, it undergoes several physiological changes, including arresting its cell cycle in the G1 phase and forming a projection called a shmoo. This G1 arrest is crucial for preparing the cell for mating. The experiment described aims to analyze the proteome of *active chromatin*, which refers to regions of the genome that are being actively transcribed into RNA.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the protein complexes in question and their expected presence in the active chromatin of a shmoo:\n\n*   **A) Pre-initiation complex (PIC):** This complex, which includes RNA polymerase and various transcription factors, assembles at the promoters of genes to initiate transcription. Since the pheromone response involves significant changes in the expression of about 200 genes, the PIC would be abundant in active chromatin regions.\n*   **B) Enhancer protein complex:** Enhancers are DNA sequences that bind proteins (activators) to increase the transcription of specific genes. These complexes are integral to regulating the active gene expression required for shmoo formation and would be found in the active chromatin.\n*   **D) Nucleosome histone complex:** Nucleosomes are the fundamental building blocks of all chromatin, both active and inactive. They consist of DNA wrapped around histone proteins. Therefore, these complexes will be ubiquitously recovered in any chromatin immunoprecipitation assay.\n\n*   **C) Pre-replication complex (pre-RC):** This complex assembles on DNA at origins of replication during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Its function is to \"license\" the DNA, making it competent for replication during the subsequent S phase. However, the pheromone response pathway actively arrests the cell cycle in G1, *before* the cell commits to DNA replication. The cell's machinery is focused on transcription for mating, not DNA duplication. While the pre-RC is assembled in G1, the cell is prevented from entering S phase where this complex would become active. Therefore, compared to the complexes directly involved in the highly active process of transcription (PIC and enhancers) or the fundamental structural components of chromatin (nucleosomes), the pre-replication complex is the least associated with the *active* functions of chromatin in a G1-arrested shmoo.\n\n<<<C>>>"
