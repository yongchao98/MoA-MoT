    "The search results confirm the formulas I used.\n\n1.  **Exoplanet Transit Depth:** The dimming caused by a transiting exoplanet, known as the transit depth, is equal to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius.\n    *   Transit Depth (Amplitude) = (R_pl / R_star)^2\n\n2.  **Starspot Light Curve Modulation:** The brightness variation of a star due to spots is caused by the contrast in temperature (and therefore flux) between the normal photosphere and the cooler, darker spots. The total flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted and spotted areas. The amplitude of the variation depends on the spot filling factor and the temperature difference.\n\nMy derivation for the amplitude caused by the spots is:\n*   Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n*   F_max is the flux from the unspotted hemisphere, proportional to T_eff^4.\n*   F_min is the flux from the spotted hemisphere, proportional to (1-f) * T_eff^4 + f * T_spot^4.\n*   This leads to: Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4).\n\nThis approach is physically sound and consistent with the principles described in the search results.\n\nThe calculation was:\n*   f = 0.20\n*   T_eff = 6000 K\n*   T_spot = 5000 K\n*   Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5000/6000)^4) ≈ 0.10355\n*   (R_pl / R_star)^2 = 0.10355\n*   R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis matches option A. The most common error would be to forget the square root and choose option C (~0.11), which represents the transit depth, not the radius ratio. The question explicitly asks for the radius ratio, Rpl/Rstar.\n\nThe logic and calculations are confirmed. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\n### Final check of the steps:\n1.  **Identify the goal:** Find the exoplanet-to-star radius ratio (Rpl/Rstar) that mimics the light curve amplitude of a spotted star.\n2.  **Model the spotted star's light curve amplitude:**\n    *   Maximum flux (F_max) is from the unspotted hemisphere, proportional to T_star⁴.\n    *   Minimum flux (F_min) is from the spotted hemisphere. Its flux is a weighted average of the spot and photosphere temperatures: F_min ∝ (1-f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴.\n    *   Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max = f * (1 - (T_spot/T_star)⁴).\n3.  **Model the exoplanet transit amplitude (depth):**\n    *   Amplitude = (Rpl/Rstar)².\n4.  **Equate the two amplitudes and solve for Rpl/Rstar:**\n    *   (Rpl/Rstar)² = f * (1 - (T_spot/T_star)⁴)\n    *   Rpl/Rstar = sqrt[ f * (1 - (T_spot/T_star)⁴) ]\n5.  **Plug in the numbers:**\n    *   f = 0.20\n    *   T_star = 6000 K\n    *   T_spot = 5000 K\n    *   Rpl/Rstar = sqrt[ 0.20 * (1 - (5000/6000)⁴) ]\n    *   Rpl/Rstar = sqrt[ 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴) ]\n    *   Rpl/Rstar = sqrt[ 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225) ]\n    *   Rpl/Rstar = sqrt[ 0.20 * 0.51775 ]\n    *   Rpl/Rstar = sqrt[ 0.10355 ]\n    *   Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.3218\n\nThe result is robustly ~0.32.\n\nFinal answer is A. To produce the same amplitude signal as the spotted star, a hypothetical exoplanet would need a radius that is approximately 32% of the star's radius. This is a very large planet, often referred to as a \"super-Jupiter\" or even a brown dwarf, highlighting how significant the effect of large-scale starspots can be on stellar light curves.\n\nThe calculation is complete and verified. I will now format the final answer.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to equate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the starspots with the dimming caused by a transiting exoplanet.\n\n**1. Calculate the flux variation due to starspots.**\n\nThe flux (F) emitted by a surface is proportional to the fourth power of its effective temperature (T), according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law (F ∝ T⁴). We are interested in the relative change in flux, so we can work with intensities (I ∝ T⁴).\n\n*   The intensity of the unspotted photosphere is I_phot ∝ T_eff⁴ = 6000⁴.\n*   The intensity of the cool spots is I_spot ∝ T_spot⁴ = (6000 - 1000)⁴ = 5000⁴.\n\nThe star's rotation causes us to see either the unspotted hemisphere or the spotted one.\n*   The maximum flux (F_max) occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is visible: F_max ∝ I_phot.\n*   The minimum flux (F_min) occurs when the spotted hemisphere is visible. This hemisphere has 20% (filling factor f = 0.2) of its area covered by spots and 80% (1 - f) by the normal photosphere.\n    F_min ∝ (1 - f) * I_phot + f * I_spot\n    F_min ∝ 0.80 * 6000⁴ + 0.20 * 5000⁴\n\nThe amplitude of the light curve variation is the relative change in flux:\nAmplitude_spots = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\nAmplitude_spots = (I_phot - [(1 - f) * I_phot + f * I_spot]) / I_phot\nAmplitude_spots = (f * I_phot - f * I_spot) / I_phot\nAmplitude_spots = f * (1 - I_spot / I_phot)\nAmplitude_spots = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)\n\nPlugging in the values:\nAmplitude_spots = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)\nAmplitude_spots = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)\nAmplitude_spots = 0.20 * (1 - 625 / 1296)\nAmplitude_spots = 0.20 * (671 / 1296)\nAmplitude_spots ≈ 0.20 * 0.51775\nAmplitude_spots ≈ 0.10355\n\n**2. Calculate the equivalent exoplanet radius.**\n\nThe dimming caused by a transiting exoplanet (the transit depth) is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. This is equivalent to the square of the ratio of their radii.\nAmplitude_planet = (Area_planet / Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n**3. Equate the amplitudes and solve for the radius ratio (R_pl / R_star).**\n\nTo produce the same signal, the amplitudes must be equal:\n(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude_spots\n(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355\n\nNow, we solve for the radius ratio by taking the square root:\nR_pl / R_star = √0.10355\nR_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~0.32\nB) ~0.07\nC) ~0.11\nD) ~0.39\n\nThe calculated value matches option A. It is important to note that option C (~0.11) corresponds to the amplitude of the signal itself ((R_pl/R_star)²), not the radius ratio.\n\nFinal Answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>To determine the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same photometric signal as the described starspots, we must first calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots and then equate it to the transit depth of an exoplanet.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Light Curve Amplitude from Starspots\n\nThe flux (brightness) of a star is proportional to the fourth power of its effective temperature (T), as described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The rotational modulation will cause the star's observed flux to vary between a maximum (when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer) and a minimum (when the spotted hemisphere is in view).\n\n1.  **Define Temperatures and Filling Factor:**\n    *   Effective temperature of the star (T_eff) = 6000 K\n    *   Temperature of the spots (T_spot) = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n    *   Filling factor of spots on the active hemisphere (f) = 20% = 0.20\n\n2.  **Calculate Relative Flux:**\n    *   The maximum flux (F_max) is proportional to the flux from the unspotted photosphere:  \n        F_max ∝ T_eff⁴\n    *   The minimum flux (F_min) is a weighted average of the flux from the spotted (20%) and unspotted (80%) parts of the visible hemisphere:  \n        F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴\n\n3.  **Determine the Amplitude:**\n    The amplitude of the signal is the relative drop in flux:\n    Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max  \n    Amplitude = (T_eff⁴ - [(1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴]) / T_eff⁴  \n    Amplitude = (f * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴  \n    Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)\n\n4.  **Substitute the values:**\n    Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)  \n    Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)  \n    Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - 625 / 1296)  \n    Amplitude = 0.20 * (671 / 1296)  \n    Amplitude ≈ 0.20 * 0.51775  \n    Amplitude ≈ 0.10355\n\nSo, the star's brightness varies by approximately 10.36% due to the spots.\n\n### Step 2: Relate Amplitude to Exoplanet Radius\n\nThe dimming of a star's light during an exoplanet transit (known as the transit depth) is equal to the ratio of the planet's cross-sectional area to the star's cross-sectional area. This simplifies to the square of the ratio of their radii (R_pl / R_star).\n\nTransit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\nTo produce the same signal, the transit depth must equal the amplitude from the starspots:\n(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355\n\n### Step 3: Solve for the Relative Radius (R_pl / R_star)\n\nWe take the square root of the amplitude to find the required radius ratio:\nR_pl / R_star = √0.10355  \nR_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<A>>>"
