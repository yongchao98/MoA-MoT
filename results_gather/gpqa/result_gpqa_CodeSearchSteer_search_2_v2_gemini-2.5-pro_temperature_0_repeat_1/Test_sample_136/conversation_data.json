    "To determine the number of revolutions a proton makes in a synchrocyclotron to reach a specific kinetic energy, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the energy gained per revolution:** In a synchrocyclotron, a particle is accelerated twice during each full turn as it crosses the gap between the \"dee\" electrodes. The energy gained in each crossing depends on the accelerating voltage `U(t)` at that instant. The problem provides the formula for the voltage as `U(t) = U₀ cos[2πν(α)t + Φ₀]`. The term `Φ₀` represents the synchronous phase, which is the phase of the RF voltage when the proton crosses the gap.\n\n    The energy gained in a single crossing is `ΔE = q * U = e * U₀ * cos(Φ₀)`, where `e` is the elementary charge of the proton. Since the proton is accelerated twice per revolution, the total energy gained in one revolution is:\n    `ΔT_rev = 2 * e * U₀ * cos(Φ₀)`\n\n2.  **Substitute the given values:**\n    *   The peak voltage is `U₀ = 190 kV = 190 * 10³ V`.\n    *   The synchronous phase is `Φ₀ = π/4`.\n    *   The charge of the proton `e` is used to express the energy in electron-volts (eV).\n\n    The energy gain per revolution in eV is:\n    `ΔT_rev = 2 * (190 * 10³ eV) * cos(π/4)`\n    `ΔT_rev = 380,000 * (1/√2) eV`\n\n3.  **Calculate the total number of revolutions:** The total kinetic energy the proton needs to gain is `T_final = 950 MeV = 950 * 10⁶ eV`, starting from negligible energy. The number of revolutions `N` is the total energy gained divided by the energy gained per revolution.\n\n    `N = T_final / ΔT_rev`\n    `N = (950 * 10⁶ eV) / (380 * 10³ * (1/√2) eV)`\n    `N = (950 * 1000 * √2) / 380`\n\n4.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    `N = (95000 / 38) * √2`\n    Since `95 / 38 = 2.5`, we have:\n    `N = (2.5 * 1000) * √2`\n    `N = 2500 * √2`\n\n5.  **Compute the final value:**\n    Using the approximation `√2 ≈ 1.4142`:\n    `N ≈ 2500 * 1.4142`\n    `N ≈ 3535.5`\n\nSince the number of revolutions must be a whole number, the proton must complete 3536 revolutions to reach or exceed the target energy of 950 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
