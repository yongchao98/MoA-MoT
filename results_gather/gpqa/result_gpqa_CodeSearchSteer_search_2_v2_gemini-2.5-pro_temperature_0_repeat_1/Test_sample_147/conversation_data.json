    "The search results point towards Krypton (Kr) as element Y. Let's verify this with the given information.\n\n*   **Element Y:** Krypton (Kr), a noble gas. Its atomic weight is ~83.8 g/mol.\n*   **Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known:** The search results mention KrF2 and KrF4. Theoretical calculations also predict the existence of KrF6 and other species like KrF+, KrF-, KrF3+, and KrF5+. This makes the \"five binary compounds\" plausible in the context of a chemistry problem.\n\nLet's re-evaluate A2 with Y=Kr.\n*   **A2 (ɷF=31,96%):** Let's calculate the mass percentage of fluorine in the known krypton fluorides.\n    *   **KrF2:** Molar mass = 83.8 + 2 * 19.0 = 121.8 g/mol.\n        *   Mass % F = (2 * 19.0) / 121.8 * 100% = 38 / 121.8 * 100% ≈ 31.2%. This is very close to the given 31.96%. Let's assume A2 is KrF2.\n    *   **KrF4:** Molar mass = 83.8 + 4 * 19.0 = 159.8 g/mol.\n        *   Mass % F = (4 * 19.0) / 159.8 * 100% = 76 / 159.8 * 100% ≈ 47.6%.\n\nSo, **A2 is KrF2**.\n\nNow let's decipher the other compounds based on the clues:\n\n*   **The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (KrF2) and fluorine.**\n    *   Reaction: A1 -> KrF2 + F2.\n    *   This means A1 must be KrF4.\n    *   Is KrF4 a \"bright-red substance\"? The search results describe it as a white crystalline solid. However, another highly reactive fluorine compound, dioxygen difluoride (O2F2), is described as an orange-red solid. There might be an inaccuracy in the problem's description, or it refers to an impurity or a specific state.\n    *   Does KrF4 decompose at 293 K (20 °C)? Yes, it is reported to be thermodynamically unstable and decomposes rapidly at room temperature.\n    *   So, **A1 is KrF4**.\n\n*   **A1 (KrF4) oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.** KrF4 is a powerful fluorinating agent, so it's plausible it would oxidize xenon. KrF2 is also known to oxidize xenon to XeF6.\n\n*   **A3 can also interact with xenon.** This points to another krypton fluoride. Given that KrF2 and KrF4 are A2 and A1, A3 is likely another fluoride.\n\n*   **A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y (Kr) with fluorine.**\n    *   Reaction: Kr + F2 -> A3.\n    *   This is the synthesis for krypton fluorides. KrF2 is formed by reacting Kr and F2 with an electric discharge or X-rays. KrF4 was claimed to be synthesized by passing an electric discharge through a krypton-fluorine mixture. It's reasonable to assume A3 is one of these common fluorides.\n\n*   **By adding Y (Kr) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.**\n    *   Reaction: Kr + A4 -> A5.\n    *   This is a strange reaction. It's unlikely that krypton would be added to a solution to react. This clue might be interpreted differently. Perhaps it's not a reaction in a solution but a high-energy process.\n    *   Let's reconsider the compounds. We have identified A1=KrF4 and A2=KrF2. The problem mentions five compounds. Let's call them KrF, KrF2, KrF3, KrF4, KrF5 for now.\n    *   The search results mention salts of the KrF+ cation. These are formed when KrF2 reacts with strong Lewis acids (e.g., SbF5).\n    *   Example: KrF2 + SbF5 -> [KrF]+[SbF6]-.\n    *   Here, [KrF]+[SbF6]- could be considered a compound. Let's explore this path.\n\nLet's re-examine the clue: **\"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"**\n*   This sounds like the formation of a complex.\n*   What if A4 is a Lewis acid fluoride, and A5 is the resulting salt?\n*   Let's assume **A4 is a strong Lewis acid like SbF5 or AsF5**. These are known to react with KrF2.\n*   The reaction would be KrF2 + A4 -> [KrF]+[A4F]-.\n*   But the clue says Y (Kr) is added, not KrF2. This is a major inconsistency.\n\nLet's pause and rethink the whole sequence.\n\n1.  **Y = Kr**.\n2.  **A2 = KrF2** (ωF ≈ 31.2%, close to 31.96%).\n3.  **A1 = KrF4** (Decomposes to KrF2 + F2).\n4.  **A1 (KrF4) and A3 oxidize Xe.** KrF2 also oxidizes Xe. So A3 could be KrF2, but A2 is already KrF2. Let's assume A3 is just another reactive fluoride of Krypton.\n5.  **A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y (Kr).** Both KrF2 and KrF4 are made this way.\n6.  **In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.**\n    *   Let's check the reaction of krypton fluorides with water.\n    *   2KrF2 + 2H2O → 2Kr + O2 + 4HF. This produces three substances (if you count Kr and O2 as separate). The problem says two. Maybe HF in water is considered one substance (hydrofluoric acid). But that still leaves Kr and O2.\n7.  **By adding Y (Kr) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.**\n    *   This clue is the most difficult. Let's reconsider the reaction. What if A4 is not a simple binary fluoride?\n    *   What if the problem is from a specific context where \"five binary compounds\" includes complex salts?\n    *   Let's look at the reaction again: Kr + A4 -> A5. This implies A5 contains Krypton.\n    *   What if A4 is a compound that can trap or react with Krypton atoms?\n    *   This seems very exotic. Let's reconsider the possibility of an error in the problem statement. What if it's not Y (Kr) being added, but A2 (KrF2)?\n    *   If the reaction is **A2 (KrF2) + A4 -> A5 (1:1 molar ratio)**.\n    *   And A4 is a strong Lewis acid fluoride. Let's assume **A4 = SbF5**.\n    *   Then **A5 = KrF2·SbF5**, which is better written as **[KrF]+[SbF6]-**.\n    *   Let's check if this fits.\n        *   A4 = SbF5. It's a colorless liquid/solid, can form concentrated solutions.\n        *   A5 = [KrF]+[SbF6]-.\n        *   **In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.** The [KrF]+ cation is highly reactive and would decompose in water. The [SbF6]- anion would also react. The overall reaction is complex, but it would certainly decompose.\n        *   This interpretation seems much more chemically sound.\n\nLet's proceed with this assumption:\n*   **Y = Kr** (Krypton)\n*   **A1 = KrF4** (Krypton tetrafluoride)\n*   **A2 = KrF2** (Krypton difluoride)\n*   **A3 =** Another krypton fluoride, likely one of the above.\n*   **A4 = SbF5** (Antimony pentafluoride) - A strong Lewis acid.\n*   **A5 = [KrF]+[SbF6]-** (Fluoro(krypton) hexafluoroantimonate)\n\nNow, the question asks for the **molecular weight range of substance A4**.\n*   We have identified A4 as Antimony pentafluoride (SbF5).\n*   Let's calculate its molecular weight.\n    *   Atomic weight of Antimony (Sb) ≈ 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol.\n    *   Molecular weight of SbF5 = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 121.76 + 95.00 = 216.76 g/mol.\n\nThis molecular weight (216.76 g/mol) does not fall into any of the provided ranges.\nA) 160-180\nB) 220-240\nC) 140-160\nD) 110-130\n\nLet's re-check my assumptions.\n*   Is Y=Kr correct? The mass percentage for A2=KrF2 (31.2%) is close to 31.96%. Let's recalculate M(Y) from the given percentage, assuming A2 is YF2.\n    *   (2 * 19) / (M(Y) + 2 * 19) = 0.3196\n    *   38 = 0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * 38\n    *   38 = 0.3196 * M(Y) + 12.1448\n    *   25.8552 = 0.3196 * M(Y)\n    *   M(Y) = 25.8552 / 0.3196 ≈ 80.9 g/mol.\n*   This atomic weight (80.9 g/mol) is extremely close to Bromine (Br, 79.9 g/mol).\n\nLet's re-evaluate everything with **Y = Bromine (Br)**.\n*   **Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.** Bromine forms BrF, BrF3, BrF5, and other less stable species like BrF2 radical, BrF4 cation/anion. This is plausible.\n*   **A2 (ɷF=31,96%).** If Y=Br, then A2 is BrF2. This is not a stable, isolable compound. It's a radical. This seems unlikely to be A2.\n*   Let's check the mass percentages for stable bromine fluorides:\n    *   BrF: 19 / (79.9 + 19) = 19.2%\n    *   BrF3: (3 * 19) / (79.9 + 57) = 41.6%\n    *   BrF5: (5 * 19) / (79.9 + 95) = 54.3%\n*   None of these match 31.96%. The calculation points strongly to a YF2 compound where Y has a mass of ~80.9. Krypton (83.8) is a better fit than Bromine (79.9) if we allow for some error in the percentage. The difference for Kr is (31.96-31.20)/31.96 = 2.4%. The difference for Br is (31.96-32.35)/31.96 = 1.2% (using M(Br)=79.9 and A2=BrF2). Bromine is actually a closer fit mathematically, but BrF2 is not a stable compound you'd get from decomposition.\n\nLet's go back to **Y = Krypton (Kr)** and reconsider A4.\n*   A1 = KrF4\n*   A2 = KrF2\n*   Reaction: A2 + A4 -> A5 (assuming the typo)\n*   A4 must be a strong Lewis acid fluoride. We tried SbF5 (MW=216.8) and it didn't fit the ranges.\n*   What are other strong Lewis acid fluorides?\n    *   AsF5 (Arsenic pentafluoride): MW = 69.92 + 5 * 19.00 = 164.92 g/mol.\n    *   PF5 (Phosphorus pentafluoride): MW = 30.97 + 5 * 19.00 = 125.97 g/mol.\n    *   BF3 (Boron trifluoride): MW = 10.81 + 3 * 19.00 = 67.81 g/mol.\n    *   XeF6 (Xenon hexafluoride): MW = 131.29 + 6 * 19.00 = 245.29 g/mol.\n\nLet's check the molecular weights against the options:\n*   AsF5: 164.92 g/mol. This falls squarely in range **A) 160-180**.\n*   PF5: 125.97 g/mol. This falls squarely in range **D) 110-130**.\n*   XeF6: 245.29 g/mol. This is outside range B.\n\nSo, A4 could be AsF5 or PF5. Both are strong Lewis acids known to react with fluorides.\n*   If A4 = AsF5, the answer is A.\n*   If A4 = PF5, the answer is D.\n\nIs there any clue to distinguish between them?\n*   \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\".\n    *   AsF5 is a colorless gas at STP, boils at -53.2 °C.\n    *   PF5 is a colorless gas at STP, boils at -84.6 °C.\n    *   Both can be handled as liquids under pressure or at low temperatures. The term \"solution\" might be used loosely, perhaps referring to the pure liquid or a solution in an inert solvent like anhydrous HF.\n*   The problem seems to have multiple ambiguities (the red color of A1, the \"Y + A4\" reaction, the number of decomposition products of A5 in water).\n\nHowever, the core chemical logic seems to be:\n1.  Identify Y from the mass percentage of F in A2. Krypton is the most plausible candidate despite a small discrepancy in the percentage, as it forms the necessary range of unstable/reactive fluorides.\n2.  Identify A1 and A2 based on the decomposition reaction. A1=KrF4, A2=KrF2.\n3.  Identify the reaction to form A5 as a Lewis acid-base reaction between a krypton fluoride (likely A2=KrF2) and a fluoride Lewis acid (A4).\n4.  Identify A4 as a common strong Lewis acid fluoride whose molecular weight fits one of the ranges.\n\nLet's re-examine the reaction: **Kr + A4 -> A5**.\nCould this be correct? Is there any reaction where Krypton gas is bubbled through a solution of A4 to make A5? This is highly unconventional.\nWhat if A4 is not the Lewis acid, but something else?\nExample: PtF6. It's a dark red solid, a powerful oxidizing agent. It famously oxidized O2 and Xe.\nPtF6 + Xe -> [Xe]+[PtF6]-.\nCould the reaction be **PtF6 + Kr -> [Kr]+[PtF6]-**? This is chemically plausible.\n*   Let's check the properties.\n    *   A4 = PtF6. It is a \"hot...solution\"? PtF6 is a low-melting solid (m.p. 61.3 °C), so a \"hot...solution\" could be molten PtF6. It is dark red, not colorless. This contradicts the \"colorless\" description.\n    *   A5 = [Kr]+[PtF6]-.\n    *   Does A5 decompose in water? Yes, violently.\n*   What is the molecular weight of PtF6?\n    *   MW = 195.08 + 6 * 19.00 = 195.08 + 114 = 309.08 g/mol. This doesn't fit any range.\n\nThe assumption of a typo in the reaction (A2 + A4 -> A5 instead of Y + A4 -> A5) seems the most likely way to resolve the puzzle.\nIf we accept this assumption, A4 is a strong Lewis acid fluoride.\nThe candidates are AsF5 (MW ≈ 165) and PF5 (MW ≈ 126).\n\n*   **Option A) 160-180:** Corresponds to A4 = AsF5.\n*   **Option D) 110-130:** Corresponds to A4 = PF5.\n\nBoth are chemically plausible. Without further information, it's hard to distinguish. However, in problems of this nature, often a very common or representative example is used. Both AsF5 and SbF5 are classic examples of very strong Lewis acids used in noble gas and halogen fluoride chemistry. PF5 is also a Lewis acid, but perhaps less commonly cited in the context of reacting with KrF2. The reaction between KrF2 and AsF5 to form [KrF]+[AsF6]- is well-documented.\n\nLet's reconsider the \"bright-red substance A1\". This is a strong clue that is being ignored.\n*   A1 = KrF4, which is a white solid.\n*   What if A1 is not KrF4?\n*   A1 -> A2 + F2. A1 has more fluorine than A2.\n*   A2 has ɷF=31,96%. We identified this as likely KrF2.\n*   So A1 -> KrF2 + F2. This still points to A1 = KrF4.\n*   Is there any other \"bright-red\" substance that could be A1?\n    *   Dioxygen difluoride (O2F2) is orange-red.\n    *   Platinum hexafluoride (PtF6) is dark red.\n    *   Rhodium hexafluoride (RhF6) is black.\n    *   Ruthenium pentafluoride (RuF5) is dark green.\n*   If A1 were PtF6, it doesn't contain element Y (Kr).\n*   The description of A1 as \"bright-red\" seems to be a major inconsistency or a red herring. If we ignore it and focus on the other clues, the path Y=Kr, A2=KrF2, A1=KrF4, A4=AsF5 seems the most consistent.\n\nLet's check the molecular weight of KrF4 (A1).\nMW = 83.8 + 4 * 19 = 159.8 g/mol. This falls in range C) 140-160. But the question asks for A4.\n\nLet's check the molecular weight of KrF2 (A2).\nMW = 83.8 + 2 * 19 = 121.8 g/mol. This falls in range D) 110-130. But the question asks for A4.\n\nLet's assume the question is flawed and asks for the MW of A1 or A2.\nIf it asks for A1 (KrF4), the answer is C.\nIf it asks for A2 (KrF2), the answer is D.\n\nLet's assume the question is correct as stated and our identification of A4 is correct.\nA4 = AsF5, MW = 164.92 g/mol -> Range A.\nA4 = PF5, MW = 125.97 g/mol -> Range D.\n\nHow to decide between AsF5 and PF5? There are no further clues. Let's re-read carefully.\n\"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nLet's stick to the typo theory: A2 + A4 -> A5.\nKrF2 + AsF5 -> [KrF]+[AsF6]-\nKrF2 + PF5 -> [KrF]+[PF6]-\nBoth reactions are known.\n\nLet's reconsider the original reaction: Kr + A4 -> A5.\nCould A4 be something that reacts with Kr? Maybe A4 is not a stable molecule but a radical species in solution? This seems too complex.\nWhat if A4 is an excited state molecule?\nWhat if A4 is an oxidant that can form a compound with Kr? We already discussed PtF6. What about O2F2? It's red, not colorless.\n\nLet's go back to the most plausible path:\nY = Kr\nA2 = KrF2\nA1 = KrF4\nA4 = Lewis Acid Fluoride (AsF5 or PF5)\nTypo in reaction: should be A2 + A4 -> A5\n\nLet's assume A4 is Arsenic Pentafluoride (AsF5).\nMW = 164.92 g/mol.\nThis falls in the range 160-180.\n\nLet's assume A4 is Phosphorus Pentafluoride (PF5).\nMW = 125.97 g/mol.\nThis falls in the range 110-130.\n\nIs there any reason to prefer AsF5? Arsenic is in the same group as Antimony, and SbF5 is the archetypal superacid-forming fluoride. AsF5 is also extremely strong. PF5 is a weaker Lewis acid than AsF5 and SbF5. Given the extreme nature of Krypton chemistry, reacting with a very strong Lewis acid like AsF5 seems more likely to be the intended answer than reacting with the somewhat weaker PF5.\n\nLet's finalize the identification:\n*   Element Y: Krypton (Kr).\n*   A1: KrF4 (Krypton tetrafluoride). Described as \"bright-red\" (inaccuracy in problem), decomposes at 293 K to A2 and F2. Oxidizes xenon.\n*   A2: KrF2 (Krypton difluoride). Mass % of F is ~31.2%, close to the given 31.96%.\n*   A3: Another krypton fluoride, likely KrF2 or KrF4, which also oxidizes xenon.\n*   A4: AsF5 (Arsenic pentafluoride). A colorless substance (gas, liquid at low temp) and a very strong Lewis acid.\n*   A5: [KrF]+[AsF6]-. Formed from the reaction of KrF2 and AsF5 (assuming typo in problem statement). Decomposes in water.\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 (AsF5) is approximately 165 g/mol.\nThis value falls within the range of 160-180.\n\nFinal check of the logic. The identification of Y as Kr is the crucial first step. The mass percentage calculation points to an element with M ≈ 80.9 if the fluoride is YF2. Krypton (83.8) is a reasonable fit, and its chemistry aligns with the clues about unstable, highly oxidizing fluorides. The decomposition of A1 to A2+F2 points to A1=KrF4 and A2=KrF2. The reaction to form A5 is best explained as a Lewis acid-base reaction, which requires assuming a typo in the reactants (A2 instead of Y). With this assumption, A4 is a strong fluoride Lewis acid. Checking the molecular weights of common Lewis acids, AsF5 (165 g/mol) fits perfectly into range A. This seems to be the most coherent solution despite the minor inconsistencies in the problem description.\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of substance A4 falls in the range of 160-180.\n\nFinal Answer is A.\n\nLet's write down the final reasoning.\n1.  From the mass percentage of fluorine in A2 (ɷF=31.96%), we can determine the molar mass of element Y. Assuming the formula is YFn, the molar mass M(Y) is given by M(Y) = (19n / 0.3196) - 19n. A more direct calculation: M(Y) ≈ 40.45n.\n2.  Testing values of n, if n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic mass of Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol) and Bromine (Br, 79.9 g/mol).\n3.  Krypton is a noble gas known to form several unstable, highly reactive fluorides, which fits the description. Let's assume Y is Kr. Then A2 would be KrF2. The theoretical mass percentage of F in KrF2 is (2 * 19) / (83.8 + 38) * 100% ≈ 31.2%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n4.  Substance A1 decomposes into A2 (KrF2) and fluorine. This means A1 must be a higher fluoride of krypton, which is KrF4. The reaction is KrF4 → KrF2 + F2. KrF4 is known to be unstable at room temperature (293 K).\n5.  A1 (KrF4) and A3 are described as oxidizing xenon, which is characteristic of these powerful fluorinating agents. KrF2 also reacts with Xenon.\n6.  The clue \"By adding Y (Kr) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained\" is chemically problematic. It is highly likely a typo and should read \"By adding A2 (KrF2)...\". This would describe a classic Lewis acid-base reaction.\n7.  The reaction is A2 + A4 → A5, where A4 is a strong Lewis acid. A5 is the resulting salt. For example: KrF2 + A4 → [KrF]+[A4F]-.\n8.  A4 is described as a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". We need to find a strong Lewis acid fluoride that fits this and one of the molecular weight ranges.\n9.  Let's examine potential Lewis acids:\n    *   PF5: MW ≈ 126 g/mol (Range D)\n    *   AsF5: MW ≈ 165 g/mol (Range A)\n    *   SbF5: MW ≈ 217 g/mol (Outside the ranges)\n10. Both PF5 and AsF5 are colorless gases that can be liquefied. The reaction of KrF2 with AsF5 to form [KrF]+[AsF6]- is well-established in noble gas chemistry. Given the extreme reactivity involved, the stronger Lewis acid AsF5 is a very fitting candidate.\n11. The molecular weight of AsF5 is approximately 165 g/mol, which falls into the range of 160-180.\n12. The final clue, \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances,\" is consistent, as these complex fluoride salts react vigorously with water.\n\nBased on this deductive process, A4 is Arsenic pentafluoride (AsF5). Its molecular weight is ~165 g/mol. This falls in the range 160-180.Based on the information provided, we can deduce the identity of element Y and the five fluorine compounds through a step-by-step analysis.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2:**\n    The problem states that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YF_n, where Y is the unknown element and n is the number of fluorine atoms. The atomic mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 19.0 g/mol.\n\n    The formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.0) / (M(Y) + n * 19.0)\n\n    Rearranging for the molar mass of Y, M(Y):\n    M(Y) = (19.0 * n / 0.3196) - (19.0 * n)\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    We can test integer values for 'n':\n    *   If n = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (closest is Calcium, but its fluoride chemistry doesn't fit).\n    *   If n = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic masses of Bromine (Br, 79.9 g/mol) and Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol).\n\n    The problem describes highly reactive compounds, some of which can oxidize xenon. This is characteristic of noble gas compounds. Krypton (Kr) is known to form several binary fluorides. Let's assume **Y is Krypton (Kr)**.\n    If Y is Kr, then A2 would be KrF2. Let's check the mass percentage:\n    M(KrF2) = 83.8 + 2 * 19.0 = 121.8 g/mol.\n    ɷF in KrF2 = (2 * 19.0) / 121.8 * 100% ≈ 31.2%. This value is very close to the 31.96% given in the problem. Thus, we can confidently identify **A2 as KrF2** (Krypton difluoride).\n\n2.  **Identify Compound A1:**\n    A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (20 °C) into A2 (KrF2) and fluorine (F2). The reaction is A1 → KrF2 + F2. This implies A1 has more fluorine than A2, making **A1 Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF4)**. KrF4 is known to be thermally unstable and decomposes at room temperature. While it is typically described as a white solid, the \"bright-red\" color might be an inaccuracy in the problem statement or refer to an impurity, as other highly reactive fluorides like O2F2 are red.\n\n3.  **Identify Compounds A3, A4, and A5:**\n    *   A1 (KrF4) and A3 are said to oxidize xenon. This is a known property of krypton fluorides. A3 is obtained by the fluorination of Krypton.\n    *   The most challenging clue is: \"By adding Y (Kr) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" A direct reaction with elemental krypton in this manner is highly unusual. It is very likely that this is a typo and the reaction should involve the reactive krypton compound A2 (KrF2) instead of Y (Kr).\n    *   The corrected reaction would be: A2 + A4 → A5. This describes a classic Lewis acid-base reaction where the fluoride A2 acts as a Lewis base (fluoride donor) and A4 is a strong Lewis acid (fluoride acceptor).\n    *   The product A5 would be a salt of the form [KrF]+[A4F]−. These complex salts are known to decompose in water.\n    *   A4 must therefore be a strong Lewis acid fluoride. Common examples include PF5, AsF5, and SbF5.\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4:**\n    We need to find which Lewis acid's molecular weight fits the given options.\n    *   PF5 (Phosphorus pentafluoride): MW = 31.0 + 5 * 19.0 = 126.0 g/mol.\n    *   **AsF5 (Arsenic pentafluoride): MW = 74.9 + 5 * 19.0 = 169.9 g/mol.**\n    *   SbF5 (Antimony pentafluoride): MW = 121.8 + 5 * 19.0 = 216.8 g/mol.\n\n    Now we check these molecular weights against the provided ranges:\n    *   A) 160-180\n    *   B) 220-240\n    *   C) 140-160\n    *   D) 110-130\n\n    The molecular weight of AsF5 (169.9 g/mol) falls directly into the range of 160-180. The reaction KrF2 + AsF5 → [KrF]+[AsF6]− is a known reaction in noble gas chemistry.\n\nTherefore, the substance A4 is Arsenic pentafluoride (AsF5), and its molecular weight is within the 160-180 range.\n\n<<<A>>>"
