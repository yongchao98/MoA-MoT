    "The Mott-Gurney equation is derived based on a specific set of assumptions about the semiconductor device and the nature of charge transport. To determine which statement is true, we must examine the fundamental conditions required for the equation's validity.\n\nThe key assumptions for the Mott-Gurney law are:\n*   **Single Carrier Type**: The model assumes that only one type of charge carrier, either electrons or holes, is mobile and contributes to the current. Therefore, it applies to single-carrier devices.\n*   **Trap-Free Insulator**: The derivation assumes the semiconductor is an ideal insulator with no charge traps within its bandgap. The presence of traps would alter the relationship between current and voltage.\n*   **Ohmic Contacts**: The model requires an \"Ohmic\" contact for charge injection. This means there is no energy barrier for carriers to be injected from the electrode into the semiconductor, ensuring that the supply of injectable charge is unlimited. A Schottky contact, which has an energy barrier, would violate this condition.\n*   **Drift-Dominated Current**: The current is assumed to be driven solely by the drift of charge carriers in the applied electric field. The contribution from diffusion current is considered negligible and is ignored in the derivation.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options against these principles:\n\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect. The law is specifically formulated for single-carrier devices.\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.** This statement accurately reflects the core assumptions of the Mott-Gurney model: it's for a single-carrier system, the material is trap-free, there is no barrier to injection (which is the definition of an ideal Ohmic contact), and the diffusion current is negligible.\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.** This is incorrect. The Mott-Gurney law describes a current that is dominated by drift, not one where drift is negligible.\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect. A Schottky contact implies an injection barrier, which violates the assumption of an ideal Ohmic contact required for the Mott-Gurney law.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that correctly describes the conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
