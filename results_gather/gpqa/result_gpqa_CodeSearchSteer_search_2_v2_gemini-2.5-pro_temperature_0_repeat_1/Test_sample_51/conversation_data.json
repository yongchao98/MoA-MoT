    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Principle**: The problem involves the population of atomic energy levels in a stellar photosphere, which is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of the populations of two energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Boltzmann Equation**: The ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy level (level 2) to the number of atoms in a lower energy level (level 1) is given by:\n    `N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T)]`\n    Where:\n    *   `N₁`, `N₂` are the number of atoms in level 1 and level 2.\n    *   `g₁`, `g₂` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n    *   `E₁`, `E₂` are the energies of the levels.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (1.380649 × 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Interpret the Ratio**: The problem states that the ratio of the number of atoms in the two levels *decreases* when the star has spots (i.e., when the temperature is lower). Let's analyze the formula. As the temperature `T` decreases, the term `- (E₂ - E₁) / (k * T)` becomes more negative. Consequently, the exponential term `exp(...)` decreases. This means the ratio `N₂ / N₁` decreases as temperature drops. Therefore, the ratio mentioned in the problem is `R = N₂ / N₁`.\n\n4.  **Define the Factor**: The question asks for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. This can be expressed as the ratio of the ratios:\n    `Factor = R_nospots / R_spots`\n\n5.  **Set up the Calculation**:\n    *   `R_nospots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_nospots)]`\n    *   `R_spots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_spots)]`\n\n    Dividing these two equations, the statistical weights `(g₂ / g₁)` cancel out:\n    `Factor = exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_nospots)] / exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_spots)]`\n    `Factor = exp[ -((E₂ - E₁) / k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) ]`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Energy Term `(E₂ - E₁)`**: The energy difference corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given wavelength.\n    `ΔE = E₂ - E₁ = h * c / λ`\n    Where:\n    *   `h` is Planck's constant (6.62607015 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n    *   `c` is the speed of light (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s).\n    *   `λ` is the wavelength (1448 Å = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m).\n\n    We need the term `ΔE / k`:\n    `ΔE / k = (h * c) / (λ * k)`\n    `ΔE / k = (6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s * 2.998 × 10⁸ m/s) / (1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m * 1.381 × 10⁻²³ J/K)`\n    `ΔE / k ≈ 99,363 K`\n\n7.  **Substitute Values and Solve**: Now, substitute the known values into the factor equation:\n    *   `ΔE / k ≈ 99,363 K`\n    *   `T_nospots = 6000 K`\n    *   `T_spots = 5500 K`\n\n    `Factor = exp[ -99363 * (1/6000 - 1/5500) ]`\n    `Factor = exp[ -99363 * ((5500 - 6000) / (6000 * 5500)) ]`\n    `Factor = exp[ -99363 * (-500 / 33,000,000) ]`\n    `Factor = exp[ 99363 * (1 / 66,000) ]`\n    `Factor = exp(1.5055)`\n    `Factor ≈ 4.506`\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.5.\n\n<<<B>>>"
