    "An oscillating charge distribution, particularly one with a defined axis of symmetry like a spheroid oscillating along that axis, can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole. The radiated power from such a dipole is not uniform in all directions and has a specific dependence on the wavelength of the radiation.\n\n### Angular Distribution of Power\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle ($dP/d\\Omega$) by an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis is proportional to the square of the sine of the angle $\\theta$ measured from the z-axis. The formula is given by:\n\n$dP/d\\Omega \\propto \\sin^2(\\theta)$\n\nThe maximum power, A, is radiated in the direction perpendicular to the axis of oscillation, where $\\theta = 90^\\circ$. At this angle, $\\sin^2(90^\\circ) = 1$.\n\nTo find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at an angle of $\\theta = 30^\\circ$, we calculate the value of $\\sin^2(30^\\circ)$.\n\nSince $\\sin(30^\\circ) = 1/2$, we have:\n\n$\\sin^2(30^\\circ) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4$\n\nTherefore, the power radiated at $30^\\circ$ is 1/4 of the maximum power, A.\n\n### Wavelength Dependence of Power\n\nThe total power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency ($\\omega$) of oscillation. This relationship is described by the Larmor formula. The power per unit solid angle also follows this dependence:\n\n$dP/d\\Omega \\propto \\omega^4$\n\nThe angular frequency is inversely proportional to the wavelength ($\\lambda$), with the relation $\\omega = 2\\pi c / \\lambda$, where c is the speed of light. Substituting this into the power relation gives:\n\n$dP/d\\Omega \\propto (1/\\lambda)^4 = \\lambda^{-4}$\n\nThis inverse fourth-power dependence is characteristic of Rayleigh scattering and is why the sky appears blue, as shorter (blue) wavelengths are scattered more strongly than longer (red) wavelengths.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining these two findings, the fraction of the maximum power A radiated at an angle of $30^\\circ$ is 1/4, and the radiated power has a dependence of $\\lambda^{-4}$. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
