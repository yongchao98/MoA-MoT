    "The search results confirm that the methodology used is correct for calculating the pH of a phosphate buffer and for dealing with polyprotic acids. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is appropriate for the H2PO4-/HPO42- system as the pKa values are well-separated. The process involves:\n1.  Calculating the molar concentrations of the acid (H2PO4-) and its conjugate base (HPO42-).\n2.  Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation with the appropriate pKa (pKa2) to find the pH, or using the Ka2 expression directly to find [H+].\n3.  Using the calculated [H+] and the Ka expression for the next dissociation step (Ka3) to find the concentration of the desired species (PO43-).\n\nThe initial calculations were:\n*   Moles of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n*   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n*   Volume = 200.00 cm3 = 0.20000 L\n*   [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n*   [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\nUsing the equilibrium for the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\nH2PO4⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO4²⁻\nKa2 = [H⁺][HPO4²⁻] / [H2PO4⁻] = 6.2x10⁻⁸\n\nWe can calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]:\n[H⁺] = Ka2 * [H2PO4⁻] / [HPO4²⁻]\n[H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M) / (0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\nNow, we use the equilibrium for the third dissociation, which involves the orthophosphate ion (PO4³⁻):\nHPO4²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO4³⁻\nKa3 = [H⁺][PO4³⁻] / [HPO4²⁻] = 1.8x10⁻¹²\n\nWe can now solve for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO4³⁻]:\n[PO4³⁻] = Ka3 * [HPO4²⁻] / [H⁺]\n[PO4³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M) / (8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO4³⁻] ≈ 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis value is very close to option B.\n\nLet's re-calculate with higher precision to be sure.\n*   [H2PO4-] = (1.00 / 136.09) / 0.200 = 0.0367404 M\n*   [HPO4^2-] = (1.00 / 177.99) / 0.200 = 0.0280915 M\n*   [H+] = (6.2e-8) * (0.0367404 / 0.0280915) = 8.10887e-8 M\n*   [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12) * (0.0280915) / (8.10887e-8) = 6.2356e-7 M\n\nThe calculated concentration is 6.2356x10⁻⁷ M.\nComparing this to the options:\nA) 5.48x10⁻⁷ M\nB) 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\nC) 2.81x10⁻⁷ M\nD) 3.97x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 6.24x10⁻⁷ M. The minor difference is likely due to rounding of the initial constants (Mw, Ka) in the problem statement. The methodology is sound and the calculation is confirmed.\n\nFinal check of the steps and logic.\n1.  The solution is a buffer made of a conjugate acid-base pair: H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄) and HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O).\n2.  The pH of this buffer is primarily determined by the pKa₂ of phosphoric acid.\n3.  The concentration of orthophosphate (PO₄³⁻) is determined by the third dissociation equilibrium (Ka₃), which is dependent on the pH (or [H⁺]) set by the buffer.\n4.  The calculation proceeds in two steps: first find [H⁺] from the buffer equilibrium, then use [H⁺] to find [PO₄³⁻] from the third dissociation equilibrium. This is a standard and correct approach.\n\nThe calculation is correct. The answer is B.\n\nTo prepare the final response, I will outline the steps clearly.\n\n1.  **Calculate moles:** Determine the number of moles of KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O.\n2.  **Calculate concentrations:** Convert moles to molar concentrations using the given volume. These are the initial concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻.\n3.  **Calculate [H⁺]:** Use the Ka₂ expression for the equilibrium H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ to find the hydrogen ion concentration.\n4.  **Calculate [PO₄³⁻]:** Use the Ka₃ expression for the equilibrium HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻ and the previously calculated [H⁺] to find the orthophosphate concentration.\n5.  **Compare:** Match the calculated value to the closest option.\n\nThis detailed plan confirms the initial quick calculation. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n*   Moles KH₂PO₄ = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.00734808 mol\n*   Moles Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.00561829 mol\n*   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.00734808 mol / 0.200 L = 0.0367404 M\n*   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.00561829 mol / 0.200 L = 0.0280915 M\n*   From the second dissociation, Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n*   [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]) = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.0367404 / 0.0280915) = 8.10887 x 10⁻⁸ M\n*   From the third dissociation, Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n*   [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺]) = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.0280915 / 8.10887 x 10⁻⁸) = 6.2356 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis value rounds to 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nFinal answer is B.\n\nTo determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we must perform a series of calculations based on the principles of chemical equilibrium for polyprotic acids.\n\nFirst, we calculate the molar amounts of the two phosphate salts dissolved in the solution.\n\n*   **Moles of KH₂PO₄:**\n    Moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n*   **Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O:**\n    Moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\nNext, we determine the initial molar concentrations of the H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ ions in the 200.00 cm³ (0.200 L) solution.\n\n*   **Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻:**\n    [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n*   **Concentration of HPO₄²⁻:**\n    [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\nThe solution contains a buffer system composed of the weak acid H₂PO₄⁻ and its conjugate base HPO₄²⁻. The pH of this solution is governed by the second dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid, which has an acid dissociation constant, Ka₂.\n\nH₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\nKa₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸\n\nWe can calculate the hydrogen ion concentration, [H⁺], using the expression for Ka₂:\n\nKa₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n\nRearranging to solve for [H⁺]:\n\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n[H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\nThe concentration of the orthophosphate ion, PO₄³⁻, is determined by the third dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid:\n\nHPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\nKa₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹²\n\nUsing the expression for Ka₃ and the calculated [H⁺]:\n\nKa₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\nRearranging to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n\n[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis calculated value is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
