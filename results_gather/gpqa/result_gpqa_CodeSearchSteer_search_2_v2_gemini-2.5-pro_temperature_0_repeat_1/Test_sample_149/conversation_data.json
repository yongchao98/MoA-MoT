    "The final product of the reaction sequence is identified by following the transformation of the starting material through each step.\n\n**Step 1: Identification of the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **¹H-NMR Data Analysis:**\n    *   `9.72 (t, 1H)`: This signal is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) that is coupled to a neighboring methylene (-CH2-) group, resulting in a triplet.\n    *   `6.98 (d, 2H)` and `6.51 (d, 2H)`: These two doublets in the aromatic region are indicative of a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   `6.27 (bs, 2H)`: A broad singlet for two protons strongly suggests a primary amine group (-NH2).\n    *   `3.66 (d, 2H)`: This doublet corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-) that is adjacent to the aldehyde's single proton, causing the split into a doublet.\n\nAssembling these fragments—a para-substituted benzene ring, an amino group, and a -CH2CHO group—leads to the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. This structure is consistent with both the molecular formula and all the NMR data.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reagents 1 and 2 (1. NaNO2 + HCl; 2. H2O):** This is a standard two-step process for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine followed by hydrolysis. The amino group (-NH2) on the benzene ring is converted into a hydroxyl group (-OH). The aldehyde portion of the molecule remains unchanged. The product of this stage is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reagent 3 (aq. KOH, Heat):** This reagent provides a basic and heated environment, which are the classic conditions for an aldol condensation reaction. Since only one type of aldehyde is present (4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde), it will undergo a self-condensation.\n    1.  **Aldol Addition:** In the presence of the base (KOH), an enolate is formed by removing an acidic alpha-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. This initially forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which in this case is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option D).\n    2.  **Condensation (Dehydration):** The \"Heat\" applied in this step promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. This dehydration typically occurs by removing the hydroxyl group from the beta-carbon (C3) and a proton from the alpha-carbon (C2), leading to the formation of a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The resulting product has a double bond conjugated with both the carbonyl group and one of the aromatic rings.\n\n**Step 3: Identification of the Final Product**\n\nThe dehydration of the intermediate, 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal, results in the formation of **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This compound is a known product and its structure matches the name provided in option A. While the aldol addition product (Option D) is a key intermediate, the application of heat drives the reaction to completion, making the dehydrated condensation product the final product.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<A>>>"
