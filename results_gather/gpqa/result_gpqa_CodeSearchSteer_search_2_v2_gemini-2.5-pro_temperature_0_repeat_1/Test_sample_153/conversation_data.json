    "Based on the comprehensive analysis of the provided spectral data, the unidentified compound is determined to be 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Here is a detailed breakdown of how each piece of information leads to this conclusion:\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS):** The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound. The additional peak at m/z = 158, with an intensity approximately one-third of the molecular ion peak (32%), is a characteristic isotopic pattern for a compound containing one chlorine atom.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:** The spectrum shows two key features. A very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is definitive for the O-H stretching vibration of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid. The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The singlet at 11.0 ppm, integrating to one proton (1H), is characteristic of a highly deshielded carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   The two signals in the aromatic region, a doublet at 8.02 ppm (2H) and another doublet at 7.72 ppm (2H), strongly suggest a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The two doublets arise because the protons on the ring are split only by their adjacent protons. The downfield chemical shifts are due to the electron-withdrawing effects of both the chlorine atom and the carboxylic acid group. Published ¹H NMR data for 4-chlorobenzoic acid show similar patterns, with two doublets in the aromatic region.\n\n**Evaluation of Other Options:**\n\n*   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** This compound lacks the carboxylic acid group and therefore would not show the characteristic broad O-H peak in the IR spectrum or the acidic proton signal around 11 ppm in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This structure contains aldehyde and phenol groups, not a carboxylic acid. Its IR and NMR spectra would be significantly different.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While this isomer has the correct molecular weight and functional group, its ¹H NMR spectrum would be more complex. An *ortho*-substituted benzene ring would result in four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons, not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n\nTherefore, the combination of all spectral evidence unequivocally points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the correct structure.\n\n<<<A>>>"
