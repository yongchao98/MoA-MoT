    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understand the Notation\n\nThe bracket notation `[A/B]` is a standard way to express elemental abundances in stars relative to the Sun. It is defined on a logarithmic scale:\n\n`[A/B] = log10(n_A/n_B)_star - log10(n_A/n_B)_sun`\n\nwhere `n_A` and `n_B` are the number densities of elements A and B, respectively.\n\nA key property of this notation is that it can be expressed relative to Hydrogen (H):\n\n`[A/B] = [A/H] - [B/H]`\n\n### 2. Analyze Star 1\n\nWe are given the following for Star 1:\n*   `[Fe/H]_1 = 0` dex\n*   `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3` dex\n\nWe want to find the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen, `[Si/H]_1`. We can use the property mentioned above:\n\n`[Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/H]_1 - [Fe/H]_1`\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n`0.3 = [Si/H]_1 - 0`\n\nThis gives us the silicon abundance for Star 1:\n\n`[Si/H]_1 = 0.3`\n\n### 3. Analyze Star 2\n\nWe are given the following for Star 2:\n*   `[Mg/H]_2 = 0` dex\n*   `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3` dex\n\nSimilarly, we want to find the silicon abundance `[Si/H]_2`. We use the same property:\n\n`[Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2`\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n`0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2`\n\nThis gives us the silicon abundance for Star 2:\n\n`[Si/H]_2 = -0.3`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Ratio of Silicon Abundances\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star 1 and Star 2. In astrophysics, this refers to the ratio of their abundance values, which are typically measured relative to hydrogen (`n_Si/n_H`). Let's call this ratio `R`:\n\n`R = (n_Si/n_H)_1 / (n_Si/n_H)_2`\n\nTo find this ratio, we can work with the `[Si/H]` values we just calculated. By definition:\n\n`[Si/H]_1 = log10( (n_Si/n_H)_1 / (n_Si/n_H)_sun ) = 0.3`\n`[Si/H]_2 = log10( (n_Si/n_H)_2 / (n_Si/n_H)_sun ) = -0.3`\n\nLet's express the abundances in terms of the solar abundance:\n\n`(n_Si/n_H)_1 = (n_Si/n_H)_sun * 10^0.3`\n`(n_Si/n_H)_2 = (n_Si/n_H)_sun * 10^-0.3`\n\nNow we can compute the ratio `R`:\n\n`R = [ (n_Si/n_H)_sun * 10^0.3 ] / [ (n_Si/n_H)_sun * 10^-0.3 ]`\n\nThe solar abundance term `(n_Si/n_H)_sun` cancels out:\n\n`R = 10^0.3 / 10^-0.3`\n`R = 10^(0.3 - (-0.3))`\n`R = 10^0.6`\n\nCalculating the final value:\n\n`R â‰ˆ 3.981`\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9.\n\nNote that the masses of the stars, the specific method (LTE, EW), and the absolute solar abundances of Mg and Fe are extra information not needed for this particular calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
