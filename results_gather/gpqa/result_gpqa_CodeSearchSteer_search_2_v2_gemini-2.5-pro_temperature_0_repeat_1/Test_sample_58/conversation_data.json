    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we must first calculate the number of moles of the acidic and basic species and then determine which is in excess after neutralization.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of each substance.\n\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n    *   HCl dissociates completely to produce H+ ions.\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.2 M × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol\n    *   This provides 0.080 moles of H+ ions.\n\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2), a strong base:**\n    *   Ba(OH)2 dissociates completely to produce two OH- ions for each formula unit.\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 M × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Moles of OH- = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol\n\n### Step 2: Perform the neutralization reactions.\n\nNeutralization reactions occur between acids and bases. The strong acid (HCl) and strong base (Ba(OH)2) will react first.\n\n*   **Strong Acid - Strong Base Neutralization:**\n    *   Initial moles of H+ (from HCl) = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles of OH- (from Ba(OH)2) = 0.180 mol\n    *   The H+ ions will be completely consumed by the OH- ions.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n*   **Weak Acid - Strong Base Neutralization:**\n    *   The remaining strong base (OH-) will then react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n    *   Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of OH- available = 0.100 mol\n    *   The CH3COOH will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the final pH.\n\nThe final solution contains an excess of 0.050 moles of OH- ions, making it basic. The pH is determined by the concentration of this excess strong base.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH- ions:**\n    *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH-]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<D>>>"
