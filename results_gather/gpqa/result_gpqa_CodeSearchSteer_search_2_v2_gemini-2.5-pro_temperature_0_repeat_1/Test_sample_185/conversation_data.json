    "The reaction that (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene undergoes is a tandem aza-Cope rearrangement followed by an intramolecular Mannich cyclization. This type of cascade reaction is well-documented in organic synthesis for the construction of complex nitrogen-containing ring systems.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the mechanism:\n1.  ** Aza-Cope Rearrangement**: The starting material contains a 3-aza-1,5-diene system. It undergoes a-sigmatropic rearrangement. This pericyclic reaction involves the breaking of the C1-N2 bond and the formation of a new bond between the C5 carbon of the norbornene ring and the terminal carbon of the vinyl group. This step opens the bicyclic system to form a transient nine-membered ring intermediate which contains an iminium ion and an enol/enolate equivalent.\n2.  **Intramolecular Mannich Reaction**: The nine-membered ring intermediate is perfectly set up for a rapid, intramolecular cyclization. The enol/enolate part of the molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic iminium ion carbon. This step forms the final bicyclic product.\n\nThe overall transformation is highly stereospecific, and the stereochemistry of the starting material dictates the stereochemistry of the product. For the given starting material, this cascade reaction is known to produce a tetrahydro-cyclopenta[c]pyridine skeleton.\n\nBased on established literature for this specific transformation, the resulting product is **4,4a,5,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine**. The name precisely describes the connectivity and the location of the double bonds in the final fused-ring product.\n\n<<<B>>>"
