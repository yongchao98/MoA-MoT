    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scenario to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2:\n\n1.  **Understanding Mean Free Path (λ):** The mean free path is the average distance a particle travels before it collides with another particle. It is inversely proportional to the number density of the target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ). The general formula is:\n\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\n    *   **n:** The number of target particles per unit volume. In this scenario, the number density of the remaining gas molecules is the same for both situations since the pressure and temperature of the gas are constant.\n    *   **σ:** The collision cross-section, which represents the effective area of a target particle for a collision. A larger cross-section means a higher probability of collision.\n\n2.  **Defining λ1:** This is the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves. The collisions are between one gas molecule and another. Therefore, the relevant cross-section is the kinetic cross-section of the gas molecules (let's call it σ1). This cross-section is based on the effective size of the molecules.\n\n    λ1 = 1 / (n * σ1)\n\n3.  **Defining λ2:** This is the mean free path of the electrons from the beam as they travel through the residual gas. The collisions are between an electron and a gas molecule. The relevant cross-section here is the electron scattering cross-section for the gas molecules (let's call it σ2).\n\n    λ2 = 1 / (n * σ2)\n\n4.  **Comparing the Cross-Sections (σ1 vs. σ2):**\n    *   **Molecule-Molecule Collision (σ1):** This is a collision between two neutral particles. The interaction is primarily a short-range repulsive force when their electron clouds overlap, behaving somewhat like billiard balls.\n    *   **Electron-Molecule Collision (σ2):** This involves a charged particle (the electron) interacting with a neutral molecule. The electron interacts with the electromagnetic field of the molecule, which is composed of the positively charged nucleus and the negatively charged orbital electrons. This interaction is long-range and more complex than a simple physical collision. The effective target area for an electron to be scattered by a gas molecule is significantly larger than the physical size of the molecule involved in molecule-molecule collisions. The electron doesn't need to \"hit\" the molecule in a physical sense; it only needs to pass close enough to be deflected by its electric field.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Cross-Sections:** Due to the long-range electromagnetic interaction, the electron scattering cross-section (σ2) is considerably larger than the kinetic cross-section for molecule-molecule collisions (σ1).\n\n    σ2 > σ1\n\n6.  **Determining the Relationship between λ1 and λ2:** Since the mean free path is inversely proportional to the cross-section (λ ∝ 1/σ), and we have established that σ2 > σ1, it follows that:\n\n    λ2 < λ1\n\nTherefore, the mean free path for the electrons scattering off gas molecules (λ2) is shorter than the mean free path for the gas molecules colliding with each other (λ1).\n\n<<<A>>>"
