    "To determine the mean decay distance of the X meson resonance, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the mean lifetime (τ) of the particle.**\n    The mean lifetime τ is related to the decay width Γ by the formula:\n    τ = ħ / Γ\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s).\n    Given Γ_X = 320 MeV:\n    τ = (6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s) / 320 MeV ≈ 2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s\n\n2.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ) and velocity (β = v/c).**\n    The Lorentz factor is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy (m).\n    γ = E_X / m_X = 8000 MeV / 1200 MeV = 20/3 ≈ 6.67\n    The velocity in units of the speed of light, β, can be found from the Lorentz factor:\n    β = √(1 - 1/γ²) = √(1 - 1/(20/3)²) = √(1 - 9/400) = √(391/400) ≈ 0.9887\n\n3.  **Calculate the mean decay distance (d).**\n    The mean decay distance in the laboratory frame is the distance the particle travels on average before decaying. This distance is subject to relativistic time dilation. The formula is:\n    d = γ * β * c * τ\n    where c is the speed of light (c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s).\n    d = (20/3) * √(391/400) * (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * (2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s)\n    d ≈ 6.67 * 0.9887 * (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * (2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s)\n    d ≈ 4.0655 x 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\n**Alternative Calculation using ħc**\n\nA more direct calculation can be performed using the value of ħc ≈ 197.3 MeV·fm (where 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m).\nThe formula for the mean decay length (L) is:\nL = (p/m) * cτ = (p/m) * (ħc/Γ)\n\nFirst, we need the momentum (p):\nE² = (pc)² + (mc²)²\np = √(E² - m²) / c\np = √(8000² - 1200²) MeV/c = √(64,000,000 - 1,440,000) MeV/c = √62,560,000 MeV/c ≈ 7909.5 MeV/c\n\nNow, we can calculate the decay length:\nL = (7909.5 MeV/c / 1200 MeV/c²) * c * (ħ/Γ) = (p*c / m*c²) * (ħc/Γ)\nL = (7909.5 MeV / 1200 MeV) * (197.3 MeV·fm / 320 MeV)\nL ≈ 6.591 * 0.6166 fm\nL ≈ 4.065 fm\nSince 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.065 x 10⁻¹⁵ m.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
