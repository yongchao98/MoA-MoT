    "The physical process described is the annihilation of a high-energy gamma-ray (γ) with a low-energy photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to produce an electron-positron pair (e⁺e⁻). This interaction, known as pair production, has a minimum energy requirement for the incoming gamma-ray, referred to as the threshold energy.\n\nTo calculate this threshold energy, we must consider the principles of energy and momentum conservation. The reaction is:\nγ + γ_CMB → e⁺ + e⁻\n\nThe threshold energy is the minimum energy the high-energy gamma-ray must have for this reaction to occur. This happens when the electron and positron are created with no kinetic energy in the center-of-mass frame of the collision. For the lowest possible threshold in the observer's (lab) frame, we assume a head-on collision between the high-energy gamma-ray and the CMB photon.\n\nThe formula to calculate the threshold energy (E_γ) is derived from the conservation of four-momentum:\n\nE_γ ≈ (m_e * c²)² / E_CMB\n\nWhere:\n*   **E_γ** is the threshold energy of the high-energy gamma-ray.\n*   **m_e * c²** is the rest mass energy of an electron, which is approximately 0.511 MeV (Mega-electron Volts).\n*   **E_CMB** is the average energy of a CMB photon, given as 10⁻³ eV (electron Volts).\n\nFirst, we convert the electron's rest mass energy to eV:\n0.511 MeV = 0.511 * 10⁶ eV\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\nE_γ = (0.511 * 10⁶ eV)² / (10⁻³ eV)\nE_γ = (0.2611 * 10¹² eV²) / (10⁻³ eV)\nE_γ = 0.2611 * 10¹⁵ eV\nE_γ = 2.611 * 10¹⁴ eV\n\nThe final step is to convert this energy from electron volts (eV) to Giga-electron Volts (GeV), as the options are given in GeV.\n1 GeV = 10⁹ eV\n\nE_γ = (2.611 * 10¹⁴ eV) / (10⁹ eV/GeV)\nE_γ = 2.611 * 10⁵ GeV\n\nThis calculated value is approximately 2.6 * 10⁵ GeV, which means that gamma-rays with energies at or above this threshold will have their lifetimes in the universe significantly limited by interactions with the Cosmic Microwave Background.\n\n<<<A>>>"
