    "### Analysis of the Chemical Reaction\n\nBased on the experimental data, the decomposition of the salt mixture yields three products: water (H₂O), oxygen (O₂), and an inert gas, which is determined to be nitrogen (N₂).\n\n1.  **Water (H₂O):** The first tube, containing anhydrous magnesium perchlorate (Mg(ClO₄)₂), is a drying agent that absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n2.  **Acidic Gases:** The second tube, with a calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)₂) solution, shows no change in weight. This indicates that no acidic gases, such as CO₂ or SO₂, were formed during the decomposition.\n\n3.  **Oxygen (O₂):** The third tube, containing red-hot copper, increased in mass by 0.80 g. This is due to the reaction of copper with oxygen to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase is solely from the oxygen.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n4.  **Inert Gas (N₂):** The remaining 2.24 liters of gas C, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP), did not react with any of the previous substances. This volume corresponds to 0.1 mol of gas (2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol). The presence of nitrogen and hydrogen in the initial salts strongly suggests this gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   Moles of N₂ = 0.1 mol.\n\n### Identification of Salts A and B\n\nThe products (H₂O, N₂, O₂) indicate that the original salts must contain hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen. Given they are salts, a logical conclusion is that they are ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions. The two most common such salts are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's examine their decomposition reactions:\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite:** Decomposes to form nitrogen gas and water.\n    *   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate:** Its decomposition is more complex and depends on temperature. At around 200°C, it can decompose to produce nitrous oxide (N₂O) and water. However, at slightly higher temperatures or under specific conditions, it can decompose explosively to form nitrogen, oxygen, and water.\n    *   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nThis second decomposition pathway for ammonium nitrate produces all three observed gases. Therefore, it is highly probable that the equimolar mixture consists of ammonium nitrite (Salt A) and ammonium nitrate (Salt B).\n\n### Stoichiometric Verification\n\nLet 'n' be the number of moles for each salt in the equimolar mixture.\n\n*   From **n** moles of NH₄NO₂:\n    *   Produces **n** moles of N₂ and **2n** moles of H₂O.\n*   From **n** moles of NH₄NO₃ (using the 2:2:1:4 ratio):\n    *   Produces **n** moles of N₂, **n/2** moles of O₂, and **2n** moles of H₂O.\n\nTotal moles of products:\n*   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n\n*   Total N₂ = n + n = 2n\n*   Total O₂ = n/2\n\nUsing the experimental data:\n*   From H₂O: 4n = 0.2 mol ⇒ **n = 0.05 mol**\n*   From N₂: 2n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.1 mol (Matches the 0.1 mol of Gas C)\n*   From O₂: n/2 = 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 mol (Matches the 0.025 mol of O₂)\n\nThe calculations are consistent, confirming that the mixture contained 0.05 moles of ammonium nitrite and 0.05 moles of ammonium nitrate.\n\n### Calculation of Total Atoms\n\nNow, we determine the total number of atoms in one molecule of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite - NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   **Total atoms in A = 8**\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate - NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   **Total atoms in B = 9**\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula unit:\nTotal Atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<A>>>"
