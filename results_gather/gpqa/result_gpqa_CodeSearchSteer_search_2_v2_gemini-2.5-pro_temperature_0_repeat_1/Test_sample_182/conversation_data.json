    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product:\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material:**\n\nThe starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure to determine its molecular formula and initial IHD.\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene ring:** A six-membered carbon ring with one double bond. This accounts for one ring and one double bond.\n*   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH):** This group contains one carbon-oxygen double bond.\n*   **Formyl group (-CHO):** This aldehyde group contains one carbon-oxygen double bond.\n*   **Vinyl group (-CH=CH₂):** This group contains one carbon-carbon double bond.\n\nTo calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, we can count the rings and pi (π) bonds.\n*   1 ring = 1 IHD\n*   1 C=C in the ring = 1 IHD\n*   1 C=O in the carboxylic acid = 1 IHD\n*   1 C=O in the formyl group = 1 IHD\n*   1 C=C in the vinyl group = 1 IHD\n\nThe total IHD of the starting material is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\n**2. Understand the Reaction:**\n\nThe reagent used is red phosphorus (P) with an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. It is known to reduce various functional groups completely to alkanes.\n*   **Aldehydes (-CHO) and Ketones (>C=O):** Are reduced to their corresponding alkanes (-CH₃ or -CH₂-).\n*   **Carboxylic acids (-COOH):** Are reduced to alkanes (-CH₃).\n*   **Alcohols (-OH):** Are reduced to alkanes (-H).\n*   **Alkenes (C=C) and Alkynes (C≡C):** Are reduced to saturated alkanes (C-C).\n\nThe red phosphorus helps to regenerate HI from the iodine (I₂) formed during the reaction, allowing the reaction to proceed to completion.\n\n**3. Determine the Product:**\n\nThe reaction will reduce all the unsaturation and oxygen-containing functional groups in the starting molecule:\n*   The carboxylic acid group will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The formyl group will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The double bond in the vinyl group will be reduced, converting it to an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   The double bond within the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a single bond.\n\nThe original carbon skeleton, which includes a six-membered ring, will remain intact. However, all double bonds will be saturated, and all oxygen atoms will be removed. The final product will be a substituted cyclohexane, which is a saturated cycloalkane.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the Product:**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. Since the reaction saturates all double and triple bonds, the only feature contributing to the IHD of the product is the cyclohexane ring itself.\n\n*   A molecule with one ring has an IHD of 1.\n*   All C=C and C=O bonds have been reduced, so they contribute 0 to the final IHD.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the final product is 1.\n\n<<<B>>>"
