  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "To determine the reason for the failed protein overexpression, the provided DNA sequence must be analyzed in the context of molecular translation.\n\nThe sequence begins with `5'-ATG...`, which is the universal start codon for protein synthesis. Following the start codon is the sequence `TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC`. This corresponds to the DNA sequence for the single influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antigenic determinant, which encodes the amino acid sequence YPYDVPDYA. This tag is used for affinity purification.\n\nThe key to the problem lies in the codons immediately following the HA tag sequence. Let's analyze the sequence in triplets (codons) from the beginning:\n\n*   **ATG**: Start codon (Methionine)\n*   **TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC**: The 9 codons for the HA tag (YPYDVPDYA).\n*   **AAA**: The next codon, which codes for the amino acid Lysine.\n*   **TGA**: This is one of the three standard stop codons (along with TAA and TAG).\n\nThe presence of the `TGA` stop codon immediately after the sequence for the HA tag and one additional amino acid will signal the ribosome to halt translation. A release factor will bind to the ribosome, causing the dissociation of the ribosomal subunits and the premature release of the very short, incomplete polypeptide chain. This chain would only consist of Methionine, the HA tag, and a single Lysine. The intended full-length GADD45G protein would not be synthesized, which perfectly explains the experimental observation.\n\nEvaluating the other options:\n*   **A) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This is incorrect. Firstly, the problematic codon is TGA (UGA in the mRNA), not TAA (UAA). Secondly, stop codons are not recognized by tRNAs; they are recognized by protein release factors.\n*   **C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** While a linker can sometimes improve protein folding and stability, its absence is not a universal cause of proteolysis. The primary issue here is the failure to synthesize the full-length protein, not its degradation after synthesis.\n*   **D) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** A missense mutation would change one amino acid to another. The HA tag sequence is correct and does not contain a missense mutation. The mutation is a *nonsense* mutation (introduction of a stop codon) that occurs *after* the tag sequence.\n\nTherefore, the early termination of translation due to a premature stop codon is the correct reason for the failure to express the protein.\n\n<<<B>>>"
