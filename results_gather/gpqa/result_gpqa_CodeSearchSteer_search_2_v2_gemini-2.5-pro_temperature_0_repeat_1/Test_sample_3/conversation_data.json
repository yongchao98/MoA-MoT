    "In a universe where magnetic monopoles—isolated north or south poles—exist, two of Maxwell's equations would need to be modified. These equations are fundamental to our understanding of electromagnetism.\n\nThe first equation that would change is Gauss's law for magnetism. In our universe, this law states that the divergence of the magnetic field (∇ ⋅ B) is zero, which mathematically implies the absence of magnetic monopoles. If magnetic monopoles were to exist, this law would be altered to show that the divergence of the magnetic field is proportional to the density of magnetic charge (ρm), much like how the divergence of the electric field relates to electric charge density.\n\nThe second equation to be modified would be Faraday's law of induction. This law describes how a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field (∇ × E). In a universe with magnetic monopoles, a moving magnetic charge would constitute a \"magnetic current\" (Jm). This magnetic current would also act as a source for a circulating electric field, adding a new term to Faraday's law.\n\nTherefore, the two equations that would be different are the one related to the divergence of the magnetic field and the one related to the circulation (curl) of the electric field.\n\n<<<A>>>"
