    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)\n\nFirst, we determine the degree of unsaturation (DoU), which indicates the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in the molecule.\n\n*   **DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)**\n*   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2)\n*   DoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n\nA degree of unsaturation of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two medium-to-strong bands are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region and is typical for an ester (C=O) functional group.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\nThe proton NMR spectrum provides the most detailed information about the carbon-hydrogen framework.\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal corresponds to 3 protons, and its triplet (`t`) multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a group with 2 protons (a CH₂ group). This is characteristic of a methyl (CH₃) group in an ethyl (-CH₂CH₃) fragment.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal for 2 protons has a quartet (`q`) multiplicity, meaning it is adjacent to a group with 3 protons (a CH₃ group). This confirms the ethyl fragment. The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm suggests the CH₂ group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, such as the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (`bs`) integrating to 2 protons is a classic signal for the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The protons are exchangeable, which causes the signal to be broad.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm). The pattern of two doublets (`d`), each integrating to 2 protons, is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are deshielded by an electron-withdrawing group, while the protons at 7.0 ppm are shielded by an electron-donating group.\n\n### 4. Assembling the Structure\n\nBased on the combined data:\n*   We have a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, which is an electron-donating group.\n*   The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**, which is an electron-withdrawing group.\n\nPutting these pieces together, the structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This structure is consistent with all the provided data:\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂.\n*   **IR:** Contains an -NH₂ group and an ester C=O group.\n*   **¹H NMR:** Shows an ethyl group attached to the ester oxygen, a primary amine, and a para-substituted aromatic ring with the expected electronic effects on the proton chemical shifts.\n\n### 5. Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but the ethyl group is part of a propionate, not an ethoxy group. The CH₂ of the ethyl group would be next to a carbonyl, shifting it to ~2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted ring, which would produce a more complex NMR splitting pattern than two doublets. Also, the carbonyl is an amide, which typically appears at a lower frequency (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹) in the IR spectrum.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H band in the IR spectrum, not two. It would also have a formyl proton (-CHO) signal around 8-8.5 ppm in the NMR.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
