    "The number of loops in a Feynman diagram calculation in four-dimensional spacetime can be determined from the power of the factor `1/(4π)` that appears in the final expression. This factor arises from the integration over momentum space for each loop.\n\nIn a typical quantum field theory calculation using dimensional regularization, each loop integral contributes a factor of `1/(4π)^2` to the final amplitude. Therefore, for a diagram with `L` loops, the expression will contain a factor of `(1/(4π)^2)^L = 1/(4π)^(2L)`.\n\nThe expression found on the note is:\n`alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\nThe key term for determining the number of loops is `1/(4pi)^6`. We can set this equal to the general formula for an L-loop diagram:\n\n`1/(4π)^(2L) = 1/(4π)^6`\n\nBy comparing the exponents, we get:\n\n`2L = 6`\n`L = 3`\n\nThe other terms in the expression are consistent with a three-loop calculation:\n*   `alpha^3 * g^2`: The powers of the coupling constants (`alpha` and `g`) relate to the number of vertices in the diagram.\n*   `sqrt(2) * 8`: These are numerical factors that can arise from symmetry considerations of the diagram or from the evaluation of the integrals.\n*   `(Q/M)^2`: This term represents the ratio of two energy scales (for example, an external momentum `Q` and a particle mass `M`) and is a typical result of evaluating the momentum integrals.\n\nBased on the power of the `1/(4π)` factor, the diagram must have contained 3 loops.\n\n<<<D>>>"
