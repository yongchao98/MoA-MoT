    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy**: The total energy of the system is conserved. The total relativistic energy (E) is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy (KE) and the potential energy (PE). The relativistic harmonic oscillator is an energy-conserving system.\n\n2.  **Energy at Maximum Amplitude**: At the point of maximum amplitude, $x = A$, the mass momentarily stops, so its velocity is $v = 0$.\n    *   The kinetic energy at this point is zero.\n    *   The potential energy stored in the spring is at its maximum, given by $PE_{max} = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   Therefore, the total energy of the system is $E = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n3.  **Energy at Equilibrium Position**: The maximum speed, $v_{max}$, is achieved when the mass passes through the equilibrium position, $x = 0$.\n    *   At this point, the potential energy is zero ($PE = 0$).\n    *   The kinetic energy is at its maximum. The formula for relativistic kinetic energy is $KE = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$.\n    *   So, the maximum kinetic energy is $KE_{max} = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$, where $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n\n4.  **Equating the Energies**: By the principle of energy conservation, the total energy at the maximum amplitude is equal to the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n    $E = PE_{max} = KE_{max}$\n    $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\n5.  **Solving for $v_{max}$**: Now, we rearrange the equation to solve for the maximum speed.\n    *   First, solve for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n        $\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\gamma_{max} - 1$\n        $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    *   Substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n        $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    *   Square both sides:\n        $\\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = (1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2$\n\n    *   Invert both sides:\n        $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    *   Isolate the $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$ term:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    *   Finally, solve for $v_{max}$:\n        $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
