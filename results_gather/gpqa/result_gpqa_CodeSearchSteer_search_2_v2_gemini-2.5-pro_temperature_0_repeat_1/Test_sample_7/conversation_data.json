    "### Analysis of Genetic Interactions Reveals Gene Functions\n\nBased on the experimental results from knock-out mutants of the white lupine genes G1, G2, and G3, a specific network of genetic interactions regulating resistance to anthracnose can be deduced. The data points to G2 being a critical upstream regulator, likely a transcription factor, with G1 and G3 functioning downstream in partially overlapping or redundant pathways.\n\n**Key Observations from the Experiment:**\n\n*   **G2 is a critical resistance gene:** The single knock-out mutant *g2* shows a complete loss of resistance (0%), the most severe phenotype among the single mutants.\n*   **G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3:** The double mutants *g1g2* and *g2g3* both exhibit 0% resistance, the same phenotype as the *g2* single mutant. In genetics, when a mutation in one gene masks the effect of a mutation in another gene, it is called epistasis. Here, the *g2* mutation's effect is epistatic to (or masks) the phenotypes of *g1* and *g3*. This strongly suggests that G2 functions upstream of both G1 and G3 in the same resistance pathway. A common biological mechanism for this relationship is a transcription factor (G2) that is required to activate the expression of its target genes (G1 and G3).\n*   **G1 and G3 have a synergistic interaction:** The single mutants *g1* and *g3* have partial resistance levels of 75% and 50%, respectively. An expected additive effect in the *g1g3* double mutant would be a resistance level of approximately 25% (100% - 25% loss - 50% loss). However, the observed resistance is only 10%. This much stronger-than-expected phenotype in the double mutant is known as a synergistic interaction.\n*   **Synergy suggests gene redundancy:** Synergistic interactions, where the combined effect of two mutations is greater than the sum of their individual effects, often point to the genes having partially redundant functions. This means G1 and G3 likely operate in parallel pathways that can partially compensate for each other. When one is knocked out, the other can still provide a significant level of resistance. When both are knocked out, the system fails more catastrophically.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This option correctly identifies G2 as a likely transcription factor. However, the data does not provide evidence for pleiotropy (one gene affecting multiple traits), and G1 is not epistatic to G3 (the *g1g3* phenotype of 10% is not the same as the *g1* phenotype of 75%).\n*   **B) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** This is incorrect because the *g2* mutant has the most severe phenotype and is epistatic to *g1*, not the other way around.\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** While G2 is likely a transcription factor, whether G1 and G3 share a promoter cannot be determined from this data. Furthermore, G3 is not epistatic to G1 (the *g1g3* phenotype of 10% is not the same as the *g3* phenotype of 50%).\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This option correctly identifies G2 as a transcription factor and accurately describes the relationship between G1 and G3 as gene redundancy, which explains their synergistic interaction. Although the claim that \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" is technically incorrect based on the data, the first two statements are the strongest and most accurate conclusions drawn from the experiment. The synergistic effect observed is a hallmark of interactions between redundant genes.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most plausible conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor acting upstream of G1 and G3, and that G1 and G3 are partially redundant genes contributing to anthracnose resistance. Option D provides the best description of these relationships, despite an inaccuracy in its final clause.\n\n<<<D>>>"
