    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to find the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z:** The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   A mass percentage of hydrogen of 14.28% corresponds to an empirical formula of CH₂. This is because the mass ratio is approximately 2 (for H) to 12 (for C), which simplifies to 1:6. The percentage of hydrogen is thus 2 / (12+2) = 2/14 ≈ 14.3%.\n    *   Since Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it doesn't react further with hydrogen), its general formula must be CₙH₂ₙ₊₂ (alkane) or CₙH₂ₙ (cycloalkane).\n    *   The empirical formula CH₂ matches the general formula for a cycloalkane, CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   The problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent. A very common cycloalkane solvent that fits this description is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only substance Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   Substance Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n    *   Let the two components of Y be C and D. We know C is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n    *   The other component, D, must also be saturated and must produce cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. A plausible candidate for D is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. While benzene is unsaturated, it does not readily decolorize bromine water without a catalyst, a fact often used to distinguish it from alkenes. Severe hydrogenation conditions will convert benzene to cyclohexane.\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction:** Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, indicating the presence of carbon-carbon double bonds. The molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   The reaction from X to Y is a disproportionation reaction occurring when heated with platinum. In the context of hydrocarbons, this often involves the transfer of hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Let the components of X be A and B. The reaction is: A + B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   For this to be a balanced reaction where A and B are in a 1:1 molar ratio, it must be a hydrogen transfer. One component is hydrogenated (reduced) and the other is dehydrogenated (oxidized).\n    *   Hydrogenation of both components of X must yield cyclohexane. This means both A and B must have a six-carbon ring structure.\n    *   Let's identify plausible structures for A and B:\n        *   To produce cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) by gaining hydrogen, a likely reactant is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**.\n        *   To produce benzene (C₆H₆) by losing hydrogen, a likely reactant is a cyclohexadiene. Since the problem specifies no conjugated bonds, this must be **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   The proposed reaction is:\n        **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) + Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈) --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)**\n    *   This reaction is a balanced hydrogen transfer (disproportionation) and fits all the conditions described in the problem.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   Liquid 1 (from mixture X) is Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀), which has **10** hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid 2 (from mixture X) is Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈), which has **8** hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<A>>>"
