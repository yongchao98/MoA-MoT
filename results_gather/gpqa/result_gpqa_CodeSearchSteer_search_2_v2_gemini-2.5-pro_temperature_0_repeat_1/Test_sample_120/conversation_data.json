    "The reaction in question is the nucleophilic ring-opening of a substituted epoxide, (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, by an organocuprate, Me2CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate). The outcome of this reaction is determined by its regioselectivity and stereoselectivity.\n\n**1. Reactants Analysis:**\n*   **Epoxide:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with a fused epoxide. The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6. C1 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to three other carbons and the oxygen) and is substituted with a methyl group. C6 is a secondary carbon (bonded to two other carbons and the oxygen) and is unsubstituted.\n*   **Nucleophile:** Me2CuLi, known as a Gilman reagent, is a source of the nucleophilic methyl anion (Me⁻).\n\n**2. Regioselectivity:**\nOrganocuprates, like other strong nucleophiles under basic or neutral conditions, attack epoxides at the less sterically hindered carbon. In the given epoxide, C6 is less sterically hindered than C1, which bears a methyl group. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack C6.\n\n**3. Stereoselectivity:**\nThe ring-opening of epoxides by strong nucleophiles proceeds via an SN2-type mechanism. A key feature of the SN2 reaction is the backside attack of the nucleophile, which results in an inversion of configuration at the carbon center being attacked.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Product Determination:**\n*   **Attack:** The methyl nucleophile (Me⁻) from Me2CuLi attacks the less hindered C6 carbon.\n*   **Inversion:** The initial configuration at C6 is (S). Due to the SN2 backside attack, the configuration at this carbon inverts to (R).\n*   **Ring Opening:** The attack causes the C6-O bond to break. The C1-O bond remains momentarily, with the oxygen becoming an alkoxide. A subsequent workup step (implicit in such problems) protonates the alkoxide to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1.\n*   **Unaffected Centers:** The stereocenters at C1, C3, and C4 are not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming steps of the nucleophilic attack. Their configurations remain unchanged: C1 stays (R), C3 stays (R), and C4 stays (R).\n\n**5. Final Product Structure and Nomenclature:**\n*   The resulting product is a cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Substituents:** It has an -OH group and a methyl group on the original C1, a new methyl group on the original C6, and the original methyl groups on C3 and C4.\n*   **IUPAC Naming:** To name the product, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) is designated as C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the bicyclic system. The ring is numbered to give the other substituents the lowest possible locants, which results in a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol structure.\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   **C1:** Unchanged, remains (1R).\n    *   **C2 (originally C6):** Inverted from (S) to (R), becomes (2R).\n    *   **C4 (originally C4):** Unchanged, remains (4R).\n    *   **C5 (originally C3):** Unchanged, remains (5R).\n\nCombining these gives the final product name: **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
