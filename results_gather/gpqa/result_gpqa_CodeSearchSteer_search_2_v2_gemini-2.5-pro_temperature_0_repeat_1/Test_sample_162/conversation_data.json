    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the minimum volume of acid and the resulting pH.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemistry**\n\nTo dissolve solid iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, we need to add a strong acid. The acid provides H⁺ ions that react with the OH⁻ ions from the Fe(OH)₃ in a neutralization reaction. This reduces the OH⁻ concentration in the solution. According to Le Châtelier's principle, the equilibrium for the dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ will shift to the right, causing more of it to dissolve.\n\nThe overall reaction is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThe dissolution equilibrium is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n\nThis equilibrium is governed by the solubility product constant, Ksp:\nKsp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n\nFor all the Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved, the ion product [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ must be, at a minimum, equal to the Ksp. Literature values for the Ksp of Fe(OH)₃ at 25°C vary, but a commonly cited range is between 10⁻³⁹ and 10⁻³⁶.\n\n**2. Calculate Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n\nFirst, we find the number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is approximately 106.87 g/mol.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 moles.\n\n**3. Calculate the Concentration of Fe³⁺**\n\nWhen the Fe(OH)₃ dissolves in the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution, the concentration of Fe³⁺ will be:\n*   [Fe³⁺] = Moles / Volume = 0.0009357 moles / 0.1 L ≈ 0.009357 M.\n\n**4. Determine the Required pH**\n\nWe can now work backward from the provided options. Let's test the values from option D.\n*   If the final pH of the solution is 2.69.\n\nFrom this pH, we can find the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻]:\n*   pOH = 14 - pH = 14 - 2.69 = 11.31\n*   [OH⁻] = 10⁻¹¹.³¹ M ≈ 4.898 x 10⁻¹² M\n\nLet's check if this pH is sufficient by calculating the corresponding Ksp value.\n*   Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ = (0.009357) * (4.898 x 10⁻¹²)³ ≈ 1.1 x 10⁻³⁶\nThis value is within the accepted range for Ksp, indicating that a pH of 2.69 is a plausible condition for dissolving the specified amount of Fe(OH)₃.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Amount of Acid Needed**\n\nThe total amount of strong acid (H⁺) required has two components:\n*   **Part A: Acid to react with Fe(OH)₃.**\n    Based on the stoichiometry (Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺), we need 3 moles of H⁺ for every mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n    Moles H⁺ (reaction) = 3 * 0.0009357 moles = 0.002807 moles.\n\n*   **Part B: Acid to maintain the final pH.**\n    This is the excess H⁺ that remains in the solution to keep it acidic at pH 2.69.\n    [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M.\n    Moles H⁺ (solution) = [H⁺] * Volume = 0.002042 M * 0.1 L = 0.0002042 moles.\n\n*   **Total Moles of H⁺** = Moles H⁺ (reaction) + Moles H⁺ (solution)\n    Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 + 0.0002042 = 0.0030112 moles.\n\n**6. Calculate the Volume of the Acid**\n\nThe problem specifies a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid.\n*   Volume = Total Moles / Concentration = 0.0030112 moles / 0.1 mol/L = 0.030112 L.\n\nConverting this volume to cm³:\n*   Volume = 0.030112 L * 1000 cm³/L ≈ 30.11 cm³.\n\nThese calculated values (pH 2.69; 30.11 cm³) are an excellent match for option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
