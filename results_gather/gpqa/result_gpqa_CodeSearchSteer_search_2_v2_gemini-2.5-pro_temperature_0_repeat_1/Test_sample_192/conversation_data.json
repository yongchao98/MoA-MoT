    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine how the number of stars changes with distance:\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between distance and parallax.**\n    In astronomy, the distance to a star (r) is inversely proportional to its parallax (plx). The relationship is given by the formula r = 1/plx, where the distance is measured in parsecs and the parallax in arcseconds. This means that parallax can be expressed as a function of distance: plx = 1/r.\n\n2.  **Interpret the given information.**\n    The problem states that \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx⁵\". This describes how the number of stars is distributed as a function of parallax. Let's denote the number of stars per unit parallax interval as dN/d(plx). Therefore, we have the proportionality:\n    dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵\n\n3.  **Determine the goal.**\n    We need to find how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically the number of stars per unit range of distance. This corresponds to the quantity dN/dr.\n\n4.  **Relate the distributions using the chain rule.**\n    To find dN/dr from dN/d(plx), we can use the chain rule of calculus:\n    dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)\n\n5.  **Calculate the derivative of parallax with respect to distance.**\n    Since plx = 1/r, we can differentiate plx with respect to r:\n    d(plx)/dr = -1/r²\n    As we are interested in the magnitude of the change, we will use the absolute value, |d(plx)/dr| = 1/r².\n\n6.  **Combine the expressions.**\n    Now, substitute the proportionalities and the derivative into the chain rule equation:\n    dN/dr ∝ (1/plx⁵) * (1/r²)\n\n7.  **Express the relationship in terms of distance (r) only.**\n    Finally, replace plx with 1/r in the expression:\n    dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)⁵) * (1/r²)\n    dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²)\n    dN/dr ∝ r³\n\nThus, the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r) proportionally to r³.\n\n<<<B>>>"
