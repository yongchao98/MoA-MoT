    "The process taking place is somatic hypermutation (SHM).\n\nHere's a breakdown of the events described and why they point to SHM:\n*   **Antigen Delivery to Peyer's Patches:** The oral gavage introduces the rotavirus capsid proteins (the antigen) to the gastrointestinal tract. Peyer's patches are secondary lymphoid organs in the small intestine that survey intestinal contents and initiate immune responses. The presence of fluorescence in the Peyer's patches confirms the antigen has reached this key immune site.\n*   **B Cell Activation and Proliferation:** In the Peyer's patches, the antigen is taken up and presented to lymphocytes, including B cells. B cells that recognize the antigen become activated and begin to proliferate rapidly within specialized structures called germinal centers. This matches the observation of an isolated \"proliferating cell population.\"\n*   **High Variability in the Variable Heavy Chain:** The most critical clue is the \"high variability\" found in the variable heavy chain gene of these proliferating B cells. This variability is generated by somatic hypermutation, a process where point mutations are intentionally introduced into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes. This process allows for the selection of B cells that produce antibodies with progressively higher affinity for the antigen, a process known as affinity maturation.\n\nHere is why the other options are incorrect:\n*   **A) VDJ recombination:** This process creates the initial, vast diversity of B cell receptors by combining V (Variable), D (Diversity), and J (Joining) gene segments. However, it occurs in the bone marrow during the early development of B cells, *before* they encounter an antigen. The cells in the Peyer's patch are already mature B cells responding to an antigen.\n*   **B) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system, a cascade of proteins that helps to eliminate pathogens. It does not involve the genetic modification of B cell receptor genes.\n*   **C) Class switching recombination:** This process changes the constant region of the heavy chain, which switches the antibody's class or isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgA). This alters the antibody's function but does not affect the variable region, which is responsible for binding the antigen. The high variability was observed specifically in the *variable* region.\n\n<<<D>>>"
