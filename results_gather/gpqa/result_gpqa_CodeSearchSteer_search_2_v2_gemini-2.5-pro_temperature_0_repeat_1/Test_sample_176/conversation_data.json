    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio**: We want to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star\\_1 (L₁) to that of Star\\_2 (L₂):\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    Simplifying this gives:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that the radius of Star\\_1 is 1.5 times that of Star\\_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂).\n    So, (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n    Substituting this into our equation gives:\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n4.  **Wien's Displacement Law and Doppler Shift**:\n    *   Wien's Displacement Law relates a star's surface temperature (T) to the intrinsic peak wavelength (λ_rest) of its emitted light: T ∝ 1/λ_rest. Therefore, the ratio of temperatures is T₁/T₂ = λ_rest₂ / λ_rest₁.\n    *   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths (λ_obs) are the same for both stars. The observed wavelength is affected by the star's radial velocity due to the Doppler effect.\n    *   For Star\\_1, the radial velocity is 0, so its observed peak wavelength is equal to its intrinsic peak wavelength: λ_obs₁ = λ_rest₁.\n    *   For Star\\_2, with a radial velocity (v₂) of 700 km/s, its light is redshifted. The observed wavelength is related to the rest wavelength by the formula for Doppler shift: λ_obs₂ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v₂/c), where c is the speed of light (approximately 300,000 km/s).\n    *   Since λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂, we have: λ_rest₁ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n\n5.  **Temperature Ratio**: Now we can find the ratio of the temperatures:\n    T₁/T₂ = λ_rest₂ / λ_rest₁\n    Substituting the relationship from the Doppler shift:\n    T₁/T₂ = λ_rest₂ / (λ_rest₂ * (1 + v₂/c)) = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n6.  **Final Calculation**: Substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (1 / (1 + v₂/c))⁴\n    Now, plug in the values for v₂ and c:\n    *   v₂ = 700 km/s\n    *   c = 300,000 km/s\n    *   v₂/c = 700 / 300,000 = 7/3000 ≈ 0.002333\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 7/3000)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00937\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23. The information about the masses of the stars is not needed for this calculation.\n\nTherefore, the luminosity of Star\\_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star\\_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<A>>>"
