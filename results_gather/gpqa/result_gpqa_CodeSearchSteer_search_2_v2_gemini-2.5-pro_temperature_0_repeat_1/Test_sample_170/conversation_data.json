    "To arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction, we must analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### Analysis of Substituents\n\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution. The substituent already on the ring determines where the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br+) will add. Substituents are classified as either ortho-, para-directing or meta-directing.\n\n1.  **С₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is an activating, ortho-, para-director.\n2.  **C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate):** The ethyl carboxylate group (-COOC₂H₅) is a deactivating, meta-director.\n3.  **C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group (-Cl) is a deactivating, ortho-, para-director.\n4.  **C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group (-NO₂) is a strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n5.  **C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is an activating, ortho-, para-director.\n6.  **C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The carboxyl group (-COOH) is a deactivating, meta-director.\n\n### Ordering the Substances\n\nThe yield of the para-isomer is significantly lower for meta-directing groups compared to ortho-, para-directing groups. Therefore, substances 4, 2, and 6 will have the lowest para-isomer yields.\n\n**1. Meta-directing groups (lowest para-yield):**\n*   **4 (C₆H₅-NO₂):** The -NO₂ group is a very strong deactivating meta-director. Bromination of nitrobenzene primarily yields the meta-isomer, with very small amounts of ortho and para products.\n*   **2 (C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅) and 6 (C₆H₅-COOH):** The -COOC₂H₅ and -COOH groups are also deactivating meta-directors. Their deactivating strength is generally considered less than the nitro group but still strong. For nitration, a benzoic ester gave 73% meta, 22% ortho, and only 5% para product. The para-yield for these will be very low, but likely slightly higher than for the strongly deactivated nitrobenzene. It is difficult to definitively order -COOH and -COOC₂H₅ without specific data for bromination, but they are often grouped together in terms of directing effects. Based on available data for similar reactions, the order of increasing para-yield among these is generally considered to be NO₂ < COOH ≈ COOC₂H₅. Let's assume for this problem that the deactivating strength correlates inversely with para-yield, so the order is 4 < 2 < 6 or 4 < 6 < 2.\n\n**2. Ortho-, para-directing groups (highest para-yield):**\nFor these groups, the distribution between the ortho and para positions is primarily influenced by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will hinder attack at the nearby ortho positions, thus increasing the proportion of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **1 (С₆H₅-CH₃ - Toluene):** The methyl group is relatively small. It allows for significant substitution at both ortho and para positions. For nitration, toluene gives about 37% para-product.\n*   **5 (C₆H₅-C₂H₅ - Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance disfavors the ortho position more than in toluene, leading to a higher para/ortho ratio and thus a higher yield of the para-isomer.\n*   **3 (C₆H₅-Cl - Chlorobenzene):** Halogens are an exception; although they are deactivating, they are ortho-, para-directors. The chloro group often leads to a high percentage of the para-isomer. For example, nitration of chlorobenzene yields 70% para-product. This high para-selectivity is a known characteristic for halogens.\n\n**3. Combining and Finalizing the Order:**\n\nLet's establish the order from lowest to highest para-yield:\n\n*   The meta-directors will come first: 4, 2, and 6. Based on the strong deactivating nature of the nitro group, it will have the lowest para-yield. Between -COOH and -COOC₂H₅, their directing effects are similar, but typically the ester group is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid. However, some sources place the para yield for nitration of benzoic esters (5%) lower than what might be expected for benzoic acid. A common order of deactivating strength is -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOR. A stronger deactivating effect generally correlates with a lower ortho/para yield. Thus, the order of increasing para-yield is likely 4 < 6 < 2.\n*   The ortho-, para-directors will come next: 1, 5, and 3.\n    *   Comparing alkyl groups, the bulkier ethyl group (5) will give more para-product than the methyl group (1) due to greater steric hindrance at the ortho positions. So, 1 < 5.\n    *   Comparing the alkyl groups to the chloro group (3), halogens are known to give very high para-selectivity. The para-isomer is the major product in the halogenation of chlorobenzene, often around 87-90%. This is significantly higher than for toluene (around 62% para) or ethylbenzene. Therefore, chlorobenzene (3) will have the highest para-yield among the o,p-directors.\n*   So, the order for the o,p-directors is 1 < 5 < 3.\n\nCombining the two groups, the complete sequence for increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
