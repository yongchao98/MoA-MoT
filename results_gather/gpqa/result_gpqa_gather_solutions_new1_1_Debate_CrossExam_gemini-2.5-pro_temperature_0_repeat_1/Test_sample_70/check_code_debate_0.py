def check_correctness():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to the exoplanet temperature ratio problem.

    The core physics principles are:
    1. Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq) is proportional to the inverse square root of the orbital distance (a): T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2).
    2. Kepler's Third Law states that the orbital period squared (P^2) is proportional to the orbital distance cubed (a^3): P^2 ∝ a^3, which means a ∝ P^(2/3).

    Combining these, we get the relationship between temperature and period:
    T_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2) = P^(-1/3).

    Therefore, the ratio of temperatures for two planets (4 and 2) is:
    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4 / P2)^(-1/3) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3).
