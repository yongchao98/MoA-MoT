The strong base, amide (NH2-), abstracts a proton or a deuteron from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the bromine-bearing carbon.\n\nTwo distinct pathways are possible, leading to different intermediates:\n\n**Pathway 1: Abstraction of a proton (H)**\n*   The amide ion removes a proton from the carbon at position 6 (C6) of the benzene ring. This is the kinetically favored step because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (a principle known as the kinetic isotope effect).\n*   This elimination leads to the formation of a **3-deuterobenzyne** intermediate, where the triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium atom remains at C2.\n*   The nucleophile (NH2- or NH3) can then attack either carbon of the benzyne triple bond.\n    *   Attack at C1 results in the formation of **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   Attack at C6 results in the formation of **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n**Pathway 2: Abstraction of a deuteron (D)**\n*   The amide ion removes the deuteron from the carbon at position 2 (C2). This step is slower due to the stronger C-D bond.\n*   This elimination results in the formation of a non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate, as the deuterium atom is removed in this process. The triple bond forms between C1 and C2.\n*   Nucleophilic attack on this symmetrical benzyne intermediate, followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent, yields only one product: **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\nCombining the outcomes of both possible pathways, three distinct organic products can be formed:\n1.  2-deuteroaniline\n2.  3-deuteroaniline\n3.

In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two different ortho atoms that can be removed: a hydrogen at position 6 and a deuterium at position 2. This leads to two competing elimination pathways:\n\n1.  **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the hydrogen (H) from position 6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from position 1 creates a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between carbons 1 and 6. The deuterium at position 2 remains untouched. This intermediate is called **3-deutero-benzyne**.\n2.  **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuterium (D) from position 2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from position 1 creates a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between carbons 1 and 2. In this process, the deuterium is removed from the molecule, resulting in a non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\nDue to the kinetic isotope effect, breaking a C-H bond is faster than breaking a C-D bond, so Pathway A is favored. However, both reactions occur, leading to the formation of two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n**Step 2: Addition of the Nucleophile**\n\nThe amide anion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the triple bond in each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deutero-benzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    *   Attack at carbon 1: This places the amino group (-NH₂) at position 1 and, after protonation, yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   Attack at carbon 6: This places the amino group at position 6. When the ring is renumbered to give the amino group the lowest number (position 1), the deuterium is now at position 3. This yields **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    *   Attack at either carbon 1 or 2 of the non-deuterated benzyne intermediate, followed by protonation, results in a single product: **aniline**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the outcomes of both pathways, three distinct organic products are possible:\n1.  2-deuteroaniline\n2.  3-deuteroaniline\n3.

Therefore, the amide anion will preferentially abstract the proton from the C6 position. This is the kinetically favored step. The subsequent elimination of the bromide ion results in a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. Crucially, the deuterium atom remains at the C2 position. This intermediate is 3-deuterobenzyne.\n*   **Pathway B (Minor):** Although less likely, it is possible for the amide anion to abstract the deuteron from the C2 position. This would lead to the formation of a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. In this case, the deuterium atom is removed, resulting in a non-deuterated benzyne intermediate.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide anion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Attack on 3-Deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    *   If the amide attacks C1, the resulting anion at C6 is protonated to form **3-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   If the amide attacks C6, the resulting anion at C1 is protonated to form **2-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Attack on Benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    *   The amide can attack either C1 or C2 of the non-deuterated benzyne. In either case, after protonation, the product is simply **aniline**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the products from both possible pathways, we find three distinct organic products:\n\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuterioaniline\n3.  3-deuterioaniline\n\nTherefore, there are three possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base like NaNH2 proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Mechanism Analysis**\n\n**Step I: Elimination to form Benzyne Intermediate(s)**\n\nThe first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr) to form a benzyne. The strong base, amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a position *ortho* to the leaving group (the bromine atom).\n\nIn 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n*   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThis leads to two possible elimination pathways:\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The amide ion (NH₂⁻) removes the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n    2.  The resulting negative charge on C6 causes the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected.\n    4.  The intermediate formed is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The amide ion (NH₂⁻) removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2.\n    2.  The resulting negative charge on C2 causes the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed from the molecule in this process.\n    4.  The intermediate formed is **benzyne** (non-deuterated).\n\n**Careful Point:** The C-H bond is weaker and more easily broken than the C-D bond. This is known as the kinetic isotope effect. Therefore, Pathway A (abstraction of H) is the major pathway, and Pathway B (abstraction of D) is the minor pathway. However, the question asks for *all possible* products, so we must consider the products from both intermediates.\n\n**Step II: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe second step is the addition of a nucleophile to the benzyne intermediate. The amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as the nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate 1 (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n    *   The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either carbon.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** NH₂ adds to C1. A carbanion is formed at C6, which is then protonated by NH₃. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** NH₂ adds to C6. A carbanion is formed at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH₂ group the lowest number (position 1), the deuterium is at position 3. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate 2 (Benzyne):**\n    *   The triple bond is between C1 and C2. This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The NH₂⁻ attacks either C1 or C2. The resulting carbanion is protonated. In either case, the final product is **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\n**3. Summary of All Possible Products**\n\nBy considering both possible elimination pathways and the subsequent addition steps, we can identify three distinct organic products:\n1.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n2.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products formed in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH₂) in condensed ammonia proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate. The strong base, amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from the positions ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom.\n\nIn this specific molecule, there are two different ortho positions:\n*   **C6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **C2**, which has a deuterium atom (D), an isotope of hydrogen.\n\nThis leads to two competing elimination pathways:\n\n1.  **Pathway 1: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from C1, forming a benzyne intermediate where the new triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains on the ring. The subsequent addition of the amide nucleophile (NH₂⁻) to this benzyne can occur at two positions:\n    *   **Attack at C1:** This leads to the formation of 2-deuterioaniline (o-deuterioaniline).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** This leads to the formation of 3-deuterioaniline (m-deuterioaniline).\n\n2.  **Pathway 2: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This is generally slower than proton abstraction due to the kinetic isotope effect. This elimination also results in the loss of the bromide ion from C1, forming a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium label is removed from the molecule. The addition of the amide nucleophile to this benzyne intermediate (at either C1 or C2) yields a single product:\n    *   **Aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂).\n\nCombining the outcomes of both pathways, three distinct organic products are possible:\n*   Aniline\n*   2-deuterioaniline\n*   3-deuterioaniline\n\nTherefore, there are three possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem involves the reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base, which proceeds through a benzyne intermediate via an elimination-addition mechanism.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that occurs via a benzyne mechanism.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate (Elimination)**\nThe strong base, the amide ion (NH2-), abstracts a proton from a position ortho (adjacent) to the leaving group (bromine). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n1.  **Position C2:** This position is occupied by a deuterium atom (D).\n2.  **Position C6:** This position is occupied by a hydrogen atom (H).\n\nThe C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the **kinetic isotope effect (KIE)**, a base will abstract a proton (H+) more readily and quickly than a deuteron (D+). However, both abstractions are possible. This leads to the formation of two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A (Major Pathway): Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the proton from C6.\n    2.  A carbanion is formed at C6.\n    3.  This carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6.\n    4.  The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected in this step. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n     \n\n*   **Pathway B (Minor Pathway): Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This is slower than H+ abstraction.\n    2.  A carbanion is formed at C2.\n    3.  This carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n    4.  The deuterium atom is removed from the ring. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n     \n\n**Step 3: Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates (Addition)**\nThe nucleophile, which is the amide ion (NH2-), attacks one of the two carbon atoms of the benzyne triple bond. This is followed by protonation from the solvent (ammonia, NH3) to give the final product(s).\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2. The incoming NH2- can attack either C1 or C6.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The NH2 group attaches to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated by NH3. The final product has the NH2 group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The NH2 group attaches to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the NH2 group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring starting from the NH2 group at C1, the deuterium is at position 3. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n     \n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C2, and there is no deuterium. The NH2- can attack either C1 or C2.\n    1.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** Regardless of which carbon is attacked, the subsequent protonation results in the same product: **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n     \n\n**Step 4: Count the Total Number of Possible Products**\nBy considering both possible elimination pathways and the subsequent addition steps, we have identified three distinct organic products:\n1.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nSince the question asks for the number of *possible* organic products, we must count all products that can be formed, even those formed via a minor pathway. Therefore, there are 3 possible products.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base, sodium amide (NaNH2), in liquid ammonia. This reaction proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (D) at position C2.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2). This provides the amide ion (:NH2-), which is a very strong base and a good nucleophile.\n*   **Solvent:** Liquid ammonia (NH3). It acts as a solvent and a proton source in the final step.\n*   **Mechanism:** The conditions are classic for an elimination-addition reaction via a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr) to form a benzyne. The strong base, NH2-, abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThe base can abstract either the proton from C6 or the deuteron from C2.\n\n*   **Path A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the primary kinetic isotope effect (KIE), the abstraction of the proton from C6 is significantly faster than the abstraction of the deuteron from C2.\n    1.  The amide ion removes the proton from C6, creating a carbanion at C6.\n    2.  This carbanion intermediate then loses the bromide ion (Br-) from C1.\n    3.  The result is a benzyne intermediate where the new triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected in this process. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Path B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    Although slower, the abstraction of the deuteron from C2 by the strong base is still a possible reaction pathway.\n    1.  The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2, creating a carbanion at C2.\n    2.  This carbanion loses the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  The result is a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium atom was removed in this step, the resulting intermediate is the normal, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed in the reaction.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe second step is the addition of a nucleophile, the amide ion (NH2-), to the benzyne intermediates. This is followed by protonation from the solvent (NH3).\n\n*   **Reaction of Intermediate from Path A (3-deuterobenzyne)**\n    This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium at C2. The nucleophile NH2- can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group attaches to C1, forming a carbanion at C6. Protonation of this carbanion by NH3 yields **aniline-2-d** (or 2-deuterioaniline).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH2 group attaches to C6, forming a carbanion at C1. Protonation of this carbanion by NH3 yields **aniline-3-d** (or 3-deuterioaniline).\n    So, Path A leads to two distinct products.\n\n*   **Reaction of Intermediate from Path B (Benzyne)**\n    This intermediate is the standard non-deuterated benzyne, with a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The amide ion can attack either C1 or C2. Due to the symmetry of the intermediate with respect to the outcome, both attacks lead to the formation of a carbanion which, upon protonation by NH3, yields the same single product: **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n    So, Path B leads to one product.\n\n**4. Conclusion: Counting the Possible Products**\nBy considering both possible elimination pathways and the subsequent addition reactions, we can identify all the possible organic products.\n1.  **Aniline-2-d** (from Path A)\n2.  **Aniline-3-d** (from Path A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Path B)\n\nThese three products are structurally distinct isomers (isotopomers). Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\nThe question asks for the number of *possible* products, so even though the products from Path B (aniline) will be formed in a smaller amount than those from Path A, they must be included in the count.\n\nThe final answer is 3.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem involves an elimination-addition reaction mechanism proceeding through a benzyne intermediate. The key is to consider all possible pathways for the formation of the intermediate and the subsequent addition of the nucleophile.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Identify the possible sites for deprotonation on the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, by the strong base NaNH2.\n2.  Determine the structure of the benzyne intermediate(s) formed from each deprotonation pathway.\n3.  For each unique benzyne intermediate, determine the possible products formed by the addition of the amide nucleophile (NH2-).\n4.  Count the total number of unique organic products.\n\n**Execution of Step 1 & 2:**\nThe starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. The strong base, amide (NH2-), will abstract a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the bromine leaving group. There are two such positions:\n*   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H). Abstraction of this H is fast and leads to an anion at C6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D). Abstraction of D is slower than H abstraction due to the kinetic isotope effect (C-D bond is stronger than C-H). However, it is still a possible pathway. Abstraction of this D leads to an anion at C2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium is removed. This intermediate is **non-deuterated benzyne**.\n\nThus, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: 3-deuterobenzyne and benzyne.\n\n**Execution of Step 3:**\nNow, we consider the nucleophilic addition of the amide ion (NH2-) to each of these intermediates, followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne:** The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and a deuterium is at C2. The NH2- can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The NH2 group attaches to C1. The resulting carbanion at C6 is protonated. The final product has the NH2 group at C1 and the D at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The NH2 group attaches to C6. The resulting carbanion at C1 is protonated. The final product has the NH2 group at C6 and the D at C2. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Products from non-deuterated benzyne:** The triple bond is between C1 and C2, and there are no deuterium atoms.\n    3.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** The NH2- group adds to either C1 or C2. The resulting carbanion is protonated by the solvent. Since there is no deuterium label, the only product from this pathway is **aniline**.\n\n**Execution of Step 4:**\nBy considering all possible pathways, we have identified three distinct organic products:\n1.  2-deuterioaniline\n2.  3-deuterioaniline\n3.  Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed ammonia is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of possible organic products:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe strong base, amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions:\n*   **Position 6, which has a hydrogen (H) atom.**\n*   **Position 2, which has a deuterium (D) atom.**\n\nDue to the kinetic isotope effect, a C-H bond is weaker and broken more easily than a C-D bond. This means two different elimination pathways are possible, leading to two different benzyne intermediates:\n\n1.  **Major Pathway (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion, forming a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains at position 2. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n2.  **Minor Pathway (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This is a slower process but still possible. The elimination of the bromide ion results in a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2.

The strong base, amide (NH2-), initiates the reaction.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction pathways:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion can abstract a proton (H) or a deuteron (D) from the positions ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of Hydrogen:** The amide ion can remove the hydrogen atom from the C6 position. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1, resulting in the formation of a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. Crucially, the deuterium atom at the C2 position remains in this intermediate. This intermediate is called **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of Deuterium:** The amide ion can also remove the deuteron from the C2 position. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1, forming a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring. This intermediate is simply **benzyne**, with no deuterium.\n\nDue to the kinetic isotope effect, the C-H bond is broken more easily and faster than the C-D bond. Therefore, Pathway A is favored, but both reactions are possible and will occur, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH2-), acting as a nucleophile, then attacks the benzyne intermediates. This is followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent to yield the final products.\n\n*   **From 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    *   Attack at C1: The NH2- group adds to C1. This leads to the formation of **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   Attack at C6: The NH2- group adds to C6. This results in the formation of **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **From benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    *   Attack at either C1 or C2: Since this intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium, the addition of the NH2- group at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, yields a single product: **aniline**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCounting the distinct organic molecules produced from all possible pathways, we have:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuterioaniline\n3.  3-deuterioaniline\n\nTherefore, there are three possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH₂) in condensed ammonia proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate. This reaction can produce three distinct organic products.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of how these products are formed:\n\n1.  **Formation of Benzyne Intermediates:** The strong base, amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the bromine-bearing carbon. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions:\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion can remove a hydrogen atom (H) from position 6. This is generally faster than removing deuterium due to the kinetic isotope effect (the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond). This elimination of HBr leads to the formation of **3-deuterobenzyne**, where the triple bond is between carbons 1 and 6, and the deuterium remains at position 2.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion can also remove the deuterium atom (D) from position 2. This is a slower process but still possible. This elimination of DBr results in a different benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between carbons 1 and 2. This benzyne intermediate does not contain deuterium.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates:** The amide ion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):** The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n        *   Attack at carbon 1 leads to the formation of **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   Attack at carbon 6 leads to the formation of **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n    *   **Product from the non-deuterated benzyne (from Pathway B):** The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) attacks the benzyne formed after the deuterium was removed.\n        *   Attack at either carbon 1 or 2, followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent, results in the formation of **aniline** (which contains no deuterium).\n\nTherefore, the three possible organic products from this reaction are 2-deuterioaniline, 3-deuterioaniline, and aniline.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe constraint-based analysis and the Python code execution both correctly determined that there are three possible unique organic products: 2-deuteroaniline, 3-deuteroaniline, and aniline.

The checker confirms this result is correct.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed ammonia proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n1.  **Elimination Step:** The strong base, the amide anion (NH2-), abstracts an acidic proton from a position ortho to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such positions:\n    *   The deuterium atom at the C2 position.\n    *   The hydrogen atom at the C6 position.\n\n2.  **Formation of Benzyne Intermediates:** This leads to two possible benzyne intermediates.\n    *   **Pathway A (Major):** Abstraction of the hydrogen from C6 is kinetically favored over the abstraction of the heavier deuterium isotope from C2 due to the kinetic isotope effect. This pathway leads to the formation of a 2-deuteriobenzyne intermediate, where the triple bond is between C1 and C6.\n    *   **Pathway B (Minor):** Abstraction of the deuterium from C2 leads to a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed in this process.\n\n3.  **Addition-Protonation Step:** The nucleophilic amide anion then attacks the benzyne intermediates, followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent.\n    *   **Products from Pathway A (2-deuteriobenzyne):**\n        *   Attack at C1: The amino group adds to C1. Subsequent protonation at C6 yields *ortho*-deuterioaniline.\n        *   Attack at C6: The amino group adds to C6. Subsequent protonation at C1 yields *meta*-deuterioaniline.\n    *   **Products from Pathway B (benzyne):**\n        *   Attack at C1 or C2: Since the deuterium was removed to form this intermediate, attack by the amide anion at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, results in the formation of non-deuterated aniline.\n\nCounting the unique products from all possible pathways, we have:\n1.  *ortho*-deuterioaniline\n2.  *meta*-deuterioaniline\n3.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n**1. Identify the Reaction Type**\nThe reaction involves an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) and a very strong base (sodium amide, NaNH₂). These conditions are characteristic of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a highly reactive \"benzyne\" intermediate.\n\n**2. Analyze the Elimination Step (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe first step is the removal of a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom by the strong amide base (NH₂⁻). In the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two different ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon has a standard hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D), which is an isotope of hydrogen.\n\nThis leads to two possible elimination pathways:\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. The resulting carbanion then expels the bromide ion from C1 to form a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is not involved in this step. The resulting intermediate is **3-deutero-benzyne**. This pathway is kinetically favored because the C-H bond is weaker and easier to break than the C-D bond (a phenomenon known as the kinetic isotope effect).\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion can also remove the deuteron from C2. Although this is a slower process, it is still a possible reaction. The subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this pathway, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule, resulting in a standard, non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\nSince the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider the outcomes from both benzyne intermediates.\n\n**3. Analyze the Addition Step (Nucleophilic Attack)**\nIn the second step, the amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deutero-benzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    *   The nucleophile can attack C1. This places the amino group (-NH₂) at C1, and the subsequent protonation of C6 yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   The nucleophile can attack C6. This places the amino group at C6. After renumbering the ring to give the amino group the primary position (C1), the deuterium is now at C3. This product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    *   The nucleophile attacks the non-deuterated benzyne. Since this intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium, attack at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, yields a single product: **aniline**.\n\n**4. Conclusion: Count the Unique Products**\nBy considering all possible pathways, we identify three distinct organic products that can be formed:\n1.  2-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n2.  3-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n3.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"

The strong base, amide (NH2-), abstracts a proton or a deuteron from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the bromine-bearing carbon.\n\nTwo distinct pathways are possible, leading to different intermediates:\n\n**Pathway 1: Abstraction of a proton (H)**\n*   The amide ion removes a proton from the carbon at position 6 (C6) of the benzene ring. This is the kinetically favored step because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (a principle known as the kinetic isotope effect).\n*   This elimination leads to the formation of a **3-deuterobenzyne** intermediate, where the triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium atom remains at C2.\n*   The nucleophile (NH2- or NH3) can then attack either carbon of the benzyne triple bond.\n    *   Attack at C1 results in the formation of **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   Attack at C6 results in the formation of **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n**Pathway 2: Abstraction of a deuteron (D)**\n*   The amide ion removes the deuteron from the carbon at position 2 (C2). This step is slower due to the stronger C-D bond.\n*   This elimination results in the formation of a non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate, as the deuterium atom is removed in this process. The triple bond forms between C1 and C2.\n*   Nucleophilic attack on this symmetrical benzyne intermediate, followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent, yields only one product: **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\nCombining the outcomes of both possible pathways, three distinct organic products can be formed:\n1.  2-deuteroaniline\n2.  3-deuteroaniline\n3.

In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two different ortho atoms that can be removed: a hydrogen at position 6 and a deuterium at position 2. This leads to two competing elimination pathways:\n\n1.  **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the hydrogen (H) from position 6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from position 1 creates a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between carbons 1 and 6. The deuterium at position 2 remains untouched. This intermediate is called **3-deutero-benzyne**.\n2.  **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuterium (D) from position 2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from position 1 creates a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between carbons 1 and 2. In this process, the deuterium is removed from the molecule, resulting in a non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\nDue to the kinetic isotope effect, breaking a C-H bond is faster than breaking a C-D bond, so Pathway A is favored. However, both reactions occur, leading to the formation of two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n**Step 2: Addition of the Nucleophile**\n\nThe amide anion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the triple bond in each benzyne intermediate.

Therefore, the amide anion will preferentially abstract the proton from the C6 position. This is the kinetically favored step. The subsequent elimination of the bromide ion results in a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. Crucially, the deuterium atom remains at the C2 position. This intermediate is 3-deuterobenzyne.\n*   **Pathway B (Minor):** Although less likely, it is possible for the amide anion to abstract the deuteron from the C2 position. This would lead to the formation of a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2.

Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base like NaNH2 proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Mechanism Analysis**\n\n**Step I: Elimination to form Benzyne Intermediate(s)**\n\nThe first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr) to form a benzyne. The strong base, amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a position *ortho* to the leaving group (the bromine atom).\n\nIn 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n*   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThis leads to two possible elimination pathways:\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The amide ion (NH₂⁻) removes the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n    2.  The resulting negative charge on C6 causes the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected.\n    4.  The intermediate formed is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The amide ion (NH₂⁻) removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2.\n    2.  The resulting negative charge on C2 causes the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed from the molecule in this process.\n    4.  The intermediate formed is **benzyne** (non-deuterated).\n\n**Careful Point:** The C-H bond is weaker and more easily broken than the C-D bond. This is known as the kinetic isotope effect. Therefore, Pathway A (abstraction of H) is the major pathway, and Pathway B (abstraction of D) is the minor pathway. However, the question asks for *all possible* products, so we must consider the products from both intermediates.\n\n**Step II: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe second step is the addition of a nucleophile to the benzyne intermediate. The amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as the nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate 1 (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n    *   The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either carbon.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** NH₂ adds to C1. A carbanion is formed at C6, which is then protonated by NH₃. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** NH₂ adds to C6. A carbanion is formed at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH₂ group the lowest number (position 1), the deuterium is at position 3. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate 2 (Benzyne):**\n    *   The triple bond is between C1 and C2. This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The NH₂⁻ attacks either C1 or C2. The resulting carbanion is protonated. In either case, the final product is **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\n**3. Summary of All Possible Products**\n\nBy considering both possible elimination pathways and the subsequent addition steps, we can identify three distinct organic products:\n1.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n2.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products formed in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH₂) in condensed ammonia proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate. The strong base, amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from the positions ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom.\n\nIn this specific molecule, there are two different ortho positions:\n*   **C6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **C2**, which has a deuterium atom (D), an isotope of hydrogen.\n\nThis leads to two competing elimination pathways:\n\n1.  **Pathway 1: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from C1, forming a benzyne intermediate where the new triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains on the ring. The subsequent addition of the amide nucleophile (NH₂⁻) to this benzyne can occur at two positions:\n    *   **Attack at C1:** This leads to the formation of 2-deuterioaniline (o-deuterioaniline).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** This leads to the formation of 3-deuterioaniline (m-deuterioaniline).\n\n2.  **Pathway 2: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This is generally slower than proton abstraction due to the kinetic isotope effect. This elimination also results in the loss of the bromide ion from C1, forming a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium label is removed from the molecule. The addition of the amide nucleophile to this benzyne intermediate (at either C1 or C2) yields a single product:\n    *   **Aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂).\n\nCombining the outcomes of both pathways, three distinct organic products are possible:\n*   Aniline\n*   2-deuterioaniline\n*   3-deuterioaniline\n\nTherefore, there are three possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem involves the reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base, which proceeds through a benzyne intermediate via an elimination-addition mechanism.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that occurs via a benzyne mechanism.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate (Elimination)**\nThe strong base, the amide ion (NH2-), abstracts a proton from a position ortho (adjacent) to the leaving group (bromine). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n1.  **Position C2:** This position is occupied by a deuterium atom (D).\n2.  **Position C6:** This position is occupied by a hydrogen atom (H).\n\nThe C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the **kinetic isotope effect (KIE)**, a base will abstract a proton (H+) more readily and quickly than a deuteron (D+). However, both abstractions are possible. This leads to the formation of two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A (Major Pathway): Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the proton from C6.\n    2.  A carbanion is formed at C6.\n    3.  This carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6.\n    4.  The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected in this step. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n     \n\n*   **Pathway B (Minor Pathway): Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This is slower than H+ abstraction.\n    2.  A carbanion is formed at C2.\n    3.  This carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n    4.  The deuterium atom is removed from the ring. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n     \n\n**Step 3: Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates (Addition)**\nThe nucleophile, which is the amide ion (NH2-), attacks one of the two carbon atoms of the benzyne triple bond. This is followed by protonation from the solvent (ammonia, NH3) to give the final product(s).\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2. The incoming NH2- can attack either C1 or C6.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The NH2 group attaches to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated by NH3. The final product has the NH2 group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The NH2 group attaches to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the NH2 group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring starting from the NH2 group at C1, the deuterium is at position 3. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n     \n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C2, and there is no deuterium. The NH2- can attack either C1 or C2.\n    1.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** Regardless of which carbon is attacked, the subsequent protonation results in the same product: **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n     \n\n**Step 4: Count the Total Number of Possible Products**\nBy considering both possible elimination pathways and the subsequent addition steps, we have identified three distinct organic products:\n1.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nSince the question asks for the number of *possible* organic products, we must count all products that can be formed, even those formed via a minor pathway. Therefore, there are 3 possible products.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base, sodium amide (NaNH2), in liquid ammonia. This reaction proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (D) at position C2.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2). This provides the amide ion (:NH2-), which is a very strong base and a good nucleophile.\n*   **Solvent:** Liquid ammonia (NH3). It acts as a solvent and a proton source in the final step.\n*   **Mechanism:** The conditions are classic for an elimination-addition reaction via a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr) to form a benzyne. The strong base, NH2-, abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThe base can abstract either the proton from C6 or the deuteron from C2.\n\n*   **Path A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the primary kinetic isotope effect (KIE), the abstraction of the proton from C6 is significantly faster than the abstraction of the deuteron from C2.\n    1.  The amide ion removes the proton from C6, creating a carbanion at C6.\n    2.  This carbanion intermediate then loses the bromide ion (Br-) from C1.\n    3.  The result is a benzyne intermediate where the new triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected in this process. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Path B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    Although slower, the abstraction of the deuteron from C2 by the strong base is still a possible reaction pathway.\n    1.  The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2, creating a carbanion at C2.\n    2.  This carbanion loses the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  The result is a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium atom was removed in this step, the resulting intermediate is the normal, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed in the reaction.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe second step is the addition of a nucleophile, the amide ion (NH2-), to the benzyne intermediates. This is followed by protonation from the solvent (NH3).\n\n*   **Reaction of Intermediate from Path A (3-deuterobenzyne)**\n    This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium at C2. The nucleophile NH2- can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group attaches to C1, forming a carbanion at C6. Protonation of this carbanion by NH3 yields **aniline-2-d** (or 2-deuterioaniline).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH2 group attaches to C6, forming a carbanion at C1. Protonation of this carbanion by NH3 yields **aniline-3-d** (or 3-deuterioaniline).\n    So, Path A leads to two distinct products.\n\n*   **Reaction of Intermediate from Path B (Benzyne)**\n    This intermediate is the standard non-deuterated benzyne, with a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The amide ion can attack either C1 or C2. Due to the symmetry of the intermediate with respect to the outcome, both attacks lead to the formation of a carbanion which, upon protonation by NH3, yields the same single product: **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n    So, Path B leads to one product.\n\n**4. Conclusion: Counting the Possible Products**\nBy considering both possible elimination pathways and the subsequent addition reactions, we can identify all the possible organic products.\n1.  **Aniline-2-d** (from Path A)\n2.  **Aniline-3-d** (from Path A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Path B)\n\nThese three products are structurally distinct isomers (isotopomers). Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\nThe question asks for the number of *possible* products, so even though the products from Path B (aniline) will be formed in a smaller amount than those from Path A, they must be included in the count.\n\nThe final answer is 3.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem involves an elimination-addition reaction mechanism proceeding through a benzyne intermediate. The key is to consider all possible pathways for the formation of the intermediate and the subsequent addition of the nucleophile.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Identify the possible sites for deprotonation on the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, by the strong base NaNH2.\n2.  Determine the structure of the benzyne intermediate(s) formed from each deprotonation pathway.\n3.  For each unique benzyne intermediate, determine the possible products formed by the addition of the amide nucleophile (NH2-).\n4.  Count the total number of unique organic products.\n\n**Execution of Step 1 & 2:**\nThe starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. The strong base, amide (NH2-), will abstract a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the bromine leaving group. There are two such positions:\n*   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H). Abstraction of this H is fast and leads to an anion at C6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D). Abstraction of D is slower than H abstraction due to the kinetic isotope effect (C-D bond is stronger than C-H). However, it is still a possible pathway. Abstraction of this D leads to an anion at C2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium is removed. This intermediate is **non-deuterated benzyne**.\n\nThus, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: 3-deuterobenzyne and benzyne.\n\n**Execution of Step 3:**\nNow, we consider the nucleophilic addition of the amide ion (NH2-) to each of these intermediates, followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne:** The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and a deuterium is at C2. The NH2- can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The NH2 group attaches to C1. The resulting carbanion at C6 is protonated. The final product has the NH2 group at C1 and the D at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The NH2 group attaches to C6. The resulting carbanion at C1 is protonated. The final product has the NH2 group at C6 and the D at C2. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Products from non-deuterated benzyne:** The triple bond is between C1 and C2, and there are no deuterium atoms.\n    3.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** The NH2- group adds to either C1 or C2. The resulting carbanion is protonated by the solvent. Since there is no deuterium label, the only product from this pathway is **aniline**.\n\n**Execution of Step 4:**\nBy considering all possible pathways, we have identified three distinct organic products:\n1.  2-deuterioaniline\n2.  3-deuterioaniline\n3.  Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed ammonia is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of possible organic products:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe strong base, amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions:\n*   **Position 6, which has a hydrogen (H) atom.**\n*   **Position 2, which has a deuterium (D) atom.**\n\nDue to the kinetic isotope effect, a C-H bond is weaker and broken more easily than a C-D bond. This means two different elimination pathways are possible, leading to two different benzyne intermediates:\n\n1.  **Major Pathway (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion, forming a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains at position 2. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n2.  **Minor Pathway (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This is a slower process but still possible. The elimination of the bromide ion results in a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was removed, this intermediate is the non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the highly reactive triple bond in each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Addition to 3-deuterobenzyne (from the major pathway):**\n    *   Attack at C1: The amino group attaches to C1, and subsequent protonation at C6 yields **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   Attack at C6: The amino group attaches to C6, and subsequent protonation at C1 yields **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Addition to benzyne (from the minor pathway):**\n    *   Attack at either C1 or C2 of the symmetrical benzyne intermediate, followed by protonation, yields a single product: **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the products from both possible pathways, we find three distinct organic products:\n1.  2-deuterioaniline\n2.  3-deuterioaniline\n3.  Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are three possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. The strong base, amide (NH2-), initiates the reaction.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction pathways:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion can abstract a proton (H) or a deuteron (D) from the positions ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of Hydrogen:** The amide ion can remove the hydrogen atom from the C6 position. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1, resulting in the formation of a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. Crucially, the deuterium atom at the C2 position remains in this intermediate. This intermediate is called **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of Deuterium:** The amide ion can also remove the deuteron from the C2 position. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1, forming a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring. This intermediate is simply **benzyne**, with no deuterium.\n\nDue to the kinetic isotope effect, the C-H bond is broken more easily and faster than the C-D bond. Therefore, Pathway A is favored, but both reactions are possible and will occur, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH2-), acting as a nucleophile, then attacks the benzyne intermediates. This is followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent to yield the final products.\n\n*   **From 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    *   Attack at C1: The NH2- group adds to C1. This leads to the formation of **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   Attack at C6: The NH2- group adds to C6. This results in the formation of **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **From benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    *   Attack at either C1 or C2: Since this intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium, the addition of the NH2- group at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, yields a single product: **aniline**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCounting the distinct organic molecules produced from all possible pathways, we have:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuterioaniline\n3.  3-deuterioaniline\n\nTherefore, there are three possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH₂) in condensed ammonia proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate. This reaction can produce three distinct organic products.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of how these products are formed:\n\n1.  **Formation of Benzyne Intermediates:** The strong base, amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the bromine-bearing carbon. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions:\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion can remove a hydrogen atom (H) from position 6. This is generally faster than removing deuterium due to the kinetic isotope effect (the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond). This elimination of HBr leads to the formation of **3-deuterobenzyne**, where the triple bond is between carbons 1 and 6, and the deuterium remains at position 2.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion can also remove the deuterium atom (D) from position 2. This is a slower process but still possible. This elimination of DBr results in a different benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between carbons 1 and 2. This benzyne intermediate does not contain deuterium.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates:** The amide ion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):** The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n        *   Attack at carbon 1 leads to the formation of **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   Attack at carbon 6 leads to the formation of **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n    *   **Product from the non-deuterated benzyne (from Pathway B):** The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) attacks the benzyne formed after the deuterium was removed.\n        *   Attack at either carbon 1 or 2, followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent, results in the formation of **aniline** (which contains no deuterium).\n\nTherefore, the three possible organic products from this reaction are 2-deuterioaniline, 3-deuterioaniline, and aniline.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe constraint-based analysis and the Python code execution both correctly determined that there are three possible unique organic products: 2-deuteroaniline, 3-deuteroaniline, and aniline.

The checker confirms this result is correct.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed ammonia proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n1.  **Elimination Step:** The strong base, the amide anion (NH2-), abstracts an acidic proton from a position ortho to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such positions:\n    *   The deuterium atom at the C2 position.\n    *   The hydrogen atom at the C6 position.\n\n2.  **Formation of Benzyne Intermediates:** This leads to two possible benzyne intermediates.\n    *   **Pathway A (Major):** Abstraction of the hydrogen from C6 is kinetically favored over the abstraction of the heavier deuterium isotope from C2 due to the kinetic isotope effect. This pathway leads to the formation of a 2-deuteriobenzyne intermediate, where the triple bond is between C1 and C6.\n    *   **Pathway B (Minor):** Abstraction of the deuterium from C2 leads to a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed in this process.\n\n3.  **Addition-Protonation Step:** The nucleophilic amide anion then attacks the benzyne intermediates, followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent.\n    *   **Products from Pathway A (2-deuteriobenzyne):**\n        *   Attack at C1: The amino group adds to C1. Subsequent protonation at C6 yields *ortho*-deuterioaniline.\n        *   Attack at C6: The amino group adds to C6. Subsequent protonation at C1 yields *meta*-deuterioaniline.\n    *   **Products from Pathway B (benzyne):**\n        *   Attack at C1 or C2: Since the deuterium was removed to form this intermediate, attack by the amide anion at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, results in the formation of non-deuterated aniline.\n\nCounting the unique products from all possible pathways, we have:\n1.  *ortho*-deuterioaniline\n2.  *meta*-deuterioaniline\n3.
