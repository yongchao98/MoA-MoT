def check_organic_reaction_products():
    """
    This function simulates the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2
    to determine the number of possible organic products.

    The reaction proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism (benzyne intermediate).

    1.  Elimination Step: A strong base (NH2-) removes a proton/deuteron from a
        position ortho to the bromine. This creates a benzyne intermediate.
    2.  Addition Step: The nucleophile (NH2-) attacks the benzyne, followed by
        protonation from the solvent (NH3).

    # ortho atom (H at C6 or D at C2) is removed.

    # The resulting intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6.
