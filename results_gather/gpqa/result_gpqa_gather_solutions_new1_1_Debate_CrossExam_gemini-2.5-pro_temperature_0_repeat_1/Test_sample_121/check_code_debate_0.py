    # Step 1: Define the expected final product from the reaction sequence.

    # Reaction 3: Ethyl bromoacetate -> Ethyl cyanoacetate (SN2 with NaCN)
    # Reaction 4: Ethyl cyanoacetate + 1,5-dibromopentane + excess NaH -> Cyclization
    # The alpha-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate and the 5-carbon chain form a 6-membered ring.

    # Step 2: Analyze the symmetry and count the distinct 1H NMR signals for the final product.

    # The plane of symmetry makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5. C4 is unique.
