def check_physics_answer(candidate_answer_letter: str):
    """
    Checks the correctness of a candidate answer for the given electrostatics problem.

    The function works by encoding fundamental physics principles as constraints
    and checking which option satisfies them.

    Principle 1: Electrostatic Shielding. The electric field outside a conductor
                 is independent of the static charge configuration inside any
                 cavities. Therefore, the formula for the external field E cannot
                 depend on variables describing the internal geometry, such as 's'
                 (cavity offset), 'l' (distance from cavity center), or 'theta'.

    Principle 2: Shell Theorem (from Gauss's Law). The electric field outside a
                 uniformly charged sphere depends on the total charge 'q' and the
                 distance 'L' from the center of the sphere.
