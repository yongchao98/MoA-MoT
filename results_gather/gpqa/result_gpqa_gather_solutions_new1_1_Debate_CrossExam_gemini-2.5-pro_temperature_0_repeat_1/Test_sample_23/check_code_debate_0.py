        return "Reason: The fundamental deduction that a 14.28% H mass fraction implies a CnH2n formula is flawed. 1/7 is not close enough to 0.1428."

    # The reasoning identifies Z as cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's verify this candidate.
    Z_formula = {'C': 6, 'H': 12}

    # Check other constraints for Z:
    # - Saturated (no further reaction with H2): Correct, cyclohexane is saturated.
    # - Widely used as a solvent: Correct, cyclohexane is a common solvent.

    # - Does not decolorize bromine water: Correct. Cyclohexane is saturated, and benzene (aromatic) does not react with Br2 water.
    # - Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z: Correct. Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of cyclohexane gives cyclohexane.
    # - Z is a constituent of Y: Correct. Cyclohexane is in the proposed mixture.

    # --- Step 3: Verify the Reaction and Conservation of Atoms ---
    # The reaction is a disproportionation: Mixture X -> Mixture Y.

    # - Decolorizes bromine water: Correct, both are unsaturated.
    # - No conjugated multiple bonds: Correct, cyclohexene has one double bond, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated.
    # - Hydrogenation gives only Z: Correct, both C6H10 and C6H8 hydrogenate to C6H12.
