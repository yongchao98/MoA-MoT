    """
    Verifies the correct answer for the relativistic harmonic oscillator problem.

    The function performs three checks:
    1. Symbolically derives the expression for v_max from the principle of
       conservation of relativistic energy.
    2. Compares the derived expression with the formula given in option D.
    3. Performs physical sanity checks on option D:
       a) Ensures it reduces to the classical result in the non-relativistic limit (c -> infinity).
       b) Ensures the predicted speed is always less than the speed of light (v_max < c).
