    This function verifies the solution to the physics problem about electron uncertainty.

    The problem asks for the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE) given:
    - Uncertainty in position (Δx) = 0.1 nm
    - Speed of the electron (v) = 2 * 10^8 m/s

    The solution involves two main steps:
    1. Use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2) to find the minimum
       uncertainty in momentum (Δp).
    2. Use the energy-momentum relationship for a particle (ΔE ≈ v * Δp) to find
       the minimum uncertainty in energy.
