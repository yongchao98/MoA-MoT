    This function checks the correctness of the final answer for the given chemistry problem.
    It codifies the logical steps required to solve the problem:
    1.  Analyzes Reaction A (Wittig Rearrangement) to determine the plausible product from the options.
    2.  Analyzes Reaction B (Cope Rearrangement) to determine the plausible product based on the principle of isomerization.
    3.  Combines the constraints to find the single correct option.
    4.  Compares the derived correct option with the provided answer.
