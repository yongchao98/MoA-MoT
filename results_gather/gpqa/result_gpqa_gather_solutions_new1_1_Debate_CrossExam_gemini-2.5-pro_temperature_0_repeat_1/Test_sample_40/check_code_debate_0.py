    Checks the correctness of the answer for the speed of light in a moving medium.

    The problem asks for the speed of light in a moving glass (refractive index n, velocity v)
    relative to a stationary observer, with the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

    The provided answer is 'B', which corresponds to the formula (1 + n*v) / (n + v).
    This function verifies this formula against:
    1. The formula derived from the relativistic velocity addition rule.
    2. Key physical constraints (vacuum case and stationary medium case).
