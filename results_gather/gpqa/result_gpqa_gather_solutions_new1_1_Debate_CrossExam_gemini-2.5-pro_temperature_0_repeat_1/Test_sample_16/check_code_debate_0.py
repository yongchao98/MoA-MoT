    # --- Analysis of the Provided Answer ---
    # The final answer provided by the LLM analysis is <<<D>>>.
    # The options listed in the original question are:
    # A) 5.0x10^-3 M
    # B) 1.0x10^-2 M
    # C) 2.0x10^-2 M
    # D) 6.3x10^-7 M
    # The value corresponding to the chosen answer 'D' is 6.3e-7 M.
    expected_value = 6.3e-7

    # --- Theoretical Calculation ---
    # The equilibrium is the dissociation of the complex: [Ca-EDTA]^2-  â‡Œ  Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-
    # The dissociation constant (Kd) is the inverse of the formation constant (Kf).
    Kd = 1 / Kf
    
    # We need to solve the equilibrium expression: Kd = x^2 / (initial_complex_conc - x)
    # where x is the equilibrium concentration of [Ca^2+].
    # This can be rearranged into the standard quadratic form: ax^2 + bx + c = 0
    # x^2 + Kd*x - Kd*initial_complex_conc = 0
    a = 1.0
    b = Kd

    # x = [-b + sqrt(discriminant)] / 2a
    calculated_concentration = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * a)
    
    # --- Verification Step ---
    # We compare the calculated concentration with the value from the chosen answer.
    # The value in option D (6.3e-7) is given with two significant figures. Our calculated
    # value (~6.32e-7) is more precise. The answer is correct if our value rounds to the given one.
    # We use math.isclose with a relative tolerance to account for this rounding.
    # A 2% relative tolerance is appropriate for comparing a calculated value to an answer
    # with two significant figures.
