    # We need to find the temperature ratio T1/T2.
    
    # From Wien's Law, T1/T2 = λ_rest_2 / λ_rest_1
    
    # The problem states observed peak wavelengths are the same: λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2
    # We relate observed and rest wavelengths using the Doppler effect.
    # For v << c, the non-relativistic approximation λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c) is sufficient.
    
    # For Star 1 (v1 = 0): λ_obs_1 = λ_rest_1
    # For Star 2 (v2 = 700 km/s): λ_obs_2 = λ_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c)
