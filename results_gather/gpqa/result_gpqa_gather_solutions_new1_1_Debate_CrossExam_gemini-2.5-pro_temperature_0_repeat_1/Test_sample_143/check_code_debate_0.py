    m_X_GeV = 1.2      # Rest mass energy in GeV
    Gamma_X_MeV = 320.0  # Decay width in MeV

    # --- Physical Constants ---
    # We use the product of the reduced Planck constant and the speed of light (hbar * c).
    # A high-precision value from CODATA 2018 is used to minimize rounding errors.
    # hbar * c â‰ˆ 197.3269804 MeV*fm (where 1 fm = 1e-15 m)
    hbar_c_MeV_fm = 197.3269804

    # --- Unit Conversion ---
    # To ensure consistency, all energy-related values are converted to MeV.
    E_X_MeV = E_X_GeV * 1000
    m_X_MeV = m_X_GeV * 1000

    # --- Calculation ---
    # The formula for the mean decay distance (L) is:
    # L = (p*c / m*c^2) * (hbar*c / Gamma)
    # where p is the momentum.

    # Step 1: Calculate the momentum term (p*c) using the relativistic energy-momentum relation:
    # E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2  =>  p*c = sqrt(E^2 - (m*c^2)^2)

    # Step 2: Calculate the mean decay distance L in femtometers (fm).
