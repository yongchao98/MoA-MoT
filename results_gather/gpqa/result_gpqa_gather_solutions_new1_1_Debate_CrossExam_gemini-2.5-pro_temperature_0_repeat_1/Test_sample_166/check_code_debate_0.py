def check_non_gaussianity_calculation():
    """
    This function calculates the non-Gaussianity (nG) for the given Schr√∂dinger cat state
    and compares the result with the provided answer.

    The calculation follows these steps:
    1. The non-Gaussianity (nG) for a pure state measured by relative entropy simplifies
       to the von Neumann entropy of the reference Gaussian state, nG = S(tau).
    2. The reference state tau has the same first and second moments as the original state.
       For the given parameters (phi=-pi/4), the state is an "odd cat state".
    3. The moments are calculated: <a^2> = alpha^2 and <n> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2).
    4. The entropy S(tau) is calculated from the symplectic eigenvalue 'nu', where
       nu^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2.
    5. The entropy formula is S(tau) = (nu + 1/2)ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2)ln(nu - 1/2).
    6. The calculated nG is compared to the options to find the closest one.
    7. This closest option is checked against the provided answer.
