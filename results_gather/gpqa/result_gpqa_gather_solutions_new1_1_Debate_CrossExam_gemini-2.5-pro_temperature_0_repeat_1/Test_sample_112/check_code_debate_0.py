    The logic is as follows:
    1.  From FTIR and Mass Spec, the presence of a carboxylic acid is confirmed.
        This requires the molecule to have exactly 2 oxygen atoms.
    2.  From FTIR and 1H NMR, the presence of an alkene (C=C) is confirmed.
    3.  A carboxylic acid (C=O) and an alkene (C=C) together require a
        Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of exactly 2.
    4.  The code will find which of the options satisfies both constraints and
