        return f"Incorrect. The final product should be a cyclohexanone derivative. Answer {final_answer_key} describes a different molecular structure: {answer_to_check['name']}."

    # Step 1: Check the hydroxyl group and its stereochemistry.
    # The -OH group is at C4 and its (S) stereochemistry is preserved throughout the synthesis.

        return f"Incorrect. The stereochemistry at C4 should be (S), as it is preserved from the starting material. Answer {final_answer_key} has C4-{answer_to_check['stereochem'].get('C4')}."

    # Step 2: Check the outcome of the tandem conjugate addition and alkylation.
    # Phenyl group adds to C3, anti to C4-OTBS, resulting in (3R).
    # Benzyl group adds to C2, anti to C3-Ph, resulting in (2S).

    if answer_to_check['stereochem'].get('C3') != 'R':
        return f"Incorrect. The stereoselective conjugate addition of the phenyl group should result in (R) stereochemistry at C3. Answer {final_answer_key} has C3-{answer_to_check['stereochem'].get('C3')}."

    # LDA is a bulky base that forms the kinetic enolate by deprotonating the less hindered C6 position.
    # Therefore, the methyl group must be at C6. This is a critical check.
