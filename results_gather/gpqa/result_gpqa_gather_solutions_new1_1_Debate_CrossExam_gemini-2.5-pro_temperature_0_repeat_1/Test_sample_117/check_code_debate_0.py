    # --- Step 1: Apply Chemical Principles to Determine the Correct Product ---
    # Principle 1: The reactant is an enol (a C=C double bond with an -OH group on one of the carbons).
    # Principle 2: The reaction of an enol with a halogen (like Br2) is a classic alpha-halogenation.
    # Principle 3: The mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of the enol's double bond on the electrophilic bromine.
    # Principle 4: The reaction results in the addition of a bromine atom to the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the C-OH, which is C2) and the tautomerization of the enol to the more stable keto form (a C=O group at C1).
    # Principle 5: This alpha-halogenation pathway is the major pathway because the formation of the strong, stable C=O bond is thermodynamically highly favorable.
