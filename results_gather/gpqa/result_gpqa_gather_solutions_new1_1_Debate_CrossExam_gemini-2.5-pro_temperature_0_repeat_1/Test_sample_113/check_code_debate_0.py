Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reagents for the given chemical reactions.

### **Analysis of Reaction 1**

*   **Reaction:** `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`
*   **Reaction Type:** This is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone.
*   **Mechanism:** The reaction proceeds in two main steps:
    1.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The cyanide ion (CN⁻), a strong nucleophile from NaCN, attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.
    2.  **Protonation:** The negatively charged alkoxide intermediate is then protonated by an acid to form the stable hydroxyl (-OH) group of the final cyanohydrin product.
*   **Identifying Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺) for the protonation step. H₃O⁺ represents a hydronium ion, which is the chemical species present in an acidic aqueous solution (an "acidic workup"). This is the standard way to complete the reaction. NaHSO₃ is used for a different type of reaction (bisulfite addition) and is incorrect.
*   **Conclusion for A:** Reagent **A is H₃O⁺**. This eliminates options C and D.

### **Analysis of Reaction 2**

*   **Reaction:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`
*   **Reaction Type:** This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-C≡N) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).
*   **Mechanism:** The hydrolysis of nitriles requires vigorous conditions, typically heating with a strong acid or a strong base in the presence of water.
*   **Identifying Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis.
    *   **HCl (Hydrochloric acid)** is a strong mineral acid and is a standard, effective reagent for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.
    *   **CH₃COOH (Acetic acid)** is a weak acid and is generally not strong enough to efficiently catalyze this reaction to completion.
*   **Conclusion for B:** Reagent **B is HCl**. This eliminates option B.

### **Final Decision**

Based on the analysis:
*   Reagent A must be **H₃O⁺**.
*   Reagent B must be **HCl**.

The only option that matches both of these requirements is A.
