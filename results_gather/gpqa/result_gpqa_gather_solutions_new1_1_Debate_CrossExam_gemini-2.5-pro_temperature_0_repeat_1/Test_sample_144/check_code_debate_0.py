    This function programmatically verifies the number of stereoisomers for
    6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol.

    It follows the standard procedure:
    1. Identify chiral carbons.
    2. Identify double bonds capable of E/Z isomerism.
    3. Sum the stereocenters and calculate 2^n.
