    Checks the correctness of the answer to the organic chemistry question.

    The function models the two reactions by considering:
    1. The chemoselectivity of the reducing agents (LiBH4 and BH3).
    2. The change in Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents
       on the chiral center, which determines the final R/S designation.
