Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.

### Step 1: Analyze the Context and the Key Phrase
The conversation occurs between two synthetic organic chemists. A core task in their work is synthesizing molecules and then purifying them from a mixture of starting materials, byproducts, and the desired product. The phrase "my compounds are on top of each other" is a colloquialism, or lab jargon, used to describe a problem. The visual nature of the phrase "on top of each other" strongly suggests a problem that is observed visually.

### Step 2: Evaluate Common Separation Techniques in Organic Chemistry
Chemists use several techniques to separate and purify compounds:
*   **Chromatography (TLC and Column):** This is the most common method. In Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC), compounds are separated on a plate, and the result is visualized as spots at different positions. If two compounds fail to separate, their spots will overlap, literally appearing "on top of each other." This technique separates compounds primarily based on differences in their **polarity**.
*   **Distillation:** This technique separates liquids based on differences in their **boiling points**. While a failed separation (co-distillation) is a problem, the phrase "on top of each other" is not the typical way to describe it.
*   **Recrystallization:** This purifies solids based on differences in solubility. Again, the phrasing does not fit this technique well.
*   **Extraction:** This separates compounds based on their differential solubility in two immiscible liquids, which is also related to polarity. However, in this case, the liquids themselves form layers that are on top of each other, which is the goal, not a problem.

### Step 3: Connect the Phrase to the Most Likely Technique
The phrase "on top of each other" is a perfect visual description for the outcome of a TLC experiment where compounds have not separated. On a TLC plate, unresolved compounds appear as a single, elongated spot or as two overlapping spots. This phenomenon is known as co-elution and is a frequent challenge in chromatography.

### Step 4: Determine the Underlying Chemical Principle
The primary principle behind the most common forms of chromatography is **polarity**. A stationary phase (like silica gel) is typically polar. Compounds in the mixture are moved along the stationary phase by a mobile phase (a solvent). Non-polar compounds travel faster and further, while polar compounds are more attracted to the stationary phase and move more slowly. When two compounds have very similar polarities, they travel at nearly the same rate, leading to poor separation and the "on top of each other" result. A question on a research forum directly asks for help with "two spots on TLC, one sitting atop the other (close Rf)," confirming this terminology is used to describe a separation problem caused by similar properties.

### Step 5: Evaluate the Given Options
*   **A) The compounds they are working with have similar polarities.** This is the direct cause of a failed chromatographic separation, which is the situation most accurately described by the chemist's phrase.
*   **B) The compounds they are working with have similar boiling points.** This would be a problem for separation by distillation, but the jargon used is characteristic of chromatography.
*   **C) The compounds they are working with have similar optical rotations.** Optical rotation is a property of chiral molecules and is not the basis for separation in standard lab chromatography.
*   **D) The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.** While these forces are the fundamental basis for polarity, "similar polarities" is the more direct and specific reason for the failed separation. It is the macroscopic property that the chemist is observing and trying to manipulate.

### Conclusion
The chemist's statement is a common and descriptive way of saying that a chromatographic separation has failed. This failure is a direct result of the compounds in the mixture having very similar polarities, which prevents them from being resolved by the technique.
