    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.

    **1. Understand the Core Concept: Regularization at High Energies**

    The question asks which physical theory does not require "regularization at high energies." This concept is central to quantum field theory (QFT).

    *   **High-Energy Divergences:** In QFT, when physicists calculate physical quantities (like the mass or charge of a particle), the calculations often yield an infinite result. This usually happens because the theory assumes particles can interact at a single point in spacetime, leading to integrals that "blow up" when considering interactions with infinitely high energy (or, equivalently, at infinitesimally short distances). These are called "ultraviolet (UV) divergences."
    *   **Regularization:** This is a mathematical technique used to manage these infinities. It involves temporarily modifying the theory, for example, by introducing an artificial energy "cutoff" to make the calculations finite. This is the first step in a process called renormalization, which ultimately yields finite, physically meaningful predictions.
    *   **The Question:** The question is asking which of the listed theories is fundamentally constructed in a way that these high-energy infinities never appear in the first place, making the procedure of regularization unnecessary.

    **2. Analyze Each Option**

    *   **A) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the quantum theory of electromagnetism. QED is the classic example of a theory that *requires* regularization and renormalization. Its early calculations were plagued by infinities in loop diagrams, and the development of regularization was a historic breakthrough that made the theory predictive.

    *   **B) Classical Electrodynamics:** While not a quantum theory, it has its own version of a high-energy divergence. If you model an electron as a true mathematical point, the energy stored in its own electric field (its "self-energy") becomes infinite. This indicates a breakdown of the theory at short distances and requires a form of regularization (e.g., assuming the particle has a small but non-zero radius) to avoid the infinity.

    *   **C) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** This is the quantum theory of the strong force. As a quantum field theory similar to QED, its calculations also produce UV divergences in loop diagrams. Therefore, QCD absolutely *requires* regularization and renormalization.

    *   **D) Superstring Theory:** This theory was developed partly to solve the problem of infinities. Its core idea is that fundamental entities are not point-like particles but tiny, one-dimensional vibrating "strings." This extended nature of strings "smears out" their interactions. Instead of interacting at a single, infinitely small point, strings interact over a small but finite region. This fundamental change smooths out the short-distance behavior that causes UV divergences in point-particle theories. As a result, Superstring Theory is believed to be "UV-finite," meaning it is free from these high-energy divergences and does not require regularization for this purpose.

    **3. Conclusion**

    Quantum Electrodynamics, Classical Electrodynamics, and Quantum Chromodynamics all suffer from infinities related to high-energy/short-distance behavior that must be handled with some form of regularization. Superstring Theory is unique among the choices because its fundamental structure is designed to naturally avoid these ultraviolet divergences.
