    Checks the correctness of the provided answer for the Lorentz factor problem.

    The problem involves relativistic particle decay. The fraction of surviving particles 'f'
    is related to the Lorentz factor 'gamma' by the formula:
    f = exp(-K / gamma), where K is a constant related to the particle's proper lifetime
    and the detector's radius.

    From this, we can derive that for two scenarios (1 and 2):
    gamma_1 * ln(1/f_1) = gamma_2 * ln(1/f_2)

    We can solve for gamma_2:
    gamma_2 = gamma_1 * (ln(1/f_1) / ln(1/f_2))
