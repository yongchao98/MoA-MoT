    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, taking into account the provided answers.

    ### **Step 1: Identification of the Starting Material (Compound X)**

    The first crucial step is to correctly identify the structure of Compound X from the spectroscopic data.

    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**
        *   The very broad absorption from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is a definitive characteristic of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid.
        *   The strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) bond in a carboxylic acid.
        *   The peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ indicate an aromatic ring.
        *   **Conclusion:** The IR data points conclusively to an aromatic carboxylic acid.

    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**
        *   The broad singlet at **10.5 ppm (1H)** confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).
        *   The two doublets at **8.0 ppm (2H)** and **7.2 ppm (2H)** are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group.
        *   The remaining signals define the alkyl substituent:
            *   The signals for a `-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)` group (a **sec-butyl** group) are all present: a methine proton (CH) attached to the ring at 2.9 ppm, a methylene group (CH₂) at 1.7 ppm, a doublet for a methyl group at 1.4 ppm, and a triplet for another methyl group at 0.9 ppm.

    *   **Structure of Compound X:** The combined data unambiguously identifies Compound X as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (C) in the list. Almost all candidate answers correctly performed this step.

    ### **Step 2: Analysis of the Chemical Reaction**

    The second step is to understand the chemical transformation that occurs.

    *   **Reagents:** The reagents are red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).
    *   **Reaction Type:** This combination is a well-known, powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its specific function in this context is the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid group.
    *   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced all the way to a methyl group (-CH₃). The aromatic ring and the sec-butyl alkyl group are stable under these conditions and remain unchanged.

    ### **Step 3: Determination of the Final Product**

    Combining the findings from the first two steps gives the final product.

    *   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
    *   **Transformation:** The -COOH group is converted to a -CH₃ group.
    *   **Final Product Name:** 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

    ### **Step 4: Matching the Final Product with the Given Options**

    The final and most important step is to match the identified product with the correct multiple-choice option.

    *   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect. The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.
    *   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - **Correct.** This name exactly matches the deduced final product.
    *   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - Incorrect. This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.
    *   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect. This is a completely different molecular structure.

    **Conclusion on Candidate Answers:**
    A review of the candidate answers shows that while most correctly identified the starting material and the final product by name, there were widespread errors in matching the final product's name to the correct letter option. Many incorrectly chose <<<A>>> or <<<C>>>. The correct chemical reasoning, however, consistently leads to 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.
