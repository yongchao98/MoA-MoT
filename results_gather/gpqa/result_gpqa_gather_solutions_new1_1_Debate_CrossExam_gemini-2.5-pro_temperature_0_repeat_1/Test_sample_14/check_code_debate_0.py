    The function performs the following steps:
    1. Calculates the ratio of transit probabilities (p1/p2) based on the problem's constraints.
       - Transit probability (p) is proportional to R_star / a.
       - From Kepler's Third Law, a is proportional to (M_star * P^2)^(1/3).
       - Given R_s1 = R_s2, M_s1 = 2*M_s2, and P2 = 3*P1.
       - This leads to p1/p2 = a2/a1 = (9/2)^(1/3).
    2. Determines the correct option based on the calculated ratio.

Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating careful points to ensure accuracy.

### Step 1: Define the Goal and Identify Key Formulas
The primary goal is to determine which planet, Planet_1 or Planet_2, has a higher probability of transiting its host star and to quantify the ratio of their probabilities.

Two key physical principles are required:
1.  **Geometric Transit Probability (`p_transit`)**: For a planet in a circular orbit, this is the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`).
    *   `p_transit ≈ R_s / a`
2.  **Kepler's Third Law**: This law relates a planet's orbital period (`P`), its semi-major axis (`a`), and the mass of its host star (`M_s`).
    *   `P² ∝ a³ / M_s`

### Step 2: Formulate the Ratio of Probabilities
We need to find the ratio `p_transit,1 / p_transit,2`.
*   `Ratio = p_transit,1 / p_transit,2 = (R_s1 / a1) / (R_s2 / a2)`

The problem states that both host stars have the same radii (`R_s1 = R_s2`). This simplifies the equation significantly.

*   **Careful Point 1**: Since the stellar radii are equal, they cancel out, and the ratio of probabilities becomes the *inverse* of the ratio of the semi-major axes. A planet with a smaller orbit (smaller `a`) will have a higher transit probability.
    *   `Ratio = a2 / a1`

### Step 3: Use Kepler's Law to Find the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes
We need to express the semi-major axis `a` in terms of the given quantities, `P` and `M_s`. We can rearrange Kepler's Third Law:
*   `a³ ∝ P² * M_s`
*   `a ∝ (P² * M_s)^(1/3)`

Now we can find the ratio `a2 / a1`:
*   `a2 / a1 = [ (P₂² * M_s2) / (P₁² * M_s1) ]^(1/3)`

### Step 4: Substitute Given Information and Solve
The problem provides the following relationships:
*   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: `P₁ = P₂ / 3` or `P₂ = 3 * P₁`.
*   The mass of the host star of Planet_1 is twice that of Planet_2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`.

Now, substitute these into the ratio for the semi-major axes:
*   `a2 / a1 = [ ((3 * P₁)² * M_s2) / (P₁² * (2 * M_s2)) ]^(1/3)`

*   **Careful Point 2**: Ensure the squares and substitutions are applied correctly. `(3 * P₁)²` becomes `9 * P₁²`.
    *   `a2 / a1 = [ (9 * P₁² * M_s2) / (2 * P₁² * M_s2) ]^(1/3)`

The terms `P₁²` and `M_s2` cancel out, leaving a simple numerical ratio:
*   `a2 / a1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3)`

### Step 5: Calculate the Final Value and Interpret the Result
The final step is to calculate the cube root of 4.5.
*   `(4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65096...`

Since `Ratio = p_transit,1 / p_transit,2 = a2 / a1`, we have:
*   `p_transit,1 / p_transit,2 ≈ 1.65`

This result means the transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1.

### Step 6: Match the Result to the Options
Let's review the given choices:
*   A) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.
*   B) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.
*   C) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.
*   D) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.

Our calculated result ("Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability") perfectly matches option D.

*   **Careful Point 3 (Analysis of other agents)**: A review of the candidate answers shows that while most agents correctly performed the physics calculation to arrive at the ~1.65 factor, many failed in the final step of correctly matching this result to the corresponding option letter. This highlights the importance of carefully cross-referencing the final calculated answer with the provided choices.
