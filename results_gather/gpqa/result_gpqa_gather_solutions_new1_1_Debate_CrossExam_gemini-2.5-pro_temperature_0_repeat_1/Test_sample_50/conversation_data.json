This work is equal to the potential energy of the interaction between the charge `q` and the fields created by the induced charges on the sphere. In the image method, this is equivalent to the interaction between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n    However, a crucial point is that the potential energy of the system is half the interaction energy of the real charge with the image charge.

The magnitude of this image charge is *q' = -q(R/d)*, and it is located at a distance *b = R²/d* from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the center to the point charge *q*.\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge *q* from infinity to the distance *d*. This work is equivalent to half the potential energy of the interaction between the real charge *q* and the image charge *q'*.

The grounded conducting sphere can be replaced by an image charge, which, together with the original charge `q`, creates a potential of zero on the surface of the sphere.\n\n1.  **Image Charge and its Location**:\n    For a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, an image charge `q'` is placed along the same line.\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -q(R/d)`.\n    *   The position of the image charge, `b`, from the center of the sphere is `b = R²/d`.\n\n2.  **Potential Energy Calculation**:\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d`. This is equivalent to the potential energy of the charge `q` due to the potential created by the image charge `q'`. However, the total electrostatic energy of the system is half the interaction energy between the charge and its image. This factor of 1/2 arises because the energy is stored in the electric field, which exists only in the space outside the sphere.\n\n3.  **Interaction Energy**:\n    First, let's calculate the interaction energy between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n    *   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `distance = d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`.\n    *   The potential energy of interaction (`U_interaction`) between two point charges is given by `k * q1 * q2 / r`.\n    *   `U_interaction = k * q * q' / (d - b)`\n    *   Substituting the values for `q'` and `(d-b)`:\n        `U_interaction = k * q * (-qR/d) / ((d² - R²)/d)`\n    *   Simplifying the expression:\n        `U_interaction = - (k * q² * R) / (d² - R²)`\n\n4.  **Net Potential Energy of the System**:\n    The net potential energy of the system is half of the interaction energy.\n    *   `U = (1/2) * U_interaction`\n    *   `U = (1/2) * [- (k * q² * R) / (d² - R²)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nD) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the net potential energy of the system.\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem and the Method of Images**\n\n*   **System:** We have a point charge `q` and a conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n*   **Condition:** The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is held at a constant potential of zero (V = 0).\n*   **Goal:** Calculate the total potential energy `U` of this system.\n*   **Method:** This is a classic electrostatics problem solved using the \"method of images.\" The effect of the grounded sphere on the external charge `q` can be perfectly replicated by removing the sphere and placing an \"image charge\" `q'` at a specific location `b` inside the original sphere's volume. The magnitude and position of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the spherical surface (at radius `R`) is zero.\n\n**2. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)**\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent image charge `q'` and its position `b` (measured from the center, along the same line as `d`) are given by the standard formulas:\n\n*   **Position of image charge:** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of image charge:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\n**Careful Point:** The image charge is located inside the sphere (`b < R` since `d > R`) and has the opposite sign to the real charge `q`. This ensures an attractive force.\n\n**3. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`, while the sphere remains grounded. There are two common ways to calculate this.\n\n**Method 1: Integrating the Force (Work Done)**\n\nThe potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent against the electric force from the sphere.\n`U = - ∫[∞, d] F(x) dx`\n\n*   **Force `F(x)`:** The force on the charge `q` when it is at an arbitrary distance `x` from the center is due to the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this force is equal to the force exerted by the image charge `q'(x)` at position `b(x)`.\n    *   `q'(x) = -q * (R / x)`\n    *   `b(x) = R^2 / x`\n    *   Distance between `q` at `x` and `q'(x)` at `b(x)` is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n    *   The force is `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2`.\n    *   `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R/x * 1/((x^2-R^2)/x)^2`\n    *   `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R/x * x^2/(x^2-R^2)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\n*   **Integration:** Now we integrate to find the work.\n    *   `U = - ∫[∞, d] (-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx`\n    *   `U = k * q^2 * R ∫[∞, d] x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\n    *   Using substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`. The integral becomes `∫(1/u^2) (du/2) = -1/(2u)`.\n    *   `U = k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))]` evaluated from `∞` to `d`.\n    *   `U = k * q^2 * R * [(-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2(∞^2 - R^2)))]`\n    *   The term with infinity goes to zero.\n    *   `U = - (k * q^2 * R) / (2(d^2 - R^2)) = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Method 2: Using the Potential Energy Formula**\n\nA more direct method uses the formula for the energy of a system of charges and conductors:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n*   **`V_induced`:** This is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by all *other* charges, which in this case are the induced charges on the sphere.\n*   **Careful Point:** The factor of `1/2` is crucial. It arises because the induced charges (and the potential they create) are themselves proportional to `q`. The energy is not simply `qV` as it would be for a test charge in a fixed external potential.\n*   **Calculation:** The potential from the induced charges at distance `d` is the same as the potential from the image charge `q'` at that point.\n    *   `V_induced = k * q' / (distance from q' to q)`\n    *   Distance = `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d) = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n*   **Final Energy:** Substitute this potential back into the energy formula.\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**4. Final Answer Analysis**\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\nLet's compare this with the given options:\nA) `U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect, has `R^2` instead of `R`.\nB) `U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect, missing the `1/2` factor and has `d` instead of `R`.\nC) `U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)` - **This matches our result.**\nD) `U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)` - Incorrect numerator and denominator.\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is negative, which makes physical sense because the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive. Work is done by the field as the charge is brought from infinity, so the potential energy of the system decreases from its zero reference at infinity.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo calculate the net potential energy of the system, we can use the method of images. In this method, the grounded conducting sphere is replaced by an \"image charge\" that, along with the original charge `q`, reproduces the correct potential (zero) on the surface of the sphere.\n\n1.  **Image Charge and Position**: For a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (where `d > R`), an image charge, `q'`, is placed along the same line at a distance `d'` from the center, inside the sphere.\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -q(R/d)`.\n    *   The position of the image charge is `d' = R²/d`.\n\n2.  **Interaction Energy**: The potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d`. This energy is equivalent to the interaction energy between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`. However, a crucial point in the method of images for calculating energy is that the potential energy of the system is half the interaction energy of the charge and its image. This is because the induced charge on the sphere is not a fixed entity but is created by the presence of the charge `q` as it is brought from infinity.\n\n3.  **Calculation**: The potential energy of interaction between the charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is given by Coulomb's potential energy formula:\n    `U_interaction = k * (q * q') / (distance between them)`\n\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `d'`) is `d - d' = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`.\n    *   Substituting the values of `q'` and the distance into the interaction energy formula:\n        `U_interaction = k * (q * [-qR/d]) / [(d² - R²)/d]`\n        `U_interaction = -k * (q²R/d) * [d / (d² - R²)]`\n        `U_interaction = -k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n4.  **Net Potential Energy**: As stated earlier, the net potential energy of the system is half of this interaction energy:\n    `U = (1/2) * U_interaction`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nD) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Setup and the Method of Images\n\nWe have a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is held at an electric potential of zero (V = 0).\n\nThe presence of the charge `q` will induce charges to redistribute on the surface of the sphere. The electric field and potential outside the sphere are the result of both the original charge `q` and this induced surface charge.\n\nThe \"method of images\" is a powerful technique to solve this problem. It allows us to replace the complex induced charge distribution on the sphere with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" (`q'`) placed at a specific location (`b`) inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero.\n\n### 2. Finding the Image Charge and its Location\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent image charge `q'` is located at a distance `b` from the center, along the same line as the original charge. The values are given by:\n\n*   **Location of image charge:** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of image charge:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\nThe system of the real charge `q` and the induced charge on the sphere is now replaced by a simpler system of two point charges: the real charge `q` at `d` and the image charge `q'` at `b`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. As the charge `q` moves, the induced charge on the sphere (and thus the image charge `q'`) continuously changes. Therefore, we must integrate the force on the charge `q` as it is brought in from infinity.\n\nLet the charge `q` be at a variable position `x` from the center of the sphere (`x` goes from `∞` to `d`).\n\n1.  **Force on the charge `q` at position `x`:**\n    The force on the real charge `q` is due to the attraction from the sphere. In our image model, this is the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n    At position `x`, the image charge has a magnitude `q'(x) = -qR/x` and is located at `b(x) = R^2/x`.\n    The distance between the real charge `q` at `x` and the image charge `q'` at `b(x)` is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n    The force `F(x)` on the charge `q` is:\n    `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (distance)^2`\n    `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n    `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R / (x * (x^2 - R^2)^2 / x^2)`\n    `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n    The negative sign indicates that the force is attractive.\n\n2.  **Work Done (Potential Energy):**\n    The potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge from infinity to `d`. This is the negative of the work done by the electric field.\n    `U = W_ext = - ∫[from ∞ to d] F(x) dx`\n    `U = ∫[from d to ∞] F(x) dx`\n    `U = ∫[from d to ∞] [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\n3.  **Solving the Integral:**\n    We can solve this integral using a u-substitution.\n    Let `u = x^2 - R^2`. Then `du = 2x dx`, which means `x dx = du / 2`.\n    The limits of integration also change:\n    *   When `x = d`, `u = d^2 - R^2`.\n    *   When `x → ∞`, `u → ∞`.\n\n    Now substitute into the integral:\n    `U = -k * q^2 * R * ∫[from d^2-R^2 to ∞] (1/u^2) * (du/2)`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * ∫[from d^2-R^2 to ∞] u^-2 du`\n    The integral of `u^-2` is `-u^-1`.\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [-1/u] |_[from d^2-R^2 to ∞]`\n    `U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [1/u] |_[from d^2-R^2 to ∞]`\n    `U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [ (lim u→∞ 1/u) - (1 / (d^2 - R^2)) ]`\n    `U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [ 0 - 1 / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\n*   A) `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n*   B) `U = - k * q^2 * d / (d^2 - R^2)`\n*   C) `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * d / (d^2 + R^2)`\n*   D) `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nOur derived expression matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:** We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to the Earth and held at a constant potential of zero (V=0). The presence of the charge `q` will induce a redistribution of charges on the surface of the sphere to maintain this V=0 condition. This results in an attractive force between the charge `q` and the sphere. The potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d`.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:** This problem is most easily solved using the method of images. The electric field and potential outside the sphere, created by the charge `q` and the induced surface charges on the sphere, are identical to the field and potential created by the original charge `q` and a fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The sphere itself is removed in this model.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b):**\n    For the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius R) to be zero, the image charge `q'` must be:\n    *   Located at a distance `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the charge `q`. The position is given by:\n        `b = R^2 / d`\n    *   Have a magnitude and sign given by:\n        `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\n    Note that since `d > R` (the charge is outside the sphere), the image charge position `b` is inside the sphere (`b < R`), and its sign is opposite to that of `q`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to assemble it. A key formula for the interaction energy `U` between a point charge `q` and a conductor is `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by the induced charges on the conductor. The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the induced charge distribution is created by and dependent on the presence of `q`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Induced Potential (V_induced):**\n    Using our image charge model, `V_induced` is simply the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`.\n    *   The position of `q` is at distance `d` from the center.\n    *   The position of `q'` is at distance `b` from the center.\n    *   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b`.\n\n    The potential `V_induced` is therefore:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    where `k` is Coulomb's constant (`1 / (4πε₀)`).\n\n6.  **Substitute and Simplify:**\n    Now, we substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b` into the formula for `V_induced`:\n    `V_induced = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [d - (R^2/d)]`\n\n    Simplify the denominator:\n    `d - (R^2/d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n    Substitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n    `V_induced = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n\n    The `d` in the denominator of the numerator and the denominator of the denominator cancel out:\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Potential Energy (U):**\n    Now, substitute this expression for `V_induced` back into the energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    Let's compare our result with the given choices:\n    A) `U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)` (Incorrect, has R²)\n    B) `U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)` (Incorrect, has d in numerator and + in denominator)\n    C) `U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)` (This matches our derived result)\n    D) `U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)` (Incorrect, missing 1/2 and has d instead of R)\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nI have analyzed the problem using the method of images, which is the standard approach for this type of electrostatics problem.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Use the method of images to find the equivalent image charge `q'` and its position `b` that correctly models the grounded conducting sphere.\n2.  Calculate the potential energy of the system. The potential energy is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d`.

The charge is located at a distance `d` from the sphere's center. We can determine the correct expression by applying a series of physical constraints.\n\n**1. Dimensional Analysis**\nThe potential energy `U` must have the dimensions of energy. In electrostatics, energy is proportional to `k * q^2 / distance`.

Boundary Condition: Charge Approaching the Sphere (d → R⁺)**\nAs the charge `q` gets infinitesimally close to the surface of the conducting sphere, the attractive force between the charge and the induced surface charge becomes infinitely large.

Correct.\n*   **B) `U = - (1/2) * kq² * d / (d² + R²)`:** As `d → R⁺`, the denominator `(d² + R²) → 2R²`, so `U` approaches a finite value `-kq²/(4R)`.

This factor of 1/2 arises because the energy is stored in the electric field, which exists only in the space outside the sphere.\n\n3.  **Interaction Energy**:\n    First, let's calculate the interaction energy between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n    *   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `distance = d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`.\n    *   The potential energy of interaction (`U_interaction`) between two point charges is given by `k * q1 * q2 / r`.\n    *   `U_interaction = k * q * q' / (d - b)`\n    *   Substituting the values for `q'` and `(d-b)`:\n        `U_interaction = k * q * (-qR/d) / ((d² - R²)/d)`\n    *   Simplifying the expression:\n        `U_interaction = - (k * q² * R) / (d² - R²)`\n\n4.  **Net Potential Energy of the System**:\n    The net potential energy of the system is half of the interaction energy.\n    *   `U = (1/2) * U_interaction`\n    *   `U = (1/2) * [- (k * q² * R) / (d² - R²)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nD) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the net potential energy of the system.\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem and the Method of Images**\n\n*   **System:** We have a point charge `q` and a conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n*   **Condition:** The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is held at a constant potential of zero (V = 0).\n*   **Goal:** Calculate the total potential energy `U` of this system.\n*   **Method:** This is a classic electrostatics problem solved using the \"method of images.\" The effect of the grounded sphere on the external charge `q` can be perfectly replicated by removing the sphere and placing an \"image charge\" `q'` at a specific location `b` inside the original sphere's volume. The magnitude and position of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the spherical surface (at radius `R`) is zero.\n\n**2. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)**\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent image charge `q'` and its position `b` (measured from the center, along the same line as `d`) are given by the standard formulas:\n\n*   **Position of image charge:** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of image charge:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\n**Careful Point:** The image charge is located inside the sphere (`b < R` since `d > R`) and has the opposite sign to the real charge `q`. This ensures an attractive force.\n\n**3. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`, while the sphere remains grounded. There are two common ways to calculate this.\n\n**Method 1: Integrating the Force (Work Done)**\n\nThe potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent against the electric force from the sphere.\n`U = - ∫[∞, d] F(x) dx`\n\n*   **Force `F(x)`:** The force on the charge `q` when it is at an arbitrary distance `x` from the center is due to the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this force is equal to the force exerted by the image charge `q'(x)` at position `b(x)`.\n    *   `q'(x) = -q * (R / x)`\n    *   `b(x) = R^2 / x`\n    *   Distance between `q` at `x` and `q'(x)` at `b(x)` is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n    *   The force is `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2`.\n    *   `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R/x * 1/((x^2-R^2)/x)^2`\n    *   `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R/x * x^2/(x^2-R^2)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\n*   **Integration:** Now we integrate to find the work.\n    *   `U = - ∫[∞, d] (-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx`\n    *   `U = k * q^2 * R ∫[∞, d] x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\n    *   Using substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`. The integral becomes `∫(1/u^2) (du/2) = -1/(2u)`.\n    *   `U = k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))]` evaluated from `∞` to `d`.\n    *   `U = k * q^2 * R * [(-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2(∞^2 - R^2)))]`\n    *   The term with infinity goes to zero.\n    *   `U = - (k * q^2 * R) / (2(d^2 - R^2)) = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Method 2: Using the Potential Energy Formula**\n\nA more direct method uses the formula for the energy of a system of charges and conductors:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n*   **`V_induced`:** This is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by all *other* charges, which in this case are the induced charges on the sphere.\n*   **Careful Point:** The factor of `1/2` is crucial. It arises because the induced charges (and the potential they create) are themselves proportional to `q`. The energy is not simply `qV` as it would be for a test charge in a fixed external potential.\n*   **Calculation:** The potential from the induced charges at distance `d` is the same as the potential from the image charge `q'` at that point.\n    *   `V_induced = k * q' / (distance from q' to q)`\n    *   Distance = `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d) = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n*   **Final Energy:** Substitute this potential back into the energy formula.\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**4. Final Answer Analysis**\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\nLet's compare this with the given options:\nA) `U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect, has `R^2` instead of `R`.\nB) `U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect, missing the `1/2` factor and has `d` instead of `R`.\nC) `U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)` - **This matches our result.**\nD) `U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)` - Incorrect numerator and denominator.\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is negative, which makes physical sense because the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive. Work is done by the field as the charge is brought from infinity, so the potential energy of the system decreases from its zero reference at infinity.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo calculate the net potential energy of the system, we can use the method of images. In this method, the grounded conducting sphere is replaced by an \"image charge\" that, along with the original charge `q`, reproduces the correct potential (zero) on the surface of the sphere.\n\n1.  **Image Charge and Position**: For a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (where `d > R`), an image charge, `q'`, is placed along the same line at a distance `d'` from the center, inside the sphere.\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -q(R/d)`.\n    *   The position of the image charge is `d' = R²/d`.\n\n2.  **Interaction Energy**: The potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d`. This energy is equivalent to the interaction energy between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`. However, a crucial point in the method of images for calculating energy is that the potential energy of the system is half the interaction energy of the charge and its image. This is because the induced charge on the sphere is not a fixed entity but is created by the presence of the charge `q` as it is brought from infinity.\n\n3.  **Calculation**: The potential energy of interaction between the charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is given by Coulomb's potential energy formula:\n    `U_interaction = k * (q * q') / (distance between them)`\n\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `d'`) is `d - d' = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`.\n    *   Substituting the values of `q'` and the distance into the interaction energy formula:\n        `U_interaction = k * (q * [-qR/d]) / [(d² - R²)/d]`\n        `U_interaction = -k * (q²R/d) * [d / (d² - R²)]`\n        `U_interaction = -k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n4.  **Net Potential Energy**: As stated earlier, the net potential energy of the system is half of this interaction energy:\n    `U = (1/2) * U_interaction`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nD) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Setup and the Method of Images\n\nWe have a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is held at an electric potential of zero (V = 0).\n\nThe presence of the charge `q` will induce charges to redistribute on the surface of the sphere. The electric field and potential outside the sphere are the result of both the original charge `q` and this induced surface charge.\n\nThe \"method of images\" is a powerful technique to solve this problem. It allows us to replace the complex induced charge distribution on the sphere with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" (`q'`) placed at a specific location (`b`) inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero.\n\n### 2. Finding the Image Charge and its Location\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent image charge `q'` is located at a distance `b` from the center, along the same line as the original charge. The values are given by:\n\n*   **Location of image charge:** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of image charge:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\nThe system of the real charge `q` and the induced charge on the sphere is now replaced by a simpler system of two point charges: the real charge `q` at `d` and the image charge `q'` at `b`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. As the charge `q` moves, the induced charge on the sphere (and thus the image charge `q'`) continuously changes. Therefore, we must integrate the force on the charge `q` as it is brought in from infinity.\n\nLet the charge `q` be at a variable position `x` from the center of the sphere (`x` goes from `∞` to `d`).\n\n1.  **Force on the charge `q` at position `x`:**\n    The force on the real charge `q` is due to the attraction from the sphere. In our image model, this is the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n    At position `x`, the image charge has a magnitude `q'(x) = -qR/x` and is located at `b(x) = R^2/x`.\n    The distance between the real charge `q` at `x` and the image charge `q'` at `b(x)` is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n    The force `F(x)` on the charge `q` is:\n    `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (distance)^2`\n    `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n    `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R / (x * (x^2 - R^2)^2 / x^2)`\n    `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n    The negative sign indicates that the force is attractive.\n\n2.  **Work Done (Potential Energy):**\n    The potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge from infinity to `d`. This is the negative of the work done by the electric field.\n    `U = W_ext = - ∫[from ∞ to d] F(x) dx`\n    `U = ∫[from d to ∞] F(x) dx`\n    `U = ∫[from d to ∞] [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\n3.  **Solving the Integral:**\n    We can solve this integral using a u-substitution.\n    Let `u = x^2 - R^2`. Then `du = 2x dx`, which means `x dx = du / 2`.\n    The limits of integration also change:\n    *   When `x = d`, `u = d^2 - R^2`.\n    *   When `x → ∞`, `u → ∞`.\n\n    Now substitute into the integral:\n    `U = -k * q^2 * R * ∫[from d^2-R^2 to ∞] (1/u^2) * (du/2)`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * ∫[from d^2-R^2 to ∞] u^-2 du`\n    The integral of `u^-2` is `-u^-1`.\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [-1/u] |_[from d^2-R^2 to ∞]`\n    `U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [1/u] |_[from d^2-R^2 to ∞]`\n    `U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [ (lim u→∞ 1/u) - (1 / (d^2 - R^2)) ]`\n    `U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [ 0 - 1 / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\n*   A) `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n*   B) `U = - k * q^2 * d / (d^2 - R^2)`\n*   C) `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * d / (d^2 + R^2)`\n*   D) `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nOur derived expression matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:** We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to the Earth and held at a constant potential of zero (V=0). The presence of the charge `q` will induce a redistribution of charges on the surface of the sphere to maintain this V=0 condition. This results in an attractive force between the charge `q` and the sphere. The potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d`.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:** This problem is most easily solved using the method of images. The electric field and potential outside the sphere, created by the charge `q` and the induced surface charges on the sphere, are identical to the field and potential created by the original charge `q` and a fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The sphere itself is removed in this model.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b):**\n    For the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius R) to be zero, the image charge `q'` must be:\n    *   Located at a distance `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the charge `q`. The position is given by:\n        `b = R^2 / d`\n    *   Have a magnitude and sign given by:\n        `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\n    Note that since `d > R` (the charge is outside the sphere), the image charge position `b` is inside the sphere (`b < R`), and its sign is opposite to that of `q`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to assemble it. A key formula for the interaction energy `U` between a point charge `q` and a conductor is `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by the induced charges on the conductor. The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the induced charge distribution is created by and dependent on the presence of `q`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Induced Potential (V_induced):**\n    Using our image charge model, `V_induced` is simply the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`.\n    *   The position of `q` is at distance `d` from the center.\n    *   The position of `q'` is at distance `b` from the center.\n    *   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b`.\n\n    The potential `V_induced` is therefore:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    where `k` is Coulomb's constant (`1 / (4πε₀)`).\n\n6.  **Substitute and Simplify:**\n    Now, we substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b` into the formula for `V_induced`:\n    `V_induced = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [d - (R^2/d)]`\n\n    Simplify the denominator:\n    `d - (R^2/d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n    Substitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n    `V_induced = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n\n    The `d` in the denominator of the numerator and the denominator of the denominator cancel out:\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Potential Energy (U):**\n    Now, substitute this expression for `V_induced` back into the energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    Let's compare our result with the given choices:\n    A) `U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)` (Incorrect, has R²)\n    B) `U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)` (Incorrect, has d in numerator and + in denominator)\n    C) `U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)` (This matches our derived result)\n    D) `U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)` (Incorrect, missing 1/2 and has d instead of R)\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nI have analyzed the problem using the method of images, which is the standard approach for this type of electrostatics problem.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Use the method of images to find the equivalent image charge `q'` and its position `b` that correctly models the grounded conducting sphere.\n2.  Calculate the potential energy of the system. The potential energy is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d`. This is equal to `(1/2) * q * V_image`, where `V_image` is the potential at the location of `q` due to the image charge.\n\n**Execution:**\n1.  **Image Charge and Position:** For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge is `q' = -q(R/d)` located at a distance `b = R^2/d` from the center, on the line connecting the center and `q`.\n\n2.  **Potential due to Image Charge:** The potential at the location of the real charge `q` (at distance `d`) due to the image charge `q'` (at distance `b`) is:\n    `V_image = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n    The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b`.\n    `V_image = k * [-q(R/d)] / [d - (R^2/d)]`\n    `V_image = -k * qR / [d * (d - R^2/d)]`\n    `V_image = -k * qR / [d^2 - R^2]`\n\n3.  **Potential Energy of the System:** The work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to `d` in the presence of the grounded sphere is half the interaction energy between the real charge and the image charge.

The electric field outside the sphere is then the superposition of the fields of the original charge and the image charge.\n\n1.  **Image Charge and its Location**: For a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (where `d > R`), the system can be modeled by placing an image charge, `q'`, inside the sphere.\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -q * (R/d)`.\n    *   The image charge is located at a distance `b = R^2/d` from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the center and the point charge `q`.\n\n2.  **Potential Energy Calculation**: The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d`. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charge on the sphere. A key principle in the method of images is that the potential energy of the interaction between the real charge and the induced surface charge is half the potential energy of the interaction between the real charge and the fictitious image charge.\n\n    The potential energy of interaction between two point charges is given by the formula `U = k * (q1*q2) / r`, where `k` is Coulomb's constant (`1/(4πε₀)`).\n\n3.  **Interaction Energy between the Real and Image Charge**:\n    *   The real charge is `q`.\n    *   The image charge is `q' = -qR/d`.\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b = R^2/d`) is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n\n    The potential at the location of the charge `q` due to the image charge `q'` is:\n    `V_image = k * q' / (d - b) = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    `V_image = -k * q^2 * R / (d * (d^2 - R^2)/d) = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n4.  **Net Potential Energy of the System**: The potential energy of the system is half the product of the real charge and the potential created by the image charge at the location of the real charge.\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nC) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis problem asks for the net potential energy of a system consisting of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The charge is located at a distance `d` from the sphere's center. We can determine the correct expression by applying a series of physical constraints.\n\n**1. Dimensional Analysis**\nThe potential energy `U` must have the dimensions of energy. In electrostatics, energy is proportional to `k * q^2 / distance`. Therefore, the correct expression must have dimensions of `[k][q]²/[L]`.\n*   **A) `k*q²*R/(d²-R²)`:** `[k*q²/L]`. Correct.\n*   **B) `k*q²*d/(d²+R²)`:** `[k*q²/L]`. Correct.\n*   **C) `k*q²*R²/(d²-R²)`:** `[k*q²]`. Incorrect.\n*   **D) `k*q²*d/(d²-R²)`:** `[k*q²/L]`. Correct.\n\nThis constraint eliminates option C.\n\n**2. Boundary Condition: Charge Approaching the Sphere (d → R⁺)**\nAs the charge `q` gets infinitesimally close to the surface of the conducting sphere, the attractive force between the charge and the induced surface charge becomes infinitely large. Consequently, the potential energy of the system must approach negative infinity (`-∞`).\n*   **A) `U = - (1/2) * kq² * R / (d² - R²)`:** As `d → R⁺`, the denominator `(d² - R²) → 0⁺`, so `U → -∞`. Correct.\n*   **B) `U = - (1/2) * kq² * d / (d² + R²)`:** As `d → R⁺`, the denominator `(d² + R²) → 2R²`, so `U` approaches a finite value `-kq²/(4R)`. Incorrect.\n*   **D) `U = - kq² * d / (d² - R²)`:** As `d → R⁺`, the denominator `(d² - R²) → 0⁺`, so `U → -∞`. Correct.\n\nThis constraint eliminates option B.\n\n**3. Asymptotic Behavior: Charge Far from the Sphere (d → ∞)**\nWhen the charge `q` is very far from the sphere, the sphere behaves like an induced electric dipole. The potential energy of a point charge interacting with an induced dipole falls off with distance as `1/d²`.\n*   **A) `U = - (1/2) * kq² * R / (d² - R²)`:** For large `d`, `d² - R² ≈ d²`. Thus, `U ≈ - (1/2) * kq² * R / d²`. The energy falls off as `1/d²`. Correct.\n*   **D) `U = - kq² * d / (d² - R²)`:** For large `d`, `d² - R² ≈ d²`. Thus, `U ≈ - kq² * d / d² = -kq²/d`. The energy falls off as `1/d`. Incorrect.\n\nThis final constraint eliminates option D.\n\nOnly option A satisfies all three physical constraints. This result is also confirmed by the method of images, which is the standard technique for solving this problem.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe problem is solved using the method of images. For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (where `d > R`), the electrostatic effect outside the sphere can be modeled by replacing the sphere with an \"image charge\" `q'`.\n\n1.  **Image Charge and Position**:\n    *   The image charge `q'` is located at a distance `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center and `q`.\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n\n2.  **Potential Energy Calculation**:\n    The potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d`. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere. The potential energy `U` of the charge `q` in the field of the induced charges (which is equivalent to the field of the image charge `q'`) is given by:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n    Where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` (distance `d` from the center) created by the image charge `q'`. The factor of 1/2 is crucial and arises because the induced charge distribution is not fixed but is created by the presence of `q`.\n\n    The distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `d - b`.\n    The potential `V_induced` at position `d` is:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\n    Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n    `V_induced = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [d - (R^2/d)]`\n    `V_induced = k * [-qR/d] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    `V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    Now, calculate the potential energy `U`:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    This expression matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
