    Checks the correctness of the answer regarding the comparison of two mean free paths.

    # The final answer from the analysis is 'C'.
    provided_answer = 'C'

    # --- Step 1: Define the physical formulas for Mean Free Path (MFP) ---

    # The general formula is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where n is number density and σ is cross-section.
    # The number density 'n' of gas molecules is the same for both λ1 and λ2.

    # For λ1 (gas-gas collision), kinetic theory accounts for the relative motion of all
    # molecules, introducing a sqrt(2) factor.
    # λ1 = 1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)
    # where σ_gg is the gas-gas kinetic cross-section.

    # For λ2 (electron-gas collision), the 1000 kV electrons are so fast that the gas
    # molecules are effectively stationary. The sqrt(2) factor is not used.
    # λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)
    # where σ_eg is the electron-gas scattering cross-section.

    # --- Step 2: Establish the relationship between the cross-sections (σ_gg vs σ_eg) ---

    # This is the most critical physical constraint.
    # For LOW-energy electrons, the long-range Coulomb force can lead to a large σ_eg.
    # However, for VERY HIGH-energy (1000 keV) electrons as specified, the electron is
    # highly penetrating. The atom is mostly empty space to it. A significant scattering
    # event ("collision") is rare and requires a close approach to the nucleus.
    # Therefore, the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron is SMALLER
    # than the kinetic cross-section for two molecules bumping into each other.
    # Constraint: σ_gg > σ_eg

    # --- Step 3: Derive the ratio of λ2 to λ1 ---

    # We can find the ratio λ2 / λ1 to compare them.
    # λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)]
    # The 'n' terms cancel out.
    # λ2 / λ1 = (sqrt(2) * σ_gg) / σ_eg
    # λ2 / λ1 = sqrt(2) * (σ_gg / σ_eg)

    # --- Step 4: Apply the cross-section constraint to the ratio ---

    # From Step 2, we know (σ_gg / σ_eg) > 1.
    # Therefore, the ratio λ2 / λ1 must be greater than sqrt(2).
    ratio_lower_bound = math.sqrt(2)  # approx 1.414

    # The physical conclusion is: λ2 / λ1 > 1.414, which means λ2 > 1.414 * λ1.

    # --- Step 5: Check which option this conclusion satisfies ---

    # Let's evaluate the given options based on our derived condition: λ2 > 1.414 * λ1
    # A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1  -> False, because λ2/λ1 > 1.414, so it cannot be less than 1.22.
    # B) λ2 = λ1             -> False, because λ2/λ1 > 1.414.
    # C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1       -> True, because if λ2/λ1 > 1.414, it is certainly >= 1.22.
    # D) λ2 < λ1             -> False, because λ2/λ1 > 1.
