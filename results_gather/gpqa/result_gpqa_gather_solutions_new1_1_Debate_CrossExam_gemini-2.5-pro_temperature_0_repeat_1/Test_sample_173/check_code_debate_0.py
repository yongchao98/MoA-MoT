def check_correctness():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer by recalculating the physics problem from scratch.
    
    The steps are:
    1. Define initial conditions and constants.
    2. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the two fragments.
    3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value).
    4. Calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) using the classical approximation.
    5. Calculate the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) using relativistic mechanics.
    6. Find the difference between the relativistic and classical values.
    7. Compare the calculated result with the LLM's answer and the provided options.

    # 1. Define initial conditions and constants
    E_M = 300.0  # Initial rest-mass energy in GeV
    GeV_to_MeV = 1000.0

    # 2. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the two fragments
    # We are given:
    # m1 = 2 * m2
    # m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M
    # In terms of rest-mass energy (E = mc^2):
    # E1 = 2 * E2
    # E1 + E2 = 0.99 * E_M
    
    # Substitute E1 into the second equation:
    # 2 * E2 + E2 = 0.99 * E_M
    # 3 * E2 = 0.99 * E_M
    m2c2 = 0.99 * E_M / 3.0  # Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment
    m1c2 = 2.0 * m2c2       # Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment

    # 3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)
    # Q is the mass defect converted to energy
    Q = E_M - (m1c2 + m2c2)

    # 4. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation
    # In classical mechanics, for a decay from rest, momentum p is conserved (p1=p2).
    # T = p^2 / (2m), so T is inversely proportional to mass.
    # T1_cl / T2_cl = m2 / m1 = 1/2  => T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl
    # T1_cl + T2_cl = Q
    # T1_cl + 2 * T1_cl = Q => 3 * T1_cl = Q
    T1_classical = Q / 3.0

    # 5. Calculate the correct (relativistic) T1
    # The relativistic energy-momentum relation is E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2.
    # This gives (pc)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(mc^2).
    # Since p1 = p2, we have (p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2:
    # T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1c2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2c2)
    # We know T2 = Q - T1. Substituting this in:
    # T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c2 = (Q - T1)^2 + 2*(Q - T1)*m2c2
    # T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c2 = Q^2 - 2*Q*T1 + T1^2 + 2*Q*m2c2 - 2*T1*m2c2
    # The T1^2 terms cancel. Rearranging to solve for T1:
    # 2*T1*m1c2 + 2*Q*T1 + 2*T1*m2c2 = Q^2 + 2*Q*m2c2
    # T1 * (2*m1c2 + 2*Q + 2*m2c2) = Q * (Q + 2*m2c2)
    # T1 * (2*(m1c2 + m2c2) + 2*Q) = Q * (Q + 2*m2c2)
    # Since m1c2 + m2c2 = E_M - Q:
    # T1 * (2*(E_M - Q) + 2*Q) = Q * (Q + 2*m2c2)
    # T1 * (2*E_M) = Q * (Q + 2*m2c2)
    T1_relativistic = (Q * (Q + 2 * m2c2)) / (2 * E_M)

    # 6. Find the difference
    difference_GeV = T1_relativistic - T1_classical
    difference_MeV = difference_GeV * GeV_to_MeV
