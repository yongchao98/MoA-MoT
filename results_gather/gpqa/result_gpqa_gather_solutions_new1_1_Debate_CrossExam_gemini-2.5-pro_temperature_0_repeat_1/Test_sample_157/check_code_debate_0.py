    # 1. The mutation is "dominant-negative". This implies:
    #    a. It causes a loss-of-function phenotype (not gain-of-function).
    #    b. It causes a mutant phenotype in a heterozygote (not wild-type).
    #    c. The mutant protein must interfere with the wild-type protein.
    # 2. The protein is a "dimer" and the mutation is in the dimerization domain.
    #    a. Interference must happen via dimerization.
    #    b. A complete "loss of protein dimerization" would prevent interference, making the mutation recessive, not dominant-negative.
    # 3. The most precise description of the genetic effect is a "loss-of-function of the wild-type allele".
    # 4. A plausible molecular fate for the non-functional heterodimer is required (e.g., degradation, aggregation).
