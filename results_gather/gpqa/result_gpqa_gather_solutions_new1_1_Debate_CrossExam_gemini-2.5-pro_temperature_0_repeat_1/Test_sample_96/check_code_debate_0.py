def check_klinefelter_mechanism(answer: str):
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the question about Klinefelter's syndrome.

    The question asks for the molecular mechanism that makes Klinefelter's syndrome (XXY)
    phenotypically less severe than Down's syndrome (Trisomy 21).

    The correct mechanism is X-chromosome inactivation, an epigenetic process that silences
    one of the X chromosomes. A key molecular event in this process is chromatin methylation
    by histone methyltransferases, which occurs post-zygotically.

    Args:
        answer: The letter of the chosen option (e.g., 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D').

    Returns:
        A string indicating "Correct" or the reason for the error.
