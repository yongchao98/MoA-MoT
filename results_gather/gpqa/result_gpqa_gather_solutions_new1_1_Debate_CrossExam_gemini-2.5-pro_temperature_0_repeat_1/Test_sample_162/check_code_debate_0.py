def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the selected answer by verifying its internal consistency.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. Calculate the moles of H+ required to stoichiometrically react with 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3.
    2. For each option (A, B, C, D):
       a. Calculate the moles of H+ that must remain in the 100 cm³ solution to produce the given pH.
       b. Sum the moles from step 1 and 2a to get the total moles of H+ required.
       c. Calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid needed to supply this total number of moles.
       d. Compare this calculated volume with the volume given in the option.
    3. The correct option is the one where the calculated volume matches the given volume.
