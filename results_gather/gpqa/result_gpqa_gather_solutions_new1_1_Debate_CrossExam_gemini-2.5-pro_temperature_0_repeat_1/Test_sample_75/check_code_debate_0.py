    # Fact 1: The red marker (mRaspberry) is controlled by a "lineage-specific promoter".

    # begins to differentiate into a specific cell type.
    is_red_signal_present_in_undifferentiated_cells = False

    # Fact 2: The green marker (TUNEL-FITC) detects apoptosis.
    # Implication: Apoptosis is a normal part of embryonic development and is also a
    # very common fate for injected iPSCs that fail to integrate.
    is_green_signal_expected = True

    # Fact 3: The red protein (mRaspberry) is a standard fluorescent protein.
    # Implication: Unless specifically engineered with a targeting sequence (not mentioned),
    # it will be located in the cytoplasm. This is a static property of the tool.
    red_signal_default_location = "cytoplasm"
    
    # Fact 4: A promoter's function is to control gene expression (if/when a protein is made).
    # Implication: It does not control the subcellular localization of the protein.
    promoter_controls_localization = False

    # --- Step 2: Evaluate the provided final answer and other options ---

        reasoning_A = "This is plausible."
    else:
        reasoning_A = "Incorrect. A promoter controls gene expression, not the subcellular localization of the resulting protein."

    # Analysis of Option B: "green signal colocalizes with the red signal"
    # This describes a cell that has started to differentiate (turning red) and is also
    # undergoing apoptosis (turning green). This is a key biological finding related to
    # the experimental goal and a very common outcome in iPSC chimera experiments.
    # It is the most significant initial *finding* that connects the two processes.
    reasoning_B = "Correct. This describes the most significant initial biological finding. It indicates that iPSCs that begin to differentiate (turn red) are being eliminated by the embryo via apoptosis (turn green). This directly addresses the experimental question about the link between iPSC fate and apoptosis."

    # Analysis of Option C: "cytoplasmic localization of the red signal"
    # While true that the signal would be cytoplasmic, this is a static property of the
    # reporter protein, not a dynamic experimental finding. The question asks what you "notice"
    # as a result of the experiment. Furthermore, at the very first time point, there would
    # likely be no red signal to localize.
    reasoning_C = "Incorrect. This describes a static property of the reporter protein, not a dynamic biological finding. The question asks for an observation about the experimental outcome, not a pre-known technical detail. Also, a red signal is not expected at the very first time point."
