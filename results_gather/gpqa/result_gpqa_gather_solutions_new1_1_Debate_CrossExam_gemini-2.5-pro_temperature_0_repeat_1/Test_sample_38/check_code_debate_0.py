    Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct value of "a".

    ### Step-by-step Analysis

    1.  **Identify the Core Principle**: The problem must be solved using the **normalization condition** of a wave function in quantum mechanics. This principle states that the total probability of finding the particle within the region where it can exist must be equal to 1. Mathematically, this is expressed as:
        ∫ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1

    2.  **Define the Integration Limits**: The problem explicitly states that particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, these are the limits for our integral. The normalization condition becomes:
        ∫₁³ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1

    3.  **Calculate the Probability Density |ψ(x)|²**: The probability density is the square of the modulus of the complex wave function.
        The wave function is given as: ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i

        For any complex number in the form `z = R + i*I`, where R is the real part and I is the imaginary part, the square of the modulus is `|z|² = R² + I²`.
        *   Real part, R = `a / sqrt(1 + x)`
        *   Imaginary part, I = `-0.5`

        Therefore, the probability density is:
        |ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)²
        |ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25

    4.  **Set Up and Solve the Normalization Integral**: We substitute the probability density into our normalization equation:
        ∫₁³ ( a² / (1 + x) + 0.25 ) dx = 1

        We solve the integral by separating the terms:
        ∫₁³ (a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫₁³ 0.25 dx = 1

        *   **First term**: `a² * ∫₁³ (1 / (1 + x)) dx = a² * [ln(1 + x)]` evaluated from 1 to 3.
            = `a² * [ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1)]`
            = `a² * [ln(4) - ln(2)]`
            Using the logarithm property `ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B)`, this simplifies to:
            = `a² * ln(4/2) = a² * ln(2)`

        *   **Second term**: `∫₁³ 0.25 dx = [0.25x]` evaluated from 1 to 3.
            = `(0.25 * 3) - (0.25 * 1)`
            = `0.75 - 0.25 = 0.5`

    5.  **Solve for "a"**: Now, we combine the results of the integral and set the sum equal to 1:
        a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1

        Isolate the term containing `a`:
        a² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5
        a² * ln(2) = 0.5
        a² = 0.5 / ln(2)

        Take the square root to find `a`:
        a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))

    6.  **Calculate the Numerical Value and Compare**: Using the approximate value of the natural logarithm of 2, `ln(2) ≈ 0.6931`:
        a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7214
        a ≈ sqrt(0.7214) ≈ 0.8493

        Comparing this calculated value to the given options:
        *   **A) 0.85**
        *   B) 1.1
        *   C) 0.6
        *   D) 0.35

        The calculated value `a ≈ 0.8493` is closest to **0.85**.

    ### Careful Points to Note

    *   **Complex Modulus**: A common mistake is to simply square the wave function `ψ(x)²` instead of calculating the modulus squared `|ψ(x)|²`. Since the wave function is complex, this distinction is critical.
    *   **Integration Limits**: The limits of integration are defined by the physical constraints of the problem, which state the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3.
    *   **Logarithm Properties**: Correct application of logarithm rules (`ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B)`) is necessary to simplify the result of the integral.
    *   **Extraneous Information**: The mention of "10,000 identical systems" is extra information. The normalization constant `a` is an intrinsic property of the wave function for a single system and does not depend on the number of systems in the ensemble.
