    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer to the special relativity problem.

    using the time dilation formula. The main ambiguity is the distance to the Large
    Magellanic Cloud (LMC), which is not given in the prompt. The code tests a range of
    accepted astronomical distances to verify the robustness of the answer.
