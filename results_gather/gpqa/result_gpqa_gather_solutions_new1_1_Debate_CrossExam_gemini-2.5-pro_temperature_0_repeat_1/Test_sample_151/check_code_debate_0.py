    Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.

    ### Step 1: Deconstruct the Experimental Scenario
    *   **Organism**: *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (yeast).
    *   **Treatment**: A peptide causing the formation of a "shmoo". This mimics the natural mating pheromone response.
    *   **Cellular State**: The key effect of the mating pheromone is to arrest the cell cycle in the G1 phase. During this arrest, the cell does not prepare for division; instead, it undergoes a massive transcriptional reprogramming to express genes required for mating.
    *   **Experimental Goal**: To analyze the proteome of *active chromatin*.
    *   **Technique**: Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by Mass Spectrometry (ChIP-MS). A ChIP experiment for "active chromatin" is designed to isolate DNA regions that are actively being transcribed. This is typically done using antibodies against markers of transcription, such as acetylated histones or RNA polymerase itself.

    ### Step 2: Analyze the Function of Each Protein Complex in this Context

    *   **C) Nucleosome histone complex**: Nucleosomes are the fundamental structural units of all chromatin, composed of histone proteins. All DNA, whether active or inactive, is packaged into nucleosomes. Therefore, any experiment that pulls down chromatin will recover a very high abundance of histone proteins.

    *   **B) Enhancer protein complex**: These complexes consist of transcription factors that bind to enhancer regions to activate and regulate gene expression. Since the shmoo response involves turning on a specific set of ~200 genes for mating, these complexes are essential for this process and will be abundant in the active chromatin fraction.

    *   **A) Pre-initiation complex (PIC)**: This is a large assembly of proteins, including RNA polymerase, that binds to gene promoters to begin transcription. As many genes are being actively transcribed to create the shmoo, PICs are a direct indicator of active chromatin and will be abundant.

    *   **D) Pre-replication complex (pre-RC)**: This complex assembles at specific sites called origins of replication during the G1 phase. Its function is to "license" the DNA, making it ready for replication in the S phase. While the yeast cells are arrested in G1 and the pre-RCs are indeed assembled on the chromatin, the pheromone signal actively *prevents* the cell from entering S phase and initiating DNA replication. The experiment is targeting the machinery of *active transcription*, not the machinery of a stalled process like replication. Therefore, compared to the complexes driving the cell's primary activity (transcription), the pre-replication complex will be the least represented in the recovered proteome.

    ### Step 3: Conclusion

    The cell is in a state of high transcriptional activity but inhibited DNA replication. The experiment is designed to isolate the proteins involved in active transcription. Therefore, the complexes directly involved in transcription (enhancer and pre-initiation complexes) and the basic structural units (nucleosomes) will be abundant. The pre-replication complex, which is associated with the inhibited process of DNA replication, will be the least observed.
