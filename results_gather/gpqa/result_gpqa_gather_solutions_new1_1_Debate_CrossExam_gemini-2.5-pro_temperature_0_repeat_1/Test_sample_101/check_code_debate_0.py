    # 1. Simulate the Cre-Lox recombination event.
    # Cre recombinase removes the 'stop' cassette, leaving a single lox2272 site behind.
    # The length of this intervening "scar" sequence is the length of the lox site.
    intervening_sequence_length = lox_site_length

    # 2. Check if the recombination event maintains the reading frame.

    # must be a multiple of the codon length (3).

    # Option A: "the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi"
    # This implies the protein is synthesized and fluorescent, but mislocalized.
    # This contradicts the observation of "no green signal". A synthesis failure is more fundamental.
    if llm_answer == 'A' and not is_in_frame:
        return "Incorrect. The answer suggests a protein trafficking issue (stuck in Golgi). However, the more fundamental problem is a synthesis failure. A frameshift mutation prevents the correct protein from being made in the first place. If the protein were just stuck in the Golgi, a mislocalized green signal would likely be visible."

    # Option B: "the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame"
    # This directly addresses the frameshift mutation.
    if not is_in_frame:
        # This is the most likely correct explanation.
        correct_explanation = f"The lox2272 site left after recombination is {lox_site_length} bp long. Since {lox_site_length} is not divisible by {codon_length}, a frameshift mutation occurs. This prevents the correct translation of eGFP, leading to 'no green signal'."

    # Option C: "the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing"
    # The problem states a strong, ubiquitous CBA promoter was used, and a control experiment
    # confirmed protein expression (pre-recombination).
    if llm_answer == 'C':
        return "Incorrect. The question states a strong, ubiquitous CBA promoter was used. Furthermore, the Western blot control in astrocytes confirmed that the promoter was active and the receptor protein could be expressed from the construct. Therefore, a missing enhancer is not the cause."

    # Option D: "ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship"
    # This describes a biological function, not a technical reason for expression failure.
    if llm_answer == 'D':
