def check_star_parallax_distribution():
    """
    Checks the relationship between the number of stars per unit parallax and parallax.

    The derivation follows these steps:
    1. The number of stars dN in a thin shell of radius d and thickness dd is
       proportional to the volume of the shell: dN ∝ 4*pi*d^2 * dd.
       So, the number of stars per unit distance, dN/dd, is ∝ d^2.
    2. The distance d is inversely proportional to parallax plx: d = k/plx.
    3. Using the chain rule, dN/d(plx) = (dN/dd) * (dd/d(plx)).
    4. We substitute d = k/plx into dN/dd and calculate dd/d(plx).
    5. The final expression shows the proportionality.
