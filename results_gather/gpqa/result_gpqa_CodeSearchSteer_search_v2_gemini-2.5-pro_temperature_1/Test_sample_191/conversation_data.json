    "Here's a step-by-step analysis of the electrostatic problem:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** The positive charge, `+q`, placed inside the cavity will attract the free electrons within the conductor. These electrons will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity, inducing a total charge of `-q` on this surface.\n\n2.  **Charge Conservation and Distribution:** The conductor was initially uncharged. To maintain its overall neutrality, a positive charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the large spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** The conductor acts as an electrostatic shield. This means the charges on the outer surface are unaffected by the positions of the charges inside the conductor (the original `+q` and the induced `-q`). Consequently, the `+q` charge on the outer surface distributes itself uniformly, as this is the lowest energy configuration for a spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** According to Gauss's Law and the shell theorem, the electric field at any point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution is identical to the field that would be produced if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere.\n\n5.  **Calculation:** The point P is outside the conductor. The electric field at P is therefore determined solely by the uniform charge `+q` on the outer surface. Treating this charge as a point charge located at the center of the large sphere, the magnitude of the electric field at a distance `L` is given by Coulomb's Law:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe location of the charge inside the cavity (related to distances `l`, `s`, and angle `\\theta$`) does not affect the electric field outside the conductor due to the shielding effect. Therefore, these parameters are irrelevant to the final answer.\n\nComparing this result with the given options, the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
