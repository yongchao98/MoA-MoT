    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product E and the number of signals in its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A**\n    *   This reaction forms a dithioacetal. Propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) reacts with 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT, HSCH₂CH₂SH) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst (BF₃) to protect the carbonyl group.\n    *   Product **A** is **2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n    *   Butyllithium (BuLi) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton in compound A. The proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (C2) is acidic.\n    *   Product **B** is the lithiated carbanion, **2-lithio-2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n    *   The carbanion B acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br) in an SN2 reaction. An ethyl group is added at the C2 position.\n    *   Product **C** is **2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    *   This step is the deprotection of the dithioacetal, hydrolyzing it back to a carbonyl group.\n    *   Product **D** is diethyl ketone, also known as **3-pentanone** ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=O).\n\n5.  **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    *   This is a Wittig reaction. First, the Wittig reagent (ylide) is prepared from triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) and 3-bromopentane, followed by deprotonation with BuLi.\n        *   **Ylide formation**: 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr) reacts with PPh₃ and then BuLi to form the ylide, (pentan-3-ylidene)triphenylphosphorane, which has the structure (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃.\n        *   **Wittig reaction**: The ketone D (3-pentanone) reacts with the ylide. The oxygen atom of the ketone is exchanged with the carbon group of the ylide.\n    *   The reaction is: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O + (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃ → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₃CH₂)₂ + Ph₃P=O.\n    *   The final product **E** is **3,4-diethyl-3-hexene**.\n\n### **13C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\n\nThe structure of the final product E, 3,4-diethyl-3-hexene (also known as tetraethylethylene), is:\n\n```\n      CH₂-CH₃\n      |\nCH₃-CH₂-C = C-CH₂-CH₃\n            |\n            CH₂-CH₃\n```\n\nTo determine the number of 13C-NMR signals, we must identify the number of chemically non-equivalent carbon atoms by analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThis molecule is highly symmetrical. There is a plane of symmetry through the C=C double bond and a C₂ rotational axis perpendicular to it.\n\n*   **Alkene Carbons**: The two carbons forming the double bond (C3 and C4) are chemically equivalent due to the symmetry of the molecule. This will produce **1 signal**.\n*   **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-)**: There are four ethyl groups attached to the double bond. All four are equivalent. The methylene (-CH₂-) carbons of these four ethyl groups are also all equivalent to each other. This will produce **1 signal**.\n*   **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃)**: Similarly, the terminal methyl (-CH₃) carbons of the four equivalent ethyl groups are all chemically equivalent. This will produce **1 signal**.\n\nIn total, there are three sets of equivalent carbons, which will result in **3 signals** in the 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
