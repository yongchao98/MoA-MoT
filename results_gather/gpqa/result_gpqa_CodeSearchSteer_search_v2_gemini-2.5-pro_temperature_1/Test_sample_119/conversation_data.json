    "To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with parallax, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Assume a Uniform Star Distribution:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number of stars per unit volume, known as the number density (ρ), is constant everywhere.\n\n2.  **Consider a Shell of Stars:** Imagine a thin spherical shell in space with a radius *d* and a very small thickness *dd*. The volume of this shell (*dV*) is its surface area (4π*d*²) multiplied by its thickness (*dd*).\n    *   dV = 4π*d*² *dd*\n\n3.  **Calculate the Number of Stars in the Shell:** Since the star density (ρ) is constant, the number of stars (*dN*) within this shell is the density multiplied by the volume of the shell.\n    *   *dN* = ρ * *dV* = 4πρ*d*² *dd*\n\n4.  **Relate Distance to Parallax:** Stellar parallax (*plx*) is inversely proportional to the distance (*d*) to the star. The relationship is given by:\n    *   *d* = 1/*plx*\n\n5.  **Express the Shell Thickness in Terms of Parallax:** We need to find the relationship between the thickness of the shell in terms of distance (*dd*) and the corresponding interval in parallax (*d(plx)*). We can do this by differentiating the distance-parallax equation:\n    *   *dd*/*d(plx)* = -1/*plx*²\n    *   Ignoring the negative sign (as it only indicates that distance and parallax are inversely related), the magnitude of the thickness is: *dd* = (1/*plx*²) *d(plx)*\n\n6.  **Substitute and Find the Final Relationship:** Now, we substitute the expressions for *d* and *dd* back into the equation for the number of stars (*dN*):\n    *   *dN* = 4πρ * (1/*plx*)² * (1/*plx*²) *d(plx)*\n    *   *dN* = 4πρ * (1/*plx*⁴) *d(plx)*\n\n7.  **Determine the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the expression *dN*/*d(plx)*.\n    *   *dN*/*d(plx)* = 4πρ / *plx*⁴\n\nSince 4, π, and ρ are constants, this shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/*plx*⁴. This relationship is noted in astronomical studies, for example, in discussions of the Lutz-Kelker bias, which arises from the assumption of a uniform distribution of stars.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as ~ 1/plx⁴.\n\n<<<B>>>"
