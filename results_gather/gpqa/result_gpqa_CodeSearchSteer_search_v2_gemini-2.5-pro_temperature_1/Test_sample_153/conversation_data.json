    "Based on the comprehensive analysis of the provided spectral data, the unknown compound is identified as 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:** The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 and the M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of approximately 32% are characteristic of a compound with a molecular weight of 156 containing one chlorine atom. All the proposed structures have a molecular weight of 156.57 g/mol and contain a single chlorine atom, making them consistent with this data.\n\n*   **IR Spectroscopy:** The spectrum shows a very broad absorption band in the range of 3500-2700 cm⁻¹, which is a hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid. Additionally, the strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of the carboxylic acid. This combination of peaks strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group, effectively ruling out 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (an aldehyde and phenol) and phenyl chloroformate (an ester). Both 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-chlorobenzoic acid are consistent with this data.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:** The proton NMR spectrum provides the most definitive evidence for the specific isomer.\n    *   The singlet at a very downfield chemical shift of 11.0 ppm is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The aromatic region displays two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, with each signal integrating to two protons (2H). This pattern is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The symmetry in a para-substituted ring results in two sets of equivalent aromatic protons, which split each other to produce two doublets.\n    *   4-chlorobenzoic acid fits this pattern perfectly. The protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are more deshielded and appear as a doublet at 8.02 ppm, while the protons adjacent (ortho) to the chlorine atom are slightly less deshielded and appear as a doublet at 7.72 ppm.\n    *   In contrast, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, being a 1,2-disubstituted ring, would show a more complex splitting pattern with four distinct signals for the aromatic protons, not two simple doublets.\n\n**Conclusion:** The combined spectral data—particularly the classic para-substituted pattern in the ¹H NMR spectrum—unambiguously points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the correct structure.\n\n<<<C>>>"
