    "To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of the electron, we can use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n**1. Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp)**\n\nFirst, we use the position-momentum uncertainty principle. The formula is:\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2\nwhere:\n*   Δx is the uncertainty in position.\n*   Δp is the uncertainty in momentum.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π), approximately 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n\nThe problem states that the uncertainty in the electron's location is Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m. We can calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp) by rearranging the formula:\nΔp ≥ ħ / (2 * Δx)\nΔp ≥ (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m)\nΔp ≥ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\n**2. Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE)**\n\nNext, we need to relate the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) to the uncertainty in energy (ΔE). The relationship between energy and momentum for a particle is given by its energy-momentum relation. For a particle moving with velocity *v*, the change in energy with respect to momentum (dE/dp) is equal to its velocity *v*. This allows us to approximate the relationship between the uncertainties:\nΔE ≈ v * Δp\n\nGiven the electron's speed is v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s, we can now estimate the minimum uncertainty in its energy:\nΔE ≈ (2 x 10⁸ m/s) * (5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s)\nΔE ≈ 10.54 x 10⁻¹⁷ J\nΔE ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\nB) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\nC) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\nD) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\n\nThe calculated value is closest to ~10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n<<<B>>>"
