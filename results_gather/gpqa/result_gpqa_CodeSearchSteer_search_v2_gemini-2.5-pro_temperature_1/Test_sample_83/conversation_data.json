    "The method of lines discretizes the spatial variables of a partial differential equation, converting it into a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). When solving the higher-dimensional heat equation, this results in a matrix exponential function that must be calculated at each time step. For computational efficiency, this exponential function is often approximated by a rational function (a fraction of two polynomials), such as a Pad√© approximation.\n\nThe key to converting the sequential solution of this system into a parallel one lies in how the rational approximation is handled. The denominator of this rational function corresponds to a matrix that must be inverted. For a multi-dimensional problem, this matrix is large and computationally expensive to invert directly.\n\nHowever, if the rational approximation is decomposed using partial fractions, the problem is transformed. A partial fraction expansion breaks down the complex fractional approximation into a sum of simpler linear fractions. Each of these simpler fractions corresponds to a much smaller, independent linear system of equations. In the context of a multi-dimensional heat equation solved via splitting, these linear systems often correspond to one-dimensional problems, which can be solved independently and simultaneously on different processors.\n\nThis decomposition is the enabling step for parallelization. Therefore, the linear partial fraction expansion of the fractional approximation is the key factor that allows the distribution of the workload across multiple processors, converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one.\n\nOther options are less central to the parallelization process:\n*   **Stability analysis** is crucial for any numerical algorithm, parallel or sequential, to ensure that errors do not amplify, but it is not the mechanism that enables parallelization.\n*   **Nonlocal boundary conditions** and **complex roots** of the fractional approximation can affect the implementation details and complexity, but they are not the fundamental factor that allows for the parallel splitting of the algorithm. In fact, some parallel methods are specifically designed to use approximations with real-only roots to avoid complex arithmetic.\n\n<<<D>>>"
