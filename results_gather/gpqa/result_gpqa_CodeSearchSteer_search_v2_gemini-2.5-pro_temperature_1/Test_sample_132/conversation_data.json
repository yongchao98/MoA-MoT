    "The search results confirm the methodology for solving this type of buffer problem. The key steps are:\n1.  Identify the primary buffer components, which are the weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻ from KH₂PO₄) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻ from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O).\n2.  Calculate the molar concentrations of these two species.\n3.  Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (or the Ka₂ expression) for the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻) to determine the concentration of H⁺ ions in the solution. The Ka₂ value provided (6.2x10⁻⁸) is consistent with the values found in the search results.\n4.  The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the third dissociation (HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻).\n5.  Use the calculated [H⁺], the initial concentration of HPO₄²⁻, and the Ka₃ value (1.8x10⁻¹²) in the Ka₃ expression to solve for the [PO₄³⁻].\n\nThe calculation performed in the thought process aligns perfectly with this confirmed methodology. No contradictions or alternative methods that would yield a different result were found. The Ka values provided in the problem are standard and confirmed by multiple sources. Therefore, I can proceed with the final answer based on the initial calculation.\n\n**Step-by-step Calculation:**\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of each component:**\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n    *   These salts dissociate completely to give H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ ions, respectively.\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components:**\n    *   Volume of solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M (This is the weak acid, HA)\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M (This is the conjugate base, A⁻)\n\n3.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] using the Ka₂ equilibrium:**\n    *   The relevant equilibrium is: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   Rearranging for [H⁺]: [H⁺] = Ka₂ * [H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 / 0.02809)\n    *   [H⁺] = 8.109 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO₄³⁻] using the Ka₃ equilibrium:**\n    *   The relevant equilibrium is: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   Rearranging for [PO₄³⁻]: [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * [HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺]\n    *   We use the initial concentration of HPO₄²⁻ and the calculated [H⁺].\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809) / (8.109 x 10⁻⁸)\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = 6.235 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nRounding the result to three significant figures gives 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
