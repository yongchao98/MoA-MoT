    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**1. Normalize the initial state vector**\n\nThe initial state of the system is given by the column matrix:\n|ψ⟩ = `[-1, 2, 1]`\n\nTo find the probability, the state vector must be normalized. The squared norm of the state is:\n⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6\n\nThe normalization constant is 1/√6. Therefore, the normalized state vector is:\n|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * `[-1, 2, 1]`\n\n**2. Find the eigenvector of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0**\n\nThe operator P is given by the matrix:\nP = `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector |p₀⟩ such that P|p₀⟩ = 0|p₀⟩ = 0. Let |p₀⟩ = `[x, y, z]`.\n`[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]` * `[x, y, z]` = `[0, 0, 0]`\n\nThis gives the system of equations:\n1.  (1/√2)y = 0  => y = 0\n2.  (1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0  => x + z = 0 => x = -z\n3.  (1/√2)y = 0  => y = 0\n\nThe eigenvector is of the form `[x, 0, -x]`. To normalize this eigenvector, we have x² + 0² + (-x)² = 1, which gives 2x² = 1, so x = 1/√2.\nThe normalized eigenvector |p₀⟩ for the eigenvalue 0 is:\n|p₀⟩ = `[1/√2, 0, -1/√2]`\n\n**3. Calculate the probability of measuring P = 0**\n\nThe probability of measuring the eigenvalue 0 for P is the squared magnitude of the projection of the initial state onto the eigenvector |p₀⟩.\nProb(P=0) = |⟨p₀|ψ_norm⟩|²\n\n⟨p₀|ψ_norm⟩ = `[1/√2, 0, -1/√2]` * (1/√6) * `[-1, 2, 1]`\n= (1/√6) * [(1/√2)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1/√2)(1)]\n= (1/√6) * [-1/√2 - 1/√2]\n= (1/√6) * [-2/√2]\n= (1/√6) * [-√2]\n= -1/√3\n\nProb(P=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3\n\n**4. Determine the state of the system after the measurement of P**\n\nAfter measuring P and obtaining the value 0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding normalized eigenvector |p₀⟩.\nThe new state is |ψ'⟩ = |p₀⟩ = `[1/√2, 0, -1/√2]`\n\n**5. Calculate the probability of measuring Q = -1 in the new state**\n\nThe operator Q is given by the matrix:\nQ = `[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\nSince Q is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements (1, 0, -1), and the corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. The eigenvector |q₋₁⟩ for the eigenvalue -1 is `[0, 0, 1]`.\n\nThe probability of measuring Q = -1 in the state |ψ'⟩ is the squared magnitude of the projection of |ψ'⟩ onto |q₋₁⟩.\nProb(Q=-1) = |⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩|²\n\n⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩ = `[0, 0, 1]` * `[1/√2, 0, -1/√2]`\n= (0)(1/√2) + (0)(0) + (1)(-1/√2)\n= -1/√2\n\nProb(Q=-1) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2\n\n**6. Calculate the joint probability**\n\nThe probability of first measuring P=0 and then measuring Q=-1 is the product of the individual probabilities calculated in the steps above.\nTotal Probability = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 after P=0)\nTotal Probability = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6\n\nThe final answer is **1/6**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
