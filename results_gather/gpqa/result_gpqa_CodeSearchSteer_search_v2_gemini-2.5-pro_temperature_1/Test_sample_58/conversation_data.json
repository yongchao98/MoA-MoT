    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we must first calculate the number of moles of the acidic and basic species being mixed.\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of each substance:**\n    *   **CH3COOH (Acetic Acid - a weak acid):**\n        *   Moles = Molarity × Volume (L)\n        *   Moles = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 moles of CH3COOH\n    *   **HCl (Hydrochloric Acid - a strong acid):**\n        *   Moles = Molarity × Volume (L)\n        *   Moles = 0.2 M × 0.400 L = 0.080 moles of HCl. Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.080 moles of H+ ions.\n    *   **Ba(OH)2 (Barium Hydroxide - a strong base):**\n        *   Moles = Molarity × Volume (L)\n        *   Moles = 0.3 M × 0.300 L = 0.090 moles of Ba(OH)2. Barium hydroxide dissociates to produce two hydroxide ions for each formula unit (Ba(OH)2 → Ba2+ + 2OH-).\n        *   Moles of OH- = 2 × 0.090 moles = 0.180 moles of OH- ions.\n\n2.  **Perform the neutralization reactions:**\n    The strong base (OH-) will first react with the strong acid (H+ from HCl), and then any remaining OH- will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n    *   **Step 2a: Strong Acid-Strong Base Neutralization**\n        *   Moles of H+ (from HCl) = 0.080 mol\n        *   Moles of OH- (from Ba(OH)2) = 0.180 mol\n        *   The H+ ions will be completely neutralized by the OH- ions.\n        *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n    *   **Step 2b: Strong Base-Weak Acid Neutralization**\n        *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.100 mol\n        *   Moles of CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n        *   The remaining OH- ions will react with the acetic acid.\n        *   Moles of OH- in excess = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n3.  **Calculate the final pH:**\n    The final solution contains 0.050 moles of excess strong base (OH-) in a total volume. The pH of the solution will be determined by this excess strong base, as its contribution to the hydroxide concentration is much greater than that of the weak conjugate base (CH3COO-) formed.\n\n    *   **Calculate the total volume:**\n        *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n\n    *   **Calculate the concentration of excess OH-:**\n        *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n        *   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n    *   **Calculate the pOH:**\n        *   pOH = -log[OH-]\n        *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n    *   **Calculate the pH:**\n        *   pH = 14 - pOH\n        *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nTherefore, the pH of the resulting solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<D>>>"
