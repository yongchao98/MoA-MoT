    "The provided information and the search results confirm the approach. The key is understanding the dissociation equilibrium of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe formation reaction for the Ca-EDTA complex is:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe formation constant (K_f), also known as the stability constant, is given by the expression:\nK_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺] * [EDTA⁴⁻])\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n*   Initial stoichiometric concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex = 0.02 M\n*   Formation constant, K_f = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nThe complex will slightly dissociate into its constituent ions. The dissociation is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nWe can set up an equilibrium table. Let 'x' be the change in concentration as the complex dissociates.\n\n| Species | Initial Concentration (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium Concentration (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n| EDTA⁴⁻ | 0 | +x | x |\n\nNow, substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\nK_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\nBecause the formation constant (K_f) is very large (5x10¹⁰), the equilibrium lies far to the right, meaning the complex is very stable and will only dissociate to a very small extent. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be significantly smaller than 0.02 M. This allows for the simplification:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nNow, we can solve for 'x', which represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺ ions:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx = 2 x 10⁻⁶.⁵\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This result matches option B. The assumption that x is much smaller than 0.02 is valid, as 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ is much less than 0.02.\n\n<<<B>>>"
