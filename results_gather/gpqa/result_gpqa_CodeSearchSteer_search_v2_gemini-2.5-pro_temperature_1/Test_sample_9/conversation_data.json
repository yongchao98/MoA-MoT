    "Here is a breakdown of the density for each exoplanet option:\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is essentially a twin of Earth, which has an average density of approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is stated to be about 5.5 g/cm³.\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** With the same composition but less mass, this planet would experience less gravitational compression from its own weight. Therefore, its material would be less compressed, resulting in a lower overall density than Earth's (< 5.51 g/cm³).\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** A planet with the same building materials as Earth but with significantly more mass will have a much stronger gravitational pull, causing the materials in its interior to be squeezed together much more tightly. This gravitational compression increases the planet's overall density. Models of super-Earths with an Earth-like composition show that as mass increases, density also increases. A rocky planet five times the mass of Earth would be significantly denser than Earth.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the options, the planet that is five times more massive than Earth (c) would undergo the most significant internal compression, leading to the highest density. Planet (a) and (b) have densities around 5.5 g/cm³, and planet (d) would be the least dense.\n\n<<<D>>>"
