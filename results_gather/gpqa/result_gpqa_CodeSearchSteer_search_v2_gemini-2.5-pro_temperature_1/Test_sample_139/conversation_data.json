    "The user's query is a chemical puzzle that requires identifying a substance (X) and then performing a calculation based on its constituent elements. I have deduced the identity of substance X and confirmed all the related chemical reactions and properties through search queries. My initial hypothesis seems correct.\n\n**Here is a summary of the findings:**\n\n*   **Substance X:** The clues strongly point to Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   It contains a heavier isotope: Deuterium (D), an isotope of Hydrogen.\n    *   Its non-deuterated analog, LiAlH₄, is a very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry, known for its violent reactions, especially with protic substances. LiAlD₄ shares these properties.\n*   **Melting Point of B:** The melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C), which matches the clue precisely. Therefore, **B is D₂O**.\n*   **Reaction of X with Y:**\n    *   Substance X (LiAlD₄) reacts violently with liquid Y to release gas W and form precipitate G.\n    *   If Y is heavy water (D₂O), the reaction is: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`. This reaction is known to be violent.\n    *   **Gas W** is D₂ (dideuterium). A D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, matching the clue that the number of protons and neutrons is the same.\n    *   **Precipitate G** is Aluminium deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃.\n    *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) causes decomposition to Al₂O₃ and D₂O (substance B), which aligns with the clues.\n*   **Reaction with Keto Acid:** LiAlH₄ (and by extension LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols. A keto acid contains both functional groups. For example, reducing pyruvic acid (which has 3 oxygen atoms) would yield propane-1,2-diol, a product with 2 oxygen atoms, which matches the clue.\n*   **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminium (atomic number 13).\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in the substance.\n    *   The mass of the lightest element's instances in the molecule: There are four atoms of Deuterium (²H or D). The mass of one deuterium atom is approximately 2 amu. The total mass is 4 * 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   The mass of the heaviest element's instances in the molecule: There is one atom of Aluminium. The only stable isotope of Aluminium is Aluminium-27 (²⁷Al), which has an atomic mass of approximately 27 amu. The total mass is 1 * 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   Cumulative mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe logic holds, and the calculation is straightforward based on the identified substance. All clues are satisfied.\n\nFinal answer is 35, which corresponds to option D.\nI am ready to provide the final answer.\nBased on the detailed chemical puzzle provided, the substance X is identified as Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄). Here is a step-by-step deduction:\n\n1.  **Identification of Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**: The melting point of substance B is stated to be very close to 277 K (4°C). This is the characteristic melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C or 276.97 K. This implies that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is Deuterium (D), an isotope of hydrogen.\n\n2.  **Identification of Substance X**: The problem states that substance X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Since X contains deuterium, its analog contains hydrogen. Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) is a very powerful and common reducing agent, and its deuterated version, Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄), is also used for isotopic labeling. This makes LiAlD₄ a strong candidate for substance X.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Reaction**:\n    *   Substance X (LiAlD₄) reacts violently with liquid Y. Let's assume Y is heavy water (D₂O). The reaction is `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`. This reaction is indeed violent.\n    *   A gas, W, is released whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. The gas produced is D₂. A deuterium nucleus has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description perfectly.\n    *   A precipitate, G, is formed. In the reaction, Aluminium deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, would precipitate.\n    *   When G is heated, it releases B (D₂O). Heating Al(OD)₃ would cause it to decompose into Al₂O₃ and D₂O, which is consistent with the clues.\n\n4.  **Reaction with a Keto Acid**: LiAlH₄ (and therefore LiAlD₄) reduces both the ketone and carboxylic acid functional groups of a keto acid into alcohol groups. For instance, pyruvic acid (CH₃COCOOH), which has three oxygen atoms, would be reduced to propane-1,2-diol (CH₃CH(OH)CH₂(OH)), a product containing two oxygen atoms. This matches the problem's description.\n\n5.  **Calculation of Cumulative Atomic Masses**:\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The constituent elements are Lithium (lightest metal), Aluminium (heaviest element), and Deuterium (isotope of the lightest element, Hydrogen).\n    *   The **lightest element** present is Hydrogen (represented by its isotope, Deuterium).\n    *   The **heaviest element** present is Aluminium.\n    *   The cumulative mass from the atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen) in the molecule is the sum of the masses of the four Deuterium atoms. The mass of one Deuterium (²H) atom is approximately 2 atomic mass units (amu).\n        *   Total mass from Deuterium = 4 × 2 amu = 8 amu.\n    *   The cumulative mass from the atoms of the heaviest element (Aluminium) in the molecule is the mass of the one Aluminium atom. The stable isotope of Aluminium is ²⁷Al, which has a mass of approximately 27 amu.\n        *   Total mass from Aluminium = 1 × 27 amu = 27 amu.\n    *   The cumulative atomic mass is the sum of these values: 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n<<<D>>>"
