    "To determine the correct reagents, let's analyze each reaction separately.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis reaction is a nucleophilic addition to a carbonyl group, specifically a cyanohydrin formation. Butan-2-one (a ketone) reacts with the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN. The reaction requires an acid to protonate the oxygen atom of the initial adduct. This can be achieved by using hydrogen cyanide (HCN) directly or by generating it in situ from a cyanide salt like NaCN and an acid. The role of reagent A is to act as this proton source.\n*   **H₃O⁺** (generated from a strong acid like HCl or H₂SO₄) will react with NaCN to form HCN, which then participates in the reaction. The acidic conditions also catalyze the reaction. This is a standard method for cyanohydrin formation.\n*   **NaHSO₃** (sodium bisulfite) reacts with ketones to form bisulfite addition products, which is a different reaction pathway. It is not used as the proton source for cyanohydrin synthesis.\n\nTherefore, reagent **A** must be **H₃O⁺**.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base, typically with heating. The reactant is a cyanohydrin, and the product is an α-hydroxy carboxylic acid.\n*   **HCl** (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and is commonly used to catalyze the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids in the presence of water.\n*   **CH₃COOH** (acetic acid) is a weak acid and is generally not effective for the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid.\n\nTherefore, reagent **B** must be **HCl**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions, reagent A is H₃O⁺ and reagent B is HCl. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
