    "Here is a step-by-step identification of compound E based on the provided reaction scheme and hints.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify Compound A**\n\n*   **Hint (a)** states that Compound A reacts with a phosphorous ylide in a Wittig reaction to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The Wittig reaction converts a ketone or aldehyde into an alkene. The \"propan-2-ylidene\" part (=C(CH₃)₂) comes from the ylide, meaning the C=O group of Compound A was at this position.\n*   By reversing the Wittig reaction on the product, we replace the `=C(CH₃)₂` group with a carbonyl group (`C=O`). The product name is somewhat ambiguous, but based on chemical logic, the starting ketone (Compound A) is **3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one**.\n*   **Hint (b)** supports this structure. The IR spectrum of Compound A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm⁻¹. This frequency is characteristic of a carbonyl group within a five-membered ring (a cyclopentanone) due to ring strain. In comparison, a typical six-membered ring ketone (cyclohexanone) shows a peak around 1715 cm⁻¹.\n\n### **Step 2: Identify Compound B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Compound A (3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one) reacts with HCN.\n*   This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the carbonyl carbon to form a cyanohydrin.\n*   **Compound B** is **1-cyano-3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Identify Compound C**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Compound B is reduced with H₂ in the presence of a Palladium (Pd) catalyst.\n*   Catalytic hydrogenation with H₂/Pd is a standard method to reduce a nitrile group (-C≡N) to a primary amine (-CH₂NH₂).\n*   **Compound C** is **1-(aminomethyl)-3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-ol**.\n\n### **Step 4: Identify Compound D and E**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Compound C reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂), and the resulting intermediate (Compound D) eliminates an inert gas to form Compound E.\n*   The reaction of a primary aliphatic amine with nitrous acid forms an unstable diazonium salt (Compound D). This intermediate readily loses nitrogen gas (N₂), an inert gas, to form a carbocation.\n*   The sequence starting from a 1-aminomethyl-cycloalkanol, like Compound C, and treating it with nitrous acid is known as the **Tiffeneau–Demjanov rearrangement**. This reaction is a reliable method for expanding a cyclic ketone's ring by one carbon.\n*   The rearrangement involves the migration of a carbon atom from the ring to the carbocation, expanding the five-membered ring into a six-membered ring. The positive charge then shifts to the carbon that originally bore the hydroxyl group, which tautomerizes to a stable ketone.\n*   Tracing the atoms during this ring expansion shows that the methyl groups, originally at positions 3 and 4 of the cyclopentanone, will be located at positions 3 and 4 of the newly formed cyclohexanone ring.\n*   Therefore, **Compound E** is **3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n### **Final Confirmation**\n\n*   **Hint (b)** provides final confirmation. The IR spectrum of Compound E shows a strong peak around 1715 cm⁻¹. This value is characteristic of a carbonyl in a six-membered ring (cyclohexanone), which has less ring strain than a cyclopentanone. This matches the structure of 3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, Compound E is identified as 3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n<<<B>>>"
