    "To determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we must identify the mutation that has the highest probability of creating a non-functional protein. This involves analyzing how each mutation alters the gene's protein-coding sequence.\n\n### Analysis of Mutations\n\nFirst, let's establish the amino acid sequence of the intact gene by breaking its DNA sequence into three-letter codons, starting with the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT…-3’`\n*   **Amino Acid Sequence:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr...\n\nNow, let's analyze the effect of each mutation:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** The sequence `5’-ATGTTCTACGCT…-3’` translates to the codons `ATG TTC TAC GCT…`. This changes the original `TTT` codon to `TTC` and the `CTC` codon to `TAC`.\n    *   `TTT` to `TTC` both code for the amino acid Phenylalanine (Phe), making this a silent mutation.\n    *   `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine) is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. While this could potentially affect the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** The sequence `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCT…-3’` translates to the codons `ATG TTC TAA GCT…`.\n    *   Similar to Mutant 1, `TTT` changes to `TTC` (a silent mutation).\n    *   Crucially, the third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is mutated to `TAA`. The `TAA` codon is a **nonsense or stop codon**. This signals the cell's machinery to stop protein synthesis prematurely. The resulting protein would be truncated to only two amino acids, making it almost certainly non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** The sequence `5’-ATGTTTTACGCT…-3’` translates to `ATG TTT TAC GCT…`.\n    *   This changes the third codon from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, similar to the one in Mutant 1. The impact on protein function is uncertain and less likely to be as severe as a nonsense mutation.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** The sequence `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACT...-3’` translates to `ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...`.\n    *   This sequence contains two changes compared to the intact gene: `CTC` becomes `TAC` (Leucine to Tyrosine) and `GGT` becomes `ACT` (Glycine to Threonine). These are two separate **missense mutations**. While multiple amino acid changes increase the chance of disrupting protein function compared to a single missense mutation, it is still less definitive than a premature stop codon.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nA nonsense mutation that introduces a premature stop codon is one of the most severe types of mutations, as it leads to a shortened, incomplete protein that is typically non-functional. Missense mutations only change a single amino acid, which may or may not disrupt the protein's function. A silent mutation, by definition, does not change the amino acid sequence, though recent research shows it can still have subtle effects.\n\nAmong the choices, Mutant 2 is the only one that introduces a premature stop codon. This happens very early in the gene sequence (at the third codon), ensuring the resulting protein will be severely truncated and non-functional. This makes it the most probable mutation to successfully eliminate the unwanted compound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
