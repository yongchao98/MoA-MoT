    "The validity of the Mott-Gurney equation rests on several key assumptions about the device and the charge transport mechanism. Analyzing the options based on these foundational principles reveals the correct statement.\n\nThe core assumptions for the Mott-Gurney law are:\n*   **Single-Carrier Device:** The model assumes that current is carried by only one type of charge carrier, either electrons or holes (unipolar transport).\n*   **Trap-Free:** The derivation considers an ideal semiconductor or insulator with no electronic trap states within the band gap that could capture injected carriers.\n*   **Ohmic Contact:** The charge-injecting contact must be \"Ohmic,\" meaning it can supply an unlimited number of charge carriers. This is equivalent to having no energy barrier for carrier injection. A Schottky contact, which has a rectifying barrier, is not suitable.\n*   **Drift-Dominated Current:** The model assumes that the current is driven by the electric field (drift current) and that the contribution from carrier diffusion is negligible.\n\nEvaluating the given options:\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect because the law is derived for a single-carrier device.\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.** This is incorrect because the current is assumed to be a drift current; it is the diffusion current that is considered negligible.\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect because an Ohmic contact (no injection barrier), not a rectifying Schottky contact, is required.\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.** This statement correctly combines all the key assumptions: it specifies a trap-free material, a single-carrier device, a contact with no injection barrier (which defines an ideal Ohmic contact), and negligible diffusion current.\n\n<<<D>>>"
