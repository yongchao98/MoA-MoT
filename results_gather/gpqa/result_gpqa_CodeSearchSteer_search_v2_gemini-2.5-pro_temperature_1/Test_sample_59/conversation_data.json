    "To determine how long the journey takes for the astronaut, we need to calculate the time dilation effect. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n### 1. Distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud\n\nThe Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. According to various astronomical observations, its distance from Earth is approximately 163,000 light-years.\n\n### 2. Time of Travel in Earth's Frame of Reference\n\nFirst, we calculate the time it would take for the spacecraft to reach Earth from the perspective of an observer on Earth.\n\n*   **Distance (d):** 163,000 light-years\n*   **Speed (v):** 0.99999987 * c\n\nThe time (t) in Earth's frame of reference is:\nt = distance / speed\nt = 163,000 light-years / 0.99999987 * c\nSince a light-year is the distance light travels in one year, we can simplify this to:\nt ≈ 163,000 / 0.99999987 years\nt ≈ 163,000.021 years\n\nFrom Earth's perspective, the journey takes slightly more than 163,000 years.\n\n### 3. Time Dilation and the Astronaut's Frame of Reference\n\nDue to the effects of special relativity, time for the astronaut moving at a relativistic speed will pass much slower than for an observer on Earth. We can calculate the time experienced by the astronaut (the proper time, t') using the Lorentz factor (γ).\n\nThe Lorentz factor is calculated as:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nGiven v = 0.99999987 * c, v/c = 0.99999987.\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.99999987²)\nγ ≈ 1 / √(1 - 0.99999974)\nγ ≈ 1 / √0.00000026\nγ ≈ 1 / 0.0005099\nγ ≈ 1961.16\n\nNow, we can find the time experienced by the astronaut:\nt' = t / γ\nt' = 163,000.021 years / 1961.16\nt' ≈ 83.11 years\n\nThe journey will take approximately 83.11 years from the astronaut's point of view.\n\n### 4. Astronaut's Age and Conclusion\n\nThe astronaut was 22 years old at the start of the journey. The time elapsed for the astronaut is about 83.11 years.\n\n*   **Astronaut's age upon arrival:** 22 + 83.11 = 105.11 years\n\nSince the average lifetime of these aliens is 150 solar years, the astronaut will be approximately 105 years old upon reaching Earth and will have survived the trip.\n\nComparing our calculated travel time for the astronaut (≈83 years) with the given options:\nA) 72 years\nB) The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth.\nC) 81 years\nD) 77 years\n\nThe calculated value of ~83 years is closest to 81 years. The minor difference can be attributed to using a more precise value for the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (some sources might cite a slightly different distance, for example, 160,000 light-years, which would result in a travel time closer to 81.6 years) or rounding during intermediate steps. Let's quickly re-calculate with a distance of 160,000 light-years.\n\nt = 160,000 light-years / 0.99999987 * c ≈ 160,000.02 years\nt' = 160,000.02 / 1961.16 ≈ 81.58 years\n\nThis value is very close to 81 years.\n\n<<<C>>>"
