    "Here is a step-by-step solution to determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1.\n\n### 1. Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star. For a planet in a circular orbit, this temperature is related to its orbital distance (semi-major axis, 'a'). The formula shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance. This can be expressed as:\n\n*   T_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\nThis relationship holds true because the other factors in the equilibrium temperature equation—the star's temperature and radius, and the planet's albedo—are constant for all three planets in this system. Squaring both sides and rearranging gives the relationship for the orbital distance:\n\n*   a ∝ 1 / T_eq²\n\n### 2. Relate Orbital Period to Orbital Distance\n\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). This is written as:\n\n*   P² ∝ a³\n\nThis law is a fundamental principle describing the motion of any object orbiting a central body, assuming the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's mass.\n\n### 3. Combine the Relationships to Link Period and Temperature\n\nBy substituting the relationship for 'a' from step 1 into Kepler's Third Law from step 2, we can establish a direct link between the orbital period and the equilibrium temperature:\n\n*   P² ∝ (1 / T_eq²)³\n*   P² ∝ 1 / T_eq⁶\n\nTaking the square root of both sides gives the final relationship:\n\n*   P ∝ 1 / T_eq³\n\nThis means that a planet's orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of its equilibrium temperature.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Ratios\n\nWe are given the following temperature ratios:\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 1.4\n*   T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3\n\nFirst, we calculate the temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet3:\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22\n\nNow, we use the relationship from step 3 (P ∝ 1 / T_eq³) to find the ratio of the orbital periods for Planet3 and Planet1:\n*   P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)³\n\nSubstitute the calculated temperature ratio:\n*   P3 / P1 = (3.22)³\n*   P3 / P1 ≈ 33.386\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 33.4. The information regarding the planet masses and the TTV discovery method is not required for this calculation, as the planets' masses are considered negligible compared to their host star's mass in the standard application of these laws.\n\nThe orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
