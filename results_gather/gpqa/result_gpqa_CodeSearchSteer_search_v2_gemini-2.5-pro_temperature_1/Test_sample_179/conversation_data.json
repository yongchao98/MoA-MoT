    "### Analysis of the System's Energy\n\nThe total electrostatic potential energy of this system is the sum of two components:\n1.  **`U_p`**: The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge (at point P) and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n2.  **`U_s`**: The potential energy from the mutual repulsion of the 12 charges on the sphere.\n\nThe total energy `U_total = U_p + U_s`. To find the minimum energy, we must determine the arrangement of the 12 charges on the sphere that minimizes their mutual potential energy, `U_s`.\n\n### The Thomson Problem and the Icosahedron\n\nThis is a classic physics problem known as the Thomson problem. For 12 identical charges on the surface of a sphere, the configuration that minimizes the electrostatic potential energy is when the charges are located at the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n\n### Calculation of the Potential Energy\n\nLet `q` be the charge of each particle, so `q = 2e`, where `e` is the elementary charge (`1.602 x 10^-19` C). The distance of the 12 charges from the central point P is `r = 2` m.\n\n**1. Energy of Interaction with the Central Charge (`U_p`)**\n\nThe central charge is also `q = 2e`. The potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12 shell charges is `k * q * q / r`, where `k` is Coulomb's constant (`8.987 x 10^9 N·m²/C²`).\n\n`U_p = 12 * (k * (2e)² / r) = 48 * k * e² / r`\n\n**2. Energy of the 12 Charges on the Sphere (`U_s`)**\n\nThe potential energy of the 12 charges on the sphere is the sum of the potential energies for all unique pairs. This can be expressed as:\n\n`U_s = (k * (2e)² / r) * S_12 = (4 * k * e² / r) * S_12`\n\nHere, `S_12` is the dimensionless energy sum for the icosahedral configuration, representing the sum of all inverse pair distances scaled by the sphere's radius `r`. For an icosahedron, the vertices have three distinct separation distances, leading to the exact value:\n\n`S_12 = 15 * sqrt(5 + 2*sqrt(5)) + 3 ≈ 49.165`\n\n**3. Total Energy (`U_total`)**\n\nCombining the two energy components:\n\n`U_total = U_p + U_s = (48 * k * e² / r) + (4 * k * e² / r) * S_12`\n`U_total = (4 * k * e² / r) * (12 + S_12)`\n\nSubstituting the values `r = 2` m and `S_12 ≈ 49.165`:\n\n`U_total = (4 * k * e² / 2) * (12 + 49.165) = 2 * k * e² * (61.165)`\n\nUsing the known values for the physical constants:\n*   `k * e² ≈ 2.307 x 10^-28 J·m`\n\n`U_total ≈ 2 * (2.307 x 10^-28 J·m) * (61.165)`\n`U_total ≈ 2.8225 x 10^-26 J`\n\nThis result can also be found by first calculating the energy for particles with charge `e`, which corresponds to option C, and then scaling the result. Since the energy is proportional to the square of the charge, for charges of `2e`, the energy will be four times greater.\n\nEnergy for charges `e`:\n`U(e) = (k * e² / 2) * (12 + S_12) ≈ (2.307 x 10^-28 / 2) * 61.165 ≈ 7.056 x 10^-27 J` (Option C)\n\nEnergy for charges `2e`:\n`U(2e) = U(e) * 4 ≈ (7.056 x 10^-27 J) * 4 ≈ 2.8224 x 10^-26 J`\n\nRounding this value to three decimals gives `2.822 x 10^-26 J`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
