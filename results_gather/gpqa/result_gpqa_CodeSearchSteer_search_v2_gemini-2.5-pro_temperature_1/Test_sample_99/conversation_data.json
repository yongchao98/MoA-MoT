    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n*   **Compound A (C₃H₆) to Compound B:** Compound A is propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂). Its bromination in carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄) is an electrophilic addition reaction that breaks the double bond and adds a bromine atom to each of the carbons, forming 1,2-dibromopropane. This is Compound B.\n\n*   **Compound B to Compound C:** 1,2-dibromopropane (B) reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH), a strong base. This causes a double dehydrohalogenation (removal of two HBr molecules) to form an alkyne. The product is propyne (CH₃-C≡CH), which is Compound C.\n\n*   **Compound C to Compound D:** When propyne (C) is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it undergoes cyclic polymerization. Three molecules of propyne trimerize to form 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, also known as mesitylene. This is Compound D.\n\n*   **Compound D to Compound E:** Mesitylene (D) reacts with a nitrating mixture (concentrated nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid). This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction that adds a nitro group (-NO₂) to the benzene ring, forming 2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (nitromesitylene). This is Compound E.\n\n*   **Compound E to Compound F:** The nitro group of Compound E is reduced to an amino group (-NH₂) using iron scrap and hydrochloric acid. This reaction converts 2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene to 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (also known as mesidine). This is Compound F.\n\n*   **Compound F to Compound G:** Mesidine (F), an aromatic amine, reacts with nitrous acid (formed in-situ from NaNO₂ and HCl) at low temperatures (0-5 °C). This process, called diazotization, converts the amino group into a diazonium salt, forming 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene diazonium chloride. This is Compound G.\n\n*   **Compound G to Compound H:** The diazonium salt (G) is warmed with a weak base like sodium hydroxide (or just with water), which hydrolyzes the diazonium group and replaces it with a hydroxyl group (-OH). This forms 1,3,5-trimethylphenol (mesitol), which is Compound H.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n*   **A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.** Compound F is mesidine (2,4,6-trimethylaniline). Aromatic amines are key components in the synthesis of azo dyes. Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\n*   **B) C is a flammable gas.** Compound C is propyne. It is a colorless, flammable gas at standard conditions, with a boiling point of -23.1 °C. Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\n*   **C) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.** Compound H is mesitol (1,3,5-trimethylphenol). The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, typically producing a violet, blue, or green color due to the formation of a colored iron-phenol complex. A yellow color is not the expected result; in fact, some sterically hindered phenols may not give a color at all. Therefore, this statement is likely incorrect.\n\n*   **D) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.** Compound D is mesitylene (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene). Due to the high symmetry of the molecule, the three aromatic protons are chemically equivalent, and the nine protons of the three methyl groups are also chemically equivalent. This results in two distinct signals in the 1H NMR spectrum, both of which are singlets because there are no adjacent non-equivalent protons to cause splitting. Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\nThe incorrect statement is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
