    "To determine the hypothetical exoplanet's relative radius, we must first calculate the brightness variation caused by the starspots and then find the planet radius that would produce a transit of the same depth.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Light Curve Amplitude from Starspots\n\nThe brightness of a star is related to its temperature by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, where the emitted flux is proportional to the fourth power of the effective temperature (T⁴). The amplitude of the brightness variation due to rotational modulation can be found by comparing the star's flux when the unspotted hemisphere is visible (maximum flux) to when the spotted hemisphere is visible (minimum flux).\n\nThe given parameters are:\n*   Star's effective temperature (Teff): 6000 K\n*   Spot temperature (Tspot): 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n*   Spot filling factor on the active hemisphere (f): 20% or 0.20\n\nThe maximum flux (F_max) occurs when the immaculate hemisphere faces the observer. We can normalize this flux to be proportional to Teff⁴.\n\nThe minimum flux (F_min) occurs when the spotted hemisphere is visible. Here, 20% of the area is covered by cooler spots, and the remaining 80% has the normal effective temperature. The flux is therefore a weighted average:\n\nF_min ∝ (1 - f) * Teff⁴ + f * Tspot⁴\n\nThe relative amplitude (A_spot) of this variation is:\n\nA_spot = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n\nA_spot = (Teff⁴ - [ (1 - f) * Teff⁴ + f * Tspot⁴ ]) / Teff⁴\n\nA_spot = f * (Teff⁴ - Tspot⁴) / Teff⁴ = f * [ 1 - (Tspot / Teff)⁴ ]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nA_spot = 0.20 * [ 1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴ ]\nA_spot = 0.20 * [ 1 - (5/6)⁴ ]\nA_spot = 0.20 * [ 1 - 0.48225 ]\nA_spot = 0.20 * 0.51775\nA_spot ≈ 0.10355\n\nSo, the star's brightness varies by about 10.36% due to the spots.\n\n### Step 2: Equate to Exoplanet Transit Depth\n\nThe dimming of a star caused by a transiting exoplanet is known as the transit depth (δ). This depth is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. This relationship is expressed as:\n\nδ = (Area_planet / Area_star) = (π * Rpl²) / (π * Rstar²) = (Rpl / Rstar)²\n\nThe problem requires that this transit depth be equal to the amplitude caused by the starspots.\n\n(Rpl / Rstar)² = A_spot ≈ 0.10355\n\n### Step 3: Solve for the Relative Planet Radius (Rpl/Rstar)\n\nTo find the relative radius of the hypothetical planet, we take the square root of the transit depth:\n\nRpl / Rstar = √0.10355\nRpl / Rstar ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.07\nB) ~0.11\nC) ~0.32\nD) ~0.39\n\nThe calculated relative radius of ~0.32 matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
