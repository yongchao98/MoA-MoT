    "To evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the given vector field, we can use the Divergence Theorem, also known as Gauss's Theorem. The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field within a closed volume is equal to the outward flux of the vector field through the surface that encloses the volume.\n\nThe vector field is given by **f**(r) = (1/r²) **r̂**, where **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction. The volume is a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.\n\nThe Divergence Theorem is expressed as:\n∫∫∫ (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV = ∮∮ (**f** ⋅ d**S**)\n\nHere, d**S** is the differential surface area vector on the sphere's surface, which is given by d**S** = **r̂** R² sin(θ) dθ dφ.\n\nThe steps to solve the integral are as follows:\n1.  **Set up the surface integral:** The surface is the sphere of radius R. On this surface, the vector field is **f**(R) = (1/R²) **r̂**.\n2.  **Calculate the dot product:** We compute the dot product of the vector field and the surface element:\n    **f** ⋅ d**S** = [(1/R²) **r̂**] ⋅ [**r̂** R² sin(θ) dθ dφ]\n    Since **r̂** ⋅ **r̂** = 1, the R² terms cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n    **f** ⋅ d**S** = sin(θ) dθ dφ\n3.  **Evaluate the integral:** The integral over the surface of the sphere is:\n    ∮∮ sin(θ) dθ dφ = ∫ (from φ=0 to 2π) dφ * ∫ (from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ\n    *   The integral of sin(θ) from 0 to π is [-cos(θ)] from 0 to π = -(-1) - (-1) = 2.\n    *   The integral of dφ from 0 to 2π is [φ] from 0 to 2π = 2π.\n    *   Multiplying these results gives: 2 * 2π = 4π.\n\nTherefore, the value of the volume integral of the divergence of the field is 4π.\n\nIt is important to note that a direct calculation of the divergence of **f**(r) gives zero for all r ≠ 0. However, the vector field has a singularity at the origin (r=0), where its value is undefined. This singularity acts as a source, and its contribution is captured by the Divergence Theorem. The divergence at the origin can be mathematically described using the Dirac delta function, where ∇ ⋅ (**r̂**/r²) = 4πδ³(**r**). Integrating this over a volume that includes the origin confirms the result of 4π. Because the sphere in the problem is centered at the origin, the singularity is included, and the correct result is obtained via the surface integral.\n\n<<<C>>>"
