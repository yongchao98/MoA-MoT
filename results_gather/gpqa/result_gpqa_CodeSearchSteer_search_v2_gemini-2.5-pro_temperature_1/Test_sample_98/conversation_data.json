    "The user wants me to identify an unknown compound from a list of four options based on its FTIR and 1H NMR spectral data.\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data:**\n*   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n*   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this data confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n\n**2. Analysis of 1H NMR Data:**\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated molecules, which is consistent with this information.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex splitting pattern arises from a single proton being coupled to three different, neighboring groups of protons.\n    *   The **doublet (d)** component means it is coupled to one adjacent proton (a -CH group).\n    *   The **triplet (t)** component means it is coupled to two adjacent, equivalent protons (a -CH₂- group).\n    *   The **quartet (q)** component means it is coupled to three adjacent, equivalent protons (a -CH₃ group).\n    *   Therefore, the proton responsible for this signal must be a methine (-CH) proton that is adjacent to another -CH group, a -CH₂- group, and a -CH₃ group.\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This splitting pattern arises from a proton being coupled to three different neighboring groups.\n    *   The **doublet (d)** component means it is coupled to one adjacent proton (a -CH group).\n    *   The first **triplet (t)** component means it is coupled to two adjacent, equivalent protons (a -CH₂- group).\n    *   The second **triplet (t)** component means it is coupled to another set of two adjacent, equivalent protons (a different -CH₂- group).\n    *   Therefore, the proton responsible for this signal must be a methine (-CH) proton that is adjacent to another -CH group and two non-equivalent -CH₂- groups.\n\n**3. Evaluation of the Candidate Structures:**\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH:**\n    *   Let's analyze the methine (C**H**) protons.\n    *   The CH next to the COOH is coupled to one CH and one CH₃. This would be a doublet of quartets.\n    *   The other CH is coupled to one CH, one CH₂, and one CH₃. This would give a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   This molecule does not have a proton environment that would produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH:**\n    *   Let's analyze the methine (C**H**) protons.\n    *   The CH next to the CH₂COOH group is coupled to one CH, one CH₂, and one CH₃. This would give a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   The other CH is coupled to one CH and two CH₃ groups. This would not give a `dtt`.\n    *   This molecule does not have a proton environment that would produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH:**\n    *   Let's analyze the methine (C**H**) protons.\n    *   The CH next to the COOH is coupled to one CH and one CH₂. This would be a doublet of triplets.\n    *   The other CH is coupled to one CH and two different CH₂ groups (one from the ethyl group on the same carbon, and one from the ethyl group on the adjacent carbon). This would produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   This molecule does not have a proton environment that would produce a `dtq` signal.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH:**\n    *   Let's analyze the two different methine (C**H**) protons in the main chain.\n    *   **Proton 1 (the CH attached to a CH₃ and an ethyl group):** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The neighboring CH proton (1H) -> **doublet**.\n        *   The adjacent CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H) -> **triplet**.\n        *   The adjacent CH₃ group (3H) -> **quartet**.\n        *   This proton's signal would be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal.\n    *   **Proton 2 (the CH attached to the CH₂COOH and an ethyl group):** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The neighboring CH proton (1H) -> **doublet**.\n        *   The adjacent CH₂ of the CH₂COOH group (2H) -> **triplet**.\n        *   The adjacent CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H) -> **triplet**.\n        *   This proton's signal would be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nStructure D is the only candidate that possesses two different methine protons whose coupling environments perfectly match both the \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" and the \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" signals described in the 1H NMR data.\n\n<<<D>>>"
