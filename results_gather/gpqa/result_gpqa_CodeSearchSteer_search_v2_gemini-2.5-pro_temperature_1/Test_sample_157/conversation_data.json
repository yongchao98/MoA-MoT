    "A dominant-negative mutation is one where the mutant protein interferes with the function of the wild-type protein. In the case of a protein that must dimerize to function, a common dominant-negative mechanism involves the mutant protein forming a non-functional complex with the wild-type protein. This \"poisons\" the wild-type protein, leading to an overall loss of function for the cell.\n\nLet's analyze the options in the context of the transcription factor described:\n\n*   **A) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype:** A dominant-negative mutation results in a loss-of-function, not a gain-of-function, phenotype.\n*   **B) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele:** For a dominant-negative effect to occur, the mutant protein must be stable enough to interact with and inhibit the wild-type protein. If the mutant protein were simply degraded, it couldn't interfere, and the phenotype would likely be recessive.\n*   **C) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype:** If the mutant protein completely lost its ability to dimerize, it could not interact with the wild-type protein. The wild-type proteins would be free to form functional homodimers, likely resulting in a wild-type (or near-wild-type) phenotype. This would be a recessive, not dominant-negative, mutation.\n*   **D) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype:** This is a plausible and documented mechanism for a dominant-negative effect. The mutation in the dimerization domain could cause the mutant protein to misfold. This misfolded protein could then not only be non-functional on its own but also trap wild-type proteins in non-functional aggregates. This sequestration of the wild-type protein leads to a dominant-negative, loss-of-function phenotype.\n\nTherefore, the most likely molecular phenotype is the formation of protein aggregates that sequester and inactivate the wild-type protein, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype.\n\n<<<D>>>"
