    "Here is a step-by-step calculation of the energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system.\n\n### 1. Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nFor a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the allowed energy levels are given by:\nE_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...)\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck's constant\n*   `m` is the mass of the particle\n*   `L` is the length of the well\n\nThe problem defines E = π²ħ² / 2mL², so the single-particle energy levels can be written as:\n**E_n = n²E**\n\n### 2. The Pauli Exclusion Principle\n\nThe system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles. These particles are fermions and must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. For this system, a quantum state is defined by the quantum number `n` and the spin projection `m_s` (+1/2 for spin-up or -1/2 for spin-down). This means each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n### 3. Ground State Energy\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **Level n=1:** We can place two particles in this level (one spin-up, one spin-down). The energy contributed by these particles is 2 × E₁ = 2 × (1²E) = 2E.\n*   **Level n=2:** We place the remaining two particles in the next lowest level (one spin-up, one spin-down). The energy from these particles is 2 × E₂ = 2 × (2²E) = 2 × 4E = 8E.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n**E_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E**\n\n### 4. First Excited State Energy\n\nTo find the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state configuration to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   The ground state configuration is (2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2).\n*   The highest occupied level is n=2.\n*   The lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n\nWe move one particle from n=2 to n=3. The new configuration is:\n*   Two particles in n=1: Energy = 2 × E₁ = 2E\n*   One particle in n=2: Energy = 1 × E₂ = 1 × (2²E) = 4E\n*   One particle in n=3: Energy = 1 × E₃ = 1 × (3²E) = 9E\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n**E_1st_excited = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E**\n\n### 5. Second Excited State Energy\n\nTo find the second excited state, we must consider all possible excitations from the ground state that have the next lowest energy. There are a few possibilities:\n\n*   **Possibility A:** Excite one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × 1²E) + (2 × 2²E) + (1 × 3²E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n\n*   **Possibility B:** Excite both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1²E) + (2 × 3²E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n\n*   **Possibility C:** Excite one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1²E) + (1 × 2²E) + (1 × 4²E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing the energies, the lowest energy configuration above the first excited state is 18E.\n**E_2nd_excited = 18E**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energies for the three states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
