    "The impulse approximation in nuclear physics rests on a set of simplifying assumptions that treat a complex many-body interaction as a simpler, single-body problem. Analyzing the four statements provides a clear picture of what this approximation entails.\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.** This is the foundational concept of the impulse approximation. The interaction is treated as an incoherent sum of scattering events off individual nucleons, rather than involving multiple nucleons at once (which would be described by meson-exchange currents) or the nucleus as a whole.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.** This assumption means that the incoming probe and the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the ejected nucleon) do not interact with the other \"spectator\" nucleons in the nucleus. This neglects so-called final-state interactions (FSI). When this assumption is included, the model is often specifically called the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA). More complex models, like the Distorted Wave Impulse Approximation (DWIA), attempt to account for FSI, thereby relaxing this specific assumption.\n\n3.  **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.** This statement concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation, however, deals with the behavior of *nucleons* within the *nucleus*. It is an approximation at the nucleonic level, not the sub-nucleonic quark level. Therefore, the internal dynamics of quarks are not a direct prerequisite for the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.** This is the \"impulse\" aspect of the approximation. The interaction is assumed to happen over a very short time, so the binding forces holding the nucleon within the nucleus are negligible during the collision itself. This allows the struck nucleon to be treated as a free particle for the duration of the interaction.\n\nBased on this analysis, the impulse approximation is jointly implied by the assumptions that the interaction is with a single nucleon (1), the rest of the nucleus is transparent to the interacting particles (2), and the nucleon's binding forces can be ignored during the rapid interaction (4).\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of assumptions is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
