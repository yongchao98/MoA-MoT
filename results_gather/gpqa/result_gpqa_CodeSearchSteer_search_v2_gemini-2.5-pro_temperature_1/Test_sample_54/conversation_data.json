    "Based on the provided 1H NMR data, the unknown compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectrum to support this conclusion:\n\n*   **Analysis of Proton Count:** The sum of the integrations (1H + 1H + 3H + 3H) equals a total of 8 hydrogen atoms. Propenyl acetate (C₅H₈O₂) has 8 hydrogens, whereas butenyl acetate (C₆H₁₀O₂) has 10 hydrogens. This immediately rules out both cis- and trans-butenyl acetate.\n\n*   **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, singlet):** This signal corresponds to the three protons of the acetate methyl group (CH₃-COO-). It is a singlet because these protons have no adjacent protons to couple with. This is a characteristic feature of an acetate group.\n\n*   **Signals of the Alkene Protons and Stereochemistry:** The key to distinguishing between the *cis* and *trans* isomers lies in the coupling constant (J-value) of the vinyl protons (the protons on the C=C double bond).\n    *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, doublet, J = 16.0 Hz):** This signal is in the typical region for a vinyl proton. The large coupling constant of 16.0 Hz is characteristic of a *trans* relationship between two adjacent vinyl protons. For *cis* isomers, the coupling constant is typically much smaller, in the range of 6-12 Hz. This proton is likely the one directly attached to the carbon bonded to the oxygen (O-CH=), as the electronegative oxygen atom shifts its signal further downfield.\n    *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, doublet of quartets):** This is the second vinyl proton. It is split into a doublet by the adjacent *trans* vinyl proton (with the same J-value of ~16.0 Hz) and into a quartet by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃).\n\n*   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, doublet):** This signal represents the methyl group attached to the double bond (-CH=CH-CH₃). It appears as a doublet because its protons are split by the single adjacent vinyl proton.\n\nThe combination of the total proton count and, most importantly, the large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) of the vinyl proton definitively points to a *trans* configuration. Therefore, the compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
