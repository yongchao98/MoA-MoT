    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the expectation value of the operator `O = 10σ_z + 5σ_x` for the given quantum state `|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩`.\n\nThe expectation value `⟨O⟩` is given by `⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩`.\n\nWe can write this as:\n`⟨O⟩ = ⟨ψ|(10σ_z + 5σ_x)|ψ⟩`\n`⟨O⟩ = 10⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩ + 5⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩`\n\nThis means we can calculate the expectation values of `σ_z` and `σ_x` separately and then combine them.\n\nThe given state is `|ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩`, with `a = 0.5` and `b = √3/2`.\nThe states `|↑⟩` and `|↓⟩` are the eigenstates of `σ_z`, with eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively.\n*   `σ_z|↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩`\n*   `σ_z|↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩`\n\nThe `σ_x` operator acts on the eigenstates as follows:\n*   `σ_x|↑⟩ = |↓⟩`\n*   `σ_x|↓⟩ = |↑⟩`\n\n**1. Calculate the expectation value of `σ_z` (`⟨σ_z⟩`)**\n\n`⟨σ_z⟩ = ⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩`\n`σ_z|ψ⟩ = σ_z(0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩) = 0.5(σ_z|↑⟩) + (√3)/2(σ_z|↓⟩) = 0.5(1)|↑⟩ + (√3)/2(-1)|↓⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ - (√3)/2|↓⟩`\n\nNow, we compute the inner product `⟨ψ|` with `σ_z|ψ⟩`:\n`⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩ = (0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓|) * (0.5|↑⟩ - (√3)/2|↓⟩)`\nUsing the orthogonality of the states (`⟨↑|↑⟩ = 1`, `⟨↓|↓⟩ = 1`, `⟨↑|↓⟩ = 0`, `⟨↓|↑⟩ = 0`):\n`⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.5)(0.5) - (√3/2)(√3/2) = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5`\n\n**2. Calculate the expectation value of `σ_x` (`⟨σ_x⟩`)**\n\n`⟨σ_x⟩ = ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩`\n`σ_x|ψ⟩ = σ_x(0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩) = 0.5(σ_x|↑⟩) + (√3)/2(σ_x|↓⟩) = 0.5|↓⟩ + (√3)/2|↑⟩`\n\nNow, we compute the inner product `⟨ψ|` with `σ_x|ψ⟩`:\n`⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ = (0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓|) * ((√3)/2|↑⟩ + 0.5|↓⟩)`\n`⟨σ_x⟩ = (0.5)(√3/2) + (√3/2)(0.5) = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2`\n\n**3. Combine the results**\n\nNow, substitute the expectation values back into the original expression:\n`⟨O⟩ = 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩`\n`⟨O⟩ = 10(-0.5) + 5(√3/2)`\n`⟨O⟩ = -5 + 2.5√3`\n\n**4. Calculate the numerical value**\n\nUsing the approximation `√3 ≈ 1.732`:\n`⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732`\n`⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33`\n`⟨O⟩ ≈ -0.67`\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the value is -0.7.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
