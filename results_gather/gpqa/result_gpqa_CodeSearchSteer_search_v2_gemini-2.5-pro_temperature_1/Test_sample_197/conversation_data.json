    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], among all cobalt-containing species, we need to calculate the mole fraction of each species in the solution.\n\nThe formation of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes is governed by the following equilibria and their overall stability constants (β):\n\n*   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺,         β₁ = 9\n*   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂],       β₂ = 40\n*   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻,     β₃ = 63\n*   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻,     β₄ = 16\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co²⁺ ion and all its complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co²⁺], the thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻], and the stability constants. The mole fraction (αₙ) of a specific complex, [Co(SCN)ₙ]²⁻ⁿ, is given by the formula:\n\nαₙ = (βₙ[SCN⁻]ⁿ) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nWe need to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which corresponds to α₂.\n\nGiven:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M (Since the thiocyanate concentration is ten times the total cobalt concentration, we can assume the free thiocyanate concentration is approximately 0.1 M).\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, let's calculate the denominator of the mole fraction equation (let's call it 'S'):\n*   1 = 1\n*   β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nS = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nNext, we calculate the numerator for the dithiocyanato complex, which is the β₂[SCN⁻]² term:\nNumerator = 0.4\n\nNow, we can calculate the mole fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]:\nα₂ = Numerator / S = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in the solution is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<D>>>"
