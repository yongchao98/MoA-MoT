    "This scenario involves comparing two different types of mean free paths within the same volume of gas:\n\n*   **λ1: The mean free path of gas molecules.** This is the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule. This process is governed by the kinetic theory of gases.\n*   **λ2: The mean free path of beam electrons.** This is the average distance a high-energy electron from the beam travels before being scattered by a gas molecule.\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the number density of scattering targets (n) and their collision cross-section (σ), which is their effective \"size\" for a collision. Since the gas conditions are the same, the number density *n* is constant for both situations. Therefore, the difference between λ1 and λ2 comes down to the difference in their respective interaction cross-sections.\n\n1.  **Gas-Molecule Interaction (λ1):** The interaction between two neutral gas molecules is governed by very short-range forces (van der Waals forces). The collision can be pictured like two billiard balls hitting each other. The effective size is the kinetic cross-section (σ_kinetic), which is related to the physical size of the molecules.\n\n2.  **Electron-Molecule Interaction (λ2):** The interaction between a charged electron and a neutral gas molecule is fundamentally different. The electron interacts with the electric field created by the molecule's components (the positive atomic nuclei and the negative electron cloud). This is a long-range Coulomb interaction. Because this force acts over a much larger distance than the physical size of the molecule, an electron can be significantly deflected (scattered) even without getting very close to the molecule.\n\nThis long-range interaction means the effective target area the gas molecule presents to an electron (σ_scattering) is significantly larger than the kinetic cross-section it presents to another gas molecule (σ_kinetic).\n\nSince the mean free path is *inversely* proportional to the cross-section, a larger cross-section results in a shorter mean free path. Because the electron scattering cross-section is larger, electrons will collide with gas molecules more frequently than gas molecules collide with each other. This leads to a shorter average distance traveled between collisions for the electrons.\n\nTherefore, the mean free path of the electrons (λ2) is shorter than the mean free path of the gas molecules (λ1).\n\n<<<A>>>"
