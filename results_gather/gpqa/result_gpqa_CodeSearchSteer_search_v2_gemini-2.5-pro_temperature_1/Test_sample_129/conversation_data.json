    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of an object for its Lyman-alpha absorption line to be detectable by optical ground-based telescopes, we must consider the wavelength at which Earth's atmosphere becomes transparent.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Lyman-alpha Wavelength**: The Lyman-alpha (Lyα) transition of neutral hydrogen has a rest wavelength of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å), which is equivalent to 121.6 nanometers (nm). This wavelength falls in the ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n2.  **Atmospheric Cutoff**: Earth's atmosphere, primarily due to ozone, absorbs most of the incoming UV radiation. Ground-based telescopes can only observe light at wavelengths that can penetrate the atmosphere. This atmospheric cutoff occurs at approximately 3200 Å (320 nm). Below this wavelength, the atmosphere is effectively opaque.\n\n3.  **Redshift Calculation**: For the Lyα absorption line at 1216 Å to be observable from the ground, it must be redshifted to a wavelength longer than the atmospheric cutoff of ~3200 Å. The relationship between rest wavelength (λ_rest), observed wavelength (λ_obs), and redshift (z) is given by the formula: `z = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1`.\n\n4.  **Estimating the Limit**:\n    *   Using the absolute atmospheric cutoff as the minimum observed wavelength:\n        λ_obs = 3200 Å\n        λ_rest = 1216 Å\n        z = (3200 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 2.63 - 1 = 1.63\n\n    *   This value (z ≈ 1.63) represents the theoretical minimum redshift. However, atmospheric transmission at 3200 Å is still very low. For practical and efficient observations, a higher wavelength where the atmosphere is more transparent is typically required. Some sources cite a practical limit for ground-based Lyman-alpha observations to be at a redshift of z ≳ 1.7 or even z ≳ 2.\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Options**:\n    *   A) 1.2: A redshift of 1.2 would shift the Lyα line to 1216 Å * (1 + 1.2) = 2675 Å. This is still deep in the UV and would be blocked by the atmosphere.\n    *   B) 1.9: A redshift of 1.9 would shift the Lyα line to 1216 Å * (1 + 1.9) = 3526 Å. This wavelength is above the atmospheric cutoff and is a realistic value for when observations become feasible.\n    *   C) 3: A redshift of 3 shifts the line to 1216 Å * (1 + 3) = 4864 Å, which is well within the visible spectrum. While observable, this is not the *lower limit*.\n    *   D) 2.4: A redshift of 2.4 shifts the line to 1216 Å * (1 + 2.4) = 4134 Å. This is also easily observable from the ground but is not the lowest possible limit.\n\nConsidering the need for sufficient atmospheric transmission for a clear signal, the practical lower limit is higher than the absolute physical cutoff. A redshift of approximately 1.9, which corresponds to an observed wavelength of about 3526 Å, represents a more realistic lower boundary for effective ground-based detection and aligns with available astronomical survey data.\n\n<<<B>>>"
