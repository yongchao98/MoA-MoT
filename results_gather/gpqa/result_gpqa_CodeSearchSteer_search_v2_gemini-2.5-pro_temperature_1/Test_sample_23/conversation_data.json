    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:** The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. The general formula for a hydrocarbon is CₓHᵧ.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `(y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008) = 0.1428`.\n    *   Simplifying with approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1): `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`.\n    *   This can be rearranged to `y ≈ 2x`.\n    *   A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ is a cycloalkane or an alkene. Since substance Z does not react further with hydrogen, it must be saturated, which points to a cycloalkane.\n    *   Let's check the formula for a cycloalkane, CₙH₂ₙ: The mass fraction of H is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857`. This is a perfect match.\n    *   We are told Z is a widely used solvent. Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) is a very common cycloalkane solvent. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Substance Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only Z (cyclohexane). This means the other component of Y must also have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n    *   The other component must not decolorize bromine water. Benzene (C₆H₆) fits this description; it is aromatic and only reacts with bromine in the presence of a catalyst, not with bromine water. Hydrogenation of benzene under severe conditions produces cyclohexane.\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   When heated with platinum, X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y. This can be seen as a hydrogen transfer reaction: `A + B → Cyclohexane + Benzene`.\n    *   By conserving atoms from the products (C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆), we know that A and B must both be C₆ compounds, and the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B must be `12 + 6 = 18`.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This confirms that both A and B must have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n    *   The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X.\n    *   We need to find two different C₆ unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18.\n        *   Cyclohexene has the formula C₆H₁₀. It has one double bond and decolorizes bromine water.\n        *   Cyclohexadienes have the formula C₆H₈. There are two common isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). The problem rules out conjugated bonds, so we consider **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   Let's check if this pair works: A = Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n        *   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our requirement.\n        *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ --(Pt, heat)--> C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is chemically plausible. It is a known type of disproportionation or hydrogen transfer reaction where cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is oxidized (dehydrogenated) to benzene.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of these liquids is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nTherefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<D>>>"
