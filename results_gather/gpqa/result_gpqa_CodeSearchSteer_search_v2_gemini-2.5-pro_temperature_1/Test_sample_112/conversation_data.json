    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of an O-H stretching vibration, and its broad nature suggests strong hydrogen bonding, which is characteristic of a carboxylic acid. Alcohols also show a broad O-H peak, but typically centered around 3300 cm⁻¹. The peak for a carboxylic acid O-H stretch is notably broad and is centered around 3000 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Carboxylic acids typically show a strong C=O absorption between 1690-1760 cm⁻¹. This, combined with the O-H peak, strongly supports the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n\n### 2. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** The presence of vinyl hydrogens (protons attached to the carbons of a double bond) confirms the existence of a C=C double bond, which corroborates the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Mass Spectrum\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very significant clue. In mass spectrometry, a fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45 is commonly attributed to the carboxyl group cation [COOH]⁺. This fragmentation strongly indicates that the compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n### 4. Combining the Evidence and Determining the Formula\n\n1.  The combined spectral data point conclusively to a molecule that is both a **carboxylic acid** (from FTIR and Mass Spec) and an **alkene** (from FTIR and 1H NMR). Such a compound is called an alkenoic acid.\n2.  A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A) C6H12O and D) C6H10O, as they only contain one oxygen atom.\n3.  We are left with two possibilities: B) C6H12O2 and C) C6H10O2. To distinguish between them, we can calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)** for each formula. The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   **For C6H12O2 (B):**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n        A degree of unsaturation of 1 corresponds to one double bond or one ring. The carboxylic acid functional group already contains one C=O double bond. Therefore, this formula represents a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid) and does not account for the additional C=C double bond identified by the spectral data.\n    *   **For C6H10O2 (C):**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n        A degree of unsaturation of 2 corresponds to two double bonds, or one triple bond, or a ring and a double bond. This fits our evidence perfectly: one degree of unsaturation for the C=O in the carboxylic acid and a second degree of unsaturation for the C=C of the alkene.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data, the unknown compound must be an alkenoic acid. The only chemical formula that accommodates both a carboxylic acid group (two oxygens) and a carbon-carbon double bond is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
