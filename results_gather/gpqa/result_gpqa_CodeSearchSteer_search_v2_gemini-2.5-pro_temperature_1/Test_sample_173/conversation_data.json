    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Define Initial and Final State Parameters\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus of mass M at rest.\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy, E = Mc² = 300 GeV.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   Two fragments with rest-masses m₁ and m₂.\n    *   The more massive fragment is m₁. We are given m₁ = 2m₂.\n    *   The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\n\nWe can find the rest-mass energies of the fragments (m₁c² and m₂c²) using the given information:\n\n1.  The total rest-mass energy of the fragments is:\n    (m₁ + m₂)c² = 0.99 * (Mc²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.\n\n2.  We have a system of two equations:\n    *   m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV\n    *   m₁c² = 2 * (m₂c²)\n\n3.  Substitute the second equation into the first:\n    2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV\n    3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV\n    **m₂c² = 99 GeV**\n\n4.  Now find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n    **m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV**\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy:\n\nQ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)\nQ = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments:\nQ = T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV\n\n### 4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p² / (2m), where p is the momentum. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (p₁ = p₂ = p).\n\n*   T₁_classical = p² / (2m₁)\n*   T₂_classical = p² / (2m₂)\n\nThe ratio of their kinetic energies is:\nT₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = m₂ / (2m₂) = 1/2\nSo, T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical.\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy:\nT₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV\nT₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV\n3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV\n**T₁_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV**\n\n### 5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁ Value\n\nFor the relativistic case, the relationship between kinetic energy (T), momentum (p), and rest-mass energy (mc²) is given by (pc)² = T(T + 2mc²).\n\nAgain, from conservation of momentum, p₁ = p₂, which means (p₁c)² = (p₂c)².\n\n*   (p₁c)² = T₁(T₁ + 2m₁c²)\n*   (p₂c)² = T₂(T₂ + 2m₂c²)\n\nSetting them equal:\nT₁(T₁ + 2m₁c²) = T₂(T₂ + 2m₂c²)\n\nWe know:\n*   m₁c² = 198 GeV\n*   m₂c² = 99 GeV\n*   T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁\n\nSubstitute these values into the equation:\nT₁(T₁ + 2 * 198) = (3 - T₁)((3 - T₁) + 2 * 99)\nT₁(T₁ + 396) = (3 - T₁)(3 - T₁ + 198)\nT₁(T₁ + 396) = (3 - T₁)(201 - T₁)\nT₁² + 396T₁ = 603 - 201T₁ - 3T₁ + T₁²\nT₁² + 396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁ + T₁²\n\nCancel T₁² from both sides:\n396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁\n396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603\n600T₁ = 603\n**T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV**\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n\nDifference = T₁ - T₁_classical\nDifference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV\n\n<<<C>>>"
