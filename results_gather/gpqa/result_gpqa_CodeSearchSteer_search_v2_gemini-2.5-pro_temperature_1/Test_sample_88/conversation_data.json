    "The problem asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded, non-exchangeable proton in the final product of a three-step reaction sequence. To solve this, we must identify the structure of each product.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with a strong base (KOH) at a high temperature (240°C). These harsh conditions suggest a rearrangement reaction, as standard elimination or substitution reactions are difficult at the bridgehead positions of the rigid adamantane cage. A known reaction under these or similar conditions is the rearrangement of the adamantane skeleton to the more strained protoadamantane skeleton. The spectral data (IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a ketone) indicates that Product 1 is **4-protoadamantanone** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]decan-4-one). While the provided ¹H NMR data is atypical for published spectra of this compound, the identity of the final product's NMR pattern is the goal, and this ketone is the most plausible intermediate.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 (4-protoadamantanone) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide. This reagent is used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts ketones to alcohols. The aluminum isopropoxide also acts as a Lewis acid, which can catalyze the dehydration of the resulting alcohol at high temperatures. Therefore, this step involves the reduction of the ketone to an alcohol (4-protoadamantanol), followed by dehydration to form an alkene. The likely product of this sequence is **4-protoadamantene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene). The formation of an alkene is necessary for the subsequent ozonolysis step.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 (4-protoadamantene) is subjected to ozonolysis (O₃ followed by DMS). Ozonolysis is a reaction that cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. The reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide (DMS) ensures that the products are aldehydes or ketones. The ozonolysis of the double bond in 4-protoadamantene cleaves the ring system to yield **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde**.\n\n**Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nWe need to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde, excluding the aldehyde protons themselves.\n\n1.  **Most Deshielded Protons:** The aldehyde (-CHO) groups are strongly electron-withdrawing. The protons on the carbons to which these groups are attached (H3 and H7) will be the most deshielded protons on the carbon framework. Due to the molecule's symmetry, H3 and H7 are chemically equivalent.\n2.  **Neighboring Protons:** We need to analyze the couplings for H3. The carbon C3 is bonded to two methylene groups, C2 and C4. Therefore, the proton H3 is coupled to four neighboring protons: two on C2 and two on C4.\n3.  **Conformation and Coupling Constants:** The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system exists in a rigid double-chair conformation. To minimize steric hindrance, the bulky aldehyde groups will occupy the equatorial positions. This places the H3 proton in an axial position.\n4.  **Coupling Pattern:** An axial proton (H3) will have two distinct types of couplings to its four neighbors:\n    *   It will couple with the two other axial protons (one on C2 and one on C4) with a large axial-axial coupling constant (J_ax-ax ≈ 8-13 Hz).\n    *   It will couple with the two equatorial protons (one on C2 and one on C4) with a smaller axial-equatorial coupling constant (J_ax-eq ≈ 3-4 Hz).\n\nA proton that is coupled to two equivalent protons with one coupling constant (J_A) and to another two equivalent protons with a different coupling constant (J_B) will exhibit a **triplet of triplets** pattern. The two large couplings split the signal into a triplet, and each line of that triplet is further split into another triplet by the two small couplings.\n\n<<<C>>>"
