    "### Analysis of the Potential\n\nThe provided potential for a quantum mechanical particle of mass `m` is given in two-dimensional polar coordinates (r, θ):\n\n`V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)`\n\nTo solve the Schrödinger equation, it is often beneficial to express the potential in Cartesian coordinates (x, y). The transformation from polar to Cartesian coordinates is defined as:\n\n*   `x = r cos(θ)`\n*   `y = r sin(θ)`\n*   `r^2 = x^2 + y^2`\n\nFrom these relations, we can express `cos^2(θ)` as `x^2 / r^2`. Substituting these into the potential equation:\n\n`V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k(x^2 + y^2) * [x^2 / (x^2 + y^2)]`\n`V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 kx^2`\n`V(x, y) = 1/2 kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2 + 3/2 kx^2`\n`V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2`\n\n### The Anisotropic Harmonic Oscillator\n\nThe resulting potential `V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2` is that of a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The potential is separable, meaning it can be written as a sum of potentials for each independent coordinate: `V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)`.\n\nThe standard form for a harmonic oscillator potential in one dimension is `1/2 mω^2 x^2`. We can identify the individual potentials and their corresponding angular frequencies:\n\n1.  **For the x-direction:**\n    *   `V_x(x) = 2kx^2 = 1/2 (4k)x^2`\n    *   The effective spring constant is `k_x = 4k`.\n    *   The angular frequency is `ω_x = sqrt(k_x / m) = sqrt(4k / m) = 2 * sqrt(k / m)`.\n\n2.  **For the y-direction:**\n    *   `V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2`\n    *   The effective spring constant is `k_y = k`.\n    *   The angular frequency is `ω_y = sqrt(k_y / m) = sqrt(k / m)`.\n\n### Energy Spectrum Calculation\n\nSince the potential is separable, the total energy `E` of the system is the sum of the energy eigenvalues for the two independent one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillators. The energy of a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator is given by `E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω`.\n\n*   The energy for the motion in the x-direction is:\n    `E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k / m) = (2n_x + 1)ħ * sqrt(k / m)`\n\n*   The energy for the motion in the y-direction is:\n    `E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k / m)`\n\nThe total energy `E` is the sum `E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}`:\n\n`E = (2n_x + 1)ħ * sqrt(k / m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k / m)`\n`E = [ (2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2) ] ħ * sqrt(k / m)`\n`E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ħ * sqrt(k / m)`\n\nThis result matches the general formula for the energy levels of a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator, E = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x + (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y.\n\nComparing this derived energy spectrum with the given options, it corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
