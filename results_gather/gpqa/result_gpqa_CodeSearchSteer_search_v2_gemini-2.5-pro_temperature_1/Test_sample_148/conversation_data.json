    "Here is a breakdown of the observations and an analysis of the options provided:\n\n### Analysis of Experimental Observations:\n1.  **Â¹H NMR Spectrum:** The crude product shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and their combined integral is correct (1H). Spin-spin coupling has been ruled out. This strongly suggests the presence of two similar but non-identical chemical environments for that proton.\n2.  **LC-MS Analysis:** The liquid chromatography (LC) separates the crude material into two distinct peaks of equal intensity. The mass spectrometry (MS) shows that both peaks have the same mass, and this mass corresponds to the expected product.\n\n### Evaluation of the Options:\n\n*   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would mean an extra amino acid was added to the peptide. The resulting molecule would have a significantly different (higher) mass. This is inconsistent with the LC-MS data, which shows both peaks have the mass of the *expected* molecule.\n*   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor from the synthesis would be a chemically different molecule and would almost certainly have a different mass. This is also inconsistent with the LC-MS data showing both peaks have the same, correct mass for the product.\n*   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties.\n    *   **NMR:** In a standard NMR experiment (using an achiral solvent), enantiomers are indistinguishable and would produce a single set of peaks, not two.\n    *   **LC-MS:** Standard LC columns are achiral and cannot separate enantiomers; they would elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, this explanation is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n    *   **Formation:** In peptide synthesis, this can commonly occur through the epimerization (inversion of a stereocenter) of one of the amino acids, which is a known side reaction. It can also occur due to restricted rotation around an amide bond (often involving proline), creating stable *cis* and *trans* isomers, which are also diastereomers.\n    *   **NMR:** Because diastereomers have different three-dimensional structures, their corresponding protons exist in different chemical environments and are expected to have different chemical shifts. It is very common for a mixture of diastereomers to show two distinct sets of peaks, or \"doubled\" peaks for certain protons, like the alpha-proton.\n    *   **LC-MS:** Due to their different physical properties, diastereomers can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. Finding two separate peaks is expected. Because they are isomers, they have the same chemical formula and thus the same mass, which is consistent with the MS data showing both peaks have the expected mass.\n\n**Conclusion:** The presence of two separable LC peaks with the same mass, combined with two distinct NMR signals for a single proton, is classic evidence for a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<D>>>"
