    "The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) of a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nThe potentials are calculated at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$, but they depend on the state of the charge at an earlier time, known as the retarded time, $t_r$. The retarded time is the time at which the electromagnetic signal must have been emitted from the charge's position to reach the observer at position $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$. The signal travels at the speed of light, $c$.\n\nLet the trajectory of the charge be $\\vec{s}(t)$. The position of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\nThe vector from the retarded position of the charge to the observation point is $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\nThe magnitude of this vector is $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\nThe relationship between the observation time and the retarded time is given by $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\nThe velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}|_{t=t_r}$.\n\nThe Liénard-Wiechert potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and are given by:\n\nScalar Potential:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nVector Potential:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nThe presence of the term $(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})$ in the denominator accounts for the relativistic effects of the moving source. Specifically, it accounts for the fact that the volume of the charge distribution appears compressed or expanded to the observer due to the charge's motion.\n\nIt is also a known property that the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is related to the scalar potential $V$ for a moving point charge by the following relation:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r}, t)$\nUsing the relationship $\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 = 1/c^2$, we can verify this from the expressions above:\n$\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\vec{v} \\left( \\frac{qc}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$\n\nNow, let's compare these correct expressions with the given options:\nA) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$: This expression is for a quasi-static case and does not correctly account for the retardation effect in the denominator.\nB) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$: This has an incorrect positive sign in the denominator.\nC) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$: This is incorrect for multiple reasons, including the use of `r` instead of the retarded distance and an incorrect form for the vector potential.\nD) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$: These expressions match the standard Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nTherefore, option D provides the correct formulas for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n<<<D>>>"
