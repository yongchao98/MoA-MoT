    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the threshold energy for a high-energy gamma-ray (Î³) to produce an electron-positron pair ($e^{+}e^{-}$) when colliding with a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon.\n\n### 1. The Physical Process\n\nThe reaction in question is pair production, where two photons annihilate to create an electron and a positron:\n$$ \\gamma_{HE} + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{-} + e^{+} $$\nHere, $\\gamma_{HE}$ is the high-energy gamma-ray and $\\gamma_{CMB}$ is a low-energy photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background.\n\n### 2. Principle of Calculation\n\nTo find the minimum or \"threshold\" energy for this reaction to occur, we use the principles of special relativity, specifically the conservation of four-momentum. The key insight is to analyze the collision in the center-of-mass frame and relate it to the laboratory frame (our frame of reference).\n\nThe total four-momentum squared is a Lorentz invariant, meaning it is the same in all inertial frames of reference. We can equate this value before the collision and at the threshold of the collision.\n\n*   **Before Collision:** We have a high-energy photon with energy $E_{\\gamma}$ and a CMB photon with energy $\\epsilon_{\\gamma}$.\n*   **At Threshold:** The minimum energy required is just enough to create the electron and positron, which appear at rest in the center-of-mass frame.\n\n### 3. Derivation\n\nLet the four-momenta be:\n*   High-energy photon: $P_{\\gamma 1} = (E_{\\gamma}, \\vec{p_1})$\n*   CMB photon: $P_{\\gamma 2} = (\\epsilon_{\\gamma}, \\vec{p_2})$\n*   Electron: $P_{e^{-}}$\n*   Positron: $P_{e^{+}}$\n\nThe conservation of four-momentum states:\n$P_{\\gamma 1} + P_{\\gamma 2} = P_{e^{-}} + P_{e^{+}}$\n\nSquaring both sides gives the invariant mass squared:\n$(P_{\\gamma 1} + P_{\\gamma 2})^2 = (P_{e^{-}} + P_{e^{+}})^2$\n\n**Left side (Initial State):**\n$P_{\\gamma 1}^2 + P_{\\gamma 2}^2 + 2 P_{\\gamma 1} \\cdot P_{\\gamma 2} = (P_{e^{-}} + P_{e^{+}})^2$\n\nFor any photon, its rest mass is zero, so $P^2 = m^2c^4 = 0$. Thus, $P_{\\gamma 1}^2 = 0$ and $P_{\\gamma 2}^2 = 0$. The equation simplifies to:\n$2 P_{\\gamma 1} \\cdot P_{\\gamma 2} = (P_{e^{-}} + P_{e^{+}})^2$\n\nThe dot product of the four-momenta is $P_{\\gamma 1} \\cdot P_{\\gamma 2} = E_{\\gamma}\\epsilon_{\\gamma} - \\vec{p_1} \\cdot \\vec{p_2}$. For photons, momentum magnitude is $p = E/c$. So, this becomes $E_{\\gamma}\\epsilon_{\\gamma} - (E_{\\gamma}/c)(\\epsilon_{\\gamma}/c) \\cos\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the two incoming photons. In natural units where c=1, this is $E_{\\gamma}\\epsilon_{\\gamma}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n**Right side (Final State):**\nAt the threshold energy, the electron and positron are created with the minimum possible energy, which means they are at rest in the center-of-mass frame. The total energy in this frame is the sum of their rest mass energies, $m_e c^2 + m_e c^2 = 2 m_e c^2$. The invariant mass squared of the final system is therefore $(2 m_e c^2)^2$.\n\n**Equating Both Sides:**\n$2 E_{\\gamma} \\epsilon_{\\gamma} (1 - \\cos\\theta) = (2 m_e c^2)^2$\n\nTo find the minimum energy $E_{\\gamma}$ for the reaction to occur, we need to consider the most favorable collision geometry. The threshold energy is lowest when the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ is maximized. This happens in a head-on collision, where the photons travel towards each other ($\\theta = 180^\\circ$ or $\\pi$ radians), making $\\cos\\theta = -1$. In this case, $(1 - \\cos\\theta) = 2$.\n\nSubstituting this into our equation:\n$2 E_{\\gamma} \\epsilon_{\\gamma} (2) = (2 m_e c^2)^2$\n$4 E_{\\gamma} \\epsilon_{\\gamma} = 4 (m_e c^2)^2$\n$E_{\\gamma} \\epsilon_{\\gamma} = (m_e c^2)^2$\n\nNow, we can solve for the threshold energy of the high-energy photon, $E_{\\gamma}$:\n$$ E_{\\gamma_{thresh}} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{\\epsilon_{\\gamma}} $$\n\n### 4. Calculation\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   Average energy of a CMB photon, $\\epsilon_{\\gamma} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n*   The rest mass energy of an electron, $m_e c^2$, is approximately $0.511 \\text{ MeV}$. This is equal to $0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n$$ E_{\\gamma_{thresh}} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} $$\n$$ E_{\\gamma_{thresh}} = \\frac{0.2611 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} $$\n$$ E_{\\gamma_{thresh}} = 0.2611 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV} $$\n$$ E_{\\gamma_{thresh}} = 2.611 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV} $$\n\nThe question asks for the answer in Giga-electron-volts (GeV), where $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$.\n$$ E_{\\gamma_{thresh}} = \\frac{2.611 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} $$\n$$ E_{\\gamma_{thresh}} = 2.611 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV} $$\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated threshold energy is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$. This means that gamma-rays with energies at or above this level will have their mean free path (and thus their lifetime in the universe) severely limited by pair production interactions with the ubiquitous CMB photons. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) 3.9 * 1e5 GeV\nB) 9.5 * 1e4 GeV\nC) 1.8 * 1e5 GeV\nD) 2.6 * 1e5 GeV\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
