    "To determine the maximum orbital period of the second planet, we must first establish the geometric conditions required for both a transit (the planet passing in front of its star) and an occultation (the planet passing behind its star).\n\n### Key Principles\n\n*   **Transit and Occultation Condition:** For a planet in a circular orbit to exhibit both a transit and an occultation, its orbit must be aligned such that it passes across the star's disk as seen by the observer. This alignment is quantified by the impact parameter, `b`, which is the projected distance between the center of the planet and the center of the star at mid-transit, measured in units of the star's radius. For a transit and occultation to occur, the impact parameter `b` must be less than or equal to 1 (`b <= 1`).\n*   **Impact Parameter Formula:** The impact parameter is related to the orbit's semi-major axis (`a`) and inclination (`i`) by the formula: `b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s`, where `R_s` is the stellar radius.\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** For planets orbiting the same star, the square of their orbital periods (`P`) is proportional to the cube of their semi-major axes (`a`). This can be expressed as a ratio: `(P2 / P1)² = (a2 / a1)³`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n1.  **Analyze Planet 1:** We are given the following for the first planet:\n    *   Orbital Period (P1) = 3 days\n    *   Impact Parameter (b1) = 0.2\n\n    Using the impact parameter formula for Planet 1:\n    `b1 = (a1 * cos(i)) / R_s = 0.2`\n\n2.  **Set the Condition for Planet 2:** For the second planet to exhibit both transit and occultation, its impact parameter (`b2`) must be at its maximum allowable value, which is 1.\n    *   Impact Parameter (b2) = 1\n\n    Using the impact parameter formula for Planet 2:\n    `b2 = (a2 * cos(i)) / R_s = 1`\n\n    Since both planets share the same orbital plane, the inclination `i` is the same for both. The stellar radius `R_s` is also a constant for the system.\n\n3.  **Relate the Orbits:** We can now set up a ratio of the two impact parameter equations to find the relationship between their semi-major axes (`a1` and `a2`):\n\n    `(a2 * cos(i) / R_s) / (a1 * cos(i) / R_s) = b2 / b1`\n\n    The terms `cos(i)` and `R_s` cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n\n    `a2 / a1 = b2 / b1`\n\n    Substituting the known values for `b1` and `b2`:\n\n    `a2 / a1 = 1 / 0.2 = 5`\n\n    This means the semi-major axis of the second planet can be at most 5 times that of the first planet.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Maximum Period of Planet 2:** Now we use Kepler's Third Law to relate the orbital periods to the semi-major axes.\n\n    `(P2 / P1)² = (a2 / a1)³`\n\n    We can solve for the maximum period of Planet 2 (P2) by substituting the known values:\n\n    `(P2 / 3 days)² = (5)³`\n    `P2² / 9 = 125`\n    `P2² = 125 * 9 = 1125`\n    `P2 = √1125`\n\n    To simplify the square root: `√1125 = √(225 * 5) = 15 * √5`.\n\n    Using the approximation `√5 ≈ 2.236`:\n\n    `P2 ≈ 15 * 2.236 ≈ 33.54` days.\n\nThe maximum orbital period for the second planet is approximately 33.5 days. The radii of the planets and the star are not needed for this calculation, as the relationship depends on the impact parameters and Kepler's Third Law.\n\n<<<B>>>"
