    "The reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed ammonia is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate. The strong base, amide (NH2-), initiates the reaction by abstracting a proton.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the possible reaction pathways and products:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has two hydrogen isotopes on the carbons adjacent (ortho) to the bromine atom: a deuterium (D) at the C2 position and a hydrogen (H) at the C6 position. The amide base can abstract either of these, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H+ from C6:** The amide ion removes the proton from the C6 position. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains in the molecule. This intermediate is called **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D+ from C2:** The amide ion removes the deuteron from the C2 position. Subsequently, the bromide ion is eliminated from C1, creating a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium is removed from the aromatic ring, resulting in a non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nIn the second stage of the reaction, the nucleophilic amide ion (NH2-) attacks the newly formed triple bond of the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3) to yield the final products.\n\n*   **Products from 3-Deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):** The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6).\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The amino group (-NH2) attaches to C1, and subsequent protonation at C6 yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The amino group attaches to C6. Protonation at C1 gives **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from Benzyne (from Pathway B):** The nucleophile attacks the symmetrical, non-deuterated benzyne intermediate.\n    3.  Attack at either C1 or C2 of the triple bond, followed by protonation, results in the formation of **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\nTherefore, the reaction yields a mixture of three distinct organic products.\n\nThe three possible organic products are:\n1.  2-Deuteroaniline\n2.  3-Deuteroaniline\n3.  Aniline\n\nThus, there are a total of **3** possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
