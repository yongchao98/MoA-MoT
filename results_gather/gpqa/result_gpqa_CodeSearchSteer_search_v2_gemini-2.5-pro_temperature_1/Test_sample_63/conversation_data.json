    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the chemistry problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the mass changes in the tubes to identify the gaseous products.**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass of H₂O produced = 3.60 g.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase is due to the oxygen.\n    *   Mass of O₂ produced = 0.80 g.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n**2. Identify the final remaining gas C.**\n\n*   Volume of gas C = 2.24 liters at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n*   Moles of gas C = Volume / Molar volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n*   The total initial mass of the salts was 7.20 g. By the law of conservation of mass, this must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n    *   Total Mass = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(C)\n    *   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(C)\n    *   Mass(C) = 7.20 - 3.60 - 0.80 = 2.80 g.\n*   Now, we can find the molar mass of gas C:\n    *   Molar Mass(C) = Mass(C) / Moles(C) = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28 g/mol.\n*   A gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol that is inert under these conditions is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**3. Determine the empirical formula of the combined salts.**\n\nThe decomposition produced 0.2 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.1 mol N₂. Let's find the total moles of each element present in the original mixture:\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** 0.2 mol H₂O × 2 H/H₂O = 0.4 mol H.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** 0.1 mol N₂ × 2 N/N₂ = 0.2 mol N.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** (0.2 mol H₂O × 1 O/H₂O) + (0.025 mol O₂ × 2 O/O₂) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n\nThe molar ratio of the elements in the initial mixture is N : H : O = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply all values by 20:\n*   N: 0.2 × 20 = 4\n*   H: 0.4 × 20 = 8\n*   O: 0.25 × 20 = 5\n\nSo, the combined empirical formula for (Salt A + Salt B) is N₄H₈O₅.\n\n**4. Identify Salts A and B.**\n\nThe problem states that A and B are salts in an equimolar mixture. We need to split the combined formula N₄H₈O₅ into two plausible salt formulas.\n*   The presence of 8 hydrogen atoms strongly suggests two ammonium cations (NH₄⁺), which would account for 2 N and 8 H atoms.\n*   The remaining atoms are N₂O₅ (N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈). These must form the two anions for the salts.\n*   To balance the charge of the two NH₄⁺ cations (2 x +1 = +2), the two anions must have a total charge of -2.\n*   The most common nitrogen-oxygen anions are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n*   Combining one nitrate and one nitrite gives (NO₃⁻ + NO₂⁻) = N₂O₅²⁻. This perfectly matches the remaining atoms (2 N, 5 O) and the required total charge (-2).\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃\n\n**5. Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nNow, we find the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each:\n*   Total Atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<A>>>"
