    "The user's question can be broken down by analyzing the products of each reaction and then determining how they will behave in two different types of liquid chromatography.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone with a single stereocenter at the C5 position in the S configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone at C3 using Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a powerful reducing agent. This reaction creates a new stereocenter at the C3 position.\n*   **Products:** The hydride can attack the planar carbonyl group from either face, resulting in two possible configurations (R or S) at the new stereocenter (C3). Since the original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged (S configuration), the products are (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** These two products are diastereomers because they have two stereocenters, with one being the same (5S) and the other being different (3S vs. 3R).\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of both ketone groups (at C2 and C4) using excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4). This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** The reduction can lead to three different stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images and are therefore a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material is achiral, they are formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a **meso compound**, which is achiral. The (2S, 4R) isomer is identical to the (2R, 4S) isomer. The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers.\n\n### **Chromatographic Separation**\n\nThe products from both reactions are combined and analyzed.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their polarity. It is capable of separating diastereomers but cannot resolve enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis of Products:**\n    *   **From Reaction I:** The two products, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated into **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** The products consist of a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound. The enantiomeric pair will behave as a single substance on an achiral column and elute as **1 peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer to the enantiomers and will elute separately, giving a second peak. This results in a total of **2 peaks** from Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase):** The products from Reaction I (C7 compounds) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C5 compounds) and will have different retention times. Therefore, the total number of peaks will be the sum of the peaks from each reaction: 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP) to differentiate between enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can separate both enantiomers and diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis of Products:**\n    *   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomers will be separated, giving **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** The chiral column will separate the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) into **2 distinct peaks**. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated, yielding a third peak. This results in **3 peaks** from Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral):** Since the products of the two reactions are structurally distinct, they will all be resolved. The total number of peaks is the sum of all unique stereoisomers produced: 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram and **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>"
