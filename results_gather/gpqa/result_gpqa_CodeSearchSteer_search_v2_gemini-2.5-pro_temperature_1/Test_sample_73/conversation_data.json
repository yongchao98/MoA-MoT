    "Radioactive decay is a stochastic process that follows an exponential distribution. A key feature of this process is that it is \"memoryless.\" This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has not decayed for 50 minutes does not change its inherent decay probability.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation of the probability:\n\n**1. Determine the decay constant (λ):**\n\nThe probability `P` of a decay within a time `t` is given by the formula: `P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\nWe are given that the probability of decay is 32% (or 0.32) in 100 minutes. We can use this to find the decay constant `λ`.\n\n*   `0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)`\n*   `e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32`\n*   `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`\n*   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: `-100λ = ln(0.68)`\n*   `λ = -ln(0.68) / 100`\n*   `λ ≈ -(-0.3857) / 100 ≈ 0.003857` per minute.\n\n**2. Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes:**\n\nDue to the memoryless property, the 50 minutes that have already passed are irrelevant to the future probability. We need to calculate the probability of the atom decaying in the *next* 150-minute interval.\n\n*   `P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for `λ` we found in the first step:\n\n*   `P(150) = 1 - e^([-ln(0.68) / 100] * 150)`\n*   `P(150) = 1 - e^(ln(0.68) * 1.5)`\n*   `P(150) = 1 - (e^ln(0.68))^1.5`\n*   `P(150) = 1 - 0.68^1.5`\n\n**3. Final Calculation:**\n\n*   `0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n*   `P(150) = 1 - 0.5607`\n*   `P(150) ≈ 0.4393`\n\nConverting this probability to a percentage gives approximately 43.93%, which rounds to 44%.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
