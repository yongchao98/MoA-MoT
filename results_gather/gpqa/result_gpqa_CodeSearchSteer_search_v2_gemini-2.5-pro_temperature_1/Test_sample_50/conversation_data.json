    "The problem of calculating the potential energy of a point charge near a grounded conducting sphere is a classic electrostatics problem solved using the method of images.\n\n### 1. The Method of Images\n\nTo solve this problem, the grounded conducting sphere is conceptually replaced by an \"image charge\" inside the sphere. This image charge, along with the original point charge `q`, must create a potential of zero on the surface of the sphere (at radius R), mimicking the condition of the grounded sphere.\n\nThe properties of the image charge `q'` are determined as follows:\n*   **Magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Position:** The image charge is located at a distance `b = R^2 / d` from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the center to the charge `q`.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance away to its final position at distance `d` from the sphere's center. As the charge `q` is brought closer, it moves within the potential created by the charges induced on the sphere's surface. The potential from these induced charges is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\nThe potential energy `U` of a charge `q` in the presence of a conductor (like the grounded sphere) is given by:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nwhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` caused by the induced charges on the sphere. The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the induced charge distribution is itself established as `q` is moved into position.\n\nThe potential `V_induced` at distance `d` is the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same point. The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n\n`V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\nSubstituting the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n\n`V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [d - (R^2/d)]`\n`V_induced = k * [-qR/d] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n`V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, we can calculate the potential energy `U`:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\n*   A) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n*   B) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n*   C) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n*   D) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
