    "To determine the correct option, let's analyze each reaction step-by-step.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants**: Dimethyl malonate serves as the Michael donor after being deprotonated by sodium ethoxide (NaOEt). Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is the Michael acceptor.\n*   **Mechanism**: The ethoxide ion removes an acidic α-proton from dimethyl malonate to form a stable enolate. This enolate then attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated ester. A subsequent protonation (from the ethanol solvent) yields the final product.\n*   **Product (A)**: The new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate (the carbon attached to the p-tolyl group). The resulting structure is (CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂COOCH₃. This compound is named trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants**: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine, which acts as the nucleophilic Michael donor. (E)-but-2-enenitrile is the Michael acceptor. This is an example of a Stork enamine synthesis.\n*   **Mechanism**: The enamine, a nitrogen analog of an enolate, attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile. This is followed by hydrolysis with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) which converts the intermediate iminium salt back into a ketone.\n*   **Product (B)**: The α-carbon of the original cyclohexanone attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. This results in a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the C-2 position with a CH(CH₃)CH₂CN group. The final product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants**: Here, we must identify reactant C. The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, and the other reactant is but-3-en-2-one (an α,β-unsaturated ketone).\n*   **Mechanism (Retrosynthetic Analysis)**: The product is formed via a Michael addition. The bond formed connects the Michael donor (C) to the Michael acceptor (but-3-en-2-one). The added group is the 3-oxobutyl group (-CH₂CH₂COCH₃), which comes from but-3-en-2-one. Therefore, reactant C must be the nucleophile that attacks it. The most acidic proton in the precursor is at the C-2 position of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione, as it is located between two carbonyl groups.\n*   **Reactant (C)**: The base (KOH) deprotonates cyclohexane-1,3-dione at the C-2 position to form a highly stabilized enolate, which then acts as the Michael donor. Thus, reactant C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis of the three reactions:\n*   Product A is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n*   Product B is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n*   Reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\nThis combination of reactants and products matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
