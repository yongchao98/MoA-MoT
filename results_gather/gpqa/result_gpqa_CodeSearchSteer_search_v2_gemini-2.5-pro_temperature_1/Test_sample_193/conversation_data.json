    "To find the partition function Z for the system of three spins (S1, S2, S3), where each spin can be +1 or -1, we must sum the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all possible 2^3 = 8 configurations. The energy E is given by the equation E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\n\nFirst, we identify the possible energy states by calculating the energy for each of the 8 spin configurations:\n\n1.  **All spins are the same:**\n    *   (+1, +1, +1): E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    *   (-1, -1, -1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    *   There are 2 configurations with an energy of -3J.\n\n2.  **Two spins are the same, and one is different:**\n    *   (+1, +1, -1): E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = J\n    *   (+1, -1, +1): E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = J\n    *   (-1, +1, +1): E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = J\n    *   (+1, -1, -1): E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = J\n    *   (-1, +1, -1): E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = J\n    *   (-1, -1, +1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = J\n    *   There are 6 configurations with an energy of J.\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum of e^(-βE) for all microstates. We can group the terms by their energy levels.\n\n*   For the energy level E = -3J, there are 2 states (degeneracy = 2). The contribution to Z is 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) = 2e^(3Jβ).\n*   For the energy level E = J, there are 6 states (degeneracy = 6). The contribution to Z is 6 * e^(-β(J)) = 6e^(-Jβ).\n\nSumming these contributions gives the total partition function:\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
