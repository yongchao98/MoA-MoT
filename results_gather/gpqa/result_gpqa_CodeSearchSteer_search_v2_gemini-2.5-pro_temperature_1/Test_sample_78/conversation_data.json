    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify Compound X:\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Reaction Product from NMR Data\n\nFirst, we must deduce the structure of the product formed in the reaction from the provided ¹H-NMR and ¹³C-NMR data. The molecular formula of the starting material, and thus the product (as this is an isomerization reaction), is C₁₁H₁₂O.\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula C₁₁H₁₂O corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of 6. A benzene ring accounts for 4, leaving 2 degrees of unsaturation, which could be two double bonds, one triple bond, or two rings.\n\n*   **¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   A signal at **δ 197.7 ppm** is highly characteristic of a **carbonyl carbon (C=O)**, specifically in a ketone or aldehyde. This accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Signals in the **δ 126-145 ppm** range are typical for aromatic and vinylic (C=C) carbons.\n    *   The presence of a carbonyl group and a benzene ring accounts for 5 of the 6 degrees of unsaturation. Therefore, there must be one additional **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The signals at **δ 7.08 (2H, d)** and **δ 7.71 (2H, d)** strongly suggest a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   The singlet at **δ 2.31 (3H, s)** is consistent with a methyl group attached to this benzene ring, forming a *p*-tolyl group.\n    *   The singlet at **δ 2.28 (3H, s)** indicates another methyl group, likely adjacent to the carbonyl group (an acetyl methyl group).\n    *   The two doublets at **δ 6.75 (1H, d)** and **δ 7.68 (1H, d)** are characteristic of two protons on a carbon-carbon double bond that are coupled to each other.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    Based on the fragments identified (a *p*-tolyl group, a C=C double bond, and a methyl ketone), the only logical structure is **(E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**. The \"E\" configuration (trans) is suggested by the large coupling constant expected for the two vinyl protons. This structure is consistent with all the NMR data. Its chemical formula is C₁₁H₁₂O, and it has 6 degrees of unsaturation (1 benzene ring, 1 C=C bond, 1 C=O bond).\n\n### 2. Identifying Compound X through Reaction Analysis\n\nThe reaction involves heating Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O) with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), a non-nucleophilic base, in a nonpolar solvent. This points to a base-catalyzed rearrangement. The product is an α,β-unsaturated ketone. This product is commonly formed from the rearrangement of a vinyloxirane (an epoxide adjacent to a double bond). This type of reaction is known as the Meinwald rearrangement. Specifically, DABCO is known to mediate the chemospecific rearrangement of terminal epoxides into methyl ketones.\n\nWe must now evaluate which of the proposed starting materials (Compound X) would rearrange to form (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n*   **A) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** This has a phenyl group, not a *p*-tolyl group. Its rearrangement would not yield the correct product.\n*   **B) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The structure is `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`. This compound is a terminal vinyloxirane. A base-catalyzed rearrangement would plausibly shift a proton and open the epoxide ring to form an enol (`p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(OH)=CH₂`), which would then tautomerize to the stable methyl ketone product, (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. This exactly matches the product identified from the NMR spectra.\n*   **C) 2-styrylepoxide:** The molecular formula (C₁₀H₁₀O) does not match the given C₁₁H₁₂O.\n*   **D) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** This compound has a phenyl group, not a *p*-tolyl group, and its vinylic system is substituted differently. Rearrangement would lead to a product whose structure is inconsistent with the NMR data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe product of the reaction is unambiguously identified as (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one from the NMR data. The reaction conditions are characteristic of a Meinwald rearrangement of a vinyloxirane. Of the choices provided, only **2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane** has the correct molecular formula and carbon skeleton to yield the observed product upon rearrangement.\n\n<<<B>>>"
