    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understand the Chemical Reaction\n\nTo dissolve solid iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, in a strong monobasic acid (like HCl or HNO₃), the following neutralization reaction occurs:\n\n**Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)**\n\nThis equation shows that 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of hydrogen ions (H⁺) for a complete stoichiometric reaction.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n\nFirst, we need the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Atomic mass of Iron (Fe) ≈ 55.85 g/mol\n*   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.00 g/mol\n*   Atomic mass of Hydrogen (H) ≈ 1.01 g/mol\n\nMolar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.85 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol.\n\nNext, we calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ in the 0.1 g sample:\n\nMoles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ **0.0009356 mol**\n\n### 3. Determine the Total Acid Required\n\nThe total amount of acid needed serves two purposes:\n1.  **Stoichiometric Amount**: To react with and neutralize the Fe(OH)₃.\n2.  **Excess Amount**: To remain in the solution and establish the final acidic pH.\n\n**Total Moles of H⁺ = Moles of H⁺ (reacted) + Moles of H⁺ (excess)**\n\n### 4. Set up an Equation to Test the Options\n\nLet's create a general formula to check which of the provided options is self-consistent.\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ (reacted)** = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 * 0.0009356 mol = **0.0028068 mol**\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ (excess)** = Final H⁺ Concentration * Total Volume\n    *   Final H⁺ Concentration = 10⁻ᵖᴴ\n    *   Total Volume = 100 cm³ = 0.1 L\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (excess) = 10⁻ᵖᴴ * 0.1\n\n*   **Total Moles of H⁺ Added** = Volume of Acid (in L) * Concentration of Acid\n    *   Volume of Acid = V (in cm³) / 1000\n    *   Concentration of Acid = 0.1 M\n    *   Total Moles of H⁺ Added = (V / 1000) * 0.1\n\nCombining these, we get:\n(V / 1000) * 0.1 = 0.0028068 + (10⁻ᵖᴴ * 0.1)\n\nTo make it easier to plug in the values, let's solve for V (in cm³):\nV / 10 = 0.28068 + 10⁻ᵖᴴ * 10\n**V (cm³) = 2.8068 + 1000 * 10⁻ᵖᴴ**  --This formula seems incorrect, let me re-derive.\n\n(V / 1000) * 0.1 = 0.0028068 + (10⁻ᵖᴴ * 0.1)\nDivide by 0.1:\nV / 1000 = 0.028068 + 10⁻ᵖᴴ\nMultiply by 1000:\n**V (cm³) = 28.068 + 1000 * 10⁻ᵖᴴ** -- The previous error was a typo, this is the correct formula.\n\n### 5. Test the Given Options\n\nNow, we can plug the pH from each option into this formula and see if the calculated volume matches the given volume.\n\n*   **A) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³**\n    V_calc = 28.068 + 1000 * 10⁻⁴.⁹⁴ = 28.068 + 0.011 = 28.079 cm³. (Does not match 20.40 cm³)\n\n*   **B) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n    V_calc = 28.068 + 1000 * 10⁻².⁶⁹ = 28.068 + 2.042 = **30.11 cm³**. (This is a very close match to 30.09 cm³)\n\n*   **C) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n    V_calc = 28.068 + 1000 * 10⁻³.¹⁶ = 28.068 + 0.692 = 28.76 cm³. (Does not match 32.14 cm³)\n\n*   **D) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n    V_calc = 28.068 + 1000 * 10⁻².⁰⁴ = 28.068 + 9.120 = 37.188 cm³. (Does not match 28.05 cm³)\n\nThe values in option B are consistent with the chemical principles. The minor difference between the calculated volume (30.11 cm³) and the given volume (30.09 cm³) is due to slight variations in the constants (like molar mass) used.\n\n<<<B>>>"
