    "An oscillating charge distribution, particularly one with a simple geometry like a spheroid oscillating along its symmetry axis, is typically modeled as an oscillating electric dipole, provided its size is much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation. The behavior of such a system in the radiation zone (far-field) is well-understood.\n\n**Angular Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) by an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis is given by the Larmor formula:\n\n`dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `C` is a factor that depends on the frequency and the dipole moment.\n*   `θ` is the polar angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).\n\nThe maximum power, `A`, is radiated when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. This occurs at `θ = 90°` (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis), where `sin²(90°) = 1`. Therefore, `A = C`.\n\nThe power radiated at any other angle `θ` is `(dP/dΩ) = A * sin²(θ)`. We are asked to find the fraction of the maximum power that is radiated at an angle of `θ = 30°`.\n\nFraction = `(A * sin²(30°)) / A = sin²(30°)`\n\nSince `sin(30°) = 1/2`, the fraction is:\n\nFraction = `(1/2)² = 1/4`\n\n**Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nThe power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency (`ω`) of oscillation. The relationship between angular frequency (`ω`), the speed of light (`c`), and wavelength (`λ`) is `ω = 2πc/λ`.\n\nTherefore, the radiated power has the following dependence on wavelength:\n\n`Power ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ ∝ λ⁻⁴`\n\nThis strong dependence on frequency is famous for explaining phenomena like Rayleigh scattering, which is why the sky appears blue (higher frequency, shorter wavelength light scatters more).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining these two results:\n*   The fraction of maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   The possible form of the function `f`, which describes the power, has a wavelength dependence of **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
