    "To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Titanium atoms in two different energy levels changes, we can use the Boltzmann equation. This equation describes the relative populations of atomic energy levels in a system that is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n### The Boltzmann Equation\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms (N) in a higher energy level (level 2) to a lower energy level (level 1) is given by:\n\n(N₂ / N₁) = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T)]\n\nwhere:\n*   `g₁` and `g₂` are the statistical weights of the two energy levels.\n*   `E₁` and `E₂` are the energies of the levels. The difference `ΔE = E₂ - E₁` is the energy of the transition.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K).\n*   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n### Calculating the Transition Energy (ΔE)\n\nThe energy of the transition (ΔE) can be calculated from the given wavelength (λ = 1448 Å) using the Planck-Einstein relation.\n\nΔE = h * c / λ\n\nwhere:\n*   `h` is the Planck constant.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n*   The product `h * c` is approximately 12400 eV·Å.\n\nΔE = 12400 eV·Å / 1448 Å ≈ 8.56 eV\n\n### Setting up the Ratio of Ratios\n\nWe need to find the factor by which the population ratio changes between the unspotted and spotted states of the star. Let's denote the temperatures as:\n\n*   T_nospots = 6000 K (surface without spots)\n*   T_spots = 5500 K (effective temperature with spots)\n\nThe ratio of populations without spots is:\nRatio_nospots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)]\n\nThe ratio of populations with spots is:\nRatio_spots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_spots)]\n\nWe want to find the factor `F = Ratio_nospots / Ratio_spots`.\n\nF = { (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)] } / { (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_spots)] }\n\nThe statistical weights (g₂ / g₁) cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n\nF = exp[ (-ΔE / k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) ]\n\n### Calculation\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the exponent:\n\n*   ΔE = 8.56 eV\n*   k = 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K\n*   T_nospots = 6000 K\n*   T_spots = 5500 K\n\nExponent = [-8.56 / (8.617 x 10⁻⁵)] * [1/6000 - 1/5500]\nExponent ≈ [-99338] * [(5500 - 6000) / (6000 * 5500)]\nExponent ≈ [-99338] * [-500 / 33,000,000]\nExponent ≈ [-99338] * [-1 / 66000]\nExponent ≈ 1.505\n\nNow, we can find the factor F:\n\nF = exp(1.505) ≈ 4.504\n\nThe calculation shows that the ratio of the number of atoms in level 2 to level 1 is approximately 4.5 times higher when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots. This result is consistent with the observation that the ratio decreases when the star has spots.\n\n<<<B>>>"
