    "To determine the proper starting materials, A and B, we must analyze the two reactions, paying close attention to the reagents and the stereochemistry of the products.\n\n### Analysis of the Starting Material and Products\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options provided are stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. Its structure contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an ester group (-COO-iBu). The chiral center is at the C3 carbon, which has an ethyl group attached.\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, a type of cyclic ester known as a lactone. The formation of this six-membered ring lactone occurs when a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid cyclizes. The chiral center at C3 of the starting material becomes the chiral center at C4 of the lactone product. Crucially, the reduction and subsequent lactonization steps do not alter the configuration (R or S) of this chiral center. Therefore, an (R)-starting material will yield an (R)-product, and an (S)-starting material will yield an (S)-product.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:** The product is the (R)-enantiomer. This directly implies that the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent. While it can reduce both esters and carboxylic acids, it is known to be more selective for the reduction of esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. In this reaction, LiBH₄ selectively reduces the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol. The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the cyclization (lactonization) of the resulting hydroxy acid to form the (R)-lactone.\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:** The product is the (S)-enantiomer. This indicates that the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent well-known for its high chemoselectivity. It selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters. In this case, BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group of the starting material to a primary alcohol. The resulting hydroxy-ester then undergoes acid-catalyzed intramolecular transesterification (lactonization) to yield the (S)-lactone.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the stereochemistry of the products and the known selectivity of the reducing agents:\n*   Starting material **A** must be the **(R)-enantiomer** to produce the (R)-lactone.\n*   Starting material **B** must be the **(S)-enantiomer** to produce the (S)-lactone.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is:\nA = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nB = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n<<<D>>>"
