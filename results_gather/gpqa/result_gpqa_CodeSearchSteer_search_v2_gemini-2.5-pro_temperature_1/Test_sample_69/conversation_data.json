    "Based on the provided chemical reaction clues, the identities of the substances are as follows:\n\n*   **A: Sulfur (S₈)**. A solid element.\n*   **B: Chlorine (Cl₂)**. A gas.\n*   **C: Sulfur dichloride (SCl₂)**. A bright, cherry-red liquid formed from the reaction of sulfur and chlorine. The overall reaction can be represented as S₈ + 8Cl₂ → 8SCl₂, fitting the \"8 equivalents\" clue.\n*   **D: Ethylene (C₂H₄)**. A gas.\n*   **E: Mustard gas (bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide, (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S)**. This is an extremely hazardous chemical warfare agent. It is produced from the reaction of sulfur dichloride (C) with two equivalents of ethylene (D): SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S.\n*   **F: Hydrochloric acid (HCl)**. A strong acid formed during the hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride.\n*   **G: Sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃)**. A weak acid. The hydrolysis of SCl₂ produces sulfur (A), HCl (F), and sulfur dioxide (SO₂), which forms sulfurous acid in water: 2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S + SO₂ + 4HCl.\n*   **H: 1,2-dichloroethane (C₂H₄Cl₂)**. A solvent formed by the 1:1 reaction of ethylene (D) and chlorine (B): C₂H₄ + Cl₂ → C₂H₄Cl₂.\n\nThe question asks for the molecular symmetry group of product **E**, which is mustard gas, (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S.\n\nTo determine the molecular symmetry group, we must consider the molecule's three-dimensional shape and its symmetry elements. Mustard gas is a flexible molecule with rotation possible around its single bonds. The overall symmetry is determined by its most stable, lowest-energy conformation. Studies have shown that the most stable conformation is a *gauche-gauche'* form.\n\nIn this conformation, the molecule possesses the following symmetry elements:\n1.  An **identity element (E)**, which all molecules have.\n2.  A single **two-fold axis of rotation (C₂)** that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle.\n\nThe molecule does not possess any mirror planes (σ), a center of inversion (i), or any higher-order rotation axes. A point group with only the E and a C₂ element belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of mustard gas (E) is C₂.\n\n<<<B>>>"
