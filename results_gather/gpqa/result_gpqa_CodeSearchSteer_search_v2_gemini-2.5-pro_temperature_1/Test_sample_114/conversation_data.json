    "To solve this problem, we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum from the theory of special relativity. The collision is an electron-positron annihilation, which is an inelastic collision where the initial rest mass is converted into the energy of photons.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Define the initial state:**\n    *   An electron moves from left to right with a Lorentz factor, γe = 4.\n    *   A positron moves from right to left with a Lorentz factor, γp = 2.\n    *   The rest mass of both the electron and the positron is identical, denoted as *mₑ*.\n\n2.  **Calculate the total initial energy (E_initial):**\n    The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by E = γmc².\n    *   Energy of the electron: Eₑ = γₑ * mₑc² = 4mₑc²\n    *   Energy of the positron: Eₚ = γₚ * mₑc² = 2mₑc²\n    *   Total initial energy: E_initial = Eₑ + Eₚ = 4mₑc² + 2mₑc² = 6mₑc²\n\n3.  **Define the final state:**\n    *   Two photons are produced with equal energy, Eᵧ.\n    *   The total final energy is E_final = Eᵧ + Eᵧ = 2Eᵧ.\n    *   Due to energy conservation, E_initial = E_final.\n    *   6mₑc² = 2Eᵧ, which means the energy of each photon is Eᵧ = 3mₑc².\n\n4.  **Calculate the total initial momentum (P_initial):**\n    The momentum of a relativistic particle is given by p = √(γ² - 1) * mc.\n    *   Momentum of the electron (moving in the positive x-direction): Pₑ = √(4² - 1) * mₑc = √15 * mₑc.\n    *   Momentum of the positron (moving in the negative x-direction): Pₚ = -√(2² - 1) * mₑc = -√3 * mₑc.\n    *   Total initial momentum in the x-direction: P_initial,x = (√15 - √3) * mₑc.\n    *   The initial momentum in the y-direction is zero.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total final momentum (P_final):**\n    The momentum of a photon is given by p = E/c.\n    *   Momentum of each photon: Pᵧ = Eᵧ / c = (3mₑc²) / c = 3mₑc.\n    *   The photons move away at angles θ and -θ with respect to the horizontal axis (\"upper-right\" and \"lower-right\").\n    *   The total final momentum in the x-direction is the sum of the x-components of each photon's momentum: P_final,x = Pᵧcos(θ) + Pᵧcos(-θ) = 2Pᵧcos(θ) = 2(3mₑc)cos(θ) = 6mₑc*cos(θ).\n    *   The final momentum in the y-direction is Pᵧsin(θ) + Pᵧsin(-θ) = 0, which is consistent with the initial state.\n\n6.  **Apply conservation of momentum:**\n    *   P_initial,x = P_final,x\n    *   (√15 - √3) * mₑc = 6mₑc * cos(θ)\n    *   cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\n\n7.  **Solve for the angle:**\n    *   Using the approximate values √15 ≈ 3.873 and √3 ≈ 1.732:\n    *   cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 ≈ 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n    *   θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1 degrees.\n\n8.  **Find the angle between the two photons:**\n    The angle between the two photons is 2θ.\n    *   Total Angle = 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°\n\nThis value is very close to 138.\n\n<<<D>>>"
