    "To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product, we first need to deduce the molecular formula of the starting material and then understand the transformation it undergoes.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    *   `cyclohex-3-ene`: A six-membered carbon ring with one double bond.\n    *   `carboxylic acid`: A -COOH group.\n    *   `formyl`: A -CHO group (an aldehyde).\n    *   `vinyl`: A -CH=CH2 group.\n*   **Molecular Formula:**\n    *   The core ring is a cyclohexene.\n    *   The parent structure has 6 carbons in the ring, 1 in the carboxyl group, 1 in the formyl group, and 2 in the vinyl group, for a total of **10 carbon atoms (C10)**.\n    *   Let's count the hydrogens: The fully saturated acyclic alkane with 10 carbons would be C10H22.\n*   **Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Reactant:**\n    The IHD (or degree of unsaturation) tells us the number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   One ring = 1 IHD\n    *   One double bond in the cyclohexene ring (C=C) = 1 IHD\n    *   One double bond in the vinyl group (C=C) = 1 IHD\n    *   One double bond in the formyl group (C=O) = 1 IHD\n    *   One double bond in the carboxylic acid group (C=O) = 1 IHD\n    *   **Total IHD of the reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5**\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction: Reaction with Red Phosphorus (P) and excess Hydroiodic Acid (HI)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus with excess HI is a powerful reducing agent.\n*   **Function:** This combination is known to completely reduce most oxygen-containing functional groups and also saturate carbon-carbon multiple bonds.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The formyl group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   Both carbon-carbon double bonds (in the ring and the vinyl group) are reduced to single bonds (alkanes).\n\n**3. Determine the Product**\n\n*   The reaction will remove all double bonds (both C=C and C=O) and the oxygen atoms, replacing them with hydrogens.\n*   The original carbon skeleton of 10 carbons will remain, but it will be fully saturated except for the ring structure.\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `formyl` group becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `vinyl` group becomes an `ethyl` group.\n*   The product is a disubstituted, saturated cyclohexane ring with an ethyl group, specifically a 1,2-dimethyl-4-ethylcyclohexane (the exact numbering may vary by IUPAC rules, but the structure is a C10 saturated cycloalkane).\n\n**4. Calculate the IHD of the Product**\n\n*   The molecular formula for a saturated acyclic alkane with 10 carbons is C10H(2*10 + 2) = C10H22.\n*   The product has a single ring, which means it has two fewer hydrogen atoms than its acyclic counterpart.\n*   Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n*   We can calculate the IHD from the formula:\n    *   IHD = (2C + 2 - H) / 2\n    *   IHD = (2 * 10 + 2 - 20) / 2\n    *   IHD = (22 - 20) / 2\n    *   IHD = 2 / 2 = **1**\n\nThe final product is a saturated cycloalkane, which has an Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of 1 due to the presence of the ring.\n\n<<<C>>>"
