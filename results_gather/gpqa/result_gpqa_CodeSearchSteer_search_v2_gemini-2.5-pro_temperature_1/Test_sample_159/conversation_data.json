    "When an N-sided polygon-shaped aperture with a constant apothem 'a' has an infinitely large number of sides (N), it approximates a circular aperture. The radius of this circle is equal to the apothem 'a'.\n\nWhen monochromatic light passes through a circular aperture, it creates a diffraction pattern known as an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central disk, called the Airy disk, surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The dark rings correspond to the minima of the light intensity.\n\nThe angular positions of these dark rings (minima) in the far-field region can be determined using the following formula, especially for small angles:\n*θ ≈ m * λ / d*\n\nWhere:\n*   **θ** is the angular position of the minimum.\n*   **λ** is the wavelength of the light.\n*   **d** is the diameter of the circular aperture.\n*   **m** is a coefficient corresponding to the order of the minimum.\n\nFor a circular aperture, the diameter 'd' is twice the radius 'r'. In this case, the radius is the apothem 'a', so d = 2a.\n\nThe coefficients 'm' for the first two minima are derived from the zeros of the first-order Bessel function and are approximately:\n*   **m₁ ≈ 1.220** for the first minimum.\n*   **m₂ ≈ 2.233** for the second minimum.\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular positions of the first and second minima:\n\n**Angular position of the first minimum (θ₁):**\nθ₁ ≈ (1.220 * λ) / (2a) = 0.610 * λ / a.\n\n**Angular position of the second minimum (θ₂):**\nθ₂ ≈ (2.233 * λ) / (2a) ≈ 1.1165 * λ / a.\n\nThe angular distance between the first two minima is the difference between their angular positions:\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁\nΔθ ≈ (1.1165 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\nΔθ ≈ 0.5065 * λ / a\n\nThis result is closest to the option 0.506 λ / a.\n\n<<<D>>>"
