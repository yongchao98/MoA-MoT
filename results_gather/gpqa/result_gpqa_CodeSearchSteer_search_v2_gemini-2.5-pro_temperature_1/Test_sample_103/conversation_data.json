    "The analysis of the problem seems correct. The relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) and the orbital period (P) is the key. The search results confirm the formula used.\n\nSpecifically, for a circular orbit (eccentricity e=0) and assuming the planet's mass (m_p) is much smaller than the star's mass (M_star), the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by formulas similar to this one:\n\nK = ( (2πG / P)^(1/3) ) * ( (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3) )\n\nLet's re-verify the derivation based on this confirmed formula.\n\n1.  **Isolate P**: We need to see how P depends on K.\n    *   K ∝ P^(-1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)\n    *   P^(-1/3) ∝ K * M_star^(2/3) / (m_p * sin(i))\n    *   P ∝ [ K * M_star^(2/3) / (m_p * sin(i)) ]^(-3)\n    *   P ∝ K^(-3) * (m_p * sin(i))^3 / M_star^2\n\n2.  **Form the ratio P2 / P1**:\n    *   P2 / P1 = [ K2^(-3) * (m_p2*sin(i2))^3 / M_star2^2 ] / [ K1^(-3) * (m_p1*sin(i1))^3 / M_star1^2 ]\n    *   P2 / P1 = (K1 / K2)^3 * ( (m_p2*sin(i2)) / (m_p1*sin(i1)) )^3 * (M_star1 / M_star2)^2\n\n3.  **Apply the problem's conditions**:\n    *   **Identical star masses**: M_star1 = M_star2. The last term (M_star1 / M_star2)^2 becomes 1.\n    *   **Similar planet masses**: The prompt states the planets have \"masses similar to that of Neptune.\" In the context of the RV method, where `sin(i)` is unknown, this refers to the observable minimum mass, `m_p * sin(i)`. Thus, we assume m_p1*sin(i1) ≈ m_p2*sin(i2). The middle term becomes approximately 1.\n    *   **Wavelength shifts**: The RV amplitude K is directly proportional to the measured wavelength shift Δλ. So, K1/K2 = Δλ1/Δλ2 = 5/7.\n\n4.  **Simplify the ratio**:\n    *   P2 / P1 ≈ (K1 / K2)^3\n    *   P2 / P1 ≈ (5 / 7)^3\n\n5.  **Calculate the final value**:\n    *   P2 / P1 ≈ 125 / 343\n    *   P2 / P1 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThe calculation is robust and the interpretation of the terms is standard for this type of problem. The result matches option A.\n\nFinal check of the steps and logic. Everything holds together. No need for further searches.\n\nTo solve this problem, we must relate the orbital period (P) of an exoplanet to the observational data from the radial velocity (RV) method.\n\n1.  **Understanding the RV Method Data**: The periodic shift of a spectral line (Δλ) is caused by the Doppler effect from the star's \"wobble\" as the planet orbits it. The amplitude of this wavelength shift (e.g., 5 mÅ for planet #1) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, known as K. Therefore, we can establish a ratio of the velocity amplitudes:\n    *   K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7\n\n2.  **The Radial Velocity Formula**: For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by the formula:\n    *   K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / Mₛ^(2/3))\n    where P is the orbital period, mₚ is the planet's mass, Mₛ is the star's mass, i is the orbital inclination, and G is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Relating Period (P) to Velocity Amplitude (K)**: We need to rearrange the formula to see how P depends on K. Let's express P in terms of the other variables:\n    *   K³ = (2πG / P) * (mₚ sin(i))³ / Mₛ²\n    *   P = (2πG * (mₚ sin(i))³) / (Mₛ² * K³)\n\n    This shows that the orbital period P is inversely proportional to the cube of the velocity amplitude K (P ∝ 1/K³), assuming all other factors are equal.\n\n4.  **Applying the Problem's Conditions**:\n    *   The stars have the same mass (Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂).\n    *   The planets have masses \"similar to that of Neptune.\" In the context of the RV method, the measured quantity is the minimum mass, mₚ sin(i), as the inclination is generally unknown. Therefore, it is standard to assume that mₚ₁ sin(i₁) ≈ mₚ₂ sin(i₂).\n\n5.  **Calculating the Ratio of the Periods**: Now we can set up the ratio for the orbital periods (P₂ / P₁). Since P ∝ 1/K³, the ratio is:\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\n    Substituting the ratio of the wavelength shifts:\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\n    *   P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<A>>>"
