    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n### 1. Normalization of the State Vector\n\nThe given state `|α>` is proportional to `(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`. We can write this as:\n`|α> = C * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n\nTo find the normalization constant C, we use the condition `<α|α> = 1`. The bra corresponding to `|α>` is `<α| = C* * [(1-i)<up| + (2+i)<down|]`.\n\n`<α|α> = |C|² * [(1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)] = 1`\n`|C|² * [(1² - i²) + (2² - i²)] = 1`\n`|C|² * [(1 + 1) + (4 + 1)] = 1`\n`|C|² * [2 + 5] = 1`\n`|C|² * 7 = 1`\n`C = 1/√7`\n\nSo, the normalized state is:\n`|α> = (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n\nIn matrix notation, where `|up> = [1, 0]`ᵀ and `|down> = [0, 1]`ᵀ, the state vector is:\n`|α> = (1/√7) * [1+i, 2-i]`ᵀ\n\n### 2. Finding Eigenstates and Eigenvalues of the Operator A\n\nThe operator A has the matrix representation `Aij = ħ/2` if `i ≠ j` and `0` otherwise. For a 2-state system, this is:\n`A = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\nThis is `(ħ/2)` times the Pauli matrix `σₓ`.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[ -λ, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, -λ ]]) = 0`\n`λ² - (ħ/2)² = 0`\n`λ² = (ħ/2)²`\nThe eigenvalues are `λ₁ = +ħ/2` and `λ₂ = -ħ/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors.\n\nFor `λ₁ = +ħ/2`:\n`(A - λ₁I) |v₁> = 0`\n`[[ -ħ/2, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, -ħ/2 ]] * [[a], [b]] = 0`\nThis gives `-a + b = 0`, so `a = b`. The eigenvector is proportional to `[1, 1]`ᵀ.\nNormalizing it, we get `|v₁> = (1/√2) * [1, 1]`ᵀ, which corresponds to `(1/√2) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n\nFor `λ₂ = -ħ/2`:\n`(A - λ₂I) |v₂> = 0`\n`[[ ħ/2, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, ħ/2 ]] * [[a], [b]] = 0`\nThis gives `a + b = 0`, so `a = -b`. The eigenvector is proportional to `[1, -1]`ᵀ.\nNormalizing it, we get `|v₂> = (1/√2) * [1, -1]`ᵀ, which corresponds to `(1/√2) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring the system in an eigenstate `|vᵢ>` is `P(λᵢ) = |<vᵢ|α>|²`.\n\n**Probability for λ₁ = +ħ/2:**\n`<v₁|α> = [(1/√2) * (<up| + <down|)] * [(1/√7) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n`<v₁|α> = (1/√14) * [ (1)*(1+i) + (1)*(2-i) ]`\n`<v₁|α> = (1/√14) * [1 + i + 2 - i] = 3/√14`\n`P(λ₁) = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.643`\n\n**Probability for λ₂ = -ħ/2:**\n`<v₂|α> = [(1/√2) * (<up| - <down|)] * [(1/√7) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n`<v₂|α> = (1/√14) * [ (1)*(1+i) - (1)*(2-i) ]`\n`<v₂|α> = (1/√14) * [1 + i - 2 + i] = (-1 + 2i)/√14`\n`P(λ₂) = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1 + 4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357`\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Average Value\n\nThe average (or expectation) value of the operator A is given by `<A> = <α|A|α>`.\nAlternatively, it can be calculated as `<A> = Σ P(λᵢ) * λᵢ`.\n\nUsing the second method:\n`<A> = P(λ₁)λ₁ + P(λ₂)λ₂`\n`<A> = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2)`\n`<A> = (ħ/28) * (9 - 5)`\n`<A> = 4ħ/28 = ħ/7`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probabilities are **0.64** and **0.36**, and the average value is **ħ/7**. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
