    "The search results confirm the formulas used in the initial reasoning.\n\n1.  **Transit Probability:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the geometric probability of it transiting its host star is given by the ratio of the star's radius (R_s) to the planet's semi-major axis (a).\n    *   `Prob ≈ R_s / a`\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital period (P) to its semi-major axis (a) and the mass of the host star (M_s). The formula is:\n    *   `P² = (4π² / (G * M_s)) * a³`\n    *   This can be rearranged to solve for the semi-major axis: `a = (G * M_s * P² / (4π²))^(1/3)`\n\nFrom Kepler's Third Law, we can see the relationship between the semi-major axis and the other variables:\n`a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3)`\n\nNow, we can substitute this into the transit probability formula:\n`Prob ∝ R_s / (M_s * P²)^(1/3)`\n\nLet's apply this to the two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2.\n\n**For Planet_1:**\n*   Host Star Radius = R_s1\n*   Host Star Mass = M_s1\n*   Orbital Period = P1\n*   `Prob1 ∝ R_s1 / (M_s1 * P1²)^(1/3)`\n\n**For Planet_2:**\n*   Host Star Radius = R_s2\n*   Host Star Mass = M_s2\n*   Orbital Period = P2\n*   `Prob2 ∝ R_s2 / (M_s2 * P2²)^(1/3)`\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the probabilities, `Prob1 / Prob2`:\n`Prob1 / Prob2 = [R_s1 / (M_s1 * P1²)^(1/3)] / [R_s2 / (M_s2 * P2²)^(1/3)]`\n`Prob1 / Prob2 = (R_s1 / R_s2) * [(M_s2 * P2²) / (M_s1 * P1²)]^(1/3)`\n\nLet's use the information given in the problem:\n*   The host stars have the same radii: `R_s1 = R_s2`, so `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1`.\n*   The host star of Planet_1 has a mass twice that of the host star of Planet_2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`, so `M_s2 / M_s1 = 1/2`.\n*   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2: `P1 = P2 / 3`, so `P2 / P1 = 3`, which means `(P2/P1)² = 3² = 9`.\n\nSubstitute these values into the ratio equation:\n`Prob1 / Prob2 = 1 * [(1/2) * 9]^(1/3)`\n`Prob1 / Prob2 = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\nNow, we need to calculate the cube root of 4.5.\n*   1.6³ = 4.096\n*   1.7³ = 4.913\n*   1.65³ = 1.65 * 1.65 * 1.65 = 2.7225 * 1.65 = 4.492125\n\nThe value is extremely close to 1.65.\n\nTherefore, the transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. This means the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n*   A) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit. (Incorrect)\n*   B) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit. (Incorrect)\n*   C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit. (Correct)\n*   D) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit. (Incorrect)\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
