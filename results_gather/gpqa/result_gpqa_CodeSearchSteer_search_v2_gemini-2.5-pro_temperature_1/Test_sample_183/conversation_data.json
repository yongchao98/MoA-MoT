    "My initial analysis of the reaction sequence in option C led to the incorrect isomer, 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene, instead of the target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. This discrepancy suggests a potential flaw in the proposed reaction pathway or an incorrect interpretation of the directing effects of the substituents under the specified conditions. Let's re-evaluate the synthesis from a different perspective, keeping the target molecule's structure—with its ortho/meta relationships—at the forefront.\n\nThe target has an ethoxy and a nitro group *meta* to each other, and a *tert*-butyl group *ortho* to both. This 1,2,3-substitution pattern is notoriously difficult to achieve via standard electrophilic aromatic substitution, which typically favors ortho/para or meta products, not a mix. This often requires a more complex strategy, sometimes involving blocking groups or rearrangement of substituent positions.\n\nLet's meticulously re-examine the sequence in Option C, which remains the most plausible choice after eliminating the other options due to clear chemical impossibilities (e.g., diazotization without an amine, Friedel-Crafts on a deactivated ring).\n\n**Re-evaluation of Option C:**\n\n1.  **i) `tert`-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ on benzene:** This yields `tert`-butylbenzene. This step is sound.\n2.  **ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ on `tert`-butylbenzene:** Standard nitration. The `tert`-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. Due to significant steric hindrance, the major product is *p*-nitro-`tert`-butylbenzene, with *o*-nitro-`tert`-butylbenzene as a minor product. For a \"high-yield\" synthesis, relying on a minor product is inefficient. However, let's proceed with the major product, **4-`tert`-butylnitrobenzene**.\n3.  **iii) Fe/HCl on 4-`tert`-butylnitrobenzene:** This reduces the nitro group to an amino group, yielding **4-`tert`-butylaniline**. This is a standard and high-yield reduction.\n4.  **iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ on 4-`tert`-butylaniline:** This is the most critical and complex step. Direct nitration of anilines is problematic; the amino group is often protected via acetylation first. Assuming the intended reaction is the nitration of protected 4-`tert`-butylaniline (N-acetyl-4-tert-butylaniline), the acetylamino group (-NHCOCH₃) is a strong ortho, para-director. The `tert`-butyl group is also an ortho, para-director. The directing effects cooperate, and nitration occurs *ortho* to the powerfully directing acetylamino group. This gives **4-`tert`-butyl-2-nitroacetanilide**, which is then hydrolyzed to **4-`tert`-butyl-2-nitroaniline**. This intermediate is a known compound.\n5.  **v) NaNO₂/HCl on 4-`tert`-butyl-2-nitroaniline:** This step converts the amino group into a diazonium salt, yielding **4-`tert`-butyl-2-nitrobenzenediazonium chloride**. This is a standard diazotization.\n6.  **vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat on the diazonium salt:** Heating an aqueous solution of the diazonium salt replaces the -N₂⁺ group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This produces **4-`tert`-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr on 4-`tert`-butyl-2-nitrophenol:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The strongly basic NaOH deprotonates the phenolic -OH group, and the resulting phenoxide ion attacks the ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form an ether. The product is **1-ethoxy-4-`tert`-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis detailed analysis confirms that the sequence in option C produces **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, which is an isomer of the target molecule but not the target molecule itself. The substituent positions are (1-OEt, 2-NO₂, 4-tBu) instead of the required (1-OEt, 2-tBu, 3-NO₂).\n\nGiven that options A, B, and D contain chemically flawed steps, and option C leads to an isomer, there appears to be an error in the question or the provided options. No sequence listed correctly and efficiently produces 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\nHowever, in the context of a multiple-choice question where one option must be the best fit despite potential inaccuracies, let's consider if there is any alternative, albeit less common, reaction pathway that could be implied. It's highly unlikely. The regiochemistry of electrophilic aromatic substitution is fundamental, and the outcome of the sequence in C is quite clear.\n\nSince the prompt requires selecting the best option among the given choices, and options A, B, and D are definitively incorrect due to misplaced or impossible reactions, option C represents the most chemically logical (though ultimately flawed in its outcome) sequence of reactions for synthesizing a trisubstituted nitro-ethoxy-tert-butyl-benzene. It follows a common synthetic logic: introduce directing groups, perform substitutions, and then modify the functional groups (nitro reduction, diazotization, hydroxyl substitution, etherification). The error lies in the regiochemical outcome, not the logic of the steps themselves. Therefore, it is the \"least wrong\" answer.\n\nFinal conclusion based on eliminating the impossible options.\n\n<<<C>>>"
