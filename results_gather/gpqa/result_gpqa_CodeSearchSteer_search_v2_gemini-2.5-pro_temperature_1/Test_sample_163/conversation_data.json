    "To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we can use the principles of orbital mechanics for binary star systems. For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the total mass of the system (the sum of the masses of the two stars, M = m₁ + m₂) is related to the orbital period (P) and the radial velocity amplitudes (K₁ and K₂).\n\nThe relationship can be derived from Kepler's Third Law and is given by the formula:\n\nM = (P / (2πG)) * (K₁ + K₂)³ / sin³(i)\n\nwhere:\n*   **M** is the total mass of the binary system (m₁ + m₂).\n*   **P** is the orbital period.\n*   **K₁** and **K₂** are the amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n*   **G** is the gravitational constant.\n*   **i** is the inclination angle of the orbit relative to the line of sight.\n\nThe problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. For an eclipse to occur, the orbital plane must be very close to our line of sight, meaning the inclination angle *i* is approximately 90 degrees. Therefore, sin(i) is approximately 1, and sin³(i) is also approximately 1. This simplifies the formula for both systems.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the mass of system_1 (M₁) to the mass of system_2 (M₂).\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Period (P₁): 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total₁): 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Period (P₂): 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total₂): 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nThe ratio M₁ / M₂ can be calculated as:\n\nM₁ / M₂ = [ (P₁ * (K_total₁)³) / (2πG) ] / [ (P₂ * (K_total₂)³) / (2πG) ]\n\nThe constant term (2πG) cancels out, leaving:\n\nM₁ / M₂ = (P₁ / P₂) * (K_total₁ / K_total₂)³\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values into this equation. It's important to use consistent units, but since we are calculating a ratio, the units will cancel out as long as they are the same for both systems (years for period, km/s for velocity).\n\nM₁ / M₂ = (2 years / 1 year) * (15 km/s / 25 km/s)³\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (15 / 25)³\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3 / 5)³\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM₁ / M₂ = 54 / 125\nM₁ / M₂ = 0.432\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 0.432. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) ~ 0.4\nB) ~ 0.7\nC) ~ 0.6\nD) ~ 1.2\n\nThe value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
