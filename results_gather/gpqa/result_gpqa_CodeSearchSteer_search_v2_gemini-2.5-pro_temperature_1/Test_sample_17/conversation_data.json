    "To calculate the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we need to determine the abundance of silicon relative to hydrogen (nSi/nH) for each star. The information about the masses of the stars, the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), and the use of the Equivalent Width (EW) method are contextual details about how astronomers determine elemental abundances and are not needed for the calculation itself.\n\nThe standard astronomical notation for elemental abundance ratios is [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY)_star - log10(nX/nY)_sun. A useful identity derived from this definition is [A/B] = [A/H] - [B/H].\n\n**For Star 1:**\n\nWe are given:\n*   [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex\n*   [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex\n\nWe can find the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen, [Si/H]_1, using the identity:\n[Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1\n[Si/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3 dex\n\nThis means:\nlog10(nSi/nH)_1 - log10(nSi/nH)_sun = 0.3\nlog10(nSi/nH)_1 = 0.3 + log10(nSi/nH)_sun\n\n**For Star 2:**\n\nWe are given:\n*   [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex\n*   [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex\n\nWe can find the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen, [Si/H]_2, using the identity [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2:\n0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2\n[Si/H]_2 = -0.3 dex\n\nThis means:\nlog10(nSi/nH)_2 - log10(nSi/nH)_sun = -0.3\nlog10(nSi/nH)_2 = -0.3 + log10(nSi/nH)_sun\n\n**Ratio Calculation:**\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres, which corresponds to the ratio of their abundances, (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2.\n\nTo find this ratio, we can take the difference of the logarithms of the abundances:\nlog10 [ (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2 ] = log10(nSi/nH)_1 - log10(nSi/nH)_2\nlog10(Ratio) = (0.3 + log10(nSi/nH)_sun) - (-0.3 + log10(nSi/nH)_sun)\nlog10(Ratio) = 0.3 - (-0.3)\nlog10(Ratio) = 0.6\n\nTo find the ratio, we take the antilogarithm:\nRatio = 10^0.6\nRatio â‰ˆ 3.98\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9.\n\n<<<C>>>"
