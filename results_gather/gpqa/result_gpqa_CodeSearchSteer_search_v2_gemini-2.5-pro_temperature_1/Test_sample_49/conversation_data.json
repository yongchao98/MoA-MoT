    "The note discovered on the desk provides a mathematical expression that estimates the size of a contribution from a Feynman diagram. This expression contains several clues, but the most direct indicator of the number of loops in the diagram is the factor involving `4π`.\n\nIn quantum field theory calculations in four-dimensional spacetime, each loop in a Feynman diagram typically introduces a factor of `1/(4π)^2` into the final expression for the amplitude. This convention arises from the integration over the four-dimensional loop momentum. An L-loop diagram, therefore, generally contains a factor of `(1/(4π)^2)^L`, which simplifies to `1/(4π)^(2L)`.\n\nThe scribbled expression is:\n`alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\nBy examining the term `1/(4pi)^6` and comparing it to the general form `1/(4pi)^(2L)`, we can determine the number of loops, `L`.\n\nSetting the exponents equal:\n`2L = 6`\n\nSolving for `L` gives:\n`L = 3`\n\nTherefore, the Feynman diagram contained 3 loops. The other terms in the expression relate to the coupling constants of the theory (`alpha^3 * g^2`), numerical factors from the specific diagram's symmetry and evaluation (`sqrt(2) * 8`), and a ratio of energy scales (`(Q/M)^2`).\n\n<<<D>>>"
