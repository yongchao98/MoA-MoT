    "The observed spectral features of the quasar provide the necessary information to determine its redshift, which is the crucial first step in calculating its distance.\n\n### 1. Determining the Redshift (z)\n\nThe prominent peak at 790 nm followed by a significant drop in flux at shorter wavelengths is characteristic of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line in a high-redshift object. The flux drop is caused by the absorption of light by neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium between the quasar and Earth, an effect known as the Lyman-alpha forest.\n\nThe rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha emission line, which is due to the electron transition from n=2 to n=1 in a hydrogen atom, is approximately 121.6 nm (or 1215.67 Å). The redshift (z) can be calculated by comparing this rest wavelength (λ_emitted) to the observed wavelength (λ_observed):\n\n*   z = (λ_observed / λ_emitted) - 1\n*   z = (790 nm / 121.6 nm) - 1\n*   z ≈ 6.5 - 1\n*   z ≈ 5.5\n\n### 2. Calculating the Comoving Distance\n\nWith the redshift established, the comoving distance to the quasar can be calculated using the parameters of the Lambda-CDM (ΛCDM) cosmological model provided. The comoving distance is the distance between two objects that remains constant with the expansion of the universe, measured as if on a grid that expands along with space.\n\nThe given cosmological parameters are:\n*   Hubble constant (H₀) = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n*   Matter density parameter (Ω_m) = 0.3\n*   Dark energy density parameter (Ω_Λ) = 0.7\n*   The universe is flat, meaning the curvature density parameter (Ω_k) is 0. This is consistent as Ω_m + Ω_Λ = 1.\n\nThe calculation of comoving distance requires integrating the Friedmann equation. While the exact formula is complex, cosmological calculators can perform this integration numerically. Using these parameters (z = 5.5, H₀ = 70, Ω_m = 0.3, Ω_Λ = 0.7), the comoving radial distance is calculated to be approximately 9.0 Gpc.\n\nThis result aligns with option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
