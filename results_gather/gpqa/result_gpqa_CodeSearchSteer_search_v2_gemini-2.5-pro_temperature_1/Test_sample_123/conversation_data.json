    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the final answer.\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem involves two key concepts: particle decay and relativistic time dilation.\n    *   **Particle Decay:** The fraction of particles, `N/N₀`, that survive after a time `t` is given by the exponential decay law: `N/N₀ = exp(-t / τ_lab)`, where `τ_lab` is the average lifetime of the particles in the laboratory's frame of reference.\n    *   **Time Dilation:** An unstable particle's lifetime appears longer when it is moving at a relativistic speed relative to an observer. This \"dilated\" lifetime in the lab frame, `τ_lab`, is related to its proper lifetime `τ` (its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor, `γ`. The formula is `τ_lab = γ * τ`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equation:**\n    *   The time it takes for the particles to travel from the center to the inner wall of the detector (radius `R` = 30 m) in the lab frame is `t = R / v`.\n    *   Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`. So, `t ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Substituting `t` and `τ_lab` into the decay equation gives the survival fraction `f`:\n        `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ))`\n    *   We can group the constants `R`, `c`, and `τ` into a single constant `K`, since they do not change between the two scenarios. Let `K = R / (c * τ)`. The equation simplifies to:\n        `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n3.  **Apply the Initial Condition:**\n    *   We are given that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁` is 20, the survival fraction `f₁` is 1/3.\n    *   `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    *   To solve for `K`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n        `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n        `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the Target Condition:**\n    *   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, required for the survival fraction `f₂` to be 2/3.\n    *   `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n    *   Substitute the value of `K` we just found:\n        `2/3 = exp(-(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂)`\n    *   Again, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n    *   Using the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)`:\n        `ln(2) - ln(3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n        `-(ln(3) - ln(2)) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n    *   The negative signs cancel out. We can also use the property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`:\n        `ln(3/2) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n    *   Now, rearrange the equation to solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   Using the approximate values for the natural logarithms (`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`):\n        `γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055`\n        `γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055`\n        `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThis value is closest to 54.\n\n<<<B>>>"
