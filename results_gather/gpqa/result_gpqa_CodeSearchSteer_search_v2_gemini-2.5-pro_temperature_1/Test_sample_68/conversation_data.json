    "To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays, we must first calculate the properties of the $X^0$ particle in the laboratory frame.\n\n### 1. Calculation of the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)\nThe Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, relates the energy and mass of a relativistic particle.\n*   Total Energy, E = 27 GeV\n*   Rest Mass, $m_0$ = 3.41 GeV (this corresponds to a rest energy $E_0 = m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV)\n\nThe formula for the Lorentz factor is:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{E_0} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Mean Decay Length (L)\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It depends on its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$), its velocity (v), and the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$).\n*   Proper lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   The speed of light, c $\\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\nThe lifetime in the lab frame is dilated by the Lorentz factor: $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\nThe distance is $L = v \\times \\tau = v \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n\nThe velocity $v$ can be expressed in terms of $\\gamma$ as $v = c\\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$. For high energies, $v$ is very close to $c$. A more direct formula for the decay length using momentum is $L = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} c\\tau_0$, where $p$ is the momentum. This can also be written as:\n$L = c\\tau_0\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n\nPlugging in the values:\n$L = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\times \\sqrt{(7.918)^2 - 1}$\n$L = (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\times \\sqrt{62.69 - 1}$\n$L = (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\times 7.854$\n$L \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n### 3. Interpretation of \"Minimum Resolution\"\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution required to observe \"at least 30% of the decays\". In a detector like a bubble chamber, a decay is \"observed\" if the particle leaves a track of a resolvable length before it decays. If a particle decays at a distance $d$ from its creation, the resolution $R$ of the detector must be smaller than $d$ ($R < d$).\n\nTherefore, we are looking for a minimum resolution $R$ such that the fraction of particles that travel a distance greater than $R$ is at least 30%. The probability of a particle surviving a distance $x$ is given by the exponential decay law, $P(x) = e^{-x/L}$.\n\nWe set this probability to 30%:\n$e^{-R/L} = 0.30$\n\nSolving for R:\n$-R/L = \\ln(0.30)$\n$R = -L \\times \\ln(0.30) = -L \\times (-1.204)$\n$R = 1.204 \\times L$\n\nUsing our calculated value for L:\n$R = 1.204 \\times (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m})$\n$R \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\nThis result ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is closest in value to option C. The slight discrepancy (around 9%) might arise from the specific values of constants used or a slightly different interpretation intended by the problem statement. However, given the options, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is the only one in the correct order of magnitude.\n\nAnother possible interpretation, common in such problems, is that the question implicitly assumes the given energy is kinetic energy and asks for the mean decay length, as the fraction of particles surviving one mean decay length ($e^{-1} \\approx 37\\%$) is \"at least 30%\". This interpretation leads to a value of $L \\approx 2.13 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, which is very close to option C. Both plausible physical interpretations point toward option C as the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
