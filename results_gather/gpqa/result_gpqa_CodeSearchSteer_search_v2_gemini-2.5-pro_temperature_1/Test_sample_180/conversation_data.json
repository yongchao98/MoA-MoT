    "To determine the ratio of neutrino fluxes, we must first understand the sources of solar neutrinos in the specified energy bands and how they are affected by the hypothetical shutdown of the pp-III branch.\n\n### Analysis of Solar Neutrino Sources\n\nThe Sun produces neutrinos through several nuclear reaction sequences, primarily the proton-proton (pp) chain and the CNO cycle. The pp chain has three main branches: pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III.\n\n1.  **Neutrino Energy Bands:**\n    *   **Band 1:** 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV)\n    *   **Band 2:** 800-900 keV (0.8-0.9 MeV)\n\n2.  **Key Neutrino Sources by Energy:**\n    *   **pp-II Branch:** This branch produces a prominent, nearly monochromatic neutrino line from the electron capture of Beryllium-7 (`7Be`). This line is at 861 keV (0.861 MeV) and falls squarely within **Band 2**.\n    *   **pp-III Branch:** This branch is responsible for producing Boron-8 (`8B`) nuclei, which then beta-decay, emitting neutrinos with a continuous energy spectrum that extends up to about 15 MeV. These `8B` neutrinos contribute to the flux in **both Band 1 and Band 2**.\n    *   **CNO Cycle:** This cycle, which contributes about 1% of the Sun's energy, also produces neutrinos. The neutrinos from Nitrogen-13 (`13N`) and Oxygen-15 (`15O`) decays have continuous energy spectra that extend up to 1.20 MeV and 1.73 MeV, respectively. Therefore, CNO neutrinos also contribute a small amount of flux to **both Band 1 and Band 2**.\n\n### Impact of Stopping the pp-III Branch\n\nThe hypothetical scenario states that the pp-III branch stops. The direct consequence is that the production of `8B` neutrinos ceases, and their flux drops to zero. The pp-II branch and the CNO cycle are stated to remain as they were.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the flux in each band under this new condition:\n\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n    *   The significant contribution from the continuous `8B` neutrino spectrum disappears.\n    *   The only remaining source of neutrinos in this energy range is the faint, continuous spectrum from the CNO cycle.\n\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n    *   The contribution from the continuous `8B` neutrino spectrum also disappears from this band.\n    *   However, the extremely strong `7Be` neutrino line at 861 keV, which comes from the unaffected pp-II branch, remains.\n    *   The faint CNO cycle neutrinos are also still present.\n\n### Calculating the Flux Ratio\n\nThe new ratio is:\n\nFlux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2) = (Flux from CNO) / (Flux from `7Be` line + Flux from CNO)\n\nThe total flux of the `7Be` neutrino line is on the order of 5 x 10⁹ cm⁻²s⁻¹. In contrast, the total fluxes of `13N` and `15O` neutrinos from the CNO cycle are much lower, around 3 x 10⁸ and 2 x 10⁸ cm⁻²s⁻¹, respectively. These CNO fluxes are spread over a wide energy range.\n\nTherefore, the integrated CNO flux over the narrow 100 keV window of Band 1 is extremely small compared to the total flux of the `7Be` line, which is concentrated entirely within Band 2. The flux in Band 2 is overwhelmingly dominated by the `7Be` neutrinos.\n\n*   **Numerator (Flux in Band 1):** A very small value, representing a fraction of the total CNO flux.\n*   **Denominator (Flux in Band 2):** A very large value, dominated by the `7Be` flux.\n\nThe resulting ratio will be a very small number, much less than 1. An order-of-magnitude estimation shows the ratio to be approximately (a few 10⁷) / (a few 10⁹), which is on the order of 10⁻².\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) 0.1 (10⁻¹)\n*   B) 0.01 (10⁻²)\n*   C) 10\n*   D) 1\n\nThe calculated ratio is closest to 0.01.\n\n<<<B>>>"
