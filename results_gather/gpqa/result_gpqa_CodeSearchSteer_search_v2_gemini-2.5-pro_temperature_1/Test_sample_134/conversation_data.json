    "A decay is kinematically allowed if the mass of the decaying particle is greater than the sum of the masses of the decay products. In the case of the boson *X* decaying into a fermion-antifermion pair ($f\\bar{f}$), the condition is:\n\n$M_X > 2 \\cdot m_f$\n\nGiven that the mass of the boson *X* is 6 GeV, a decay into a specific fermion-antifermion pair is possible only if the mass of the fermion (*f*) is less than 3 GeV.\n\nLet's examine the masses of the fundamental fermions listed in the options:\n\n**Leptons:**\n*   **Electron (e):** The mass of an electron is approximately 0.511 MeV/c², which is 0.000511 GeV/c². This is significantly less than 3 GeV.\n*   **Muon (μ):** The mass of a muon is approximately 105.7 MeV/c², or 0.1057 GeV/c². This is less than 3 GeV.\n*   **Tau (τ):** The mass of a tau lepton is about 1.777 GeV/c². This is less than 3 GeV.\n\n**Quarks:**\n*   **Up (u):** The mass of an up quark is approximately 2.2 MeV/c², which is 0.0022 GeV/c². This is less than 3 GeV.\n*   **Down (d):** The mass of a down quark is approximately 4.7 MeV/c², or 0.0047 GeV/c². This is less than 3 GeV.\n*   **Strange (s):** The mass of a strange quark is about 95 MeV/c², which is 0.095 GeV/c². This is less than 3 GeV.\n*   **Charm (c):** The mass of a charm quark is approximately 1.27 GeV/c². This is less than 3 GeV.\n*   **Bottom (b):** The mass of a bottom quark is about 4.18 GeV/c². This value is greater than 3 GeV.\n*   **Top (t):** The mass of a top quark is approximately 173 GeV/c². This is substantially greater than 3 GeV.\n\nBased on these masses, the decays of the boson *X* that are kinematically allowed are into pairs of charm quarks, strange quarks, up quarks, down quarks, tau leptons, muons, and electrons. The decays into top and bottom quark pairs are not allowed because their required energy (twice their mass) exceeds the mass of the *X* boson.\n\nTherefore, the correct list of kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order is:\n\n$X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}, s\\bar{s}, u\\bar{u}, d\\bar{d}, \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}, \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-}$\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
