    "The energy levels of a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by the formula:\n\n`E_n = (n + 3/2)ħω`\n\nHere, `n` is the principal quantum number which can take non-negative integer values (n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\n*   The ground state corresponds to `n = 0`.\n*   The first excited state corresponds to `n = 1`.\n*   The second excited state corresponds to `n = 2`.\n*   The third excited state corresponds to `n = 3`.\n\nTo find the energy of the third excited state, we set `n = 3`:\n\n`E_3 = (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω`\n\nThe number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy level `E_n` is known as the degeneracy, `g_n`. For the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy is calculated by the formula:\n\n`g_n = (n + 1)(n + 2) / 2`\n\nFor the third excited state, `n = 3`, the degeneracy is:\n\n`g_3 = (3 + 1)(3 + 2) / 2 = (4)(5) / 2 = 10`\n\nThus, for the third excited state, the energy is (9/2)ħω and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for this energy eigenvalue.\n\n<<<A>>>"
