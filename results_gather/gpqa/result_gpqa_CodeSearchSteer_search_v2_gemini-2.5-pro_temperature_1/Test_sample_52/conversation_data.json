    "To identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound, we can systematically analyze the provided spectral data to determine its constituent fragments.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Structure and FTIR:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which means it has a `C6H4` core. The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (`-COO-`).\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. The presence of two signals for these 4 protons is characteristic of a para (1,4) substituted ring, which would show two doublets due to symmetry. This confirms the `C6H4` fragment. (Total protons so far: 4)\n    *   **Vinyl Protons (2 signals):** There are two signals for vinyl protons (hydrogens attached to a C=C double bond). The splitting patterns—one doublet and one doublet of quartets—are a classic indicator of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`). The vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split into a doublet of quartets, while the other vinyl proton appears as a doublet. This fragment is `-C₃H₅`. (Total protons so far: 4 + 2 = 6)\n    *   **Methyl Protons (2 signals):** The spectrum shows two signals for methyl (`-CH₃`) groups.\n        *   One methyl group is part of the propenyl (`-CH=CH-CH₃`) fragment identified above.\n        *   The second methyl group must be part of the ester. Since the data indicates no `-CH₂` groups, it cannot be an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). Therefore, the ester must be a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetate group (`-OCOCH₃`). Both of these fragments contribute one methyl group and have the formula `-C₂H₃O₂`. (Total protons so far: 4 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 12)\n    *   **No –CH₂ signals:** This crucial piece of information rules out fragments like ethyl groups, confirming the assignment of the ester as a methyl ester or acetate.\n\n### Assembling the Molecular Formula\n\nNow, we combine the atoms from each identified fragment to determine the total molecular formula.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** `C₆H₄`\n*   **Propenyl Group:** `C₃H₅` (This includes one vinyl -CH=CH- and one -CH₃)\n*   **Ester Fragment:** `C₂H₃O₂` (This includes the -COO- and the second -CH₃)\n\n**Total Calculation:**\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of 6 (one ring, four double bonds within the ring, one vinyl double bond, and one carbonyl double bond), which is consistent with the proposed structure.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n*   A) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\n*   B) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\n*   C) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\n*   D) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n\nThe deduced formula matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
