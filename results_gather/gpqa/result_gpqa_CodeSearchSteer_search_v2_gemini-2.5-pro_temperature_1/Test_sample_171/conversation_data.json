    "To determine the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the two stars, we will use the Boltzmann equation, which is applicable here due to the assumption that the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\nThe Boltzmann equation describes the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy levels:\n\nN_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   N_j and N_i are the number of atoms in the excited state (j) and a lower energy state (i), respectively.\n*   g_j and g_i are the statistical weights of these energy levels.\n*   E_j - E_i is the energy difference between the levels (ΔE).\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nLet's denote the ratio of excited atoms to atoms in the lower state for each star as R_1 and R_2.\n\nFor Star 1 (temperature T_1):\nR_1 = (N_j / N_i)_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n\nFor Star 2 (temperature T_2):\nR_2 = (N_j / N_i)_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nThe problem states that the iron atoms in star 1 are twice as excited as in star 2. This means that the population of the specific excited energy level in star 1 is twice that in star 2, so R_1 = 2 * R_2.\n\nBy substituting the Boltzmann equations into this relationship, we get:\n(g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nThe term for the statistical weights (g_j / g_i) cancels out on both sides:\nexp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nTo solve for the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\nln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to isolate ln(2):\nln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)\n\nFactoring out the common term ΔE/k:\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\nCombining the terms in the parenthesis gives:\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\nThe problem provides the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. The value of the Boltzmann constant, k, is defined as exactly 1.380649 x 10^(-23) J/K. Therefore, the ratio ΔE / k is approximately 1 K.\n\nSubstituting this value into our equation:\nln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\nThis simplifies to:\nln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
