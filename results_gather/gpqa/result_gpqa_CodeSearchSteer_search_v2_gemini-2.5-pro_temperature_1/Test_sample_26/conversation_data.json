    "This cellular conversation describes the beginning of the protein secretory pathway.\n\n*   **\"Oh, I know you,\" the ribonucleoprotein particle says...**: This refers to the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP), an abundant, cytosolic ribonucleoprotein. It recognizes a specific signal sequence on the newly forming protein.\n*   **...to the nascent chain as they meet.**: The nascent chain is a protein being synthesized on a ribosome. This meeting happens in the cytosol, where protein synthesis begins.\n*   **\"Pause there for a minute.\"**: The binding of SRP to the nascent chain causes a temporary halt in protein synthesis.\n*   **\"Let me show you in; you really need some sugar.\"**: The SRP guides the entire ribosome-protein complex to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. The reference to \"sugar\" points to glycosylation, a modification process that attaches carbohydrates to proteins, which begins in the endoplasmic reticulum.\n*   **\"It seems somewhat rough.\"**: This is a clue that their destination is the *rough* endoplasmic reticulum (RER), which is studded with ribosomes and is the entry point for the secretory pathway.\n*   **\"I guess this is goodbye; I need to be on my way\", the chain replies.**: Once the complex docks at the RER, the SRP is released, and the nascent chain is translocated into the RER. From here, it will travel through the secretory pathway, which can ultimately lead to its secretion from the cell into the extracellular space.\n\nTherefore, the meeting occurs in the cytosol, and the chain is heading into the secretory pathway, a major destination of which is the extracellular space.\n\n<<<B>>>"
