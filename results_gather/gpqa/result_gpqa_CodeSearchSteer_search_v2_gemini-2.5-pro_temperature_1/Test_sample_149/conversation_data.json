    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Starting Compound**\n\nFirst, we must determine the structure of the initial compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO using the provided 1H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO. The degree of unsaturation is 5, which suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees) and a carbonyl group (1 degree).\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting pattern indicates it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly indicate a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group attached to an aromatic ring.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-) that is adjacent to a single proton, which is consistent with it being coupled to the aldehyde proton.\n\nBased on this data, the starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Sequence**\n\nNow, we will trace the starting material through the three-step reaction sequence.\n\n1.  **NaNO2 + HCl:** This set of reagents is used for diazotization. A primary aromatic amine reacts with nitrous acid (formed in situ from NaNO2 and HCl) to form a diazonium salt. In this step, the amino group (-NH2) on 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is converted to a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-), forming 4-(diazonium)phenylacetaldehyde chloride.\n\n2.  **H2O:** The addition of water to the diazonium salt, often with gentle warming, results in a hydrolysis reaction. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This step converts the intermediate into **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves an aldol condensation. 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde has acidic protons on the carbon alpha to the aldehyde group. In the presence of a strong base like potassium hydroxide (KOH), it will undergo self-condensation.\n    *   The base (OH-) removes an alpha-proton from one molecule to form an enolate.\n    *   This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    *   This initially forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, known as the aldol addition product. In this case, it would be 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal.\n    *   Because the reaction is heated, this aldol addition product undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Final Product Structure**\n\nThe final product is the result of the dehydration of the aldol addition product. The dehydration occurs by removing the hydroxyl group from the beta-carbon (C3) and a proton from the alpha-carbon (C2), creating a double bond between C2 and C3.\n\nThe resulting structure is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
