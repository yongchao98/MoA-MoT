    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star. The formula shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis, 'a'). Since all other factors like the star's properties and the planets' albedos are the same, they cancel out when taking a ratio.\n\n    Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₄)\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital period (P) to its semi-major axis (a). It states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (P² ∝ a³). For two planets orbiting the same star, the ratio of their properties is:\n    (P₄ / P₂)² = (a₄ / a₂)³\n\n    We can rearrange this to find the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n    a₄ / a₂ = (P₄ / P₂)^(2/3)\n    or\n    a₂ / a₄ = (P₂ / P₄)^(2/3)\n\n3.  **Combine the Formulas:** Now, we substitute the relationship from Kepler's Third Law into the temperature ratio equation:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = √((P₂ / P₄)^(2/3))\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₂ / P₄)^(1/3)\n\n4.  **Use the Given Period Ratios:** The problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods for Planet_1 through Planet_5 as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    *   The relative period for Planet_2 (P₂) is 2.\n    *   The relative period for Planet_4 (P₄) is 3.5.\n\n    The ratio of their periods is:\n    P₂ / P₄ = 2 / 3.5\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:** Substitute the period ratio into the combined formula:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.83\n\nThus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<B>>>"
