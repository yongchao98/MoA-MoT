    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\n\nThis reaction is an alpha-halogenation of a ketone. In this process, a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an alpha-hydrogen) is replaced by a bromine atom. This results in the formation of **2-bromocyclohexanone (Product 1)**.\n\n**Step 2: 2-bromocyclohexanone heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\nWhen an α-halo ketone with an available proton on its other α-carbon is treated with a strong base like NaOH, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This is a well-documented reaction that involves a ring contraction. The six-membered cyclohexanone ring contracts to form a five-membered ring derivative. The product is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2)**.\n\n**Step 3: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. The hydroxyl (-OH) group of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom. Pyridine is often used to neutralize the HCl byproduct. The resulting molecule is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3)**.\n\n**Step 4: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H)**\n\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky, mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce reactive acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to an alcohol. Therefore, it reduces cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride to **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde (Product 4)**.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nTo determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde, we must examine its structure and symmetry.\n\nThe molecule consists of a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO). There is a plane of symmetry that runs through the aldehyde group, the carbon it's attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1, bisecting the ring.\n\nDue to this symmetry:\n*   The **aldehyde hydrogen** is unique. (1 set)\n*   The **hydrogen on C1** (the carbon attached to the aldehyde) is unique. (2nd set)\n*   The carbons C2 and C5 are equivalent. However, the two hydrogens on C2 are diastereotopic (not equivalent) because of their spatial relationship to the rest of the molecule. The same is true for C5. By symmetry, the two \"upper\" hydrogens on C2 and C5 are equivalent to each other, and the two \"lower\" hydrogens are equivalent to each other. This gives two more sets of hydrogens. (3rd and 4th sets)\n*   The carbons C3 and C4 are equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the geminal hydrogens on C3 (and C4) are diastereotopic. The two \"upper\" hydrogens on C3 and C4 are equivalent, and the two \"lower\" hydrogens are equivalent. This provides the final two sets. (5th and 6th sets)\n\nCounting these sets, we have a total of **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<C>>>"
