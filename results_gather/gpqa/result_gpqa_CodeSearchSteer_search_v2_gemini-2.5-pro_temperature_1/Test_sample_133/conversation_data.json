    "To solve this problem, we must calculate the total heat released from two simultaneous reactions: the neutralization of acids with a base and the precipitation of barium sulfate.\n\n### 1. Calculation of Moles of Reactants\n\nFirst, we determine the number of moles for each reactive ion involved.\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ ions from acids:**\n    *   From 0.2 M HCl: 0.500 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.10 mol H⁺\n    *   From 0.3 M H₂SO₄: 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L × 2 H⁺/H₂SO₄ = 0.18 mol H⁺\n    *   **Total moles of H⁺ = 0.10 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol**\n\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ ions from the base:**\n    *   From 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂: 0.200 L × 0.5 mol/L × 2 OH⁻/Ba(OH)₂ = 0.20 mol OH⁻\n    *   **Total moles of OH⁻ = 0.20 mol**\n\n*   **Moles of ions for precipitation:**\n    *   Moles of Ba²⁺ from Ba(OH)₂: 0.200 L × 0.5 mol/L = 0.10 mol Ba²⁺\n    *   Moles of SO₄²⁻ from H₂SO₄: 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol SO₄²⁻\n\n### 2. Calculation of Enthalpy Changes\n\nThe total enthalpy change is the sum of the heat released from neutralization and precipitation.\n\n*   **Enthalpy of Neutralization (ΔH_neut):**\n    The reaction is H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O. We compare the moles of H⁺ (0.28 mol) and OH⁻ (0.20 mol). The OH⁻ ions are the limiting reactant. Therefore, 0.20 moles of water will be formed.\n    The standard enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and a strong base is approximately -13.7 kcal/mol.\n    *   Heat from neutralization = 0.20 mol × (-13.7 kcal/mol) = **-2.74 kcal**\n\n*   **Enthalpy of Precipitation (ΔH_precip):**\n    The reaction is Ba²⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq) → BaSO₄(s). We compare the moles of Ba²⁺ (0.10 mol) and SO₄²⁻ (0.09 mol). The SO₄²⁻ ion is the limiting reactant. Therefore, 0.09 moles of BaSO₄ will precipitate.\n    The enthalpy of precipitation for BaSO₄ is -4.66 kcal/mol.\n    *   Heat from precipitation = 0.09 mol × (-4.66 kcal/mol) = **-0.4194 kcal**\n\n### 3. Total Enthalpy Change\n\nThe total heat evolved is the sum of the heat from both reactions.\n\n*   Total Enthalpy = (Heat from neutralization) + (Heat from precipitation)\n*   Total Enthalpy = -2.74 kcal + (-0.4194 kcal)\n*   Total Enthalpy = **-3.1594 kcal**\n\nThis calculated value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
