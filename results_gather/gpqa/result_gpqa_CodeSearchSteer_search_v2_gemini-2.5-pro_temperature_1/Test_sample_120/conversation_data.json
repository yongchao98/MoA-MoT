    "The reaction in question is the nucleophilic ring-opening of a substituted epoxide by an organocuprate, specifically a Gilman reagent (Me₂CuLi). To determine the correct product, we must apply the established rules for this type of reaction regarding regioselectivity and stereoselectivity.\n\n### **1. Regioselectivity: Site of Attack**\n\nOrganocuprates are soft nucleophiles that react with epoxides via an Sₙ2-like mechanism. A key principle of these reactions is that the nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon atom of the epoxide ring.\n\n*   The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n*   The epoxide ring involves carbons C1 and C6.\n*   Carbon C1 is a tertiary center, as it is bonded to three other carbon atoms (C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   Carbon C6 is a secondary center, bonded to two other carbon atoms (C1 and C5).\n\nGiven the lower steric hindrance at C6, the methyl nucleophile (Me⁻) from the Gilman reagent will selectively attack this position. This attack breaks the C6-O bond, and after an aqueous workup, the oxygen atom attached to C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n\nThis regioselectivity leads to a product with a hydroxyl group and a methyl group on the original C1, and a new methyl group on the original C6. The resulting skeleton is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This eliminates options C and D, which describe a 2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol that would result from an attack at the more hindered C1 position.\n\n### **2. Stereoselectivity: Inversion of Configuration**\n\nThe Sₙ2-like mechanism of epoxide opening by organocuprates involves a backside attack by the nucleophile, which results in the inversion of stereochemistry at the carbon being attacked.\n\n*   The nucleophilic attack occurs at carbon C6.\n*   The problem states that the initial configuration of C6 is (S).\n*   The reaction causes an inversion of this configuration. Therefore, the resulting stereocenter at this position will have an (R) configuration.\n\n### **3. Product Structure and IUPAC Nomenclature**\n\nWe must now determine the IUPAC name for the resulting stereoisomer.\n*   The carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the original C1) is designated as C1 in the final product.\n*   The numbering of the cyclohexane ring proceeds to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. The next substituent is the newly added methyl group at the adjacent carbon (the original C6), so this becomes C2.\n*   The stereocenter that was attacked (original C6) is now C2 in the product.\n*   Since the configuration at C6 inverted from (S) to (R), the product must have a (2R) configuration.\n\nLooking at the remaining options:\n*   A) (1R,**2R**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   B) (1R,**2S**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOnly option A has the required (2R) configuration at the C2 position. The other stereocenters, (1R, 4R, 5R), are consistent with the original reactant's stereochemistry, as they are not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming steps.\n\nTherefore, the reaction produces (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<A>>>"
