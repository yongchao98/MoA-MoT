    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms.\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a trans-alkene. Its reaction with mCPBA is a syn-addition, which results in a trans-epoxide. Because the starting alkene is symmetric, the product is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Acid-catalyzed ring-opening:** The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid opens the epoxide ring. This is an anti-addition, meaning the water molecule attacks from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen. This reaction proceeds with an inversion of stereochemistry at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n    *   The ring-opening of the (4R,5R)-epoxide results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The ring-opening of the (4S,5S)-epoxide also results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (which is identical to (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol).\n3.  **Product of Reaction 1:** The final product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, which is a single, achiral meso compound. This is because the anti-dihydroxylation of a symmetric trans-alkene yields a meso compound.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a cis-alkene. Its syn-addition reaction with mCPBA produces a cis-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is symmetric, the resulting cis-4,5-epoxyoctane is a meso compound.\n2.  **Acid-catalyzed ring-opening:** The acid-catalyzed ring-opening of this meso-epoxide is an anti-addition. The water molecule can attack either of the two carbons of the epoxide with equal probability.\n    *   Attack at one carbon leads to (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon leads to (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 2:** The products, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are a pair of enantiomers. Since they are formed in equal amounts, the product is a racemic mixture.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the single meso compound from Reaction 1 with the racemic mixture of two enantiomers from Reaction 2. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (a meso compound)\n*   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (an enantiomer)\n*   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (an enantiomer)\n\nThe meso compound and the enantiomers are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### Chromatographic Observation\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Therefore, the meso-diol will be separated from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Consequently, the chemist will observe **two peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting pair of enantiomers.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:** This method uses a chiral stationary phase to separate enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diol, allowing them to be separated into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also have a different retention time and will appear as a separate peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chemist will observe **three peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct observation is 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<B>>>"
