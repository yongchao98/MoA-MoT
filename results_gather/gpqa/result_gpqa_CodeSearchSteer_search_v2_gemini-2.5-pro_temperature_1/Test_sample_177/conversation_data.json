    "### Calculation of the Mass Dimension of κ\n\nTo determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ, we analyze the interaction Lagrangian \\(\\mathcal{L}_{int}\\) within the principles of dimensional analysis in quantum field theory. We work in natural units where the reduced Planck constant \\(\\hbar\\) and the speed of light \\(c\\) are set to 1. In this system, mass, energy, and momentum have dimensions of mass, while length and time have dimensions of inverse mass.\n\nThe action \\(S\\), defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) over four-dimensional spacetime, must be dimensionless.\n\\[ S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L} \\]\nSince the spacetime volume element \\(d^4x\\) has a mass dimension of \\([d^4x]_M = -4\\), the Lagrangian density \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) must have a mass dimension of \\([\\mathcal{L}]_M = 4\\). Consequently, any term in the Lagrangian, including the interaction term \\(\\mathcal{L}_{int}\\), must also have a mass dimension of 4.\n\nThe given interaction Lagrangian is:\n\\[ \\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu} \\]\nTo find the mass dimension of \\(\\kappa\\), we first need to establish the mass dimensions of the fields \\(\\psi\\) and \\(F^{\\mu\\nu}\\).\n\n1.  **Mass Dimension of the Fermion Field \\(\\psi\\):** The kinetic term for a Dirac fermion field is \\(\\mathcal{L}_{kin} = \\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m)\\psi\\). For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, considering the term \\(\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu\\psi\\), we have \\([\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\psi]_M + [\\partial_\\mu]_M = 4\\). The derivative \\(\\partial_\\mu\\) has a mass dimension of 1. Since \\([\\bar{\\psi}]_M = [\\psi]_M\\), we get \\(2[\\psi]_M + 1 = 4\\), which leads to \\([\\psi]_M = 3/2\\).\n\n2.  **Mass Dimension of the Field Strength Tensor \\(F^{\\mu\\nu}\\):** The kinetic term for a gauge field is \\(\\mathcal{L}_{kin} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}\\). For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, we require \\(2[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4\\), which means \\([F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 2\\).\n\nNow, we can determine the mass dimension of \\(\\kappa\\) from the interaction term \\(\\mathcal{L}_{int}\\). The term \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is a dimensionless combination of gamma matrices.\n\\[ [\\mathcal{L}_{int}]_M = [\\kappa]_M + [\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\psi]_M + [F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4 \\]\nSubstituting the known mass dimensions:\n\\[ [\\kappa]_M + \\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4 \\]\n\\[ [\\kappa]_M + 3 + 2 = 4 \\]\n\\[ [\\kappa]_M + 5 = 4 \\]\n\\[ [\\kappa]_M = -1 \\]\nTherefore, the mass dimension of the coupling constant \\(\\kappa\\) is -1.\n\n### Renormalizability of the Theory\n\nThe renormalizability of a quantum field theory can be assessed using power-counting. This method relates the renormalizability to the mass dimension of the coupling constants in the theory.\n\n*   If all coupling constants have a **non-negative mass dimension** ([\\(g\\)] \\(\\geq 0\\)), the theory is generally considered **renormalizable** (or super-renormalizable if [\\(g\\)] > 0). This means that infinities that arise in loop calculations can be absorbed into a finite number of redefinitions of the original parameters of the Lagrangian.\n*   If any coupling constant has a **negative mass dimension** ([\\(g\\)] < 0), the theory is **non-renormalizable**. In such theories, an infinite number of new, independent divergent terms are generated at higher orders in perturbation theory, requiring an infinite number of counterterms to absorb the infinities. This deprives the theory of its predictive power.\n\nSince we found that the mass dimension of \\(\\kappa\\) is \\([\\kappa]_M = -1\\), which is negative, the theory described by the interaction Lagrangian \\(\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}\\) is **not renormalizable**.\n\nCombining our findings, the mass dimension of \\(\\kappa\\) is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable.\n\n<<<D>>>"
