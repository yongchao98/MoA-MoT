    "To identify the correct 1H NMR data for the described compound, a step-by-step structural elucidation is necessary based on the provided information.\n\n### **1. Deducing the Molecular Structure**\n\n*   **Parent Structure:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring.\n*   **Total Carbons:** There are 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   A **carbonyl group** (C=O) is present.\n    *   An **aromatic-halogen bond** is present, meaning a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Assembling the Pieces:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain the carbonyl group and the two carbon atoms. The most common and stable structure fitting this description is an acetyl group (-COCH₃). This group has exactly two carbons and a carbonyl.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO.\n\n### **2. Analyzing Isomers and Predicting NMR Spectra**\n\nA di-substituted benzene ring can exist as three possible isomers: ortho (1,2-), meta (1,3-), or para (1,4-). The 1H NMR splitting pattern is highly dependent on this substitution.\n\n*   **Ortho- and Meta-Isomers:** These isomers are unsymmetrical. They would show complex splitting patterns in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm), with four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons.\n*   **Para-Isomer:** This isomer (e.g., 4'-haloacetophenone) is symmetrical about the axis passing through both substituents. This symmetry results in a much simpler 1H NMR spectrum:\n    *   The two protons adjacent to the acetyl group are chemically equivalent.\n    *   The two protons adjacent to the halogen are also chemically equivalent.\n    *   This leads to two distinct signals in the aromatic region, each appearing as a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent proton. Each doublet would integrate to 2H.\n    *   The methyl group (-CH₃) of the acetyl substituent is isolated and has no adjacent protons, so it will appear as a singlet, integrating to 3H.\n\n### **3. Evaluating the NMR Data Options**\n\nLet's compare the predicted spectrum for the para-isomer with the given choices:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2 protons, and a singlet for 3 protons. This pattern perfectly matches the expected spectrum for a **para-haloacetophenone**. The reported chemical shifts are also consistent; for example, the 1H NMR spectrum for 4'-Bromoacetophenone is reported as δ 7.82 (d, 2H), 7.61(d, 2H), 2.57 (s, 3H). Similarly, 4'-Chloroacetophenone shows signals at δ 7.89 (d, 2H), 7.43 (d, 2H), 2.59 (s, 3H).\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde, not a ketone. This contradicts the acetyl group structure. Also, a 3H singlet for the methyl group is absent.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This data does not correspond to a di-substituted benzene ring. The signals and splitting patterns are inconsistent with an aromatic structure.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm), indicating it is not an aromatic compound.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only option that correctly represents the 1H NMR data for the described compound (a para-haloacetophenone) is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
