    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where R is the star's radius, T is its effective surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio:** We want to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star 1 (L₁) to that of Star 2 (L₂):\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    The constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, leaving:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that the radius of Star 1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star 2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). Therefore, the ratio (R₁/R₂) is 1.5.\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio (Wien's Law and Doppler Effect):**\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law** states that the effective temperature (T) of a black body is inversely proportional to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (λ_emitted), i.e., T ∝ 1/λ_emitted.\n    *   The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared brightest* are the same. This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs), which is affected by the star's motion due to the Doppler effect.\n    *   The relationship between the emitted wavelength (λ_emitted) and the observed wavelength (λ_obs) due to a radial velocity (v) is given by the formula for the relativistic Doppler effect:\n        λ_obs = λ_emitted * √[(1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c)]\n        where c is the speed of light.\n\n5.  **Applying the Doppler Effect to Find Temperatures:**\n    *   We are given that λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.\n    *   For Star 1, the radial velocity v₁ = 0, so its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted wavelength: λ_obs,1 = λ_emitted,1.\n    *   For Star 2, the radial velocity v₂ = 700 km/s. So, λ_obs,2 = λ_emitted,2 * √[(1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c)].\n    *   Since λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2, we have: λ_emitted,1 = λ_emitted,2 * √[(1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c)].\n    *   From Wien's Law, T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1.\n    *   Substituting the expression for λ_emitted,1, we get:\n        T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,2 / (λ_emitted,2 * √[(1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c)])\n        T₁/T₂ = 1 / √[(1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c)] = √[(1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c)]\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Now substitute this temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n        L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n        L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (√[(1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c)])⁴\n        L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [(1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c)]²\n    *   Now, we plug in the values:\n        v₂ = 700 km/s = 7 x 10⁵ m/s\n        c (speed of light) ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s\n        v₂/c = (7 x 10⁵) / (3 x 10⁸) ≈ 0.002333\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 * [(1 - 0.002333) / (1 + 0.002333)]²\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 * [0.997667 / 1.002333]²\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 * (0.995345)²\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 * 0.99071\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23. The information about the mass of the stars is not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
