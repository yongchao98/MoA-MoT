    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical transformations to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (a norbornadiene derivative, let's call it NBD-OtBu) and 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium iodide (NaI) at elevated temperature.\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** The reagent 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a precursor for a reactive diene. Treatment with sodium iodide causes reductive debromination to form exocyclic double bonds, yielding 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene. This molecule is a vinylogous o-xylylene and is a highly reactive diene for Diels-Alder reactions. For simplicity, we can consider this diene to be functionally equivalent to the more common o-xylylene, as they share the same reactive diene system and symmetry, which is key for the final analysis.\n*   The norbornadiene derivative (NBD-OtBu) acts as a dienophile and has two double bonds. Since two equivalents of the diene precursor are used, a double Diels-Alder reaction occurs. One molecule of the reactive diene adds to each of the two double bonds of the norbornadiene.\n*   **Product 1:** The resulting product is a large, symmetric (possessing a C2v symmetry axis, ignoring the freely rotating tert-butyl group) polycyclic molecule, which is the double *exo*-adduct of the diene onto the norbornadiene frame, with a tert-butoxy group at the C7 bridge position.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard acid-catalyzed cleavage of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (-OtBu) is converted into a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Product 2:** The structure is identical to Product 1, but with a C7-OH group instead of the C7-OtBu group. The overall symmetry of the carbon skeleton is maintained.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reagents:** SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO (Parikh-Doering oxidation).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a mild oxidation of a secondary alcohol to a ketone. The C7-OH group is oxidized to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **Product 3:** This is the 7-keto derivative of the double Diels-Alder adduct. This molecule possesses a C2v symmetry, with one symmetry plane passing through the C=O group.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is heated to 150°C.\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** Diels-Alder adducts are known to undergo a reversible reaction called the retro-Diels-Alder reaction upon heating. Given that Product 3 is a symmetric double adduct, heating will cause one of the two identical fused ring systems to be eliminated as the diene (o-xylylene or its vinylogous analogue). This reaction regenerates one of the double bonds of the original norbornadiene core. A full double retro-Diels-Alder followed by decarbonylation to form benzene is not supported by the answer choices.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is the mono-adduct ketone. Its structure consists of a norborn-5-en-7-one core, which has a double bond at the C5-C6 position and a ketone at C7. At the C2-C3 position, the ring system from the first Diels-Alder reaction remains fused.\n\n**Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the symmetry of Product 4.\n\n*   **Structure:** A norbornen-7-one core with a large, fused ring system attached at the C2 and C3 positions.\n*   **Symmetry:** While the static, lowest-energy conformation of this molecule might be asymmetric (C1 symmetry), polycyclic molecules like this often undergo rapid conformational changes (e.g., ring flipping within the fused adduct). In the context of NMR spectroscopy, this rapid interconversion often results in a time-averaged structure with higher symmetry. For Product 4, it is reasonable to assume an effective Cₛ plane of symmetry that passes through the C7-ketone, the C1 and C4 bridgehead atoms, and bisects the C5=C6 double bond and the C2-C3 bond where the adduct is fused.\n\nAssuming this Cₛ symmetry, we can count the sets of equivalent hydrogen atoms:\n\n1.  **Bridgehead H at C1:** Lies on the symmetry plane. It is in a unique environment. (1 type)\n2.  **Bridgehead H at C4:** Also on the plane, but in a different environment from H1 (it is closer to the double bond). (1 type)\n3.  **Vinyl H atoms at C5 and C6:** These two hydrogens are located on the double bond and are mirror images of each other. Thus, they are chemically equivalent. (1 type)\n4.  **Bridge H atoms at C2 and C3:** These hydrogens are at the junction with the fused ring. They are also mirror images and are equivalent. (1 type)\n5.  **Aromatic H atoms:** The fused ring contains a benzene ring (from the o-xylylene). The symmetry plane bisects this ring, making the four aromatic hydrogens equivalent in two pairs. (2 types)\n6.  **Aliphatic H atoms in the adduct:** The part of the adduct formed from the =CH₂ groups of the diene consists of two -CH₂- groups. These two groups are mirror images of each other. Within each -CH₂- group, the two hydrogens (one pointing 'exo' and one 'endo' relative to the norbornene system) are diastereotopic and thus distinct. However, the two 'exo' hydrogens are equivalent by symmetry, as are the two 'endo' hydrogens. This gives two more types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n\nSumming these up, the total number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments is:\n1 (H1) + 1 (H4) + 1 (H5/H6 pair) + 1 (H2/H3 pair) + 2 (aromatic pairs) + 2 (aliphatic pairs) = **8** types.\n\nTherefore, there are 8 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
