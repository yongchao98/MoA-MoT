    "The physical phenomenon described is known as Larmor precession. Initially, the spin-1/2 particle has its magnetic moment aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in a spin-up eigenstate with respect to the Z-axis.\n\nWhen the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the spin is no longer in an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. The new Hamiltonian is given by H = -**μ** · **B** = -γB*S*y, where **μ** is the magnetic moment operator, **B** is the magnetic field, γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, and *S*y is the spin operator for the y-component.\n\nThe spin vector, which is initially pointing along the Z-axis, will begin to precess around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis). The expectation value of the spin's components will evolve in time according to the Ehrenfest theorem or by solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation.\n\nThe equation of motion for the expectation value of the spin vector <**S**> is d<**S**>/dt = γ(<**S**> × **B**). Since **B** is in the Y direction, this leads to the following set of coupled differential equations for the expectation values of the spin components:\n\n*   d<*S*x>/dt = γB<*S*z>\n*   d<*S*y>/dt = 0\n*   d<*S*z>/dt = -γB<*S*x>\n\nDifferentiating the equation for <*S*z> with respect to time gives:\nd²<*S*z>/dt² = -γB(d<*S*x>/dt) = -γB(γB<*S*z>) = -(γB)²<*S*z>\n\nThis is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator with an angular frequency ω = γB. Therefore, the expectation value of the z-component of the spin, and consequently the z-component of the magnetic moment, oscillates with an angular frequency of γB. This frequency is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nThe initial condition is that the spin is aligned along +Z, so at t=0, <*S*z> has its maximum value of ħ/2, and <*S*x> is zero. The solution for the z-component is <*S*z>(t) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt). The oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t in the argument of the cosine function.\n\nThus, the oscillation frequency is γB.\n\n<<<C>>>"
