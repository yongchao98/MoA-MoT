    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at both points in the titration.\n\n1.  **Dilution of Acetic Acid:** First, the initial acetic acid solution is diluted. We can use the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2 to find the new concentration (M2).\n    *   M1 (initial concentration) = 0.05 M\n    *   V1 (initial volume) = 20.00 cm³\n    *   V2 (final volume) = 20.00 cm³ acetic acid + 20.00 cm³ water = 40.00 cm³\n    *   M2 = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M.\n    This is the concentration of the acetic acid solution that will be titrated.\n\n2.  **pH at 25% Titration:** At this stage, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has reacted with the NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻). This creates a buffer solution. The pH of a buffer can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n    *   **Equation:** pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n    *   First, we calculate the pKa from the given Ka value (1.85 x 10⁻⁵). Some sources may list slightly different Ka values for acetic acid, but we will use the one provided.\n        *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n    *   At 25% titration, the ratio of the conjugate base [A⁻] to the remaining acid [HA] is 25/75, or 1/3.\n    *   Now, plug these values into the equation:\n        *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n        *   pH = 4.73 - log(3)\n        *   pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477\n        *   **pH ≈ 4.26**\n\n3.  **pH at the Equivalence Point:** The equivalence point is reached when all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, converting it completely into its conjugate base, sodium acetate. The pH at this point is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion in water.\n    *   **Moles of Acetic Acid:** Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.040 L = 0.001 moles.\n    *   **Volume of NaOH added:** At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH = moles of acetic acid.\n        *   Volume = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 moles / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L or 10.00 cm³.\n    *   **Total Volume:** 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ or 0.050 L.\n    *   **Concentration of Acetate ([A⁻]):** Concentration = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n    *   **Hydrolysis of Acetate:** The acetate ion reacts with water, producing hydroxide ions (OH⁻), which makes the solution basic.\n        *   A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate, which can be found from the Ka of acetic acid and the ion-product constant for water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C).\n        *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    *   We can now calculate the concentration of OH⁻.\n        *   Kb = [HA][OH⁻] / [A⁻] ≈ [OH⁻]² / [A⁻]\n        *   [OH⁻]² ≈ Kb × [A⁻] = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02\n        *   [OH⁻]² ≈ 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n        *   [OH⁻] ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n    *   Calculate the pOH:\n        *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   Finally, calculate the pH:\n        *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48\n        *   **pH ≈ 8.52**\n\nBased on these calculations, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52.\n\n<<<C>>>"
