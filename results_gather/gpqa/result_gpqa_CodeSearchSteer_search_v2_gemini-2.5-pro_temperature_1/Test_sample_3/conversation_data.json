    "In a universe where magnetic monopoles (isolated north or south poles) exist, two of Maxwell's equations would be modified to become more symmetrical with their counterparts.\n\nThe two affected equations are:\n\n*   **Gauss's Law for Magnetism (related to the divergence of the magnetic field):** In our universe, this law states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero (∇ ⋅ B = 0), which mathematically means there are no magnetic sources or sinks—no monopoles. If monopoles existed, they would act as sources of the magnetic field, so this equation would change to show that the divergence of the magnetic field is proportional to the magnetic charge density (∇ ⋅ B = μ₀ρₘ).\n*   **Faraday's Law of Induction (related to the circulation of the electric field):** This law describes how a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field (∇ × E = -∂B/∂t). In a universe with magnetic monopoles, a moving magnetic monopole would constitute a \"magnetic current.\" This magnetic current would also produce a circulating electric field, adding a new term to the equation (∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - Jₘ).\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that the equations related to the divergence of the magnetic field and the circulation of the electric field would be different.\n\n<<<A>>>"
