    "To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, ⟨Sy⟩, for an electron in a given spin state, we use the principles of quantum mechanics.\n\nThe spin state is given by the vector |χ⟩ = (3i, 4). In column vector notation, this is:\n|χ⟩ =  [ 3i ]\n      [ 4  ]\n\nThe spin operator along the y-direction, S_y, is defined in terms of the Pauli matrix σ_y and the reduced Planck constant ħ:\nS_y = (ħ/2)σ_y\n\nGiven the matrix for σ_y:\nσ_y = [ 0  -i ]\n      [ i   0 ]\n\nThe expectation value ⟨Sy⟩ for a state |χ⟩ is calculated using the formula:\n⟨Sy⟩ = ⟨χ|S_y|χ⟩ / ⟨χ|χ⟩\n\nHere's a step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Find the bra vector ⟨χ|**: The bra ⟨χ| is the conjugate transpose of the ket |χ⟩.\n    ⟨χ| = [ -3i  4 ]\n\n2.  **Calculate the inner product ⟨χ|χ⟩**: This is needed for normalization.\n    ⟨χ|χ⟩ = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = -9(i²) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25.\n\n3.  **Calculate the action of the operator S_y on the state |χ⟩**:\n    S_y|χ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ 0  -i ] * [ 3i ]\n                   [ i   0 ]   [ 4  ]\n    S_y|χ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) ]\n                   [ (i)(3i) + (0)(4)  ]\n    S_y|χ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ -4i ]\n                   [ 3i² ]\n    S_y|χ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ -4i ]\n                   [ -3  ]\n\n4.  **Calculate the full matrix element ⟨χ|S_y|χ⟩**:\n    ⟨χ|S_y|χ⟩ = [ -3i  4 ] * (ħ/2) * [ -4i ]\n                                  [ -3  ]\n    ⟨χ|S_y|χ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [(-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3)]\n    ⟨χ|S_y|χ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [12i² - 12]\n    ⟨χ|S_y|χ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-12 - 12]\n    ⟨χ|S_y|χ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-24]\n    ⟨χ|S_y|χ⟩ = -12ħ\n\n5.  **Compute the final expectation value**:\n    ⟨Sy⟩ = (-12ħ) / 25 = -12ħ/25\n\nThis result matches the calculation found in a similar solved problem.\n\nTherefore, the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction is -12ħ/25.\n\n<<<B>>>"
