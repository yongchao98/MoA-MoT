    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2.\n\n### Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong intensity bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a clear indication of a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands correspond to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of the N-H bonds.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O) stretching vibration. The frequency is typical for an ester.\n\nCombining these observations, the compound is likely a primary amine containing an ester group.\n\n### Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The molecular formula C9H11NO2 has a degree of unsaturation of 5. (Calculated as: 9 - 11/2 + 1/2 + 1 = 5). A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation, and a carbonyl group (C=O) accounts for one, which fits the data.\n\n*   **Signal-by-Signal Analysis:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal is a triplet and integrates to three protons. This pattern is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal is a quartet and integrates to two protons. This is typical for a methylene group (-CH₂) next to a methyl group (-CH₃). The chemical shift of ~4.5 ppm indicates that this methylene group is attached to an oxygen atom (-O-CH₂-). Together, the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an ethoxy group (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂) attached to an aromatic ring. The broadness is due to chemical exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are both doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons. This pattern is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is due to protons adjacent to an electron-donating group (the -NH₂ group), while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is due to protons adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester's carbonyl group).\n\n### Structure Determination and Evaluation of Options\n\nAssembling the identified fragments—a primary amine, an ethoxy group, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring—leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is fully consistent with all the spectroscopic data analyzed. It has a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring. The predicted chemical shifts and IR frequencies match the provided data.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amine (an amide), which would show only a single N-H stretch in the IR, and its C=O stretch would be at a lower frequency. This contradicts the IR data.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This structure has a propionyloxy group (-O-CO-CH₂CH₃), not an ethoxy group. The methylene protons of the propionyl group would appear as a quartet around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide with a 1,3- (meta) substitution pattern on the benzene ring. The NMR would show a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two clean doublets.\n\nTherefore, the data unequivocally identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
