    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the original decay (2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V):**\n    *   This is a multi-body decay, as the final state has more than two particles (two B, two E, and two V).\n    *   In a multi-body decay, the total energy released (the Q-value) is shared among the final particles.\n    *   This sharing of energy results in a *continuous* energy spectrum for any of the decay products. The problem statement correctly identifies that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous.\n    *   The endpoint of this spectrum represents the maximum possible combined energy of the two E particles. This maximum is achieved when the other light particles (the two V particles) carry away a minimal amount of energy (approaching zero).\n\n2.  **Analyze the variant decay (2A -> 2B + 2E + M):**\n    *   This is also a multi-body decay (two B, two E, and one M).\n    *   Therefore, the total energy of the outgoing E particles will also be shared with the particle M.\n    *   This means the energy spectrum of the E particles will remain *continuous*, as the energy can be distributed between the E particles and the M particle in an infinite number of ways. This eliminates options A and D, which state the spectrum becomes discrete.\n\n3.  **Compare the endpoints of the energy spectra:**\n    *   The total energy released in the decay, known as the Q-value, is determined by the difference in rest mass between the initial and final particles: `Q_value = (m_initial - m_final) * c^2`.\n    *   Let `Q_total` be the energy released from the conversion of the heavy nucleons: `Q_total = (2*m_A - 2*m_B) * c^2`. This value is the same for both decays. This `Q_total` is the total energy available to be converted into the rest mass and kinetic energy of the emitted light particles.\n    *   **For the original decay (2V):** The total available kinetic energy is `KE_total_1 = Q_total - 2*m_E*c^2 - 2*m_V*c^2`. The endpoint of the E particle spectrum, `Endpoint_1`, occurs when the two V particles have zero kinetic energy, so the two E particles take all the available kinetic energy: `Endpoint_1 = KE_total_1`.\n    *   **For the variant decay (M):** The total available kinetic energy is `KE_total_2 = Q_total - 2*m_E*c^2 - m_M*c^2`. Since particle M is massless (`m_M = 0`), this simplifies to `KE_total_2 = Q_total - 2*m_E*c^2`. The endpoint `Endpoint_2` occurs when M has zero kinetic energy: `Endpoint_2 = KE_total_2`.\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   `Endpoint_1 = Q_total - 2*m_E*c^2 - 2*m_V*c^2`\n        *   `Endpoint_2 = Q_total - 2*m_E*c^2`\n    *   Since V is a massive particle (`m_V > 0`), the term `2*m_V*c^2` is positive. Therefore, `Endpoint_2` is greater than `Endpoint_1`. The endpoint of the energy spectrum increases.\n\n4.  **Consider the shape of the spectrum:**\n    *   The distribution of energy among the final particles depends on the phase space available, which is different when there are three light final particles (2E + M) compared to four (2E + 2V).\n    *   This change in phase space leads to a different distribution of energies, meaning the shape of the continuous spectrum is adjusted. In the analogous real-world case of Majoron-emitting decay, the spectrum is \"skewed\" toward higher energies compared to the standard two-neutrino decay.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn the variant decay, the energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles remains continuous, but its shape is adjusted, and the endpoint value increases.\n\n<<<C>>>"
