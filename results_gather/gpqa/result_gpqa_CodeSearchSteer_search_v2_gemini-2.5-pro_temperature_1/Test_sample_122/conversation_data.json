    "This problem is a classic example of special relativity, specifically involving the concept of time dilation. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Identify the Frames of Reference**\n\n*   **Galaxy's Reference Frame:** This is considered the \"stationary\" frame. We want to find the distance traveled as measured by an observer in this frame.\n*   **Ejecta's Reference Frame:** This is the \"moving\" frame. The time of 50 seconds is measured in this frame, making it the *proper time*.\n\n**2. Understand Time Dilation**\n\nAccording to Einstein's theory of special relativity, time for a moving object (as measured by a stationary observer) passes more slowly than for the stationary observer. This effect, called time dilation, is significant at speeds approaching the speed of light. The time interval measured in the stationary frame (Galaxy) will be longer than the time interval measured in the moving frame (ejecta).\n\n**3. The Calculation**\n\nThe solution involves three main steps:\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n    The Lorentz factor, γ (gamma), determines the magnitude of relativistic effects. The formula is:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n    Where:\n    *   `v` is the relative velocity = 60,000 km/s\n    *   `c` is the speed of light ≈ 300,000 km/s\n    First, find the ratio v/c:\n    v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2\n    Now, plug this into the Lorentz factor formula:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96\n    γ ≈ 1.02062\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the Dilated Time (Δt)**\n    The time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt) is found by multiplying the proper time (Δt₀) by the Lorentz factor.\n    Δt = γ * Δt₀\n    Where:\n    *   γ ≈ 1.02062\n    *   Δt₀ = 50 s\n    Δt ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s\n    So, while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy's frame measures about 51.031 seconds.\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame**\n    Finally, calculate the distance the ejecta travels from the perspective of the Galaxy. Use the standard distance formula with the dilated time calculated in the previous step.\n    Distance = velocity × time\n    Distance = v * Δt\n    Distance ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s\n    Distance ≈ 3,061,860 km\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,860 km. Comparing this result with the given choices:\n\n*   A) 2,940,000 km\n*   B) 2,880,000 km\n*   C) 3,000,000 km (This would be the incorrect, non-relativistic answer)\n*   D) 3,060,000 km\n\nThe calculated value is extremely close to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
