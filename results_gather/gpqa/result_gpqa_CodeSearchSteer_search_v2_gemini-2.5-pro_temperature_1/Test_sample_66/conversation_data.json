    "The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring specific eigenvalues for the z-component of the orbital angular momentum for two electrons.\n\n1.  **Initial State:** The two-electron system is in a coupled angular momentum state `|l, m> = |2, -1>`. This means the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l=2`, and the quantum number for its z-component is `m=-1`.\n2.  **Individual Particles:** The electrons are in a p-orbital, so their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are `l₁=1` and `l₂=1`.\n3.  **Measurement:** A measurement of the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, `L₁z` and `L₂z`, is performed.\n4.  **Desired Outcome:** We want to find the probability of measuring the eigenvalue `-ħ` for *both* `L₁z` and `L₂z`. This corresponds to the measurement outcome where the individual magnetic quantum numbers are `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n\nThe z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This is true for both the operators (`L_z = L₁z + L₂z`) and their corresponding quantum numbers (`m = m₁ + m₂`).\n\nIn the initial state, the system has a definite total magnetic quantum number `m = -1`. This means that any measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum will yield `-1ħ`. Consequently, if we measure the individual components `L₁z` and `L₂z`, the sum of their outcomes `m₁` and `m₂` must equal the total `m`.\n\nSo, the condition `m₁ + m₂ = -1` must be satisfied.\n\nThe question asks for the probability of the outcome `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`. Let's check if this outcome is possible:\n`m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2`\n\nSince the required sum `(-2)` does not equal the system's total magnetic quantum number `(-1)`, this outcome is physically impossible. The state `|l=2, m=-1>` has no component corresponding to the state where `m₁=-1` and `m₂=-1`. The probability of measuring an impossible outcome is zero.\n\nTo be more formal, the probability `P` is the square of the absolute value of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient that connects the initial and final states:\nP = |<l₁, m₁; l₂, m₂ | l, m>|²\nP = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>|²\n\nClebsch-Gordan coefficients are zero unless `m = m₁ + m₂`. Here, `m = -1` and `m₁ + m₂ = -2`. Since `-1 ≠ -2`, the coefficient is zero, and the probability is zero.\n\n<<<A>>>"
