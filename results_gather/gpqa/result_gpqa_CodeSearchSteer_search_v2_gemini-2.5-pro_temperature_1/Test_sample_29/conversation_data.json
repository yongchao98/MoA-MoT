    "A textile dye with an extensively conjugated pi-electron system that emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV will absorb red light.\n\nWhen a molecule absorbs light, its electrons are promoted to a higher energy level. The molecule then often relaxes to a slightly lower energy state before emitting light as the electrons return to their ground state. This means the emitted light has less energy, and therefore a longer wavelength, than the absorbed light. The color we perceive an object to be is the complement of the color of light it absorbs.\n\nFirst, the wavelength of the emitted light is calculated from its energy using the formula λ = hc/E, where 'h' is Planck's constant, 'c' is the speed of light, and 'E' is the energy. A convenient form of this equation is λ (in nm) ≈ 1240 / E (in eV).\n\nFor the given energy of 2.3393 eV:\nλ ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 eV ≈ 530.07 nm\n\nA wavelength of approximately 530 nm corresponds to green light in the visible spectrum.\n\nThe color of light absorbed by the compound is the complementary color of the light it emits. The complementary color of green is red. Therefore, the organic compound absorbs red light.\n\n<<<A>>>"
