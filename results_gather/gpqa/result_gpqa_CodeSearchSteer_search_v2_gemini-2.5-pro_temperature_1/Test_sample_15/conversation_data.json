    "A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This analysis will determine the chirality of each compound listed.\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule is an alkene. Due to the double bond, the atoms directly involved are in the same plane. The molecule has a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`, which specify the absolute configuration at two chiral centers. Since a specific enantiomer is named, the compound is chiral and thus optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule possesses two chiral centers. However, this particular stereoisomer has a plane of symmetry, which makes it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is a diastereomer of the meso form. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry, and its mirror image, the `(2S,3S)` form, is non-superimposable. Therefore, as a single enantiomer, it is chiral and optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The `(R)` designation indicates a specific configuration at a chiral center (the carbon bonded to the hydroxyl group). The presence of this single, specified chiral center makes the molecule a specific enantiomer, which is chiral and optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** This compound, also known as cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, has hydroxyl groups on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement results in a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral and optically inactive despite the presence of stereocenters.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** An examination of this ketone's structure reveals no chiral centers. The carbon atom in the butyl chain attached to two identical methyl groups is not chiral, and no other atom meets the criteria. The molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>"
