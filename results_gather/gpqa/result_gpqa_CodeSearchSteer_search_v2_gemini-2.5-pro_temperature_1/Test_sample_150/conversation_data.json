    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the principles of quantum mechanics for measuring an observable. The process involves these main steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the state vector and the observable operator.**\n    *   The state of the system, `|ψ⟩`, is given by the column matrix:\n        ```\n        [-1]\n        [ 2]\n        [ 1]\n        ```\n    *   The observable, `P`, is represented by the matrix:\n        ```\n        [ 0,   1/√2,  0   ]\n        [ 1/√2, 0,   1/√2 ]\n        [ 0,   1/√2,  0   ]\n        ```\n\n2.  **Find the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of the observable `P`.**\n    The possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the observable's operator. We are interested in the outcome of 0. First, we must confirm that 0 is indeed an eigenvalue of `P` by solving the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n    ```\n    det([ -λ,  1/√2,   0   ])\n        ([ 1/√2, -λ,   1/√2 ]) = -λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ = λ(1 - λ²) = 0\n        ([  0,   1/√2,  -λ   ])\n    ```\n    The eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, and λ = -1. Since 0 is an eigenvalue, a measurement of the observable `P` can yield the value 0.\n\n3.  **Determine the eigenvector for the eigenvalue of interest (λ = 0).**\n    We need to find the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` that corresponds to the eigenvalue λ = 0 by solving the equation `P|v₀⟩ = 0|v₀⟩`.\n    ```\n    [ 0,   1/√2,  0   ] [x]   [0]\n    [ 1/√2, 0,   1/√2 ] [y] = [0]\n    [ 0,   1/√2,  0   ] [z]   [0]\n    ```\n    This matrix equation gives us a system of linear equations:\n    *   `y/√2 = 0`  ⇒ `y = 0`\n    *   `x/√2 + z/√2 = 0` ⇒ `x = -z`\n    The eigenvector is of the form `(x, 0, -x)`. To make this a unit vector (normalize it), we can choose `x = 1/√2`, which gives the normalized eigenvector:\n    `|v₀⟩` = `(1/√2, 0, -1/√2)`\n\n4.  **Normalize the state vector `|ψ⟩`.**\n    The probability calculation requires the state vector to be normalized. The squared norm of `|ψ⟩` is:\n    `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n    The normalized state vector, `|ψ_norm⟩`, is:\n    `|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]`\n\n5.  **Calculate the probability.**\n    The probability of measuring a specific eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the inner product (or projection) of the normalized state vector onto the corresponding normalized eigenvector. This is known as the Born rule.\n    `Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n    For the eigenvalue 0:\n    `Prob(0) = |⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n    First, calculate the inner product `⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩`:\n    `⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2] · (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]`\n    `= (1/√6) * [(1/√2)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1/√2)(1)]`\n    `= (1/√6) * [-1/√2 - 1/√2]`\n    `= (1/√6) * [-2/√2]`\n    `= (1/√6) * [-√2]`\n    `= -√2/√6 = -√(1/3)`\n\n    Now, square the magnitude of this result to find the probability:\n    `Prob(0) = |-√(1/3)|² = 1/3`\n\nAn alternative method is to use unnormalized vectors and apply the formula:\n`Prob(0) = |⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v₀|v₀⟩⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\n*   `⟨v₀|ψ⟩ = (1, 0, -1) · (-1, 2, 1) = -1 + 0 - 1 = -2`\n*   `|⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² = (-2)² = 4`\n*   `⟨v₀|v₀⟩ = 1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2`\n*   `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 6`\n*   `Prob(0) = 4 / (2 * 6) = 4 / 12 = 1/3`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\nThe probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 is 1/3.\n\n<<<A>>>"
