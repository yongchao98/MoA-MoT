    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula is:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    Where:\n    *   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n    *   R_star is the radius of the star.\n    *   A is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n    *   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n2.  **Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n    We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))\n    T_eq2 = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\n\n    Since the problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are the same) and have the same albedo (A), these terms cancel out when we take the ratio:\n    (T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\n    (T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\n3.  **Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity**\n    The problem provides the Doppler shifts caused by the planets, which relate to the star's radial velocity (RV) amplitude, K. For a circular orbit, the RV amplitude is given by:\n    K = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n    Where:\n    *   M_p is the planet's mass.\n    *   M_star is the star's mass.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n    *   Since the planets were detected via the transit method, we assume their orbits are edge-on (inclination i ≈ 90°), so sin(i) ≈ 1.\n\n    We can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis, 'a':\n    K² = (M_p² * G) / (M_star * a)\n    a = (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1)**\n    Using the formula for 'a', we can find the ratio a2 / a1:\n    a2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K2²)] / [(G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K1²)]\n\n    The terms G and M_star cancel out:\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2² / K2²) / (M_p1² / K1²)\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n\n5.  **Substitute the Given Values**\n    We are given:\n    *   M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n    *   M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n    *   The induced Doppler shift for Planet1 (Δλ₁) is 0.03 Å.\n    *   The induced Doppler shift for Planet2 (Δλ₂) is 0.04 Å.\n\n    The radial velocity amplitude K is directly proportional to the Doppler shift Δλ (since K = c * Δλ / λ, where c and λ are constants). Therefore, the ratio of the RV amplitudes is:\n    K1 / K2 = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4\n\n    Now substitute the mass and K ratios into the equation for a2 / a1:\n    a2 / a1 = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\n    a2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n    a2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n6.  **Final Calculation of the Temperature Ratio**\n    Now we can calculate the final temperature ratio using the result from step 2:\n    (T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n    (T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(225 / 784)\n    (T_eq1 / T_eq2) = 15 / 28\n    (T_eq1 / T_eq2) ≈ 0.5357\n\nThe ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>"
