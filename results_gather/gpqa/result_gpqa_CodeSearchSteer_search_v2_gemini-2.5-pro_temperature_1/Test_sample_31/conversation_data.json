    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to determine the total energy of the specified nucleus.\n\n### 1. Identify the Nucleus (X)\n\n*   The element is Lithium (Li), which has an atomic number (Z) of 3, meaning it contains 3 protons.\n*   The problem states that the nucleus has 3 neutrons (N).\n*   The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons: A = Z + N = 3 + 3 = 6.\n*   Therefore, the nucleus X is Lithium-6 (⁶Li).\n\n### 2. Determine the Rest Mass (m₀) and Rest Energy (m₀c²)\n\n*   The atomic mass of a Lithium-6 atom is 6.015122 atomic mass units (amu). For high-energy physics calculations, the mass of the atom is a very close approximation to the mass of the nucleus, as the mass of the electrons is negligible.\n*   The rest mass is m₀ = 6.015122 amu.\n*   To find the rest energy, we convert this mass to energy units, typically Giga-electron Volts (GeV). The conversion factor is approximately 1 amu = 931.5 MeV/c².\n*   Rest Energy (m₀c²) = 6.015122 amu × 931.5 MeV/amu\n*   Rest Energy (m₀c²) ≈ 5603.1 MeV ≈ 5.6031 GeV\n\n### 3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)\n\n*   The total energy (E) of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by the equation E = γ * m₀c², where γ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   The Lorentz factor is calculated based on the particle's speed (v) relative to the speed of light (c): γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n*   The speed is given as v = 0.96c.\n*   First, we calculate the term v²/c²: (0.96c)² / c² = 0.96² = 0.9216.\n*   Now, we calculate γ:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\n    γ = 1 / √0.0784\n    γ = 1 / 0.28\n    γ ≈ 3.5714\n\n### 4. Calculate the Total Energy (E)\n\n*   Using the formula E = γ * m₀c²:\n*   E ≈ 3.5714 × 5.6031 GeV\n*   E ≈ 20.011 GeV\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated total energy is approximately 20.011 GeV. Comparing this result to the given options:\nA) 23.069 GeV\nB) 21.419 GeV\nC) 18.475 GeV\nD) 20.132 GeV\n\nThe calculated value of 20.011 GeV is closest to option D, 20.132 GeV. The minor difference (~0.6%) can be attributed to the use of slightly different physical constants (e.g., a more precise value for the mass of ⁶Li or the speed v) in the source of the problem. Given the choices, 20.132 GeV is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
