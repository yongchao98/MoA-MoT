    "Upon examining the provided physical theories, the one that does not inherently require regularization at high energies (ultraviolet divergences) is Superstring Theory.\n\n*   **Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)** and **Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)** are both quantum field theories. A key feature of these theories is the appearance of infinite values in calculations for high-energy processes, a problem known as ultraviolet divergence. To resolve this and make meaningful predictions, a procedure involving regularization and renormalization is necessary. Regularization artificially makes the calculations finite, and renormalization then absorbs the infinities into the definitions of physical quantities like mass and charge.\n\n*   **Classical Electrodynamics**, while not a quantum theory, also suffers from a high-energy (or short-distance) problem. Specifically, the self-energy of a point-like charged particle, such as an electron, is infinite. This divergence implies that a point particle would have infinite inertia, which is unphysical. This issue is sometimes addressed by regularizing the theory, for instance by assuming the particle is a tiny, extended object rather than a true point.\n\n*   **Superstring Theory** is believed to be free from ultraviolet divergences. Unlike point particles in quantum field theory, strings are extended one-dimensional objects. This inherent \"fuzziness\" smooths out interactions at very short distances (high energies), thus avoiding the infinities that plague other theories. For this reason, superstring theory is considered to be UV-finite and does not need regularization for high-energy processes.\n\n<<<A>>>"
