    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the relationship:\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between parallax and distance.** The parallax of a star (plx) is inversely proportional to its distance (r) from us. This relationship can be expressed as:\n\n    r = 1/plx\n\n    This means that a larger parallax angle corresponds to a smaller distance, and vice-versa.\n\n2.  **Use the given information.** The problem states that the number of stars (let's call it N) varies with parallax as 1/plx⁵. This can be written as a proportionality:\n\n    N ∝ 1/plx⁵\n\n    This represents the cumulative number of stars observed with a parallax greater than or equal to a certain value.\n\n3.  **Express the number of stars in terms of distance.** To see how the number of stars changes with distance, we can substitute the parallax-distance relationship (plx = 1/r) into the given proportionality:\n\n    N ∝ 1/(1/r)⁵\n    N ∝ r⁵\n\n    This tells us that the total number of stars up to a distance *r* is proportional to the fifth power of the distance.\n\n4.  **Determine the number of stars per unit range of distance.** The question asks how the number of stars *per unit range of distance* changes with r. This is equivalent to finding the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance, which is the derivative of N with respect to r (dN/dr).\n\n    Taking the derivative of the proportionality N ∝ r⁵:\n\n    dN/dr ∝ d/dr (r⁵)\n    dN/dr ∝ 5r⁴\n\n    Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to r⁴.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n\nA) ~ r³\nB) ~ r⁴\nC) ~ r²\nD) ~ r⁵\n\nThe correct relationship is ~ r⁴.\n\n<<<B>>>"
