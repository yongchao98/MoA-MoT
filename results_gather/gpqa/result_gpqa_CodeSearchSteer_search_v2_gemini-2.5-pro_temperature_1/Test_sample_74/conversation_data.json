    "To determine the reason for the failed protein overexpression, the provided DNA sequence must be analyzed.\n\nThe plan is to create a fusion protein with an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of the GADD45G protein. This means the coding sequence should start with a start codon (ATG), followed by the sequence for the HA tag, and then the sequence for the GADD45G protein.\n\n1.  **Analyze the HA Tag Sequence**: The standard amino acid sequence for an HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. The DNA sequence for this tag is commonly 5'-TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCT-3'. Let's examine the beginning of the provided construct:\n    *   **Sequence**: 5'-`ATG` `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC`...-3'\n    *   The first codon is `ATG`, the universal start codon for translation.\n    *   The following 27 nucleotides (`TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC`) are translated as follows:\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n        *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n        *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n        *   `GTT` -> Valine (V)\n        *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n        *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n        *   `GCC` -> Alanine (A)\n    *   This translates to `YPYDVPDYA`, which correctly matches the HA tag's amino acid sequence. Therefore, there is no missense mutation in the tag sequence, ruling out option A.\n\n2.  **Scan for other mutations**: The next step is to analyze the sequence immediately following the HA tag to see if the GADD45G sequence begins correctly.\n    *   **Sequence**: 5'-...`GATTACGCC` `AAA` `TGA` `CTCTGGAAGAAG`...-3'\n    *   After the HA tag sequence, the next codon is `AAA`, which codes for the amino acid Lysine.\n    *   The subsequent codon is `TGA`. In the standard genetic code, `TGA` is one of the three stop codons (along with `TAA` and `TAG`).\n    *   When the ribosome encounters a stop codon during translation, it terminates the process, and the polypeptide chain is released.\n\nBecause of this premature `TGA` stop codon, the ribosome would only synthesize a very short peptide (M-YPYDVPDYA-K) and would stop before translating the actual GADD45G protein sequence that follows. This directly explains the inability to detect the overexpression of the full-length fusion protein.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   **A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** This is incorrect. The HA tag sequence is correct.\n*   **B) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** While a linker can sometimes help with protein folding and stability, the presence of a premature stop codon is a more definitive and direct cause for the lack of a full-length protein product.\n*   **C) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** This is correct. A `TGA` stop codon is present immediately after the HA tag sequence, which would halt translation.\n*   **D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This statement is flawed. The stop codon in the sequence is TGA, not UAA. Furthermore, stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs, to terminate translation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
