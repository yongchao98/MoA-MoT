    "Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. To determine which of the given compounds show optical isomerism, each structure must be analyzed for elements of chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Due to the bulky nitro and carboxylate groups at the ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'), rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is severely restricted. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, makes the molecule chiral as the two rings are not in the same plane, and the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry. Such compounds can be resolved into enantiomers.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Also known as methyl lactate, its structure is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are optically active (unless in a racemic mixture).\n\n3.  **benzophenone:** The structure of benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. The central carbonyl carbon is bonded to only three groups (two phenyl groups and one oxygen atom). There are no chiral centers. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and, therefore, optically inactive. While some heavily substituted benzophenone derivatives can be made chiral, benzophenone itself is not.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the trans-isomer of an alkene, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. It is a planar molecule that possesses a center of inversion and a plane of symmetry. It has no chiral centers and is achiral, thus it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on this analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<B>>>"
