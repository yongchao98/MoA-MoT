    "To clearly distinguish between two quantum energy levels, the difference in their energies must be greater than the natural energy width of each level. This energy width is a consequence of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nThe principle states that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in the lifetime of the state (Δt) are related by the formula:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nHere, ħ is the reduced Planck constant. A simplified and commonly used form for this relationship is ΔE ≈ ħ/τ, where τ is the lifetime of the state. The value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\nFor two energy levels to be clearly resolved, the energy difference between them (|E2 - E1|) should be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (ΔE1 + ΔE2).\n\n1.  **Calculate the energy uncertainty (width) for the first state (E1):**\n    *   Lifetime τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n2.  **Calculate the energy uncertainty (width) for the second state (E2):**\n    *   Lifetime τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n3.  **Determine the minimum energy difference for resolution:**\n    *   The minimum required energy difference is the sum of the widths:\n    *   ΔE_min ≈ ΔE1 + ΔE2 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV) ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nThe energy difference between the two levels must be larger than approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Now we evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This value is significantly larger than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **B) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This value is smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **C) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This value is much smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **D) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This value is smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option A provides an energy difference large enough to clearly resolve the two states, as it is greater than the combined energy uncertainties caused by their finite lifetimes.\n\n<<<A>>>"
