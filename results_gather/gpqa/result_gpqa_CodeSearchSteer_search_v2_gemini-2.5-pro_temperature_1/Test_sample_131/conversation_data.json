    "An analysis of the 1H NMR spectra for each of the potential compounds is required to solve this problem. We are looking for a 1:1 mixture of two compounds that matches the following spectral data:\n\n*   **Aromatic region:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio (~6.7 ppm).\n*   **Aliphatic region:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio (~2.2 ppm).\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n\nLet's analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each option:\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single singlet (representing 2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are also chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single singlet (representing 12H).\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has less symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments and are not equivalent. This would result in two separate aromatic singlets (each representing 1H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are in unique chemical environments, which would lead to four different aliphatic singlets.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 4 aliphatic singlets (3H each).\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single singlet (representing 2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at positions 2 and 3 are equivalent. This results in two distinct aliphatic singlets (each representing 6H).\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H each).\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent, producing a single singlet (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The protons of the ethyl groups will show splitting. The two CH2 groups are equivalent and will appear as a quartet, while the two CH3 groups are equivalent and will appear as a triplet. This does not match the \"all singlets\" description for the aliphatic region. Therefore, this compound can be eliminated.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the mixtures presented in the options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would produce three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from 1,2,3,4-TMB and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB), which contradicts the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would also produce three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB), contradicting the data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet, and 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. Assuming their chemical shifts are different, this will result in **two singlets**. Since it is a 1:1 molar mixture and both signals represent 2H, their integration ratio will be **1:1**. This perfectly matches the aromatic data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H), and 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). This results in a total of **three aliphatic singlets**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Ratio:** In a 1:1 mixture, the ratio of protons in these three signals will be 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the aliphatic data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** This option is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give only singlets in its aliphatic region.\n\nTherefore, the only pair that fits all the spectral data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
