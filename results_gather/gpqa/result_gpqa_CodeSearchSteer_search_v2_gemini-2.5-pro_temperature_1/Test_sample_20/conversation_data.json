    "Based on the principles of tautomerism and optical isomerism, the correct compounds are identified as follows:\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible isomers. For keto-enol tautomerism, the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group) is typically required.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone:** This molecule has a cyclic structure with alternating double bonds and two ketone groups. The carbons adjacent to the ketone groups are sp² hybridized and part of a double bond. It lacks the necessary alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ hybridized carbon, which makes tautomerization unfavorable. Therefore, benzoquinone does not show significant tautomerism.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbons between the ketone groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are sp³ hybridized and each has two alpha-hydrogens. These hydrogens are acidic and can readily move, allowing the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism to form its enol, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is particularly stable due to its aromaticity.\n\nThus, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure of this molecule is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methyl ester group (-COOCH₃). Because it has a chiral center, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule has the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the ester groups are in a *trans* configuration across the carbon-carbon double bond. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral. It does not have a chiral center and therefore does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nCombining these findings:\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
