    "Here's a breakdown of the reaction sequence and the symmetry of the final product.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reaction Analysis\n\n1.  **Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.**\n    This is the nitration of toluene, an electrophilic aromatic substitution. The methyl group (-CH₃) is an ortho, para-directing group. The reaction yields a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. Due to less steric hindrance, the major product is **p-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene)**, which we will consider as product 1.\n\n2.  **Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄, forming product 2.**\n    This step involves the oxidation of the methyl group on p-nitrotoluene. Manganese dioxide (MnO₂) in the presence of sulfuric acid is an oxidizing agent capable of converting an alkyl side chain on an aromatic ring to a carboxylic acid. This reaction transforms p-nitrotoluene into **p-nitrobenzoic acid (4-nitrobenzoic acid)**.\n\n3.  **Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\n    This is an acid-base reaction. p-Nitrobenzoic acid is an acid, and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is a strong base. The NaOH will deprotonate the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to form a carboxylate salt (-COO⁻Na⁺). Acetone in this context is likely acting as a solvent. Therefore, product 3 is **sodium p-nitrobenzoate** (or more specifically, the p-nitrobenzoate anion in solution).\n\n### Molecular Symmetry of Product 3\n\nThe final product to analyze is the **p-nitrobenzoate anion ([O₂N-C₆H₄-COO]⁻)**. To determine its molecular symmetry group, we must identify its symmetry elements.\n\n*   **Idealized Symmetry (C₂ᵥ):** If we consider the molecule to be perfectly planar and rigid, it would possess a C₂ rotational axis along the line connecting the nitro and carboxylate groups, and two mirror planes. One mirror plane would be the plane of the molecule itself, and the other would be perpendicular to it, containing the C₂ axis. A molecule with these symmetry elements belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\n*   **Actual Symmetry in a Real Environment (Cₛ):** However, the C₂ᵥ symmetry is an idealization. In reality, several factors can lower the symmetry:\n    *   **Substituent Rotation:** The nitro (-NO₂) and carboxylate (-COO⁻) groups can rotate out of the plane of the benzene ring. For instance, studies on similar molecules like methyl 4-nitrobenzoate and isopropyl 4-nitrobenzoate show that the ester and nitro groups are often twisted relative to the benzene ring.\n    *   **Crystal Packing and Solvation:** In a solid state or in solution, interactions with neighboring molecules or solvent molecules (like water and acetone from the reaction) can distort the molecule.\n    *   **Asymmetry:** If the rotation of the two substituent groups is not symmetrical, or if there are other slight distortions, the C₂ axis and the perpendicular mirror plane are lost.\n\nThe one symmetry element that is most likely to be retained, even with these distortions, is the plane of the benzene ring itself acting as a mirror plane. A molecule that possesses only an identity element (E) and a single mirror plane (σ) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group. Given that the provided options do not include the idealized C₂ᵥ, the most chemically reasonable answer is the lower symmetry group that accounts for likely molecular distortions.\n\nBased on this analysis, the molecular symmetry group of product 3 is Cₛ.\n\n<<<C>>>"
