    "Based on the provided information, a star must satisfy two main criteria to be detectable by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs: it must be visible from both observatories' locations and it must be bright enough for both instruments.\n\n### 1. Location Visibility\n\nA star's visibility depends on its declination (DEC) and the latitude of the observatory.\n*   **Keck Observatory** is in the Northern Hemisphere at a latitude of approximately +20° N. It can observe stars with a declination greater than about -70°.\n*   **Paranal Observatory** is in the Southern Hemisphere at a latitude of about -24° S. It can observe stars with a declination less than about +66°.\n*   Therefore, for a star to be visible from both locations, its declination must be within the range of **-70° < DEC < +66°**.\n\n### 2. Brightness Limit\n\nThe star must be brighter than the magnitude limit of both instruments.\n*   **ESPRESSO** can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude brighter than 17 (V < 17).\n*   **HIRES** can observe stars brighter than 16 (V < 16).\n*   To be seen by both, a star must meet the stricter requirement, meaning its apparent V magnitude must be **V < 16**.\n\n### Analysis of Each Star\n\nThe apparent magnitude (m) is calculated from the absolute magnitude (M), distance (d) in parsecs, and absorption (A_V) using the formula: `m = M + 5 * log10(d/10) + A_V`. The absorption `A_V` is calculated as `3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\n*   **Star 1:** Has a declination of -75°. This is outside the visible range for the Keck Observatory. Thus, it cannot be observed by both.\n\n*   **Star 2:** Has a declination of +55°, which is visible from both observatories. However, its apparent V magnitude is 16.5 mag. This is too faint for HIRES (V must be < 16). Thus, it cannot be observed by both.\n\n*   **Star 3:**\n    *   **Location:** Declination is +48°. This is within the range `-70° < 48° < +66°`, so it is visible from both observatories.\n    *   **Brightness:** Apparent V magnitude is 15.5 mag. This is brighter than the V < 16 limit.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Star 3 is detectable by both instruments.\n\n*   **Star 4:**\n    *   **Location:** Declination is -48°. This is within the range `-70° < -48° < +66°`, so it is visible from both.\n    *   **Brightness:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n        *   Absolute Magnitude (M) = 15.5 mag\n        *   Distance (d) = 10 pc\n        *   Absorption `A_V = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24` mag\n        *   Apparent Magnitude `m = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10/10) + 1.24 = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74` mag.\n        *   This is fainter than the V < 16 limit for HIRES.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Star 4 is not detectable by both.\n\n*   **Star 5:**\n    *   **Location:** Declination is +60°. This is within the range `-70° < 60° < +66°`, making it visible from both.\n    *   **Brightness:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n        *   Absolute Magnitude (M) = 16.5 mag\n        *   Distance (d) = 5 pc\n        *   Absorption (A_V) = 0\n        *   Apparent Magnitude `m = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5/10) = 16.5 + 5 * (-0.301) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995` mag.\n        *   This is brighter than the V < 16 limit.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Star 5 is detectable by both instruments.\n\nTherefore, Star 3 and Star 5 are the only ones that can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n\n<<<B>>>"
