    "To find the numerical value of \"a\", we must use the normalization condition for the wave function. This fundamental principle of quantum mechanics states that the total probability of finding the particle in all possible locations must be 1. The probability density is given by the square of the magnitude of the wave function, |ψ(x)|².\n\nThe given wave function is:\nψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\n**1. Calculate the Probability Density**\n\nFirst, we find the complex conjugate, ψ*(x), by changing the sign of the imaginary part:\nψ*(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i\n\nNext, we calculate the probability density, |ψ(x)|², by multiplying the wave function by its complex conjugate:\n|ψ(x)|² = ψ*(x) * ψ(x)\n|ψ(x)|² = [ (a / sqrt(1 + x)) + 0.5i ] * [ (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i ]\nUsing the difference of squares formula, (A+B)(A-B) = A² - B², we get:\n|ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² - (0.5i)²\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) - 0.25 * i²\nSince i² = -1:\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n**2. Apply the Normalization Condition**\n\nThe problem states that the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, the integral of the probability density over this interval must be equal to 1.\n∫₁³ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n∫₁³ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\n**3. Solve the Integral**\n\nWe integrate the expression with respect to x:\n∫ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = a² * ∫ (1 / (1 + x)) dx + ∫ 0.25 dx\n= a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25x\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral from 1 to 3:\n[a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3] - [a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1]\n= [a² * ln(4) + 0.75] - [a² * ln(2) + 0.25]\n= a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5\nUsing the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\n= a² * ln(4/2) + 0.5\n= a² * ln(2) + 0.5\n\n**4. Solve for \"a\"**\n\nWe set the result of the integral equal to 1 and solve for \"a\":\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the approximate value for the natural logarithm of 2 (ln(2) ≈ 0.693):\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693\na² ≈ 0.7215\na ≈ sqrt(0.7215)\na ≈ 0.849\n\nThis value is approximately 0.85.\n\n<<<D>>>"
