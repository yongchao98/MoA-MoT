    "### Calculation of Photon Momentum for Rovibrational Transition\n\nTo determine the momentum of the absorbed photon, we first need to calculate the energy of the transition from the molecule's fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy.\n\n#### 1. Energy Levels and State Transitions\nThe energy of a diatomic molecule in the quantum rotation-vibration model is given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n*   **Energy Formula**: E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + B*J(J + 1)\n    *   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n    *   `J` is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n    *   `ħ` is the reduced Planck's constant (≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n    *   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n    *   `B` is the rotational constant, related to the molecule's moment of inertia.\n\n*   **Fundamental State**: The lowest energy state (ground state) occurs when both quantum numbers are at their minimum: v = 0 and J = 0.\n    *   E_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + B*0(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω\n\n*   **Next Lowest Energy State**: For a photon to be absorbed, transitions must follow specific selection rules. For rovibrational transitions in a diatomic molecule, the rules are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1.\n    *   Starting from the ground state (v=0, J=0), the only possible transition is to a state where v=1 and J=1 (as J cannot be negative).\n    *   This corresponds to the first line of the R-branch in the rovibrational spectrum.\n    *   E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B*1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n\n#### 2. Transition Energy (ΔE)\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must equal the difference between these two energy states.\n*   ΔE = E_final - E_initial = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - (1/2)ħω\n*   ΔE = ħω + 2B\n\n#### 3. Calculation of Physical Constants\n\n*   **Reduced Mass (μ)**: This is the effective mass of the two-body system.\n    *   μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n    *   μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n    *   Converting to kilograms: μ ≈ 1.818 * (1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg/amu) ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n*   **Moment of Inertia (I)**: This measures the molecule's resistance to rotational motion.\n    *   I = μR²\n    *   I ≈ (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)² = 1.208 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n*   **Rotational Constant (B)**: This constant determines the spacing of rotational energy levels.\n    *   B = ħ² / (2I)\n    *   B ≈ (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (2 * 1.208 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 4.60 x 10⁻²³ J\n\n#### 4. Calculating the Photon Energy\nNow, we can calculate the total energy of the transition.\n*   **Vibrational Energy Part (ħω)**:\n    *   ħω ≈ (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n*   **Rotational Energy Part (2B)**:\n    *   2B ≈ 2 * (4.60 x 10⁻²³ J) = 9.20 x 10⁻²³ J\n*   **Total Transition Energy (ΔE)**:\n    *   ΔE = ħω + 2B ≈ (4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J) + (9.20 x 10⁻²³ J) ≈ 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\nAs you can see, the rotational energy contribution is significantly smaller than the vibrational energy.\n\n#### 5. Calculating the Photon Momentum (p)\nThe momentum of a photon is related to its energy by the equation E = pc, where `c` is the speed of light (≈ 3.0 x 10⁸ m/s).\n*   p = ΔE / c\n*   p ≈ (4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3.0 x 10⁸ m/s)\n*   p ≈ 1.405 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
