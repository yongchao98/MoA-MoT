    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as an extension of the Standard Model (SM), incorporating higher-dimensional operators to parameterize potential new physics at energy scales beyond the electroweak scale. The construction of the SMEFT Lagrangian adheres to several fundamental principles and symmetries.\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry**: The SMEFT is a quantum field theory formulated in Minkowski spacetime, and as such, all its terms, including the higher-dimensional operators, must be scalars under Lorentz transformations to ensure the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers. The operators are explicitly constructed to be invariant under the Lorentz group.\n\n2.  **Poincaré Symmetry**: This symmetry group extends Lorentz symmetry to include spacetime translations. The SMEFT Lagrangian is required to obey Poincaré symmetry, which is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime in local quantum field theories.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry, the combination of charge conjugation and parity transformation, is known to be violated in the Standard Model by the weak interaction. The SMEFT framework is designed to parameterize not only the SM but also potential new sources of CP violation from beyond the Standard Model. Consequently, there exist numerous CP-violating operators within SMEFT, and this symmetry is not required to be respected by all operators.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry**: According to the CPT theorem, any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be symmetric under the combined transformation of charge conjugation (C), parity inversion (P), and time reversal (T). Since the SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant theory, it must respect CPT symmetry. A violation of CPT symmetry would imply a violation of Lorentz invariance.\n\nBased on these principles, Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT, while CP symmetry is not a required symmetry.\n\n<<<C>>>"
