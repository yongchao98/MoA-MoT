    "To arrange the given substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we must consider the directing effects and steric properties of each substituent on the benzene ring. The yield of the para-isomer is influenced by whether the substituent is ortho-, para-directing or meta-directing, and by the steric hindrance around the ortho positions.\n\n### Analysis of Substituents:\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents into two main categories:\n*   **Ortho-, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the positions ortho (adjacent) and para (opposite) to themselves. All activating groups and halogens fall into this category.\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta positions. Deactivating groups (except for halogens) are meta-directors.\n\nThe substances are:\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** -CH3 is an activating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** -COOC2H5 is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl is a deactivating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** -NO2 is a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** -C2H5 is an activating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** -COOH is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n\n### Ranking the Substances:\n\nThe substances with meta-directing groups will produce very low yields of the para-isomer, while those with ortho-, para-directing groups will produce significantly higher yields.\n\n**1. Meta-Directors (lowest para-yield):**\nFor substances 4, 6, and 2, the primary product is the meta-isomer. The para-isomer is formed in very small quantities.\n*   **4) C6H5-NO2:** The -NO2 group is a powerful deactivator. During nitration (a similar electrophilic substitution), it yields only a trace (0-5%) of the para-isomer. Bromination is expected to be similar, yielding predominantly the meta-isomer.\n*   **6) C6H5-COOH:** The -COOH group is also a meta-director. Its deactivating effect leads to low yields of ortho and para products.\n*   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5:** The -COOC2H5 group is a meta-director, similar to -COOH. Data for the nitration of ethyl benzoate shows it yields predominantly the meta-isomer (73%), with about 5% being the para-isomer.\n\nComparing these three, the order of deactivating strength is generally -NO2 > -COOH ≈ -COOR. This correlates with the very low amounts of para-product. Based on available data for similar reactions, the para-isomer yield increases in the order: Nitrobenzene < Benzoic Acid < Ethyl Benzoate.\n*   **Order of increasing para-yield for meta-directors: 4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**2. Ortho-, Para-Directors (highest para-yield):**\nFor substances 1, 5, and 3, the major products are the ortho- and para-isomers. The ratio between para and ortho products is largely determined by steric hindrance; bulkier groups hinder attack at the ortho position, thus favoring the para position.\n*   **1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The -CH3 group is relatively small. Bromination gives a substantial amount of both ortho and para products, with the para-isomer being favored. For example, sulfonation of toluene yields about 60-65% para-isomer. Nitration gives about 37% para-isomer. For bromination, the para-isomer is the major product over the ortho-isomer.\n*   **5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The -C2H5 group is bulkier than the -CH3 group. This increased steric hindrance further disfavors ortho-substitution, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer compared to toluene.\n*   **3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The -Cl atom, while deactivating overall, is an ortho-, para-director. Halogens often lead to a high percentage of the para-isomer. For example, the nitration of chlorobenzene yields 70% of the para-product. This high para-selectivity is due to a combination of steric effects and the strong inductive electron withdrawal that deactivates the ortho position more than the para position.\n\nComparing these three, the steric bulk increases from -CH3 to -C2H5, so the para-yield of ethylbenzene (5) is greater than that of toluene (1). Chlorobenzene (3) is known to give a very high proportion of the para-isomer in electrophilic substitutions.\n*   **Order of increasing para-yield for ortho-, para-directors: 1 < 5 < 3**\n\n### Final Order:\n\nCombining the two groups, the overall order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is obtained by placing the meta-directors before the ortho-, para-directors.\n\nFinal sequence: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
