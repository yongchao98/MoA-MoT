    "The search results confirm the methodology and the calculated values.\n\n*   **Source** provides a step-by-step solution to the exact same problem (for a negative pion, which has the same mass). It calculates the total energy released as 33.9 MeV. It then calculates the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_μ) to be 4.1 MeV and the energy of the muon antineutrino (E_ν) to be 29.8 MeV.\n*   **Source** also discusses the energetics of charged pion decay. It states that the measurement of the muon's kinetic energy is 4.13 MeV, which is consistent with a massless neutrino. This confirms that the majority of the energy is carried away by the neutrino.\n*   **Source** provides a detailed solution using slightly different mass values (in terms of electron mass) but follows the same conservation of energy and momentum principles. It arrives at a muon kinetic energy of 4.08 MeV and a neutrino energy of 29.65 MeV.\n*   **Source** gives a highly precise experimental measurement of the muon momentum from pion decay at rest as pμ+ = (29.79200 ± 0.00011) MeV/c. From this, it derives the kinetic energy of the muon as Tμ+ = (4.11984 ± 0.00003) MeV. This experimental value is in excellent agreement with our calculated value of ~4.12 MeV.\n\nThe calculations performed in the thought process are validated by these sources.\n\n*   KE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV\n*   KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\nThese values correspond to option A.\n\nFinal check of the calculations:\n*   p*c = [ (139.6)² - (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ] = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2 = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV\n*   KE_ν = p*c ≈ 29.8 MeV\n*   E_μ = sqrt((29.78)² + (105.7)²) = sqrt(886.85 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.34) ≈ 109.815 MeV\n*   KE_μ = 109.815 - 105.7 = 4.115 MeV ≈ 4.12 MeV\n\nThe calculations are correct.\n\nFinal Answer: The kinetic energies of the product particles, the muon (μ⁺) and the muon neutrino (ν), are approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, respectively. This corresponds to option A.\n\nTo find the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν), we apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nThe decay is given by:\nπ⁺ → μ⁺ + ν\n\nGiven data:\n*   Rest mass of π⁺ (m_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of μ⁺ (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The π⁺ is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero.\n\n**1. Conservation of Momentum:**\nSince the initial pion is at rest, the total momentum before the decay is zero. To conserve momentum, the muon (μ⁺) and the muon neutrino (ν) must travel in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude (p).\n\n**2. Conservation of Energy:**\nThe total energy before the decay is the rest energy of the stationary pion:\nE_initial = m_π * c² = 139.6 MeV\n\nThe total energy after the decay is the sum of the total energies of the muon (E_μ) and the neutrino (E_ν):\nE_final = E_μ + E_ν\n\nThe total energy of a particle is given by the relativistic formula E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n\n*   For the muon: E_μ² = (p*c)² + (m_μ * c²)²\n*   For the neutrino, its rest mass is negligible (m_ν ≈ 0). Therefore, its total energy is E_ν = p*c.\n\nAccording to energy conservation:\nm_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν\n139.6 MeV = sqrt((p*c)² + (105.7 MeV)²) + p*c\n\n**3. Calculation:**\nWe can solve for the momentum-energy term (p*c):\n139.6 - p*c = sqrt((p*c)² + 105.7²)\nSquaring both sides:\n(139.6 - p*c)² = (p*c)² + 105.7²\n139.6² - 2*(139.6)*(p*c) + (p*c)² = (p*c)² + 105.7²\n19488.16 - 279.2*(p*c) = 11172.49\n8315.67 = 279.2*(p*c)\np*c = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV\n\n**4. Kinetic Energies:**\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_ν):**\n    Since the neutrino is considered massless, its total energy is its kinetic energy.\n    KE_ν = E_ν = p*c ≈ 29.8 MeV.\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_μ):**\n    The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest energy (KE_μ = E_μ - m_μ * c²).\n    First, we find its total energy:\n    E_μ = 139.6 MeV - E_ν = 139.6 - 29.78 = 109.82 MeV\n    Then, its kinetic energy is:\n    KE_μ = 109.82 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 4.12 MeV.\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the muon neutrino. These values are confirmed by multiple physics resources.\n\n<<<A>>>"
