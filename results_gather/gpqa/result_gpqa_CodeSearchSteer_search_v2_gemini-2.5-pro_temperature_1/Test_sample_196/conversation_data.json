    "### Identification of the Final Product\n\nTo determine the final product, we must first deduce the structure of the starting material, Compound X, from its spectral data and then identify the product of its reaction with red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\n#### Step 1: Structure Elucidation of Compound X\n\n**Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n*   A very broad absorption in the range of **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretching of a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n*   The strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n*   Absorptions at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** suggest the presence of C=C bonds within an aromatic ring.\n\nFrom the IR data, we can conclude that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n**¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n*   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet in this downfield region is a classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, causing them to be deshielded.\n*   **Alkyl Region Analysis:**\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH).\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for two protons is consistent with a methylene group (-CH₂) situated between two different proton environments (e.g., a methyl and a methine group).\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for one proton suggests a methine group (-CH) bonded to the benzene ring and adjacent to multiple protons.\n\n**Assembling the Structure:**\nThe alkyl signals piece together to form a *sec*-butyl group [-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃]. This group is attached to the benzene ring at the methine carbon. Therefore, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (C).\n\n#### Step 2: The Chemical Reaction\n\nCompound X, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, reacts with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent. It is well-established that Red P and HI will completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The reaction is a full reduction of the carboxyl group to an alkane.\n\n#### Step 3: Determining the Final Product\n\nThe reduction of the carboxylic acid group on 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid will result in the formation of a methyl group, while the *sec*-butyl group and the benzene ring remain intact.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the -COOH group to a -CH₃ group.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\nThis structure matches option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"
