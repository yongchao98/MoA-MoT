Understand the Initial State and Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe problem describes the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and a slowly moving antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The term \"slowly moving\" implies that the kinetic energy of the antiproton is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can assume the proton is also at rest (as in a fixed-target experiment). Therefore, the total initial energy of the system is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n\nThe rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938 \\text{ MeV}$.\nThe rest mass energy of an antiproton is the same, $m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 \\approx 938 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nTotal initial energy ($E_{initial}$):\n$E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 938 \\text{ MeV} + 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**2. Understand the Final State and Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\nThe initial system is effectively at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the final particles must also be zero.\n\nThe final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since they all have the same mass ($m_A$) and the total momentum is zero, the total energy must be distributed equally among them for the system to be symmetric.\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy of a Single Particle A**\n\nThe total final energy ($E_{final}$) must be equal to the total initial energy.\n$E_{final} = E_{initial} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nThis total energy is shared among the four final particles. The energy of a single particle A ($E_A$) is:\n$E_A = \\frac{E_{final}}{4} = \\frac{1876 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**4. Calculate the Velocity of Particle A**\n\nWe now know the total energy ($E_A$) and the rest mass energy ($m_A c^2$) of a single particle A. We can use the relativistic energy equation to find its velocity.\n\nThe relativistic energy equation is $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\nWe have:\n*   $E_A = 469 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5633$\n\nNow, solve for the velocity $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4091} = \\sqrt{0.5909}$\n$\\beta \\approx 0.7687$\n\nSo, the velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe initial calculation seems correct. I will refine it with a more precise value for the proton's rest mass energy and then finalize the answer.\n\n1.  **Initial State & Energy Conservation**: The process is a proton-antiproton annihilation. The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. We can assume the annihilation happens at rest. In this scenario, the total initial energy is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n    *   The rest mass of a proton ($m_p$) is equal to the rest mass of an antiproton ($m_{\\bar{p}}$).\n    *   The rest energy of a proton is approximately 938.27 MeV. Some sources round this to 938 MeV or 939.3 MeV. I will use 938.27 MeV for better precision.\n    *   Total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) = $E_p + E_{\\bar{p}} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n2.  **Final State & Energy Distribution**: The annihilation produces four particles of mass $m_A$, where $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   According to the principle of conservation of energy, the total initial energy is converted into the total energy of the final particles.\n    *   $E_{initial} = E_{final} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   Due to the conservation of momentum (initial momentum is zero), the energy will be distributed equally among the four resulting particles.\n    *   Energy per particle A ($E_A$) = $E_{final} / 4 = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV} / 4 = 469.135 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Relativistic Velocity Calculation**: Each particle A has a total energy $E_A = 469.135 \\text{ MeV}$ and a rest energy $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$. We can find its velocity using the relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n    *   The total energy of a particle is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$.\n    *   $\\gamma = E_A / (m_A c^2) = 469.135 \\text{ MeV} / 300 \\text{ MeV} \\approx 1.56378$.\n    *   Now, we solve for the velocity, $v$.\n        *   $\\gamma^2 = 1 / (1 - v^2/c^2)$\n        *   $1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 / \\gamma^2$\n        *   $v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1 / \\gamma^2$\n        *   $v = c \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$\n    *   Plugging in the value for $\\gamma$:\n        *   $v = c \\sqrt{1 - 1/(1.56378)^2}$\n        *   $v = c \\sqrt{1 - 1/2.44558}$\n        *   $v = c \\sqrt{1 - 0.40890}$\n        *   $v = c \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n        *   $v \\approx 0.7688c$\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: The calculated velocity is approximately $0.77c$. This matches option B.\n\nFinal check of the steps and reasoning.\n- The assumption of annihilation at rest is justified by the \"slowly moving\" antiproton.\n- Conservation of energy is correctly applied.\n- Equal energy distribution among the four identical product particles is justified by momentum conservation in the center-of-mass frame.\n- The relativistic energy formula is correctly used to find the velocity.\nThe calculation is robust.\n\nFinal Answer is B.\nThe problem describes a proton-antiproton annihilation at rest, producing four particles.\n\n1.  **Calculate the total initial energy.**\n    The process begins with a proton and a \"slowly moving\" antiproton. This implies we can consider them both to be effectively at rest, so their initial kinetic energy is negligible. The total initial energy is the sum of their rest energies. The rest energy of a proton is approximately 938.27 MeV. An antiproton has the same rest mass.\n    *   Total Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$) = $2 \\times (\\text{rest energy of a proton})$\n    *   $E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n2.  **Determine the energy of each final particle.**\n    The annihilation results in four particles ($2A^+$ and $2A^-$). By the law of conservation of energy, the total initial energy is distributed among these four particles. Since the initial momentum is zero, the energy is shared equally.\n    *   Energy per particle A ($E_A$) = $E_{initial} / 4$\n    *   $E_A = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV} / 4 = 469.135 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the velocity of particle A.**\n    The total energy ($E_A$) of each particle A is the sum of its rest energy ($m_A c^2$) and its kinetic energy. The relationship is given by the relativistic formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   We are given $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ is $E_A / (m_A c^2) = 469.135 \\text{ MeV} / 300 \\text{ MeV} \\approx 1.564$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is also defined as $\\gamma = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}$. We can solve for the velocity $v$.\n    *   $\\gamma^2 = 1 / (1 - v^2/c^2)$\n    *   $v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/\\gamma^2$\n    *   $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 1/(1.564)^2} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 1/2.446} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4088} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5912} \\approx 0.769$.\n    *   Therefore, the velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.96c\nB) 0.77c\nC) 0.91c\nD) 0.86c\n\nThe calculated velocity matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The core principle is the conservation of energy. The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after the annihilation.\n2.  **Calculate the initial energy ($E_{initial}$):** The initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. We can assume both particles are effectively at rest. Therefore, the total initial energy is the sum of their rest mass energies. The rest mass energy of a proton is approximately 938.27 MeV, and an antiproton has the same rest mass.\n3.  **Calculate the final energy ($E_{final}$):** The final state consists of four particles (two $A^+$ and two $A^-$). The total final energy is the sum of the energies of these four particles. By symmetry, each of these four particles will have the same energy, which we'll call $E_A$. So, $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A$.\n4.  **Equate initial and final energies:** From the conservation of energy, $E_{initial} = E_{final}$. This allows us to solve for the energy of a single particle A, $E_A$.\n5.  **Relate energy to velocity:** The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor and $m_A c^2$ is the rest mass energy of particle A (given as 300 MeV). We can use this to calculate $\\gamma$.\n6.  **Solve for velocity:** The Lorentz factor is defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.

In any such interaction, both total energy and total momentum must be conserved. Since the final particles are expected to be moving at high speeds, we must use the principles of special relativity.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Initial State (Before Annihilation):**\n    *   The initial particles are a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is a key phrase indicating that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can therefore approximate it as being at rest.\n    *   In a typical fixed-target experiment, the proton would be part of a stationary target. Thus, we can assume the proton is also at rest.\n    *   With both initial particles effectively at rest, the total initial momentum of the system is zero ($\\vec{P}_{initial} \\approx 0$). This means the annihilation occurs in the center-of-mass frame.\n    *   The total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n    *   The rest energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   A particle and its antiparticle have the same mass, so $m_{\\bar{p}} = m_p$.\n    *   Therefore, $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2$.\n    *   $E_{initial} \\approx 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Final State (After Annihilation):**\n    *   The final state consists of four particles: $2A^+ + 2A^-$.\n    *   We are given that the rest energy of particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$. We assume the antiparticle $A^-$ has the same mass as the particle $A^+$.\n    *   By the conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero ($\\vec{P}_{final} = 0$).\n    *   For the total momentum to be zero, the four final particles must fly off in directions such that their vector momenta cancel out.\n    *   Since the system is in the center-of-mass frame and the four final particles have identical masses, the available energy will be distributed equally among them. This means each of the four A particles will have the same speed, $v_A$, and thus the same total energy, $E_A$.\n    *   The total energy of a single relativistic particle is $E_A = \\gamma_A m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_A/c)^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles: $E_{final} = 4 E_A = 4 \\gamma_A m_A c^2$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Law of Conservation of Energy:**\n    We equate the total initial energy and the total final energy:\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma_A m_A c^2$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Velocity of Particle A ($v_A$):**\n    *   First, we solve the energy equation for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_A$:\n        $\\gamma_A = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n    *   Now, substitute the known values for the rest energies:\n        $\\gamma_A = \\frac{938 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938}{600} \\approx 1.5633$\n    *   Next, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity. Let $\\beta = v_A/c$.\n        $\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    *   Rearrange the formula to solve for $\\beta$:\n        $\\gamma_A^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2} \\implies 1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2} \\implies \\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}}$\n    *   Substitute the calculated value of $\\gamma_A$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4091}$\n        $\\beta \\approx \\sqrt{0.5909} \\approx 0.7687$\n    *   The velocity of particle A is $v_A = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated velocity is approximately 0.77c, which corresponds to option D.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **\"Slowly moving\" approximation:** It is critical to interpret this as meaning the initial kinetic energy is negligible, simplifying the initial state to a system at rest.\n*   **Relativistic kinematics:** The energies involved ($m_p c^2 \\gg m_A c^2$) and the resulting speeds require the use of relativistic formulas for energy ($E=\\gamma mc^2$), not classical ones ($E=mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$).\n*   **Symmetry:** The symmetry of the initial state (at rest) and the final state (four identical-mass particles) allows for the simple assumption that energy is distributed equally.\n*   **Constants:** Using the standard value for the proton's rest energy ($m_p c^2 \\approx 938$ MeV) is necessary.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\n\n**1.

Principle of Conservation of Energy\n\nThe process is the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) into four new particles ($2A^{+} + 2A^{-}$). According to the principle of conservation of energy, the total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after the annihilation.\n\n### 2. Initial Energy\n\n*   The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible.

Using a more precise value won't significantly change the result to match another option, but let's recalculate with 938.27 MeV.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the principles of conservation of energy and momentum, which are fundamental in particle annihilation processes.\n\n**Detailed Steps:**\n\n1.  **Identify Initial State:**\n    *   One proton ($p$) and one antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. To conserve momentum (initially near zero), the proton must also be nearly at rest.

The most straightforward way for this to happen is if they share the available energy equally. Therefore, each of the four particles will have the same total energy, $E_A$.\n    *   The total final energy is $E_f = 4 \\times E_A$.\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   $E_i = E_f$\n    *   $1876.54 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times E_A$\n    *   $E_A = \\frac{1876.54}{4} \\text{ MeV} = 469.135 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Velocity:**\n    *   The total energy of a single particle A is given by the relativistic formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   We know $E_A = 469.135$ MeV and $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV.\n    *   $469.135 = \\gamma \\times 300$\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{469.135}{300} \\approx 1.56378$\n\n5.  **Convert Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$) to Velocity (v):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor is defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    *   $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n    *   $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    *   $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    *   $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.56378)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.44541}}$\n    *   $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 0.40892} = \\sqrt{0.59108}$\n    *   $\\beta \\approx 0.7688$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n    *   This corresponds to option D.\n\nThe calculation is robust.

Principle of Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe fundamental principle we will use is the conservation of total energy. The total energy of the system before the annihilation must be equal to the total energy of the system after the annihilation. We will also implicitly use the conservation of momentum.\n\n**2. Initial State Energy ($E_{initial}$)**\n\n*   The initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is a common simplification in such problems, implying that the kinetic energies of the initial particles are negligible compared to their rest mass energies. To satisfy the conservation of momentum (initial momentum must be zero), we analyze the event in the center-of-mass frame, where both the proton and antiproton are effectively at rest.\n*   The total initial energy is therefore the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n*   The rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938.3 MeV. The antiproton has the same rest energy.\n*   Therefore, the total initial energy is:\n    $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n    $E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**3. Final State Energy ($E_{final}$)**\n\n*   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n*   We assume that $A^+$ and $A^-$ have the same mass, $m_A$. The problem gives the rest energy of particle A as $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV.\n*   Since the initial total momentum is zero, the total momentum of the four final particles must also be zero. By symmetry, the total energy released ($E_{initial}$) will be distributed equally among the four final particles. Each particle will have the same speed and thus the same total energy, which we'll call $E_A$.\n*   The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n    $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A$\n\n**4. Equating Initial and Final Energy**\n\n*   According to the conservation of energy:\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times E_A$\n*   We can now find the total energy of a single particle A:\n    $E_A = \\frac{1876.6 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469.15 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**5. Calculating the Velocity**\n\n*   The total energy ($E_A$) of a relativistic particle is related to its rest energy ($m_A c^2$) and its velocity ($v$) by the formula:\n    $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$\n    where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n*   We can first calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.15 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5638$\n*   Now, we solve for the velocity $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n    $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n*   Plugging in the value of $\\gamma$:\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n\nThe velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.

Identify the Physical Principles**\n\nThe core principles governing this particle annihilation process are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum. Since the resulting particles will be moving at speeds close to the speed of light, we must use relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n**2. Analyze the Initial State**\n\n*   The initial system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". In the context of annihilation, where the energy released from converting mass is enormous, the initial kinetic energy of the particles is negligible compared to their rest mass energy. Therefore, we can assume both the proton and antiproton are effectively at rest.\n*   The total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and antiproton.\n    *   Rest mass energy of a proton, $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   An antiproton has the same mass as a proton, so $m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = m_p c^2$.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.54 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n*   Since the particles are considered to be at rest, the total initial momentum ($P_{initial}$) is zero.\n\n**3. Analyze the Final State**\n\n*   The final system consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. All these particles have the same rest mass, $m_A$.\n*   The rest mass energy of each particle A is given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n*   By the conservation of momentum, the total final momentum ($P_{final}$) must also be zero. This implies that the four particles fly off in such a way that their momentum vectors cancel out.\n*   Due to the symmetry of the final state (four identical mass particles), we can conclude that they will all have the same speed, $v_A$, and therefore the same total energy, $E_A$.\n*   The total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by $E_A = \\gamma_A m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma_A$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_A/c)^2}}$.\n*   The total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n    *   $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma_A m_A c^2$.\n\n**4.

Initial Energy**\nThe initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies that the initial kinetic energy of the system is negligible compared to the rest mass energy. Therefore, the total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton. Since a proton and an antiproton have the same mass, this is twice the rest energy of a proton.\n\n$E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2$\n\nThe rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938.27 MeV.\n\n$E_i = 2 \\times 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.54 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n**2. Final Energy**\nThe final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since they are produced from the annihilation, they will share the total initial energy. By conservation of momentum, if the initial system was at rest, the final particles must move in such a way that the total momentum remains zero. This implies that all four resulting particles will have the same speed, $v$, and therefore the same energy.\n\nThe energy of a single relativistic particle ($E_A$) is given by:\n\n$E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\nwhere $m_A c^2$ is the rest energy of particle A (given as 300 MeV) and $\\gamma$ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$\n\nThe total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n\n$E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n**3.

The most straightforward way for this to happen is if they share the available energy equally. Therefore, each of the four particles will have the same total energy, $E_A$.\n    *   The total final energy is $E_f = 4 \\times E_A$.\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   $E_i = E_f$\n    *   $1876.54 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times E_A$\n    *   $E_A = \\frac{1876.54}{4} \\text{ MeV} = 469.135 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Velocity:**\n    *   The total energy of a single particle A is given by the relativistic formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   We know $E_A = 469.135$ MeV and $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV.\n    *   $469.135 = \\gamma \\times 300$\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{469.135}{300} \\approx 1.56378$\n\n5.  **Convert Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$) to Velocity (v):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor is defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.

Principle of Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe fundamental principle we will use is the conservation of total energy. The total energy of the system before the annihilation must be equal to the total energy of the system after the annihilation. We will also implicitly use the conservation of momentum.\n\n**2. Initial State Energy ($E_{initial}$)**\n\n*   The initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is a common simplification in such problems, implying that the kinetic energies of the initial particles are negligible compared to their rest mass energies. To satisfy the conservation of momentum (initial momentum must be zero), we analyze the event in the center-of-mass frame, where both the proton and antiproton are effectively at rest.\n*   The total initial energy is therefore the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n*   The rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938.3 MeV. The antiproton has the same rest energy.\n*   Therefore, the total initial energy is:\n    $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n    $E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**3.

The problem gives the rest energy of particle A as $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV.\n*   Since the initial total momentum is zero, the total momentum of the four final particles must also be zero. By symmetry, the total energy released ($E_{initial}$) will be distributed equally among the four final particles. Each particle will have the same speed and thus the same total energy, which we'll call $E_A$.\n*   The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n    $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A$\n\n**4.

Identify the Physical Principles**\n\nThe core principles governing this particle annihilation process are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum. Since the resulting particles will be moving at speeds close to the speed of light, we must use relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n**2. Analyze the Initial State**\n\n*   The initial system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". In the context of annihilation, where the energy released from converting mass is enormous, the initial kinetic energy of the particles is negligible compared to their rest mass energy. Therefore, we can assume both the proton and antiproton are effectively at rest.\n*   The total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and antiproton.\n    *   Rest mass energy of a proton, $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   An antiproton has the same mass as a proton, so $m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = m_p c^2$.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.54 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n*   Since the particles are considered to be at rest, the total initial momentum ($P_{initial}$) is zero.\n\n**3. Analyze the Final State**\n\n*   The final system consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. All these particles have the same rest mass, $m_A$.\n*   The rest mass energy of each particle A is given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n*   By the conservation of momentum, the total final momentum ($P_{final}$) must also be zero. This implies that the four particles fly off in such a way that their momentum vectors cancel out.\n*   Due to the symmetry of the final state (four identical mass particles), we can conclude that they will all have the same speed, $v_A$, and therefore the same total energy, $E_A$.\n*   The total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by $E_A = \\gamma_A m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma_A$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_A/c)^2}}$.\n*   The total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n    *   $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma_A m_A c^2$.\n\n**4.

Let $\\beta = v_A/c$.\n$\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for $\\beta$:\n$\\gamma_A^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}$\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the calculated value of $\\gamma_A$:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n\nTherefore, the velocity of particle A is $v_A = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo determine the velocity of particle A, we apply the principle of conservation of energy to the annihilation process.\n\n**1. Initial Energy**\nThe initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies that the initial kinetic energy of the system is negligible compared to the rest mass energy. Therefore, the total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton. Since a proton and an antiproton have the same mass, this is twice the rest energy of a proton.\n\n$E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2$\n\nThe rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938.27 MeV.\n\n$E_i = 2 \\times 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.54 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n**2. Final Energy**\nThe final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since they are produced from the annihilation, they will share the total initial energy. By conservation of momentum, if the initial system was at rest, the final particles must move in such a way that the total momentum remains zero. This implies that all four resulting particles will have the same speed, $v$, and therefore the same energy.\n\nThe energy of a single relativistic particle ($E_A$) is given by:\n\n$E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\nwhere $m_A c^2$ is the rest energy of particle A (given as 300 MeV) and $\\gamma$ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$\n\nThe total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n\n$E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n**3. Conservation of Energy**\nBy equating the initial and final energies ($E_i = E_f$):\n\n$2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\nWe can solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\, \\text{MeV}} = \\frac{938.27}{600} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n**4. Calculating the Velocity**\nNow, we can find the velocity ($v$) from the Lorentz factor. The formula for velocity in terms of gamma is:\n\n$v = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstituting the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n\n$v = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}}$\n$v = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n$v = c \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089}$\n$v = c \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n$v \\approx 0.7688 c$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.77c.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe initial state of the system is a proton and a slowly moving antiproton. \"Slowly moving\" implies that we can neglect the kinetic energy of the antiproton. Assuming the proton is also at rest (e.g., in a fixed target experiment), the total initial energy is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n\nThe rest mass energy of a proton is approximately 938.3 MeV.

In this specific case, the initial particles are a proton ($p$) and a slowly moving antiproton ($\\bar{p}$), which annihilate to produce four new particles: two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$.\n\nTo determine the velocity of the resulting A particles, we can apply the law of conservation of energy.

Final Energy ($E_f$)**\n\nThe final state consists of four particles of mass $m_A$, where the rest energy $m_A c^2$ is given as 300 MeV. Due to the conservation of momentum and the symmetry of the final state, the total energy will be distributed equally among the four particles.
