Since the stars are assumed to radiate as black bodies, the solution requires three key physical laws:\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is a constant.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** A star's surface temperature (T) is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of the light it *emits* (λ_emitted). Thus, T ∝ 1/λ_emitted.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength (λ_obs) is shifted from the *emitted* wavelength due to the star's radial velocity (v_r). The formula is λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c).\n\n2.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    From the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    The constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, leaving:\n    **L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴**\n\n3.  **Calculate the Radius Ratio Term:**\n    The problem states that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore, the first part of the equation is:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = **2.25**\n\n4.  **Calculate the Temperature Ratio Term:**\n    This is the most critical part of the problem.\n    *   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the *emitted* wavelength ratio: T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   The problem states that the stars \"appeared brightest\" at the same wavelength. This means their *observed* peak wavelengths are equal: λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n    *   We must use the Doppler effect to connect the observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths.\n        *   For Star_1: v_r,₁ = 0, so there is no Doppler shift. Thus, λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n        *   For Star_2: v_r,₂ = 700 km/s. Its light is redshifted, so λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the expressions equal:\n        λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n    *   Now, we can find the ratio of emitted wavelengths needed for our temperature calculation:\n        λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        **T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)**\n\n5.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    Substitute the derived ratios for radius and temperature back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)⁴\n\n    Plugging in the numerical values:\n    *   v_r,₂ = 700 km/s\n    *   c (speed of light) ≈ 300,000 km/s\n    *   v_r,₂/c = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ **2.229**\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) ~2.35\n    B) ~2.23\n    C) ~2.32\n    D) ~2.25\n\n    The calculated value of 2.229 is closest to **2.23**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength:** The most crucial distinction is between the *observed* peak wavelength (\"appeared brightest\") and the *emitted* peak wavelength. The problem states the observed wavelengths are the same, but Wien's Law relates temperature to the emitted wavelength.\n*   **Necessity of the Doppler Effect:** The radial velocity information is essential. It provides the link between the observed and emitted wavelengths. Ignoring it is a common trap.\n*   **The \"2.25\" Distractor:** If one incorrectly assumes that equal observed wavelengths mean equal temperatures (T₁ = T₂), the calculation simplifies to L₁/L₂ = (1.5)² = 2.25. This corresponds to option D, making it a very plausible but incorrect answer.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The information about the stars' masses (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is irrelevant to this problem, which is based on the principles of black body radiation, not stellar structure or mass-luminosity relationships. It is included as a distractor.\n*   **Physical Intuition:** Because Star 2 is moving away, its light is redshifted (wavelength is stretched). For its observed wavelength to match Star 1's, it must be emitting light at a shorter wavelength. A shorter emitted wavelength implies a higher temperature (T₂ > T₁). Since T₂ is slightly higher, the (T₁/T₂)⁴ term is slightly less than 1, making the final answer slightly less than 2.25.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the provided answers and identifying the correct approach.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to the luminosity of Star_2 (L₁ / L₂).\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Physical Laws:** The problem assumes the stars radiate as black bodies, which requires the application of three core principles:\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law states that a star's total luminosity (L) is proportional to its surface area and the fourth power of its surface temperature (T). The formula is `L = 4πR²σT⁴`.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law connects a star's surface temperature (T) to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation (`λ_emitted`). Temperature is inversely proportional to this wavelength, so `T ∝ 1/λ_emitted`.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** This effect relates the *observed* wavelength (`λ_obs`) to the *emitted* wavelength (`λ_emitted`) based on the star's radial velocity (`v`). The formula for non-relativistic speeds is `λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c)`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    The constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, leaving the core equation:\n    **L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴**\n\n4.  **Calculate the Component Ratios:**\n    *   **Radius Ratio Term:** The problem states that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore, the first part of the equation is:\n        `(R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25`\n    *   **Temperature Ratio Term:** This is the most critical part of the calculation.\n        *   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the *emitted* wavelength ratio: `T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁`.\n        *   The problem states that the stars \"appeared brightest\" at the same wavelength, meaning their *observed* peak wavelengths are equal: `λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂`.\n        *   We must use the Doppler effect to connect the observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths.\n            *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0, so there is no Doppler shift: `λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁`.\n            *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. Its light is redshifted (shifted to a longer wavelength): `λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v₂/c)`.\n        *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the expressions equal to each other: `λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v₂/c)`.\n        *   To find the temperature ratio, we need to rearrange this for `λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁`:\n            `λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)`\n        *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is: `T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)`.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Substitute the derived ratios for the radius and temperature back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\n    Now, plug in the numerical values:\n    *   v₂ = 700 km/s\n    *   c (speed of light) ≈ 300,000 km/s\n    *   v₂/c = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333\n\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ **2.229**\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229. Comparing this to the given options:\n    *   A) ~2.32\n    *   B) ~2.25\n    *   C) ~2.23\n    *   D) ~2.35\n\n    The calculated value of 2.229 is closest to **2.23**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength:** The most critical point is to distinguish between the *observed* peak wavelength (\"appeared brightest\") and the *emitted* peak wavelength. Wien's Law applies to the emitted wavelength, while the problem's key information is about the observed wavelength.\n*   **Necessity of the Doppler Effect:** The radial velocity information is essential. It is the key to finding the true temperature difference between the stars. Ignoring it leads to the incorrect assumption that the temperatures are equal, resulting in an answer of 2.25 (Option B).\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The information about the stars' masses (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is a distractor and is not needed for this calculation, which is based on black body radiation principles.\n*   **Direction of the Effect:** Since Star 2 is moving away, its light is redshifted. For it to be observed at the same wavelength as the stationary Star 1, its emitted light must be at a shorter wavelength. A shorter emitted wavelength implies a higher temperature (T₂ > T₁). This means the final luminosity ratio must be slightly less than 2.25, which serves as a good sanity check for the calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this problem by combining three key principles from physics: the Stefan-Boltzmann Law for black body radiation, Wien's Displacement Law relating temperature to peak wavelength, and the Doppler Effect for moving sources.\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity ratio is `L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴`.\n2.  **Given Information:** We know `(R₁/R₂)² = 1.5² = 2.25`. The mass information is extraneous.\n3.  **Wien's Law & Doppler Effect:** The crucial part is finding the temperature ratio. The problem states the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (`λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂`). However, Wien's Law relates temperature to the *emitted* wavelength (`T ∝ 1/λ_emitted`). We must use the Doppler effect to connect these.\n    *   For Star 1 (v=0), `λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁`.\n    *   For Star 2 (v=700 km/s), `λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v₂/c)`.\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, `λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v₂/c)`.\n4.  **Temperature Ratio:** From Wien's Law, `T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁`. Substituting from the previous step, we get `T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)`.\n5.  **Final Calculation:** I will substitute these ratios into the luminosity formula and use Python to calculate the final numerical value, which will then be compared to the given options.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The information about the stars' masses is a distractor and should be ignored.\n*   The most common mistake is to confuse the *observed* peak wavelength with the *emitted* peak wavelength. The problem states the observed wavelengths are the same, but Wien's law requires the emitted wavelengths to determine temperature.\n*   The radial velocity information is essential. Ignoring it would lead to the incorrect assumption that the temperatures are equal (since the observed wavelengths are equal), resulting in an answer of 2.25.\n\n```python\n# Define the given values and constants\n# Ratio of the radii of Star_1 to Star_2\nradius_ratio = 1.5\n# Radial velocity of Star_2 in km/s\nv2_kms = 700\n# Speed of light in km/s (using a precise value for accuracy)\nc_kms = 299792.458\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the radius term of the luminosity ratio formula.\n# L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\n# The radius term is (R1/R2)^2\nradius_term = radius_ratio**2\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the temperature ratio (T1/T2).\n# As derived from the Doppler effect and Wien's Law, T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c).\n# This is because Star 2's light is redshifted, so for its observed wavelength\n# to match Star 1's, its emitted wavelength must be shorter, meaning it's hotter.\ntemperature_ratio = 1 / (1 + v2_kms / c_kms)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the temperature term of the luminosity ratio formula.\n# The temperature term is (T1/T2)^4\ntemperature_term = temperature_ratio**4\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the final luminosity ratio (L1/L2).\nluminosity_ratio = radius_term * temperature_term\n\n# Step 5: Print the final result and compare with the options.\nprint(f\"The calculated luminosity ratio is: {luminosity_ratio}\")\nprint(\"The given options are:\")\nprint(\"A) ~2.23\")\nprint(\"B) ~2.25\")\nprint(\"C) ~2.32\")\nprint(\"D) ~2.35\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to 2.23.\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The calculated luminosity ratio is: 2.229107561148499\nThe given options are:\nA) ~2.23\nB) ~2.25\nC) ~2.32\nD) ~2.35\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 2.23.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating the careful points identified from the candidate answers.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Goal and Relevant Physical Principles**\nThe primary goal is to calculate the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, L₁/L₂. The problem assumes the stars radiate as black bodies, which means the solution requires three key physical laws:\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law relates a star's luminosity (L) to its radius (R) and surface temperature (T). The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴.\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a star's surface temperature (T) to the peak wavelength of the light it *emits* in its own rest frame (λ_emitted). The relationship is T ∝ 1/λ_emitted.\n3.  **Doppler Effect:** This effect relates the *observed* wavelength (λ_obs) to the *emitted* wavelength (λ_emitted) based on the star's radial velocity (v_r). The formula is λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c).\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, we can set up the ratio of the luminosities. The constants (4, π, σ) cancel out:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Radius Term**\nThe problem states that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore, the first part of the equation is:\n(R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Temperature Ratio (The Critical Step)**\nThis step requires careful handling of the wavelength information.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength.** The problem states the stars \"appeared brightest\" at the same wavelength. This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs), which is affected by motion. Wien's Law, however, uses the *emitted* peak wavelength (λ_emitted).\n*   **Careful Point 2: Applying the Doppler Effect.** We must use the Doppler effect to connect λ_obs and λ_emitted.\n    *   For Star 1: v_r,₁ = 0, so there is no Doppler shift. Thus, λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   For Star 2: v_r,₂ = 700 km/s. Its light is redshifted (shifted to a longer wavelength). Thus, λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n*   **Deriving the Temperature Ratio:** Since we are given λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂, we can set the expressions equal:\n    λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n    From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁. Rearranging the equation above gives us this ratio:\n    λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n    Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n    T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n\n**Step 5: Combine Terms and Perform the Final Calculation**\nSubstitute the derived ratios for the radius and temperature back into the luminosity ratio formula:\nL₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)]⁴ = 2.25 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)⁴\n\nNow, plug in the numerical values:\n*   v_r,₂ = 700 km/s\n*   c (speed of light) ≈ 300,000 km/s\n*   v_r,₂/c = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333\n\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion and Final Check**\nThe calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Ignoring Extraneous Information.** The information about the mass ratio (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is not needed for this calculation and is a distractor.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Comparing with Options.** The calculated value of 2.229 is closest to the option ~2.23.

Wien's Law applies to the emitted wavelength, while the problem's crucial piece of data is about the observed wavelength.\n*   **Necessity of the Doppler Effect:** The radial velocity information is essential and not extraneous. It is the key to linking the observed wavelength to the emitted wavelength and thus correctly determining the temperature ratio.\n*   **The \"Trap\" Answer:** Ignoring the Doppler effect leads to the incorrect assumption that the temperatures are equal (T₁ = T₂). This would make the temperature ratio term equal to 1, resulting in a final answer of L₁/L₂ = 2.25, which corresponds to option B.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The information that the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 is a distractor and is not relevant to calculating luminosity from the black body radiation model.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the provided answers and identifying the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to the luminosity of Star_2 (L₁ / L₂).\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Physical Laws:** The solution requires the application of three core principles from physics:\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law states that the total luminosity (L) of a star radiating as a black body is proportional to its surface area and the fourth power of its surface temperature (T). The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a star's surface temperature (T) to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation (λ_emitted). Temperature is inversely proportional to this wavelength, so T ∝ 1/λ_emitted.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** This effect describes how the *observed* wavelength (λ_obs) of light is shifted from its *emitted* wavelength (λ_emitted) due to the source's radial velocity (v_r). The formula is λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c).\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    The constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n4.  **Calculate the Component Ratios:**\n    *   **Radius Ratio Term:** The problem states that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore, the first part of the equation is:\n        (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n    *   **Temperature Ratio Term:** This is the most critical part of the calculation.\n        *   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the *emitted* wavelength ratio: T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁.\n        *   The problem states that the stars \"appeared brightest\" at the same wavelength, meaning their *observed* peak wavelengths are equal: λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n        *   We must use the Doppler effect to connect the observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths.\n        *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0, so there is no Doppler shift: λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n        *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s, so its light is redshifted: λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n        *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the expressions equal: λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n        *   To find the temperature ratio, we need to rearrange this equation to solve for λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁:\n          λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n        *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n\n5.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    Substitute the derived ratios for the radius and temperature back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)⁴\n\n    Now, plug in the numerical values (v_r,₂ = 700 km/s and c ≈ 300,000 km/s):\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700/300000)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229. Comparing this to the given options:\n    *   A) ~2.25\n    *   B) ~2.35\n    *   C) ~2.23\n    *   D) ~2.32\n\n    The calculated value of 2.229 is closest to 2.23.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Distractor Information:** The information about the stars' masses (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is extraneous and not needed to solve the problem using the principles of black body radiation.\n*   **Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength:** This is the most crucial distinction in the problem. The statement that the stars \"appeared brightest\" at the same wavelength refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs). However, Wien's Law, which relates wavelength to temperature, applies to the *emitted* peak wavelength (λ_emitted) in the star's own reference frame. The Doppler effect is the essential link between these two concepts.\n*   **The Consequence of Ignoring the Doppler Effect:** A common mistake is to assume that because the observed wavelengths are the same, the temperatures must also be the same (T₁ = T₂). This would lead to an incorrect answer of L₁/L₂ = (1.5)² = 2.25 (Option A). The problem provides specific radial velocity data, indicating that it is necessary for the calculation.\n*   **Physical Interpretation:** Because Star_2 is moving away from the observer, its light is redshifted (its observed wavelength is longer than its emitted wavelength). For its observed wavelength to match Star_1's (which is at rest), Star_2's emitted wavelength must be shorter. According to Wien's Law, a shorter peak emission wavelength corresponds to a higher temperature. Therefore, Star_2 is slightly hotter than Star_1. This higher temperature for Star_2 slightly reduces the luminosity ratio, bringing it down from 2.25 to ~2.23.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers and a first-principles approach to the problem, here is a definitive step-by-step breakdown.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Equation for Luminosity:** The problem assumes the stars radiate as black bodies. The luminosity (L) of a black body is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n    $L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** To find how many times greater the luminosity of Star_1 is than Star_2, we compute the ratio L₁/L₂. The constants (4, π, σ) cancel out:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Radius Term:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 ($R_1 = 1.5 R_2$). Therefore, the first part of the equation is:\n    $(R_1/R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Temperature Term:** This is the most critical part of the problem and requires combining two physical laws.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law** states that a star's temperature (T) is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of the light it *emits* ($\\lambda_{emitted}$). This means the temperature ratio is the inverse of the emitted wavelength ratio: $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{emitted,2} / \\lambda_{emitted,1}$.\n    *   **The Doppler Effect** must be used because the problem states the wavelengths at which the stars \"*appeared* brightest\" are the same. This refers to the *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$), which is affected by the star's motion. The relationship is $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emitted} (1 + v_r/c)$.\n\n5.  **Connecting the Wavelengths:**\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity ($v_{r,1}$) is 0, so there is no Doppler shift. Its observed wavelength equals its emitted wavelength: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{emitted,1}$.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity ($v_{r,2}$) is 700 km/s. Its light is redshifted. Its observed wavelength is: $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{emitted,2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n    *   Since we are given that $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we can set the expressions equal:\n        $\\lambda_{emitted,1} = \\lambda_{emitted,2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n    *   To find the temperature ratio, we need the ratio of emitted wavelengths, which we can find by rearranging the equation:\n        $\\lambda_{emitted,2} / \\lambda_{emitted,1} = 1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        $T_1/T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the radius and temperature terms back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (2.25) \\times [1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)]^4 = 2.25 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)^4$\n    Plugging in the values ($v_{r,2} = 700 \\text{ km/s}$ and $c \\approx 300,000 \\text{ km/s}$):\n    $L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.25 / (1 + 700/300000)^4$\n    $L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.25 / (1.002333)^4$\n    $L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.25 / 1.009365$\n    $L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.229$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The information about the stars' masses (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is a distractor and is not relevant to the calculation of luminosity based on black body radiation principles.\n*   **Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength:** The crucial distinction is between the \"observed\" peak wavelength (what astronomers see) and the \"emitted\" peak wavelength (what the star is actually producing in its own reference frame). Wien's Law applies to the emitted wavelength, while the problem gives information about the observed wavelength.\n*   **The Doppler Effect is Key:** The radial velocity data is essential. It is the link between the observed and emitted wavelengths. Ignoring it leads to the incorrect assumption that the temperatures are equal, which would yield an answer of 2.25 (Option D).\n*   **Logical Check:** Since Star_2 is moving away, its light is redshifted (wavelength is stretched). For its observed wavelength to match Star_1's, its emitted wavelength must be shorter. According to Wien's Law, a shorter emitted wavelength means a higher temperature. Therefore, T₂ must be slightly greater than T₁. Since T₂ is in the denominator of the luminosity ratio and raised to the fourth power, the final answer must be slightly less than 2.25, which our calculation confirms.\n\nThe calculated value of ~2.229 is closest to 2.23.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the provided answers to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal and Governing Laws:** The objective is to find the luminosity ratio L₁/L₂.

Temperature is inversely proportional to this wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_emitted).\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** This effect relates the *observed* wavelength (λ_obs) to the *emitted* wavelength based on the star's radial velocity (v_r). The formula is λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Radius Term:**\n    The problem states that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore, the radius term in the luminosity equation is:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n3.  **Calculate the Temperature Term:**\n    This is the most critical part of the problem and requires careful handling of the wavelength information.\n    *   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the *emitted* wavelength ratio: T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   The problem states that the stars \"appeared brightest\" at the same wavelength, meaning their *observed* peak wavelengths are equal: λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n    *   We must use the Doppler effect to connect the observed and emitted wavelengths:\n        *   For Star_1, with v_r,₁ = 0, there is no shift: λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n        *   For Star_2, with v_r,₂ = 700 km/s, the light is redshifted: λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the expressions equal to each other: λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   To find the temperature ratio, we rearrange this equation to get the ratio of emitted wavelengths: λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Now, we substitute the radius and temperature terms back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)]⁴ = 2.25 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)⁴\n\n    Plugging in the numerical values (v_r,₂ = 700 km/s and c ≈ 300,000 km/s):\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700/300,000)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength:** The crucial distinction is between the *observed* peak wavelength (\"appeared brightest\") and the *emitted* peak wavelength. Wien's Law applies to the emitted wavelength, while the problem's key piece of data concerns the observed wavelength. The Doppler effect is the necessary link.\n*   **Relevance of Velocity Data:** The radial velocity of Star_2 is essential information. Ignoring it leads to the incorrect assumption that the temperatures are equal, resulting in an answer of 2.25 (Option B). The fact that Star_2 is moving away means its temperature must be slightly higher than Star_1's for their observed peak wavelengths to match.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The information about the stars' masses (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is a distractor and is not relevant to the black-body luminosity calculation.\n*   **Sensitivity to Temperature:** The fourth power in the Stefan-Boltzmann law means that even a small difference in temperature, caused by the Doppler shift, has a noticeable impact on the final luminosity ratio.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation consistently yields a value of approximately 2.229. Comparing this to the provided options:\n*   A) ~2.23\n*   B) ~2.25\n*   C) ~2.35\n*   D) ~2.32\n\nThe calculated value of 2.229 is closest to 2.23.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer, synthesizing the provided candidate solutions.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem and Identify the Goal\nThe primary objective is to calculate the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to that of Star_2 (L₁ / L₂).\n\n**Given Information:**\n*   Radius of Star_1: R₁ = 1.5 × R₂\n*   Mass of Star_1: M₁ = 1.5 × M₂\n*   Radial Velocity of Star_1: v₁ = 0 km/s\n*   Radial Velocity of Star_2: v₂ = 700 km/s\n*   The stars radiate as black bodies.\n*   The wavelengths at which the stars *appeared* brightest are the same (λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂).\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Relevant Physical Laws\nThe solution requires the application of three core principles of astrophysics:\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a black body is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** A star's surface temperature (T) is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation (λ_emitted). Therefore, T ∝ 1/λ_emitted.\n3.  **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength (λ_obs) of light is shifted from the *emitted* wavelength (λ_emitted) due to the star's radial velocity (v). The non-relativistic formula is λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c).\n\n### Step 3: Formulate and Solve the Luminosity Ratio\nFrom the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of luminosities is:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\nThe constants cancel out, leaving:\n**L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² × (T₁/T₂)⁴**\n\n**A. Calculate the Radius Term:**\nThe problem states R₁ = 1.5 × R₂.\nTherefore, (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = **2.25**.\n\n**B. Calculate the Temperature Term:**\nThis is the most critical part of the calculation.\n*   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the *emitted* wavelength ratio: T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁.\n*   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n*   We must use the Doppler effect to connect the observed and emitted wavelengths:\n    *   For Star_1 (v₁ = 0): λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   For Star_2 (v₂ = 700 km/s): λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n*   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the expressions equal to each other:\n    λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n*   To find the temperature ratio, we need the ratio of emitted wavelengths. Rearranging the equation gives:\n    λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n*   Therefore, the temperature ratio is **T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)**.\n\n**C. Final Calculation:**\nSubstitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity formula:\nL₁ / L₂ = (2.25) × [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\nNow, plug in the numerical values (v₂ = 700 km/s and c ≈ 300,000 km/s):\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700/300,000)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365\n**L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229**\n\n### Step 4: Compare with Options and List Careful Points\nThe calculated value is approximately 2.229.

The Doppler effect is the necessary link.\n*   **The \"2.25\" Trap:** Ignoring the Doppler effect and incorrectly assuming the temperatures are equal (because the observed wavelengths are equal) would lead to an answer of L₁/L₂ = (1.5)² = 2.25. This is a common pitfall.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The information about the mass ratio (M₁ = 1.5 M₂) is a distractor and is not relevant to the calculation of luminosity based on black body radiation principles.\n*   **Impact of Velocity:** Because Star_2 is moving away, its light is redshifted. For its observed wavelength to match Star_1's, its emitted wavelength must be shorter, meaning Star_2 is actually slightly hotter than Star_1. This is why the final luminosity ratio is slightly less than 2.25.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer, synthesizing the correct logic from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Governing Physical Laws\n\nTo solve this problem, three core principles of astrophysics are required:\n1.  **The Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: This law states that the total luminosity (L) of a star radiating as a black body is proportional to its surface area (which depends on the square of its radius, R) and the fourth power of its surface temperature (T). The formula is $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$.\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law**: This law relates a star's surface temperature (T) to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation ($\\lambda_{emitted}$). Temperature is inversely proportional to this wavelength, so $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{emitted}$.\n3.  **The Doppler Effect**: This effect describes how the motion of a source changes the *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) of its radiation. For a source moving away with radial velocity $v_r$, the observed wavelength is redshifted (lengthened) according to the formula $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emitted} (1 + v_r/c)$, where c is the speed of light.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Luminosity Ratio\n\nFrom the Stefan-Boltzmann law, we can set up a ratio of the luminosities of the two stars. The constants ($4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$) cancel out:\n$L_1 / L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Component Ratios\n\n*   **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2$. Therefore, the squared ratio is:\n    $(R_1/R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$\n\n*   **Temperature Ratio**: This is the most critical part of the calculation.\n    *   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the *emitted* wavelength ratio: $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{emitted,2} / \\lambda_{emitted,1}$.\n    *   The problem states that the stars \"appeared brightest\" at the same wavelength, meaning their *observed* peak wavelengths are equal: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n    *   We must use the Doppler effect to connect the observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths.\n        *   For Star 1, with $v_{r,1} = 0$, there is no Doppler shift: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{emitted,1}$.\n        *   For Star 2, with $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s, the light is redshifted: $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{emitted,2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the expressions equal to each other: $\\lambda_{emitted,1} = \\lambda_{emitted,2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n    *   Rearranging this to find the ratio needed for the temperature calculation gives: $\\lambda_{emitted,2} / \\lambda_{emitted,1} = 1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is: $T_1/T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\n\nNow, substitute the derived ratios for the radius and temperature back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n$L_1 / L_2 = (2.25) \\times [1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)]^4 = 2.25 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)^4$\n\nPlugging in the numerical values:\n*   $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s\n*   $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s (speed of light)\n*   $v_{r,2}/c = 700 / 300,000 \\approx 0.002333$\n\n$L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)^4$\n$L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.25 / (1.002333)^4$\n$L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.25 / 1.009365$\n$L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.229$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength**: The most common error is failing to distinguish between the *observed* peak wavelength (given as equal for both stars) and the *emitted* peak wavelength (which determines temperature via Wien's Law). The Doppler effect is the crucial link between them.\n2.  **Ignoring the Doppler Effect**: If one incorrectly assumes that equal observed wavelengths mean equal temperatures, the temperature ratio term $(T_1/T_2)^4$ becomes 1. This leads to an incorrect answer of $L_1/L_2 = 2.25$, which is option C. The presence of specific radial velocity data is a clear signal that it must be used.\n3.  **Extraneous Information**: The fact that the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times larger is irrelevant for this problem, which is based on the principles of black body radiation, not stellar structure or gravity. This information is a distractor.\n4.  **Direction of the Effect**: Because Star 2 is moving away, its light is redshifted. For it to be *observed* at the same wavelength as the stationary Star 1, it must *emit* light at a shorter (bluer) wavelength. According to Wien's Law, a shorter emitted wavelength means a higher temperature. Therefore, $T_2 > T_1$. Since $T_2$ is in the denominator of the luminosity ratio, the final answer must be less than 2.25, which is consistent with our calculation.\n\nThe calculated value of ~2.229 is closest to the option 2.23.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Based on a comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers, all of which follow the same correct physical reasoning, here is the definitive step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal and Governing Laws:** The objective is to find the luminosity ratio L₁/L₂. Since the stars are treated as black bodies, the solution requires three physical principles:\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** A star's luminosity (L) is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴. The ratio of luminosities for two stars simplifies to L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** A star's surface temperature (T) is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation (λ_emitted). This means the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** This relates the *observed* wavelength (λ_obs) to the *emitted* wavelength based on the source's radial velocity (v_r) via the formula λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Radius Term:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). Therefore, the radius term in the luminosity ratio is:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = **2.25**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Temperature Term:** This is the most critical part of the problem and requires careful handling of the wavelength information.\n    *   The problem states that the stars \"appeared brightest\" at the same wavelength. This refers to their **observed** peak wavelengths being equal: λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n    *   We must use the Doppler effect to find the ratio of their **emitted** wavelengths, which determines their temperature ratio.\n    *   For Star 1: The radial velocity is 0, so there is no Doppler shift. Thus, λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   For Star 2: The radial velocity is 700 km/s, so its light is redshifted. Thus, λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the expressions equal: λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   To find the temperature ratio, we need the ratio of the emitted wavelengths, λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁. Rearranging the equation gives: λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = **1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)**.\n\n4.  **Combine and Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:** Substitute the derived terms for the radius and temperature back into the main formula:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)⁴\n\n    Now, plug in the numerical values (v_r,₂ = 700 km/s and c ≈ 300,000 km/s):\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 700/300000)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ **2.229**\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229.

The problem states the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same, but Wien's Law, which determines temperature, depends on the *emitted* peak wavelength. The Doppler effect is the essential bridge between these two concepts.\n*   **The \"Trap\" Answer:** A common mistake is to ignore the Doppler effect. If one incorrectly assumes that equal observed wavelengths mean equal temperatures (T₁ = T₂), the answer would be L₁/L₂ = (1.5)² = 2.25. This corresponds to option C and is a classic distractor.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The information that the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times larger is irrelevant for this problem, which is based on black body radiation principles, not stellar structure models. It is included to distract or confuse.\n*   **Necessity of the Doppler Effect:** The radial velocity data is provided for a reason and is essential for the calculation. Ignoring it leads to an incorrect answer.\n*   **Physical Sanity Check:** Because Star_2 is moving away, its light is redshifted (wavelength is stretched). For its observed wavelength to match that of the stationary Star_1, its emitted wavelength must be shorter (bluer). According to Wien's Law, a shorter emitted wavelength means a higher temperature. Therefore, Star_2 is slightly hotter than Star_1. Since luminosity depends on T⁴ and T₂ is in the denominator of the L₁/L₂ ratio, the final answer must be slightly less than 2.25, which the calculation confirms.\n\n<<<A>>>"

Wien's Law applies to the emitted wavelength, while the problem's key information is about the observed wavelength.\n*   **Necessity of the Doppler Effect:** The radial velocity information is essential. It is the key to finding the true temperature difference between the stars. Ignoring it leads to the incorrect assumption that the temperatures are equal, resulting in an answer of 2.25 (Option B).\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The information about the stars' masses (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is a distractor and is not needed for this calculation, which is based on black body radiation principles.\n*   **Direction of the Effect:** Since Star 2 is moving away, its light is redshifted. For it to be observed at the same wavelength as the stationary Star 1, its emitted light must be at a shorter wavelength. A shorter emitted wavelength implies a higher temperature (T₂ > T₁). This means the final luminosity ratio must be slightly less than 2.25, which serves as a good sanity check for the calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this problem by combining three key principles from physics: the Stefan-Boltzmann Law for black body radiation, Wien's Displacement Law relating temperature to peak wavelength, and the Doppler Effect for moving sources.\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity ratio is `L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴`.\n2.  **Given Information:** We know `(R₁/R₂)² = 1.5² = 2.25`. The mass information is extraneous.\n3.  **Wien's Law & Doppler Effect:** The crucial part is finding the temperature ratio. The problem states the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (`λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂`). However, Wien's Law relates temperature to the *emitted* wavelength (`T ∝ 1/λ_emitted`). We must use the Doppler effect to connect these.\n    *   For Star 1 (v=0), `λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁`.\n    *   For Star 2 (v=700 km/s), `λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v₂/c)`.\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, `λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v₂/c)`.\n4.  **Temperature Ratio:** From Wien's Law, `T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁`. Substituting from the previous step, we get `T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)`.\n5.  **Final Calculation:** I will substitute these ratios into the luminosity formula and use Python to calculate the final numerical value, which will then be compared to the given options.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The information about the stars' masses is a distractor and should be ignored.\n*   The most common mistake is to confuse the *observed* peak wavelength with the *emitted* peak wavelength. The problem states the observed wavelengths are the same, but Wien's law requires the emitted wavelengths to determine temperature.\n*   The radial velocity information is essential. Ignoring it would lead to the incorrect assumption that the temperatures are equal (since the observed wavelengths are equal), resulting in an answer of 2.25.\n\n```python\n# Define the given values and constants\n# Ratio of the radii of Star_1 to Star_2\nradius_ratio = 1.5\n# Radial velocity of Star_2 in km/s\nv2_kms = 700\n# Speed of light in km/s (using a precise value for accuracy)\nc_kms = 299792.458\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the radius term of the luminosity ratio formula.\n# L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\n# The radius term is (R1/R2)^2\nradius_term = radius_ratio**2\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the temperature ratio (T1/T2).\n# As derived from the Doppler effect and Wien's Law, T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c).\n# This is because Star 2's light is redshifted, so for its observed wavelength\n# to match Star 1's, its emitted wavelength must be shorter, meaning it's hotter.\ntemperature_ratio = 1 / (1 + v2_kms / c_kms)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the temperature term of the luminosity ratio formula.\n# The temperature term is (T1/T2)^4\ntemperature_term = temperature_ratio**4\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the final luminosity ratio (L1/L2).\nluminosity_ratio = radius_term * temperature_term\n\n# Step 5: Print the final result and compare with the options.\nprint(f\"The calculated luminosity ratio is: {luminosity_ratio}\")\nprint(\"The given options are:\")\nprint(\"A) ~2.23\")\nprint(\"B) ~2.25\")\nprint(\"C) ~2.32\")\nprint(\"D) ~2.35\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to 2.23.\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The calculated luminosity ratio is: 2.229107561148499\nThe given options are:\nA) ~2.23\nB) ~2.25\nC) ~2.32\nD) ~2.35\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 2.23.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating the careful points identified from the candidate answers.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Goal and Relevant Physical Principles**\nThe primary goal is to calculate the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, L₁/L₂. The problem assumes the stars radiate as black bodies, which means the solution requires three key physical laws:\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law relates a star's luminosity (L) to its radius (R) and surface temperature (T). The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴.\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a star's surface temperature (T) to the peak wavelength of the light it *emits* in its own rest frame (λ_emitted). The relationship is T ∝ 1/λ_emitted.\n3.  **Doppler Effect:** This effect relates the *observed* wavelength (λ_obs) to the *emitted* wavelength (λ_emitted) based on the star's radial velocity (v_r). The formula is λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c).\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, we can set up the ratio of the luminosities. The constants (4, π, σ) cancel out:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Radius Term**\nThe problem states that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore, the first part of the equation is:\n(R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Temperature Ratio (The Critical Step)**\nThis step requires careful handling of the wavelength information.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength.** The problem states the stars \"appeared brightest\" at the same wavelength. This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs), which is affected by motion. Wien's Law, however, uses the *emitted* peak wavelength (λ_emitted).\n*   **Careful Point 2: Applying the Doppler Effect.** We must use the Doppler effect to connect λ_obs and λ_emitted.\n    *   For Star 1: v_r,₁ = 0, so there is no Doppler shift. Thus, λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   For Star 2: v_r,₂ = 700 km/s. Its light is redshifted (shifted to a longer wavelength). Thus, λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n*   **Deriving the Temperature Ratio:** Since we are given λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂, we can set the expressions equal:\n    λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n    From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁. Rearranging the equation above gives us this ratio:\n    λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n    Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n    T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n\n**Step 5: Combine Terms and Perform the Final Calculation**\nSubstitute the derived ratios for the radius and temperature back into the luminosity ratio formula:\nL₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)]⁴ = 2.25 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)⁴\n\nNow, plug in the numerical values:\n*   v_r,₂ = 700 km/s\n*   c (speed of light) ≈ 300,000 km/s\n*   v_r,₂/c = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333\n\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion and Final Check**\nThe calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Ignoring Extraneous Information.** The information about the mass ratio (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is not needed for this calculation and is a distractor.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Comparing with Options.** The calculated value of 2.229 is closest to the option ~2.23.

The statement that the stars \"appeared brightest\" at the same wavelength refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs). However, Wien's Law, which relates wavelength to temperature, applies to the *emitted* peak wavelength (λ_emitted) in the star's own reference frame. The Doppler effect is the essential link between these two concepts.\n*   **The Consequence of Ignoring the Doppler Effect:** A common mistake is to assume that because the observed wavelengths are the same, the temperatures must also be the same (T₁ = T₂). This would lead to an incorrect answer of L₁/L₂ = (1.5)² = 2.25 (Option A). The problem provides specific radial velocity data, indicating that it is necessary for the calculation.\n*   **Physical Interpretation:** Because Star_2 is moving away from the observer, its light is redshifted (its observed wavelength is longer than its emitted wavelength). For its observed wavelength to match Star_1's (which is at rest), Star_2's emitted wavelength must be shorter. According to Wien's Law, a shorter peak emission wavelength corresponds to a higher temperature. Therefore, Star_2 is slightly hotter than Star_1.

The constants (4, π, σ) cancel out:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Radius Term:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 ($R_1 = 1.5 R_2$). Therefore, the first part of the equation is:\n    $(R_1/R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Temperature Term:** This is the most critical part of the problem and requires combining two physical laws.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law** states that a star's temperature (T) is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of the light it *emits* ($\\lambda_{emitted}$). This means the temperature ratio is the inverse of the emitted wavelength ratio: $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{emitted,2} / \\lambda_{emitted,1}$.\n    *   **The Doppler Effect** must be used because the problem states the wavelengths at which the stars \"*appeared* brightest\" are the same. This refers to the *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$), which is affected by the star's motion. The relationship is $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emitted} (1 + v_r/c)$.\n\n5.  **Connecting the Wavelengths:**\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity ($v_{r,1}$) is 0, so there is no Doppler shift. Its observed wavelength equals its emitted wavelength: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{emitted,1}$.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity ($v_{r,2}$) is 700 km/s. Its light is redshifted. Its observed wavelength is: $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{emitted,2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n    *   Since we are given that $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we can set the expressions equal:\n        $\\lambda_{emitted,1} = \\lambda_{emitted,2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n    *   To find the temperature ratio, we need the ratio of emitted wavelengths, which we can find by rearranging the equation:\n        $\\lambda_{emitted,2} / \\lambda_{emitted,1} = 1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        $T_1/T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the radius and temperature terms back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (2.25) \\times [1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)]^4 = 2.25 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)^4$\n    Plugging in the values ($v_{r,2} = 700 \\text{ km/s}$ and $c \\approx 300,000 \\text{ km/s}$):\n    $L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.25 / (1 + 700/300000)^4$\n    $L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.25 / (1.002333)^4$\n    $L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.25 / 1.009365$\n    $L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.229$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The information about the stars' masses (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is a distractor and is not relevant to the calculation of luminosity based on black body radiation principles.\n*   **Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength:** The crucial distinction is between the \"observed\" peak wavelength (what astronomers see) and the \"emitted\" peak wavelength (what the star is actually producing in its own reference frame). Wien's Law applies to the emitted wavelength, while the problem gives information about the observed wavelength.\n*   **The Doppler Effect is Key:** The radial velocity data is essential. It is the link between the observed and emitted wavelengths. Ignoring it leads to the incorrect assumption that the temperatures are equal, which would yield an answer of 2.25 (Option D).\n*   **Logical Check:** Since Star_2 is moving away, its light is redshifted (wavelength is stretched). For its observed wavelength to match Star_1's, its emitted wavelength must be shorter. According to Wien's Law, a shorter emitted wavelength means a higher temperature. Therefore, T₂ must be slightly greater than T₁. Since T₂ is in the denominator of the luminosity ratio and raised to the fourth power, the final answer must be slightly less than 2.25, which our calculation confirms.\n\nThe calculated value of ~2.229 is closest to 2.23.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the provided answers to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal and Governing Laws:** The objective is to find the luminosity ratio L₁/L₂. The problem assumes the stars are black bodies, so we must use three key physical principles:\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** Luminosity is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴. The ratio is L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** Temperature is inversely proportional to the *emitted* peak wavelength: T ∝ 1/λ_emitted. Therefore, T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** This relates the *observed* wavelength (λ_obs) to the *emitted* wavelength (λ_emitted) based on radial velocity (v_r): λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Radius Term:** The problem states R₁ = 1.5 * R₂.\n    *   Therefore, the radius term in the luminosity equation is (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = **2.25**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Temperature Term:** This is the most critical part of the problem.\n    *   The problem states the stars \"appeared brightest\" at the same wavelength, meaning their **observed** peak wavelengths are equal: λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n    *   We must use the Doppler effect to find the ratio of their **emitted** wavelengths, which determines their temperature ratio.\n    *   For Star 1: v_r,₁ = 0, so there is no Doppler shift. λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   For Star 2: v_r,₂ = 700 km/s.

It states that luminosity is proportional to the surface area (and thus the radius squared, R²) and the fourth power of the surface temperature (T). The formula is `L = 4πR²σT⁴`.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law connects a star's surface temperature (T) to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation (`λ_emitted`). Temperature is inversely proportional to this wavelength, so `T ∝ 1/λ_emitted`.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** This effect relates the *observed* wavelength (`λ_obs`) to the *emitted* wavelength (`λ_emitted`) based on the star's radial velocity (`v_r`).

The solution requires the application of three fundamental physical laws, as correctly identified by the majority of the candidate answers:\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law states that a star's luminosity (L) is proportional to its surface area and the fourth power of its surface temperature (T). The formula for the ratio is:\n        L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law connects a star's surface temperature to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation (λ_emitted). Temperature is inversely proportional to this wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_emitted).\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** This effect relates the *observed* wavelength (λ_obs) to the *emitted* wavelength based on the star's radial velocity (v_r). The formula is λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Radius Term:**\n    The problem states that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore, the radius term in the luminosity equation is:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n3.  **Calculate the Temperature Term:**\n    This is the most critical part of the problem and requires careful handling of the wavelength information.\n    *   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the *emitted* wavelength ratio: T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   The problem states that the stars \"appeared brightest\" at the same wavelength, meaning their *observed* peak wavelengths are equal: λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n    *   We must use the Doppler effect to connect the observed and emitted wavelengths:\n        *   For Star_1, with v_r,₁ = 0, there is no shift: λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n        *   For Star_2, with v_r,₂ = 700 km/s, the light is redshifted: λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the expressions equal to each other: λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   To find the temperature ratio, we rearrange this equation to get the ratio of emitted wavelengths: λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Now, we substitute the radius and temperature terms back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)]⁴ = 2.25 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)⁴\n\n    Plugging in the numerical values (v_r,₂ = 700 km/s and c ≈ 300,000 km/s):\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700/300,000)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength:** The crucial distinction is between the *observed* peak wavelength (\"appeared brightest\") and the *emitted* peak wavelength. Wien's Law applies to the emitted wavelength, while the problem's key piece of data concerns the observed wavelength.

Therefore, T ∝ 1/λ_emitted.\n3.  **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength (λ_obs) of light is shifted from the *emitted* wavelength (λ_emitted) due to the star's radial velocity (v). The non-relativistic formula is λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c).\n\n### Step 3: Formulate and Solve the Luminosity Ratio\nFrom the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of luminosities is:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\nThe constants cancel out, leaving:\n**L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² × (T₁/T₂)⁴**\n\n**A.

Calculate the Temperature Term:**\nThis is the most critical part of the calculation.\n*   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the *emitted* wavelength ratio: T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁.\n*   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n*   We must use the Doppler effect to connect the observed and emitted wavelengths:\n    *   For Star_1 (v₁ = 0): λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   For Star_2 (v₂ = 700 km/s): λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n*   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the expressions equal to each other:\n    λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n*   To find the temperature ratio, we need the ratio of emitted wavelengths. Rearranging the equation gives:\n    λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n*   Therefore, the temperature ratio is **T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)**.\n\n**C. Final Calculation:**\nSubstitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity formula:\nL₁ / L₂ = (2.25) × [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\nNow, plug in the numerical values (v₂ = 700 km/s and c ≈ 300,000 km/s):\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700/300,000)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365\n**L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229**\n\n### Step 4: Compare with Options and List Careful Points\nThe calculated value is approximately 2.229. Comparing this to the provided options:\n*   A) ~2.23\n*   B) ~2.32\n*   C) ~2.25\n*   D) ~2.35\n\nThe calculated value of 2.229 is closest to **2.23**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength:** The crucial distinction is that the problem gives information about the *observed* wavelength (\"appeared brightest\"), while Wien's Law relates temperature to the *emitted* wavelength. The Doppler effect is the necessary link.\n*   **The \"2.25\" Trap:** Ignoring the Doppler effect and incorrectly assuming the temperatures are equal (because the observed wavelengths are equal) would lead to an answer of L₁/L₂ = (1.5)² = 2.25. This is a common pitfall.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The information about the mass ratio (M₁ = 1.5 M₂) is a distractor and is not relevant to the calculation of luminosity based on black body radiation principles.\n*   **Impact of Velocity:** Because Star_2 is moving away, its light is redshifted. For its observed wavelength to match Star_1's, its emitted wavelength must be shorter, meaning Star_2 is actually slightly hotter than Star_1. This is why the final luminosity ratio is slightly less than 2.25.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer, synthesizing the correct logic from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Governing Physical Laws\n\nTo solve this problem, three core principles of astrophysics are required:\n1.  **The Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: This law states that the total luminosity (L) of a star radiating as a black body is proportional to its surface area (which depends on the square of its radius, R) and the fourth power of its surface temperature (T). The formula is $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$.\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law**: This law relates a star's surface temperature (T) to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation ($\\lambda_{emitted}$). Temperature is inversely proportional to this wavelength, so $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{emitted}$.\n3.  **The Doppler Effect**: This effect describes how the motion of a source changes the *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) of its radiation. For a source moving away with radial velocity $v_r$, the observed wavelength is redshifted (lengthened) according to the formula $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emitted} (1 + v_r/c)$, where c is the speed of light.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Luminosity Ratio\n\nFrom the Stefan-Boltzmann law, we can set up a ratio of the luminosities of the two stars. The constants ($4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$) cancel out:\n$L_1 / L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Component Ratios\n\n*   **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2$. Therefore, the squared ratio is:\n    $(R_1/R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$\n\n*   **Temperature Ratio**: This is the most critical part of the calculation.\n    *   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the *emitted* wavelength ratio: $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{emitted,2} / \\lambda_{emitted,1}$.\n    *   The problem states that the stars \"appeared brightest\" at the same wavelength, meaning their *observed* peak wavelengths are equal: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n    *   We must use the Doppler effect to connect the observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths.\n        *   For Star 1, with $v_{r,1} = 0$, there is no Doppler shift: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{emitted,1}$.\n        *   For Star 2, with $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s, the light is redshifted: $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{emitted,2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the expressions equal to each other: $\\lambda_{emitted,1} = \\lambda_{emitted,2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n    *   Rearranging this to find the ratio needed for the temperature calculation gives: $\\lambda_{emitted,2} / \\lambda_{emitted,1} = 1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is: $T_1/T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\n\nNow, substitute the derived ratios for the radius and temperature back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n$L_1 / L_2 = (2.25) \\times [1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)]^4 = 2.25 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)^4$\n\nPlugging in the numerical values:\n*   $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s\n*   $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s (speed of light)\n*   $v_{r,2}/c = 700 / 300,000 \\approx 0.002333$\n\n$L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)^4$\n$L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.25 / (1.002333)^4$\n$L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.25 / 1.009365$\n$L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.229$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength**: The most common error is failing to distinguish between the *observed* peak wavelength (given as equal for both stars) and the *emitted* peak wavelength (which determines temperature via Wien's Law). The Doppler effect is the crucial link between them.\n2.  **Ignoring the Doppler Effect**: If one incorrectly assumes that equal observed wavelengths mean equal temperatures, the temperature ratio term $(T_1/T_2)^4$ becomes 1. This leads to an incorrect answer of $L_1/L_2 = 2.25$, which is option C. The presence of specific radial velocity data is a clear signal that it must be used.\n3.  **Extraneous Information**: The fact that the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times larger is irrelevant for this problem, which is based on the principles of black body radiation, not stellar structure or gravity. This information is a distractor.\n4.  **Direction of the Effect**: Because Star 2 is moving away, its light is redshifted. For it to be *observed* at the same wavelength as the stationary Star 1, it must *emit* light at a shorter (bluer) wavelength. According to Wien's Law, a shorter emitted wavelength means a higher temperature. Therefore, $T_2 > T_1$. Since $T_2$ is in the denominator of the luminosity ratio, the final answer must be less than 2.25, which is consistent with our calculation.\n\nThe calculated value of ~2.229 is closest to the option 2.23.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
