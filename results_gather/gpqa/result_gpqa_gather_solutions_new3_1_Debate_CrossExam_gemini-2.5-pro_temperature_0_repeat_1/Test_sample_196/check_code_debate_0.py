    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer to the chemistry problem.
    It follows a logical deduction process based on the provided spectral data and reaction.
    
    1.  It deduces the structure of the starting material (Compound X) from the IR and NMR data.
    2.  It determines the transformation caused by the specified reagents (Red P / HI).
    3.  It identifies the structure of the final product.
    4.  It compares this deduced product with the given options to find the correct answer.

    # NMR data (8.0 ppm d, 7.2 ppm d) indicates a para-disubstituted benzene ring.
