    """
    This function checks the correctness of the number of stereoisomers for
    6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol.

    It follows these steps:
    1.  Analyzes the structure to identify chiral carbon atoms.
    2.  Analyzes the structure to identify stereogenic double bonds (capable of E/Z isomerism).
    3.  Calculates the total number of stereocenters.
    4.  Calculates the total number of possible stereoisomers using the 2^n formula.
    5.  Compares the calculated result with the provided answer's reasoning and final value.
