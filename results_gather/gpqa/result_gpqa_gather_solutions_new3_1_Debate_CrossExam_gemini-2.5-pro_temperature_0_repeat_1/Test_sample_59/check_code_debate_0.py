def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the special relativity problem.

    The core of the problem is calculating the proper time (time experienced by the astronaut)
    for a journey at relativistic speeds. This involves the time dilation formula.

    The main steps are:
    1.  Identify all given parameters (speed, age, lifespan).
    2.  Identify the missing parameter: the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).
        This requires using a standard astronomical value. Common estimates range from
        159,000 to 163,000 light-years. The calculation is sensitive to this value.
    3.  Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma) from the given speed.
    4.  Calculate the travel time in Earth's reference frame (delta_t).
    5.  Calculate the proper time for the astronaut (delta_t_0 = delta_t / gamma).
    6.  Check the survival constraint: astronaut's age upon arrival must be less than their lifespan.
    7.  Compare the calculated proper time with the given options to find the closest match.
    8.  Verify if this closest match corresponds to the provided answer.
