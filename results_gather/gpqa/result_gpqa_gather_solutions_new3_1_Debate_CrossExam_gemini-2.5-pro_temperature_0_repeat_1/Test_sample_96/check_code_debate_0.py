**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.

**Question**:
In gametogenesis, the germline undergoes two cycles of meiosis to give rise to haploid gametes. The goal of meiosis, unlike mitosis, is to separate not only the replicated sister chromatids but also the homologous chromosome pairs to form haploid cells. Fertilized gametes enter embryogenesis and ultimately develop into an organism. Meiosis is not always perfectly executed, and most such cases result in embryonic lethality. Viable events can already be detected in the karyotype of embryonic cells from the amniotic fluid. One such event results in Klinefelter's syndrome in boys. Which molecular mechanism is responsible for less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome compared to better known Down's syndrome?

A) chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases in the post-zygote
B) attachment of spindle to kinetochores in the metaphase I
C) chiasmata resolution by separase in diakinesis
D) progression of the polymerase alpha in the morula/blastocyst

Based on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.
The response is:
**Proposer**: The central task is to identify the molecular mechanism that makes Klinefelter's syndrome (47,XXY) phenotypically less severe than Down's syndrome (Trisomy 21).
...
**Skeptic**: The evidence is now comprehensive. The search results have validated the Proposer's argument and resolved my specific questions.
...
The debate has converged. The molecular mechanism responsible for the less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome is the epigenetic silencing of the extra X chromosome via X-chromosome inactivation, a process for which chromatin methylation is a key component.
