    This function verifies the answer to the quantum mechanics problem.

    The problem asks for the probability of measuring the value 0 for an observable P,
    given the system's state vector |ψ⟩.

    The probability is calculated using the formula:
    Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|² / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩
    where:
    - λ is the eigenvalue (0 in this case).
    - |v_λ⟩ is the normalized eigenvector corresponding to λ.
    - |ψ⟩ is the state vector of the system.
    - ⟨v_λ|ψ⟩ is the inner product of the two vectors.
    - ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ is the squared norm of the state vector.
