Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.

### Step 1: Identify the Key Information in the Expression

The mathematical expression provided is: `alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`.

To determine the number of loops in the corresponding Feynman diagram, we must identify the part of the expression that is directly and uniquely dependent on the number of loops.

*   **Coupling Constants (`alpha^3 * g^2`):** These terms indicate the number and type of interaction vertices in the diagram. While related to the diagram's complexity, they do not directly state the number of loops.
*   **Numerical Factors (`sqrt(2) * 8`):** These constants arise from diagram-specific calculations like symmetry factors or group theory traces. They do not determine the loop number.
*   **Energy Scale Ratio (`(Q/M)^2`):** This term is a typical result of evaluating loop integrals but does not itself count the loops.
*   **Loop Factor (`1/(4pi)^6`):** This is the crucial piece of information. In quantum field theory, calculations in four-dimensional spacetime generate a characteristic factor related to `4π` for each loop integral.

### Step 2: Apply the Loop Counting Rule

In four-dimensional spacetime, a standard result from performing momentum-space integrals (using techniques like dimensional regularization) is that **each loop in a Feynman diagram contributes a factor of `1/(4π)^2`** to the final amplitude.

Let `L` be the number of loops in the diagram. The total factor arising from these `L` loops will be the product of the individual loop factors:

Total Loop Factor = `(1/(4π)^2)^L = 1/(4π)^(2L)`

### Step 3: Solve for the Number of Loops (L)

We can now compare the general formula for an L-loop diagram with the specific factor found in the note.

*   General form: `1/(4pi)^(2L)`
*   Factor from the note: `1/(4pi)^6`

By equating the exponents in the denominator, we get a simple equation:

`2L = 6`

Solving for `L` yields:

`L = 3`

Therefore, the Feynman diagram contained 3 loops.

### Step 4: Final Answer Selection

The calculation unambiguously shows that the number of loops is 3. The provided options are:
A) 6
B) 1
C) 2
D) 3

The correct option corresponding to 3 loops is D. A review of the candidate answers shows that while most correctly derive `L=3`, many fail to select the corresponding correct letter. The physical reasoning, however, is sound and consistently points to 3 loops.
