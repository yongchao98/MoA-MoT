The mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate. To obtain the final neutral cyanohydrin product, this alkoxide intermediate must be protonated. A source of protons, such as a hydronium ion (H₃O⁺) from a strong acid, is required for this step. Therefore, reagent **A** is **H₃O⁺**.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation is typically achieved by heating the nitrile with water in the presence of a strong acid or base. Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, using a strong mineral acid like hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric acid, is a standard method to convert nitriles to carboxylic acids. The reaction proceeds by protonation of the nitrile, followed by attack by water, leading eventually to the carboxylic acid and an ammonium ion. Therefore, reagent **B** is **HCl**.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   **A = H₃O⁺**\n*   **B = HCl**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone. This reaction involves the nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion (CN-) to the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. When using sodium cyanide (NaCN) as the source of the cyanide ion, an acid is required to protonate the intermediate alkoxide ion to form the final hydroxyl group of the cyanohydrin. A hydronium ion (H3O+), typically generated from a strong acid, serves as the necessary proton source for this step. Therefore, reagent A is H3O+.\n\nThe second reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The starting material is a cyanohydrin, and the product is an α-hydroxy carboxylic acid. This transformation is a standard reaction in organic chemistry, achieved by heating the nitrile with a strong acid or base in the presence of water. The use of a strong mineral acid like hydrochloric acid (HCl) with water is a common method for the acidic hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. Therefore, reagent B is HCl.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct reagents are A = H3O+ and B = HCl.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each reaction to determine the suitable reagents.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a nucleophilic addition reaction to a carbonyl group, specifically the formation of a cyanohydrin.\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:**\n    *   The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a strong nucleophile. It attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n    *   This attack breaks the pi bond of the C=O group, forming a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n    *   This alkoxide intermediate is negatively charged (CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂CH₃) and needs to be protonated to form the final stable product, which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n3.  **Determine reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺) to protonate the alkoxide intermediate.\n    *   H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion, representing a strong aqueous acid like HCl or H₂SO₄) is an excellent proton source for this step.\n    *   NaHSO₃ (sodium bisulfite) is a different reagent that also adds to carbonyls but is not used to complete the cyanohydrin formation initiated by NaCN.\n    *   Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**. This narrows down the options to A and D.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile.\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:** Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base, typically with heating. The presence of H₂O in the reaction indicates hydrolysis.\n    *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is heated with a strong aqueous acid (e.g., HCl, H₂SO₄). The acid protonates the nitrogen atom, making the carbon atom more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water. Through a series of steps, the nitrile is converted first to an amide and then to a carboxylic acid and an ammonium ion.\n    *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is heated with a strong aqueous base (e.g., NaOH). This forms a carboxylate salt, which must then be acidified in a separate step to yield the carboxylic acid.\n3.  **Determine reagent B:** Reagent B acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis.\n    *   HCl (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and a standard reagent used to effectively catalyze the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids in a single step.\n    *   CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid. While it might catalyze the reaction to a very small extent, it is generally not strong enough to efficiently drive the hydrolysis to completion. Strong mineral acids are required.\n    *   Therefore, **B = HCl** is the most suitable choice.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   For the first reaction, A must be H₃O⁺.\n*   For the second reaction, B must be HCl.\n\nCombining these findings, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the suitable reagents.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction starts with a ketone (butan-2-one) and adds a cyanide group (-CN) and a hydroxyl group (-OH) across the carbonyl (C=O) double bond. This is a classic example of a **cyanohydrin formation** reaction.\n\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Nucleophilic Attack):** The cyanide ion (CN⁻), from the dissociation of NaCN, is a strong nucleophile. It attacks the partially positive carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. The pi electrons of the C=O bond move to the oxygen atom, forming a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n        `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH3 + CN⁻ → CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3`\n    *   **Step 2 (Protonation):** The negatively charged alkoxide intermediate is a base. It needs to be protonated by a proton source (an acid) to form the final stable cyanohydrin product, which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n        `CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3 + H⁺ → CH3-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3`\n\n3.  **Determine Reagent A:**\n    *   Reagent A's role is to provide the proton (H⁺) for the second step. This is typically done by adding an acid to the reaction mixture.\n    *   H₃O⁺ represents a hydronium ion, which is the form an acid like HCl or H₂SO₄ takes in water. It is an excellent proton source for this step.\n    *   NaHSO₃ (sodium bisulfite) is used for a different type of carbonyl addition reaction (bisulfite addition) and would not lead to the desired cyanohydrin product.\n    *   Therefore, **A must be an acid source, represented by H₃O⁺**.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction converts a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in the presence of water. This is a **hydrolysis of a nitrile**. The rest of the molecule, including the hydroxyl group, remains unchanged.\n\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:**\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base, typically with heating. The process involves the addition of two molecules of water across the carbon-nitrogen triple bond.\n    *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** A strong acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄) protonates the nitrile nitrogen, making the carbon atom more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water. After a series of steps, the nitrile is converted first to an amide, which is then further hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid and an ammonium ion (NH₄⁺).\n    *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** A strong base (like NaOH) can also be used, but it would produce a carboxylate salt, which would then require a separate acidification step to form the final carboxylic acid.\n\n3.  **Determine Reagent B:**\n    *   Reagent B acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis.\n    *   HCl is a strong acid and is a standard and effective reagent for catalyzing the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid in a single step.\n    *   CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid. While it might catalyze the reaction to a very small extent, it is generally not strong enough to efficiently drive the hydrolysis to completion. Strong mineral acids are required.\n    *   Therefore, **B is a strong acid catalyst, like HCl**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   For the first reaction, Reagent A is an acid source for protonation, making **H₃O⁺** the correct choice.\n*   For the second reaction, Reagent B is a strong acid catalyst for nitrile hydrolysis, making **HCl** the correct choice.\n\nMatching these findings with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  -> **This matches our analysis.**\n*   B) A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH -> Incorrect.\n*   C) A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH -> Incorrect, as CH₃COOH is a poor catalyst for nitrile hydrolysis.\n*   D) A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl -> Incorrect.\n\nThe most suitable reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   **Type:** This is a nucleophilic addition reaction to form a cyanohydrin.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The reaction starts with the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻ from NaCN) on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n        *   Step 1: CH₃COCH₂CH₃ + CN⁻ → CH₃C(O⁻)(CN)CH₂CH₃\n    *   This alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl group (-OH) of the cyanohydrin product.

An acidic workup, represented as H₃O⁺, is the standard way to achieve this protonation. Using a strong acid like HCl directly with NaCN is hazardous as it would generate toxic HCN gas. The reaction is usually performed with NaCN, and then H₃O⁺ is added in a separate step. Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n    *   Looking at the options, this eliminates A and C. We are left with options B and D.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   **Type:** This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-C≡N) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Mechanism:** The hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids requires harsh conditions, typically heating with a strong aqueous acid or a strong aqueous base.\n        *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is heated with a strong acid like aqueous HCl or H₂SO₄. The reaction proceeds through an amide intermediate, which is then further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid.\n        *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is heated with a strong base like aqueous NaOH. This forms a carboxylate salt, which must then be acidified in a separate step to yield the final carboxylic acid.\n    *   The reagent 'B' is the catalyst for this hydrolysis in the presence of water.\n        *   Comparing the options for B (HCl vs. CH₃COOH):\n            *   **HCl (Hydrochloric acid)** is a strong acid and is a very common and effective reagent for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles.\n            *   **CH₃COOH (Acetic acid)** is a weak acid and is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid under typical conditions.\n    *   Therefore, the most suitable reagent for 'B' is **HCl**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   We determined that A = H₃O⁺.\n    *   We determined that B = HCl.\n    *   Combining these findings, the correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.

Combine the findings for A and B to select the correct multiple-choice option.\n\n*   **Execution (Analysis):**\n    1.  **Reaction 1:** `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`. This is a nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion (from NaCN) to the carbonyl group of butan-2-one. The initial product is an alkoxide intermediate. Reagent 'A' is needed to protonate this alkoxide to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group of the cyanohydrin product. An acidic workup, represented by H₃O⁺, is the standard way to achieve this protonation. Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n    2.  **Reaction 2:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`. This reaction converts a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation is known as nitrile hydrolysis. It can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base. Looking at the options for 'B' (HCl or CH₃COOH), both are acids. However, this hydrolysis typically requires harsh conditions, making a strong acid like HCl much more effective and the standard choice over a weak acid like acetic acid (CH₃COOH). Therefore, **B = HCl**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the analysis, A is H₃O⁺ and B is HCl. This combination matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone (butan-2-one) using sodium cyanide (NaCN). This reaction involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) on the carbonyl carbon. The resulting alkoxide intermediate is then protonated to yield the final 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. While hydrogen cyanide (HCN) can be used directly, a common and safer laboratory procedure involves using NaCN followed by an acidic workup (represented by H₃O⁺) to protonate the intermediate. The acid is necessary to provide the proton for the hydroxyl group in the final product.\n\nThe second reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile (in this case, the cyanohydrin 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile) to a carboxylic acid (2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid). This transformation is a standard reaction in organic synthesis. The hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid is typically achieved by heating with a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), in the presence of water. This process is known as acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. A weak acid like acetic acid (CH₃COOH) would be far less effective for this conversion.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   Reagent **A** for the first reaction should be **H₃O⁺** for the acidic workup.\n*   Reagent **B** for the second reaction should be **HCl** for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe correct reagents for the given reactions are selected based on established chemical principles for cyanohydrin formation and nitrile hydrolysis.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis reaction is a nucleophilic addition known as cyanohydrin formation. The reaction requires a source of cyanide ions (NaCN) and a proton source to protonate the intermediate alkoxide ion. An acidic workup, represented by H3O+, provides the necessary proton to form the final hydroxyl group of the cyanohydrin. Therefore, reagent **A** is **H3O+**.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation can be achieved under either acidic or basic conditions. For acidic hydrolysis, the nitrile is typically heated with a strong mineral acid, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl). This process converts the nitrile into a carboxylic acid and an ammonium salt. Therefore, reagent **B** is **HCl**.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   **A = H3O+**\n*   **B = HCl**\n\nThis combination corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone. This reaction involves the nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion (from NaCN) to the carbonyl carbon. The resulting alkoxide intermediate is then protonated to form the hydroxyl group. This protonation step requires an acid. A common way to carry out this reaction is to use NaCN with a strong acid like HCl or H₂SO₄, which is represented as H₃O⁺. This creates HCN *in situ* and provides the necessary acidic environment for the final protonation step.\n\nThe second reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. This transformation can be achieved by heating the nitrile with either a strong acid or a strong base in the presence of water. Using a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl), directly yields the carboxylic acid. Using a weak acid like acetic acid (CH₃COOH) would be significantly less effective for this hydrolysis.\n\nTherefore, the most suitable reagents are:\n*   **A = H₃O⁺** for the cyanohydrin formation.\n*   **B = HCl** for the nitrile hydrolysis.\n\nThis combination matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the suitable reagents.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Product:**\n    *   **Reactant:** butan-2-one (CH₃-CO-CH₂-CH₃) is a ketone.\n    *   **Product:** 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile (CH₃-C(OH)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃) is a cyanohydrin.\n    *   The reaction involves the addition of H and CN across the C=O double bond.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   This is a nucleophilic addition reaction known as cyanohydrin formation.\n    *   The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n    *   This attack breaks the C=O pi bond and forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate: CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   This negatively charged alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group of the cyanohydrin product.\n\n3.  **Determine Reagent A:**\n    *   Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺) to protonate the alkoxide intermediate.\n    *   This is typically achieved by adding an acid.

The process involves the nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion (CN⁻) to the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate. Reagent 'A' is required to protonate this alkoxide intermediate to yield the final hydroxyl group (-OH) of the cyanohydrin product. This protonation is achieved by using an acid. While hydrogen cyanide (HCN) can be used directly, it is a highly toxic gas. A common and safer laboratory method involves using a salt like sodium cyanide (NaCN) in combination with a strong acid, such as HCl or H2SO4, which is represented generally as H3O⁺ (hydronium ion). The acid generates HCN in the reaction mixture and provides the necessary proton for the final step.

This transformation is known as nitrile hydrolysis. The starting material is a cyanohydrin, and the product is an α-hydroxy acid. The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid is typically carried out under vigorous conditions, requiring heating in the presence of a strong acid or a strong base. Reagent 'B', in conjunction with water, must be a strong acid catalyst to effectively hydrolyze the nitrile. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a strong mineral acid commonly used for this purpose. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is a weak acid and would not be sufficient to catalyze this reaction efficiently. Therefore, B = HCl.\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions, the suitable reagents are A = H3O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**Proposer's Argument:**\nThe first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one. This involves the nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion to the carbonyl carbon, followed by protonation of the resulting alkoxide ion. The reagents are NaCN and an acid. H3O+ is a suitable acid for this protonation step. The second reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile (the cyanohydrin) to a carboxylic acid. This hydrolysis can be achieved by heating with a dilute acid, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl). Therefore, A = H3O+ and B = HCl.\n\n**Skeptic's Cross-Examination:**\nFor the first reaction, adding a strong acid like H3O+ directly to NaCN is hazardous as it liberates toxic HCN gas. The reaction is often carried out by generating HCN *in situ* from NaCN and a weaker acid, or by adjusting the pH to around 4-5. However, an acidic workup (represented by H3O+) is a common final step to ensure protonation. For the second reaction, nitrile hydrolysis is indeed catalyzed by strong acids like HCl. While weak acids could work, strong acids are generally more effective. The combination of H3O+ for the first reaction (representing the necessary acidic conditions/workup) and HCl for the second (a standard strong acid for hydrolysis) remains the most chemically sound choice among the given options. The alternative, NaHSO3, is used for a different preparative route.\n\n**Converged Decision:**\nThe debate confirms that the most appropriate set of reagents among the choices are an acid for the cyanohydrin formation and a strong acid for the nitrile hydrolysis.\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a cyanohydrin formation. The reaction proceeds via nucleophilic attack of the CN- ion on the ketone. An acid (represented by H3O+) is then required to protonate the intermediate alkoxide to form the final hydroxyl group. While the reaction conditions need careful pH control in practice, H3O+ correctly represents the required acid source for the protonation step.\n*   **Reaction 2:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. This transformation is typically carried out by heating with a strong mineral acid like dilute HCl or H2SO4.

    "Here is a self-debate to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Proposer:**\nMy proposal is to analyze each chemical reaction individually to determine the role and identity of reagents A and B. Based on this chemical analysis, we can select the correct option.\n\nMy first action is to analyze Reaction 1: `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`.\nThis is a well-known reaction called cyanohydrin formation. The mechanism begins with the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN on the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This creates a negatively charged alkoxide intermediate. To form the final, stable product with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, this intermediate must be protonated. Therefore, reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺). Looking at the options for A, H₃O⁺ represents an aqueous acid and is a suitable proton source. NaHSO₃ is used for a different type of carbonyl addition reaction and is incorrect here. Thus, we can conclude that **A = H₃O⁺**, which eliminates options A and C.\n\n**Skeptic:**\nI agree that A must be a proton source. However, a potential failure mode in this reasoning is overlooking the practical aspects. Mixing a strong acid (represented by H₃O⁺) directly with sodium cyanide is hazardous as it liberates large amounts of toxic hydrogen cyanide (HCN) gas. While an acidic workup step (represented by H₃O⁺) is a common way to ensure full protonation at the end of a reaction, the reaction itself is often conducted under carefully controlled pH.\n\nHowever, the constraint is to choose the most suitable reagent from the given list. NaHSO₃ is chemically incorrect for this specific product. H₃O⁺ correctly represents the necessary acidic component required for the protonation step. The majority of the provided candidate answers (12 out of 15) also correctly identify the need for an acid (H₃O⁺), indicating a strong consensus on this chemical principle. Therefore, proceeding with A = H₃O⁺ is the logical step.\n\n**Proposer:**\nYour point is noted, but given the constraints, H₃O⁺ is the only chemically plausible choice for A.\n\nMy next action is to analyze Reaction 2: `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`.\nThis reaction is the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which is known as nitrile hydrolysis. This transformation requires water and a catalyst. Our remaining options for reagent B are HCl (from option B) and CH₃COOH (from option D). Nitrile hydrolysis is known to require vigorous conditions, typically heating with a strong acid or a strong base. HCl is a strong acid, whereas CH₃COOH is a weak acid. A strong acid is required to effectively catalyze the reaction to completion. Therefore, **B = HCl** is the far more suitable choice.\n\n**Skeptic:**\nThis analysis appears robust. A weak acid like acetic acid (CH₃COOH) would be largely ineffective for this hydrolysis under standard laboratory conditions. The reaction would be impractically slow or incomplete. All the candidate answers that provided detailed reasoning correctly identified that a strong acid like HCl is the standard and effective reagent for this step. This confirms that HCl is the correct choice for B.\n\n**Converged Decision:**\nThe debate confirms the identity of both reagents based on fundamental organic chemistry principles.\n\n1.  **For Reaction 1 (Cyanohydrin Formation):** An acid source is needed to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. Among the choices, **A = H₃O⁺** is the correct reagent.\n2.  **For Reaction 2 (Nitrile Hydrolysis):** A strong acid catalyst is needed to convert the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. The strong acid **B = HCl** is the appropriate choice over the weak acid CH₃COOH.\n\nThe correct pair of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl. This combination corresponds to option B.\n\nA review of the candidate answers shows that while a majority correctly deduced the chemical identities of A and B, many made a clerical error by matching them to the wrong lettered option. The consensus on the underlying chemistry is very strong and points directly to this conclusion.\n\n<<<B>>>"

The mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate. To obtain the final neutral cyanohydrin product, this alkoxide intermediate must be protonated. A source of protons, such as a hydronium ion (H₃O⁺) from a strong acid, is required for this step.

This transformation is typically achieved by heating the nitrile with water in the presence of a strong acid or base. Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, using a strong mineral acid like hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric acid, is a standard method to convert nitriles to carboxylic acids. The reaction proceeds by protonation of the nitrile, followed by attack by water, leading eventually to the carboxylic acid and an ammonium ion.

A common and safer laboratory method involves using a salt like sodium cyanide (NaCN) in combination with a strong acid, such as HCl or H2SO4, which is represented generally as H3O⁺ (hydronium ion).

This transformation is known as nitrile hydrolysis. The starting material is a cyanohydrin, and the product is an α-hydroxy acid. The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid is typically carried out under vigorous conditions, requiring heating in the presence of a strong acid or a strong base. Reagent 'B', in conjunction with water, must be a strong acid catalyst to effectively hydrolyze the nitrile. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a strong mineral acid commonly used for this purpose.

H3O+ is a suitable acid for this protonation step. The second reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile (the cyanohydrin) to a carboxylic acid. This hydrolysis can be achieved by heating with a dilute acid, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl). Therefore, A = H3O+ and B = HCl.\n\n**Skeptic's Cross-Examination:**\nFor the first reaction, adding a strong acid like H3O+ directly to NaCN is hazardous as it liberates toxic HCN gas. The reaction is often carried out by generating HCN *in situ* from NaCN and a weaker acid, or by adjusting the pH to around 4-5. However, an acidic workup (represented by H3O+) is a common final step to ensure protonation. For the second reaction, nitrile hydrolysis is indeed catalyzed by strong acids like HCl. While weak acids could work, strong acids are generally more effective. The combination of H3O+ for the first reaction (representing the necessary acidic conditions/workup) and HCl for the second (a standard strong acid for hydrolysis) remains the most chemically sound choice among the given options. The alternative, NaHSO3, is used for a different preparative route.\n\n**Converged Decision:**\nThe debate confirms that the most appropriate set of reagents among the choices are an acid for the cyanohydrin formation and a strong acid for the nitrile hydrolysis.\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

An acid (represented by H3O+) is then required to protonate the intermediate alkoxide to form the final hydroxyl group. While the reaction conditions need careful pH control in practice, H3O+ correctly represents the required acid source for the protonation step.\n*   **Reaction 2:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. This transformation is typically carried out by heating with a strong mineral acid like dilute HCl or H2SO4. Therefore, B = HCl is the most suitable reagent.\n\nBased on this analysis, reagent A is H3O+ and reagent B is HCl.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
