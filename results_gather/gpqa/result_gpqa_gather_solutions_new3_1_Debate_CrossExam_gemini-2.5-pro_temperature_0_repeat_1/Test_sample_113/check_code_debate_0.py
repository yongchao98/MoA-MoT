Here is a self-debate to determine the correct answer.

**Proposer:**
My proposal is to analyze each chemical reaction individually to determine the role and identity of reagents A and B. Based on this chemical analysis, we can select the correct option.

My first action is to analyze Reaction 1: `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`.
This is a well-known reaction called cyanohydrin formation. The mechanism begins with the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN on the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This creates a negatively charged alkoxide intermediate. To form the final, stable product with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, this intermediate must be protonated. Therefore, reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺). Looking at the options for A, H₃O⁺ represents an aqueous acid and is a suitable proton source. NaHSO₃ is used for a different type of carbonyl addition reaction and is incorrect here. Thus, we can conclude that **A = H₃O⁺**, which eliminates options A and C.

**Skeptic:**
I agree that A must be a proton source. However, a potential failure mode in this reasoning is overlooking the practical aspects. Mixing a strong acid (represented by H₃O⁺) directly with sodium cyanide is hazardous as it liberates large amounts of toxic hydrogen cyanide (HCN) gas. While an acidic workup step (represented by H₃O⁺) is a common way to ensure full protonation at the end of a reaction, the reaction itself is often conducted under carefully controlled pH.

However, the constraint is to choose the most suitable reagent from the given list. NaHSO₃ is chemically incorrect for this specific product. H₃O⁺ correctly represents the necessary acidic component required for the protonation step. The majority of the provided candidate answers (12 out of 15) also correctly identify the need for an acid (H₃O⁺), indicating a strong consensus on this chemical principle. Therefore, proceeding with A = H₃O⁺ is the logical step.

**Proposer:**
Your point is noted, but given the constraints, H₃O⁺ is the only chemically plausible choice for A.

My next action is to analyze Reaction 2: `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`.
This reaction is the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which is known as nitrile hydrolysis. This transformation requires water and a catalyst. Our remaining options for reagent B are HCl (from option B) and CH₃COOH (from option D). Nitrile hydrolysis is known to require vigorous conditions, typically heating with a strong acid or a strong base. HCl is a strong acid, whereas CH₃COOH is a weak acid. A strong acid is required to effectively catalyze the reaction to completion. Therefore, **B = HCl** is the far more suitable choice.

**Skeptic:**
This analysis appears robust. A weak acid like acetic acid (CH₃COOH) would be largely ineffective for this hydrolysis under standard laboratory conditions. The reaction would be impractically slow or incomplete. All the candidate answers that provided detailed reasoning correctly identified that a strong acid like HCl is the standard and effective reagent for this step. This confirms that HCl is the correct choice for B.

**Converged Decision:**
The debate confirms the identity of both reagents based on fundamental organic chemistry principles.

1.  **For Reaction 1 (Cyanohydrin Formation):** An acid source is needed to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. Among the choices, **A = H₃O⁺** is the correct reagent.
2.  **For Reaction 2 (Nitrile Hydrolysis):** A strong acid catalyst is needed to convert the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. The strong acid **B = HCl** is the appropriate choice over the weak acid CH₃COOH.

The correct pair of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl. This combination corresponds to option B.

A review of the candidate answers shows that while a majority correctly deduced the chemical identities of A and B, many made a clerical error by matching them to the wrong lettered option. The consensus on the underlying chemistry is very strong and points directly to this conclusion.
