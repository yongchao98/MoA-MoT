def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the provided answer for the pseudo-Goldstone boson mass.

    The function verifies the answer against three key physics principles:
    1.  Dimensionality/Scaling: The mass-squared must be inversely proportional to the
        square of the symmetry-breaking scale, (x^2 + v^2).
    2.  Particle Content Completeness: The formula must include contributions from all
        relevant massive particles in the model (heavy gauge bosons, all physical
        scalars except H2, the top quark, and the new heavy neutrinos).
    3.  Sign Convention (Supertrace): Contributions from bosons (spin 0, 1) must be
        positive, while contributions from fermions (spin 1/2) must be negative.
