def check_quasar_redshift_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer for the minimum redshift of a quasar.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. Define the physical constants: the rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line.
    2. Define the key constraint: the atmospheric cutoff wavelength. The question asks for the
       *lower limit*, so we should use the shortest practical wavelength observable from the
       ground, which is around 3500 Å, not the start of the visible spectrum (~4000 Å).
    3. Calculate the theoretical minimum redshift based on this constraint.
    4. Compare the calculated redshift to the provided options to find the best fit.
    5. Verify that the chosen answer is indeed the lower limit by checking that any options
       with a smaller redshift would result in an undetectable wavelength.
