def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the biology question.

    The function models the biological principles of the experiment:
    1.  **Promoter Activity**: The red protein (mRaspberry) is under a 'lineage-specific' promoter,
        meaning it's only expressed after the undifferentiated iPSCs begin to differentiate.
    2.  **Apoptosis**: The green stain (TUNEL) marks apoptosis, which is expected in early
        embryos and as a result of failed iPSC integration.
    3.  **Timeline**: The question asks for the 'first' observation (e.g., at 12 hours).
    4.  **Reporter Properties**: The mRaspberry protein, unless modified, is cytoplasmic.

    It then evaluates each multiple-choice option against these principles to determine the most
    plausible "first finding".
