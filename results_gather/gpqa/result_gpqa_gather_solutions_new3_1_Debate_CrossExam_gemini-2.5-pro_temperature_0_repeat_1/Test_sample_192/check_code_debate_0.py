    This function checks the correctness of the provided LLM's answer.

    It models the physics problem symbolically to derive the correct relationship
    and compares it with the provided answer's reasoning and final choice.

    The key steps are:
    1.  Interpret "number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5" as a density
        function: dN/d(plx) ‚àù 1/plx^5. This is the standard interpretation.
    2.  Use the relationship plx = 1/r.
    3.  Apply the chain rule for transforming densities: dN/dr = dN/d(plx) * |d(plx)/dr|.
    4.  Verify the result against the provided answer.
