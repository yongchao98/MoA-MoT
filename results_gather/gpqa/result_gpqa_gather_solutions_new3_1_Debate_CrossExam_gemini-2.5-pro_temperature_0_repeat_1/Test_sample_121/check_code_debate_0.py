Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.

### Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (Product 4)

1.  **Acetic acid to Product 1**: The reaction of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride is an α-halogenation (a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky type reaction). This replaces a hydrogen on the α-carbon with a bromine atom.
    *   **Product 1**: Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).

2.  **Product 1 to Product 2**: Product 1 is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a Fischer esterification, which converts the carboxylic acid into an ethyl ester.
    *   **Product 2**: Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).

3.  **Product 2 to Product 3**: Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an Sₙ2 reaction.
    *   **Product 3**: Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).

4.  **Product 3 to Product 4**: Product 3 is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane.
    *   NaH, a strong base, deprotonates the acidic α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate (the CH₂ group between the -CN and -COOEt groups).
    *   The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule.
    *   The use of *excess* NaH ensures that the remaining α-proton on the newly formed intermediate is also removed.
    *   This second carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentane chain to form a stable six-membered ring (a Thorpe-Ziegler reaction).
    *   **Product 4**: The final product is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.

### Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4

The core of the question is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals for ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry.

*   **Structure**: A cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃) attached to the same carbon, C1.

*   **Key Point: Chirality**: The carbon at position 1 (C1) is attached to four different groups:
    1.  A cyano group (-CN)
    2.  An ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃)
    3.  The C2 position of the ring (-CH₂-)
    4.  The C6 position of the ring (-CH₂-)
    Since the path around the ring from C1-C2... is different from C1-C6..., C1 is a **chiral center**.

*   **Consequence of Chirality**: A chiral molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. Therefore:
    *   The five methylene (CH₂) groups of the cyclohexane ring (at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6) are all in chemically distinct environments.
    *   Within each of these five CH₂ groups, the two protons (which would be axial and equatorial in a chair conformation) are **diastereotopic**. This means they are chemically non-equivalent and should, in principle, give separate signals.

*   **Counting the Signals (Rigorous Approach)**:
    1.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons**: Since there are 5 distinct CH₂ groups, and the two protons on each are also distinct, this gives a total of 5 × 2 = **10 signals** from the ring.
    2.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃)**:
        *   The three protons of the terminal methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.
        *   The two protons of the methylene (-OCH₂-) group are adjacent to the chiral center (C1). This makes them diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. However, it is a very common simplification in undergraduate-level problems to consider the protons of a flexible ethyl group as equivalent unless they are part of a ring. Given the answer choices, we will apply this common simplification. This gives **1 signal** for the -OCH₂- group.

*   **Final Count**:
    *   Signals from the ring = 10
    *   Signals from the ethyl group = 1 (-CH₃) + 1 (-OCH₂-) = 2
    *   **Total distinct signals = 10 + 2 = 12**

This corresponds to option A. The alternative interpretation, which assumes a plane of symmetry (leading to 8 signals), is less rigorous because it ignores the fundamental chirality of the molecule.
