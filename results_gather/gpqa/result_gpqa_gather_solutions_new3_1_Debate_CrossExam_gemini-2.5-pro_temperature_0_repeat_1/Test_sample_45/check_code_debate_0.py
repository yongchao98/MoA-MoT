    Analyzes the stereochemical outcome of the self-metathesis of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene.

    The product is 3,6-dimethyl-4-octene. We need to count all possible stereoisomers.
    The product has two chiral centers (C3, C6) and a double bond (C4) that can be E or Z.

    The starting material is a racemic mixture of (R) and (S) enantiomers.
    The possible reaction pairings are:
    1. (R) + (R) -> (3R, 6R) product
    2. (S) + (S) -> (3S, 6S) product
    3. (R) + (S) -> (3R, 6S) product
