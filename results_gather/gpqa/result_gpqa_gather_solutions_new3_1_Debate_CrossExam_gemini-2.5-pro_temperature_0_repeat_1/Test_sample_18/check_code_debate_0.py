    Checks the correctness of the final answer for the given chemistry question.

    The function simulates the reasoning process for determining the products of two Michael reactions.
    1.  It analyzes Reaction A to determine the correct substitution position on the cyclohexanone ring.
    2.  It analyzes Reaction B to determine the correct structural class of the product.
