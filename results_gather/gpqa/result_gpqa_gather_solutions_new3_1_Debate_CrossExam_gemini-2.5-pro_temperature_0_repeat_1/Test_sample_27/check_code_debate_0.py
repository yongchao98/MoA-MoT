    Checks the correctness of the provided answer for the multi-step synthesis problem.

    The function verifies the final product based on key chemical principles:
    1.  The basic molecular structure must be a cyclohexanone.
    2.  The methylation step with LDA (a bulky base) must occur at the less hindered
        kinetic position (C6), not the more hindered C2.
    3.  The stereochemistry must match the outcome of sequential anti-additions
        and stereocontrolled methylation, resulting in (2S,3R,4S,6S).
