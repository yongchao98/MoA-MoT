    # Option A: Stuck in Golgi

    # Logic: The construct uses a strong, ubiquitous CBA promoter, and the in vitro
    # test confirmed protein expression, making this highly unlikely.
    is_B_correct = not promoter_is_functional
    reason_B = "This is incorrect. The construct uses the strong, ubiquitous CBA promoter. Furthermore, the in vitro Western blot test confirmed that the non-recombined proteins were expressed, proving the promoter is functional."

    # technical success of synthesizing the reporter protein within a single cell.

    reason_C = "This is incorrect. The biological relationship (paracrine vs. autocrine) describes how the proteins function between cells. It does not explain a technical failure in the synthesis of the reporter protein *within* a cell."

    # Option D: Not in frame
    # Logic: A 34 bp scar is not divisible by 3, causing a frameshift.
    # A frameshift prevents the synthesis of a functional protein, leading to no signal.
    # This perfectly matches the observation.

    reason_D = "This is the correct explanation. After Cre-mediated excision, a 34 bp lox2272 scar remains. Since 34 is not divisible by 3, this causes a frameshift mutation. The ribosome can no longer read the eGFP sequence in the correct frame, preventing the synthesis of a functional, fluorescent protein and resulting in no green signal."
