def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the final answer provided for the quantum mechanics problem.

    The core principle is the normalization of the wave function:
    ∫ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1 over the allowed region [1, 3].

    1.  The wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i.
    2.  The probability density is |ψ(x)|² = [Re(ψ)]² + [Im(ψ)]²
        |ψ(x)|² = [a / sqrt(1 + x)]² + [-0.5]² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25.
    3.  The normalization integral is ∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1.
    4.  Solving the integral:
        [a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25x] from 1 to 3 = 1
        (a² * ln(4) + 0.25 * 3) - (a² * ln(2) + 0.25 * 1) = 1
        a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + (0.75 - 0.25) = 1
        a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
    5.  Solving for 'a':
        a² * ln(2) = 0.5
        a² = 0.5 / ln(2)
        a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))
