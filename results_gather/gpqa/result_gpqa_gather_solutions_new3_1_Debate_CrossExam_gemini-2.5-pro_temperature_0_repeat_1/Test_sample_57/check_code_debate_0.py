Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, including a careful review of the key concepts involved.

**Step 1: Understand the Core Concept of "Regularization at High Energies"**

The question hinges on understanding what "regularization at high energies" means in physics.

*   **High Energies & Short Distances:** In quantum mechanics, high energies correspond to very short distances. When physicists study interactions at extremely small scales, they are probing very high-energy phenomena.
*   **Infinities (Divergences):** In many physical theories, when you try to calculate a physical quantity (like the mass or charge of a particle), the equations produce an infinite result. This often happens when the theory assumes particles are mathematical points with zero size, leading to problems when interactions occur at a single point (zero distance). This specific type of infinity, related to high energies/short distances, is called an "ultraviolet (UV) divergence."
*   **Regularization:** This is a mathematical technique used to manage these infinities. It involves temporarily modifying the theory (for example, by introducing a "cutoff" that prevents energy from going to infinity) to make the calculations yield a finite number. This is the first step in a process called renormalization, which ultimately produces finite, measurable predictions.
*   **The Question:** The question asks which of the listed theories is fundamentally built in a way that these high-energy infinities never appear, making the artificial step of regularization unnecessary.

**Step 2: Analyze Each Option**

Let's examine each theory based on the need for regularization:

*   **A) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory, while not a quantum theory, has its own famous infinity problem. If you calculate the energy stored in the electric field of a point-like particle (like an electron), the result is infinite. This is because the energy density increases without bound as you get closer to the point. This "infinite self-energy" shows the theory breaks down at short distances and requires a fix, or regularization (for instance, by assuming the particle is not a point but a tiny sphere). Therefore, it requires a form of regularization.

*   **C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the quantum theory of electromagnetism. QED is a primary example of a theory that *requires* regularization. When calculating corrections to particle properties, diagrams involving virtual particle "loops" lead to integrals that diverge at high energies (UV divergences). QED would be useless without the two-step process of regularization and renormalization to tame these infinities.

*   **D) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** This is the quantum theory of the strong force that binds quarks together. Like QED, it is a quantum field theory based on point-like particles. Its calculations also involve loop diagrams that produce UV divergences. Therefore, QCD absolutely requires regularization and renormalization to make physical predictions.

*   **B) Superstring Theory:** A central motivation for developing superstring theory was to solve the problem of infinities that plague quantum field theories, especially when trying to incorporate gravity. In string theory, the fundamental objects are not point particles but tiny, vibrating, one-dimensional strings. This has a profound consequence: interactions are no longer point-like. When strings interact, they merge or split over a small region, "smearing out" the interaction. This inherent smearing naturally smooths out the behavior at short distances and eliminates the UV divergences found in the other theories. Because these infinities don't appear in the first place, the theory does not require regularization at high energies.

**Step 3: Final Conclusion**

Classical Electrodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Quantum Chromodynamics all suffer from infinities related to high-energy or short-distance behavior, which must be handled by some form of regularization. Superstring Theory is unique among the options because its fundamental structure, based on extended strings rather than points, is specifically designed to be free of these ultraviolet divergences.
