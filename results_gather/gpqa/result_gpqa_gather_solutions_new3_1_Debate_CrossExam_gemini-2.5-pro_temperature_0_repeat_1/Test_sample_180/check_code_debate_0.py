def check_neutrino_flux_ratio():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the solar neutrino flux problem.

    The problem asks for the ratio of neutrino fluxes, Flux(700-800 keV) / Flux(800-900 keV),
    under the condition that the pp-III branch (source of ⁸B neutrinos) has stopped.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. Identify the remaining neutrino sources for each band (pp-II and CNO).
    2. Estimate the flux from each source using values from Standard Solar Models.
    3. Calculate the total flux in each band.
    4. Compute the ratio and compare it to the given options to verify the provided answer.
