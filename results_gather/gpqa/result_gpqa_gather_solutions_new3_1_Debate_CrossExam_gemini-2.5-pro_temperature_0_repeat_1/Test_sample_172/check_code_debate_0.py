    """
    Checks the correctness of the final answer to the physics problem.

    The problem asks for the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE) given:
    - Speed of electron, v = 2 * 10^8 m/s
    - Uncertainty in position, Δx = 0.1 nm

    The solution involves:
    1. Using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2) to find the minimum Δp.
    2. Using the relation ΔE ≈ v * Δp to find the minimum ΔE.
