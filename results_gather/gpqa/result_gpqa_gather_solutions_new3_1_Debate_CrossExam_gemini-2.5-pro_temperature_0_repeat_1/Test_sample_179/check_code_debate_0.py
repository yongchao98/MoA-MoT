    The system consists of:
    - 1 central charge q = 2e.
    - 12 charges q = 2e on a sphere of radius r = 2m.
    
    The minimum energy configuration for the 12 charges on the sphere is an icosahedron.
    The total energy is the sum of the interaction with the central charge and the
    mutual interaction of the 12 charges on the sphere.
