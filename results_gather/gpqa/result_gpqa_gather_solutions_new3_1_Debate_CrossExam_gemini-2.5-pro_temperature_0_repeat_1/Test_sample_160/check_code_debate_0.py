    2.  λ2 (electron-gas MFP) = 1 / (n * σ_eg)

    # Principle 1: The formula for the mean free path of a gas molecule among its
    # peers (λ1) includes a sqrt(2) factor to account for relative motion.
    # The formula for a fast electron hitting stationary gas molecules (λ2) does not.
    # This factor alone makes λ2 larger than λ1 by a factor of sqrt(2) if cross-sections were equal.
    sqrt2_factor = math.sqrt(2) # approx 1.414

    # Principle 2: Compare the collision cross-sections (σ_gg vs σ_eg).
    # σ_gg: The kinetic cross-section for two gas molecules colliding. This is related to the molecule's physical size.
    # σ_eg: The scattering cross-section for a very high-energy (1000 kV) electron.
    # At such high energies, the electron is highly penetrating, and the atom is mostly empty space.
    # The probability of a significant scattering event is low.
    # Therefore, the gas-gas cross-section is significantly LARGER than the electron-gas cross-section.
    # We can represent this as a ratio > 1. For a robust check, we'll assume it's at least slightly larger than 1.
    # A realistic value would be much larger, but > 1 is sufficient.
