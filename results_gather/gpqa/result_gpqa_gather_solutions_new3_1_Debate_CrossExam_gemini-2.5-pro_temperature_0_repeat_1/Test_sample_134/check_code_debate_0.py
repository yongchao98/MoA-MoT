def check_particle_decay_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer for the particle decay question.

    The problem asks for the kinematically allowed decays of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV.
    The decay process is X -> f + f_bar, where f is a fermion and f_bar is its antifermion.

    The kinematic condition for this decay is:
    Mass(X) >= Mass(f) + Mass(f_bar)

    Since a fermion and its antifermion have the same mass, this simplifies to:
    Mass(X) >= 2 * Mass(f)
    6 GeV >= 2 * Mass(f)
    Mass(f) <= 3 GeV

    This code calculates the set of allowed fermions based on this condition and compares it
    to the set of fermions listed in the proposed answer 'A'.
