    """
    Checks the correctness of the provided answer by verifying its key logical and quantitative steps.
    
    The provided answer's reasoning is as follows:
    1. Element Y is identified as Gold (Au).
    2. Substance A2 is identified as AuF5, based on a "reasonable" match with the given fluorine mass percentage.
    3. Substance A4 is identified as AuF2, based on the 1:1 comproportionation reaction (Au + AuF2 -> 2AuF).
    4. The molecular weight of A4 (AuF2) is calculated to be ~235 g/mol.
    5. This molecular weight falls into the range 220-240 g/mol, corresponding to option C.
