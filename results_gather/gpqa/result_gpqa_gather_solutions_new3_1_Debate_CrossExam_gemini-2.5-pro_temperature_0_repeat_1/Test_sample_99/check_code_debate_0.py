    # Statement B: H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.
    # Fact: The ferric chloride test for phenols typically gives a violet, blue, or green color. A yellow color is the color of the
    # FeCl3 reagent itself and indicates a NEGATIVE test. Compound H (2,4,6-trimethylphenol) is sterically hindered and does not
    # give a positive test. Therefore, the statement that it "gives" a yellow color is a misleading description of a negative result.

Therefore, this statement is factually incorrect in the context of chemical tests."
