    # Principle: The reaction is a [2+2] cycloaddition of cyclohexene with a ketene.
    # Product: 8,8-diiodobicyclo[4.2.0]octan-7-one.
    # Retrosynthesis: Breaking the newly formed 4-membered ring (at C1-C7 and C6-C8)
    # gives back cyclohexene and the ketene. The ketene must have provided the C7(=O)
    # and C8(I)2 fragments. This corresponds to diiodoketene, I2C=C=O.
    # IUPAC Name: 2,2-diiodoethen-1-one.

    # 1. Conformation: Ability to adopt s-cis conformation. Locked s-cis is most reactive.
    #    Steric hindrance preventing s-cis makes it unreactive.
    # 2. Electronics: Electron-donating groups (EDGs) increase reactivity.
