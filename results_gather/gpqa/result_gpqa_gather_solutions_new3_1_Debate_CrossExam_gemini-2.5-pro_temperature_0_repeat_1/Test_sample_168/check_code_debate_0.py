Here is a step-by-step analysis of the nuclear decay problem to determine the correct answer.

### Step 1: Analyze the Nature of the Energy Spectrum (Continuous vs. Discrete)

The first step is to determine if the energy spectrum of the two 'E' particles remains continuous or becomes discrete in the variant decay.

*   **Original Decay (`2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V`):** The problem states this decay produces a continuous energy spectrum. This is consistent with the principles of particle physics. In a decay with more than two particles in the final state, the total energy released (the Q-value) is shared among them. Since the two 'V' particles can carry away a variable amount of energy, the energy left for the two 'E' particles is not fixed, resulting in a continuous distribution.
*   **Variant Decay (`2A -> 2B + 2E + M`):** In this case, the final state consists of the heavy nucleus '2B', the two 'E' particles, and a single exotic particle 'M'. Since there are still three light particles (2E and M) sharing the decay energy, the energy distribution remains variable. The particle 'M' can carry away any amount of kinetic energy from zero up to the maximum available. Consequently, the total energy of the two 'E' particles is not fixed and will still form a **continuous spectrum**.

This analysis eliminates options A and C, which incorrectly state that the spectrum becomes discrete. A discrete spectrum would only occur in a two-body final state (e.g., `2A -> 2B + 2E`), where energy and momentum conservation would fix the energies of the products.

### Step 2: Analyze the Endpoint of the Energy Spectrum

The next step is to compare the endpoint of the energy spectrum in the variant decay to the original decay. The endpoint represents the maximum possible kinetic energy available to the 'E' particles. This maximum is determined by the Q-value of the reaction, which is the total mass converted into energy.

*   **Q-value Definition:** The energy released is `Q = (mass_initial - mass_final) * c^2`. A higher Q-value means a higher endpoint for the kinetic energy spectrum.

*   **Initial Mass:** The initial mass is `m(2A)` for both decays.

*   **Final Mass (Original Decay):** The final state particles are 2B, 2E, and 2V. The total final mass is `m(2B) + 2*m_E + 2*m_V`. The problem describes 'V' as a "much lighter particle," which, in contrast to the explicitly "massless" particle M, implies it has a small but non-zero rest mass (`m_V > 0`).

*   **Final Mass (Variant Decay):** The final state particles are 2B, 2E, and M. The total final mass is `m(2B) + 2*m_E + m_M`. The problem explicitly states that M is **massless**, so `m_M = 0`.

### Step 3: Compare the Endpoints

Let's compare the total rest mass of the light particles created in each decay:
*   **Original Decay:** `2*m_E + 2*m_V`
*   **Variant Decay:** `2*m_E + 0`

Since `m_V > 0`, the total rest mass of the final particles is *smaller* in the variant decay. According to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence (`E=mc^2`), a smaller final rest mass means that more of the initial mass is converted into kinetic energy.

Therefore, the Q-value for the variant decay is higher than the Q-value for the original decay. This means the maximum possible energy for the 'E' particles—the endpoint of their spectrum—is higher.

### Conclusion

1.  The spectrum remains **continuous** because the variant decay still results in a multi-body final state.
2.  The shape of the spectrum is **adjusted** due to the change in the number of final state particles (from four light particles to three).
3.  The endpoint of the spectrum **increases** because replacing two particles with mass (2V) with one massless particle (M) reduces the total final rest mass, releasing more energy.

This combination of outcomes corresponds to option D.
