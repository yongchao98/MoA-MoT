Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.

### **Careful Points to Consider**

1.  **Overall Transformation**: The two-step reaction sequence (1. mCPBA, 2. H₃O⁺) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of an alkene. It's crucial to correctly identify this overall transformation. The first step is a *syn*-epoxidation, and the second is an acid-catalyzed *anti*-ring opening, leading to a net *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl groups.
2.  **Stereochemistry of Addition**: The stereochemical outcome depends on the geometry of the starting alkene. There are well-established rules for stereospecific reactions:
    *   *Anti*-addition to a *trans*-(E)-alkene yields a *meso* compound.
    *   *Anti*-addition to a *cis*-(Z)-alkene yields a *racemic* mixture of enantiomers.
3.  **Composition of the Final Mixture**: It is essential to correctly identify all the unique stereoisomers present after both reactions are complete and the products are combined.
4.  **Principles of Chromatography**: One must distinguish between the capabilities of standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC.
    *   **Standard (Achiral) HPLC**: Separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (like polarity). It can separate diastereomers but *cannot* separate enantiomers.
    *   **Chiral HPLC**: Uses a chiral stationary phase to create a chiral environment. It can separate diastereomers *and* enantiomers.

### **Step-by-Step Analysis**

**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**
*   **Starting Material**: (E)-oct-4-ene, a *trans*-alkene.
*   **Reaction**: *Anti*-dihydroxylation.
*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: Applying the rule "Trans + Anti → Meso", the reaction produces a single, achiral product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.

**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**
*   **Starting Material**: (Z)-oct-4-ene, a *cis*-alkene.
*   **Reaction**: *Anti*-dihydroxylation.
*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: Applying the rule "Cis + Anti → Racemic", the reaction produces a racemic (1:1) mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.

**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**
The chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:
1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)
2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)
3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)

The relationship between these isomers is that the meso compound is a diastereomer of the other two, which are enantiomers of each other.

**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**

*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:**
    *   This column cannot separate the enantiomers ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S)), so they will elute together as a single peak.
    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and has different physical properties, so it will be separated and elute as a different peak.
    *   **Total Peaks = 2** (one for the meso compound, one for the unresolved enantiomeric pair).

*   **Chiral HPLC:**
    *   This column is designed to separate enantiomers. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will be resolved into two separate peaks.
    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and appear as its own distinct peak.
    *   **Total Peaks = 3** (one for each of the three unique stereoisomers).

### **Conclusion**

The analysis shows that the chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option D.
