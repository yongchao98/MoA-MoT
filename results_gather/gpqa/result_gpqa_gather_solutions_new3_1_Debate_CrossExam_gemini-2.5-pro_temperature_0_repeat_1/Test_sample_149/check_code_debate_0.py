def check_correctness():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to the organic chemistry question.

    The logic follows these steps:
    1.  **Identify Starting Material:** Based on the molecular formula and NMR data, the starting material is identified as 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.
    2.  **Simulate Reaction Step 1 & 2:** The diazotization (NaNO2 + HCl) followed by hydrolysis (H2O) converts the aromatic amine (-NH2) to a phenol (-OH). The intermediate is 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.
    3.  **Simulate Reaction Step 3:** The conditions (aq. KOH, Heat) are for a self-aldol condensation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.
        - The initial product is an aldol *addition* product: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal.
        - The "Heat" condition promotes a subsequent dehydration (condensation) to form a more stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.
    4.  **Identify Final Product:** The final product after dehydration is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.
    5.  **Compare with Answer:** The function checks if the provided answer matches this derived final product.
