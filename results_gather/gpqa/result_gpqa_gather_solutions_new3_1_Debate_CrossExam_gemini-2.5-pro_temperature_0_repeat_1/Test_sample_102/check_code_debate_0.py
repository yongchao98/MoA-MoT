    # ii) Bromobenzene -> 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major). This does not establish the 1,3,5-pattern.

    # i) Benzene -> Nitrobenzene
    # ii) Nitrobenzene -> Aniline

    # This is a valid, sophisticated synthesis.
    # i) Benzene -> Acetophenone (-COCH3 is a meta-director).
    # ii) Acetophenone -> 3-Bromoacetophenone (Correct meta-direction).
    # iii) Nitration -> 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone (Major product, necessary for the next step).
    # iv) Reduction of -NO2 -> 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone.
    # v) Nitration. The powerful activating -NH2 group directs the new -NO2 to position 5.
