def check_rcm_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer for the RCM synthesis question.

    The logic follows a direct retrosynthetic analysis:
    1. The product is a 6-membered ring, so the precursor must be an octa-1,7-diene.
    2. The product is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. The substituents are at
       positions 3, 4, and 5.
    3. The most direct retrosynthesis maps the product's substituent positions (P3, P4, P5)
       to the same positions on the precursor chain (O3, O4, O5).
    4. This defines the structure of the precursor.
    5. The code then determines the correct IUPAC name for this precursor structure.
    6. Finally, it compares the derived name with the provided answer.
