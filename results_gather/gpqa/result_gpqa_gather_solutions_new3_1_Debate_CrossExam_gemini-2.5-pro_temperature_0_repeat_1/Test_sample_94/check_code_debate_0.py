Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions to determine the final product.

### **Careful Points & Step-by-Step Analysis**

1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:**
    *   The name is **3,3,6-trimethylhepta-1,5-dien-4-one**.
    *   Let's draw the structure:
        *   `hepta`: 7-carbon chain.
        *   `-4-one`: A ketone (C=O) is at carbon 4.
        *   `-1,5-dien`: Double bonds are at C1-C2 and C5-C6.
        *   `3,3,6-trimethyl`: Two methyl groups are on C3, and one is on C6.
    *   The correct structure is:
        `CH₂=CH—C(CH₃)₂—C(=O)—CH=C(CH₃)—CH₃`
        `(C1=C2) — (C3) — (C4) — (C5=C6) — (C7)`
    *   **Key Insight:** Both double bonds are conjugated with the ketone at C4, forming an α,β,α',β'-unsaturated system. This is a crucial detail often missed.

2.  **Analyze the First Reaction: Epoxidation**
    *   **Reagent:** 1 equivalent of meta-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).
    *   **Reaction:** Epoxidation of an alkene. This is an electrophilic reaction, meaning it favors electron-rich double bonds.
    *   **Reactivity:**
        *   The C1=C2 double bond is monosubstituted and conjugated (deactivated).
        *   The C5=C6 double bond is trisubstituted (activated) and conjugated (deactivated).
        *   Even with deactivation from conjugation, the trisubstituted C5=C6 bond is significantly more electron-rich than the monosubstituted C1=C2 bond. Therefore, it should be more reactive.
    *   **The Problem's Premise:** The question explicitly states, "Two different products are formed, in approximately a 1:1 ratio." We must accept this premise, even if it seems chemically unusual. This means the reaction produces a mixture of two constitutional isomers:
        *   **Product A:** 1,2-epoxy-3,3,6-trimethylhepta-5-en-4-one (from epoxidation at C1=C2).
        *   **Product B:** 5,6-epoxy-3,3,6-trimethylhept-1-en-4-one (from epoxidation at C5=C6).

3.  **Analyze the Second Reaction: Gilman Reagent Addition**
    *   **Reagent:** Methyllithium (CH₃Li) + Copper(I) iodide (CuI) → Lithium dimethylcuprate ((CH₃)₂CuLi), a Gilman reagent.
    *   **Stoichiometry:** "an excess" of the reagent is used. This is a critical point, implying that all available reactive sites should react.
    *   **Reactivity of Gilman Reagents:** They are soft nucleophiles that are excellent for:
        1.  1,4-conjugate addition to α,β-unsaturated ketones.
        2.  Sₙ2-type opening of epoxides, typically at the less sterically hindered carbon.
        3.  They do not typically react with simple ketones.

4.  **Trace the Reaction Pathways**
    The question asks for "one product that will be formed," so we only need to find one valid pathway that leads to one of the options. Let's trace the fate of Product A.

    *   **Pathway starting from Product A (1,2-epoxy-3,3,6-trimethylhepta-5-en-4-one):**
        *   This molecule has two sites that react with a Gilman reagent: the epoxide ring and the α,β-unsaturated ketone system (`-C(=O)-CH=C(CH₃)-CH₃`).
        *   **First Reaction (1,4-Addition):** Gilman reagents are highly selective for 1,4-addition. The methyl nucleophile will attack the β-carbon (C6) of the conjugated system.
        *   **Second Reaction (Epoxide Opening):** Because an *excess* of the Gilman reagent is used, it will then react with the remaining electrophilic site, the epoxide. The methyl group will attack the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide, which is C1. The ring opens to form an alcohol at C2 (after workup).
        *   **Assembling the Final Product:**
            *   The 1,4-addition of a methyl group to C6 converts the right side of the molecule: `...-CH=C(CH₃)-CH₃` → `...-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-CH₃`.
            *   The epoxide opening at C1 converts the left side: `[Epoxide at C1,C2]-...` → `CH₃-CH₂-CH(OH)-...`.
            *   The full structure is: `CH₃-CH₂-CH(OH)—C(CH₃)₂—C(=O)—CH₂—C(CH₃)₂—CH₃`.
    *   **Naming the Product:**
        *   The principal functional group is the ketone. The longest carbon chain containing it has 8 carbons (octane).
        *   Numbering from the right gives the ketone the lowest number (C4). The parent name is **octan-4-one**.
        *   The substituents are a hydroxyl group at C6, two methyl groups at C2, and two methyl groups at C5.
        *   The full IUPAC name is **6-hydroxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyloctan-4-one**.

5.  **Compare with Options and Conclude**
    *   The derived name, **6-hydroxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyloctan-4-one**, perfectly matches option A.
    *   The other options can be eliminated:
        *   B) `5-hydroxy-3,3,6,6-tetramethylhept-1-en-4-one`: This would be an intermediate from the reaction of Product B, but it would be expected to react further with the excess Gilman reagent.
        *   C) and D) are diols. This would require the reduction of the ketone, which Gilman reagents do not do.
    *   The pathway starting from Product A is mechanistically sound, respects the "excess" reagent condition, and leads directly to option A. Therefore, this is a product that will be formed.
