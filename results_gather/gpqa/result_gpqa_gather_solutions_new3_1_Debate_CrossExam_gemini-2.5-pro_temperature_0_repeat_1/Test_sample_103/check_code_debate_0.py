    # The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 (P2 / P1).
    
    # --- Physics Derivation ---
    # 1. The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the wavelength shift (Δλ).
    #    Therefore, K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 5 / 7.
    #
    # 2. The formula for K is K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * [m_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3)].
    #    Given that star masses are equal and planet masses (m_p * sin(i)) are assumed to be similar,
    #    the relationship simplifies to K ∝ P^(-1/3).
    #
    # 3. From this proportionality, we can write the ratio:
    #    K1 / K2 = (P1)^(-1/3) / (P2)^(-1/3) = (P2 / P1)^(1/3).
    #
    # 4. To solve for the desired ratio P2 / P1, we cube both sides:
    #    P2 / P1 = (K1 / K2)^3
    #
    # 5. Substitute the known ratio of wavelength shifts:
    #    P2 / P1 = (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^3
