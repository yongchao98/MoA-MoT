def check_hamiltonian_eigenvalues():
    """
    This function verifies the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian H = ε * σ.n.

    The process is as follows:
    1. Define the Pauli matrices (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) and symbolic variables (ε, n_x, n_y, n_z)
       using the sympy library.
    2. Construct the Hamiltonian matrix H symbolically.
    3. Calculate the eigenvalues of H. The result will be expressions involving the components of n.
    4. Apply the physical constraint that n is a unit vector, i.e., |n|^2 = n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1.
    5. Compare the simplified eigenvalues with the set {+ε, -ε}, which corresponds to answer C.
    6. Return "Correct" if they match, otherwise return a reason for the discrepancy.
