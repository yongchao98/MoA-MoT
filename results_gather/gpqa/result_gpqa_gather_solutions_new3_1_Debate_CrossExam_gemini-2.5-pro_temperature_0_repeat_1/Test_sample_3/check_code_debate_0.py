Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.

### Step 1: Deconstruct the Premise
The core of the question is to identify which of Maxwell's equations would be different in a universe where magnetic monopoles (isolated north or south poles) exist. This requires understanding the standard form of these equations and what each one represents physically.

### Step 2: Analyze Maxwell's Equations in Our Universe
Maxwell's four equations form the foundation of classical electromagnetism. In their differential form, they are:
1.  **Gauss's Law for Electricity:** `∇ ⋅ E = ρ / ε₀`. This relates the **divergence** of the electric field (`E`) to electric charge density (`ρ`). It means electric field lines start and end on electric charges.
2.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** `∇ ⋅ B = 0`. This states the **divergence** of the magnetic field (`B`) is zero. This is the crucial mathematical statement that there are no magnetic monopoles. Magnetic field lines always form closed loops.
3.  **Faraday's Law of Induction:** `∇ × E = -∂B/∂t`. This relates the **curl (circulation)** of the electric field (`E`) to a changing magnetic field (`B`).
4.  **Ampère-Maxwell Law:** `∇ × B = μ₀(J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t)`. This relates the **curl (circulation)** of the magnetic field (`B`) to electric currents (`J`) and changing electric fields.

### Step 3: Analyze the Impact of Magnetic Monopoles
If magnetic monopoles existed, they would be sources of the magnetic field, just as electric charges are for the electric field. This would require two fundamental changes to the equations to maintain consistency and symmetry.

*   **Careful Point 1: The Law of Magnetic Sources.** Gauss's Law for Magnetism (`∇ ⋅ B = 0`) is a direct contradiction to the existence of magnetic monopoles. If a magnetic charge (let's call its density `ρm`) existed, it would be a source of the magnetic field. Therefore, the divergence of `B` would no longer be zero. The equation would have to be modified to `∇ ⋅ B = μ₀ρm` (the constant may vary by convention).
    *   **Conclusion:** The equation related to the **divergence of the magnetic field** must change.

*   **Careful Point 2: The Law of Induction and Symmetry.** The existence of magnetic charges implies that if they move, they would create a "magnetic current" (let's call it `Jm`). Maxwell's equations are highly symmetric. The Ampère-Maxwell law shows that an electric current (`J`) creates a circulating magnetic field (`∇ × B`). For symmetry to hold, a magnetic current (`Jm`) must create a circulating electric field (`∇ × E`). This requires adding a new term to Faraday's Law. The equation would become `∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀Jm`.
    *   **Conclusion:** The equation related to the **circulation of the electric field** must also change.

### Step 4: Evaluate the Options
Based on the analysis, the two equations that would change are the ones governing the **divergence of the magnetic field** and the **circulation of the electric field**. Let's match this with the given options:

*   A) The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field.
    *   This is true but incomplete, as Faraday's Law also changes.
*   B) The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.
    *   This is incorrect. The curl of the *electric* field changes, not the magnetic field.
*   **C) The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.**
    *   **This perfectly matches our conclusions.** It correctly identifies both modified equations.
*   D) The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field.
    *   This is incorrect. These are the Ampère-Maxwell Law and Gauss's Law for Electricity, which are not directly affected by the existence of magnetic charges.
