    """
    This function checks the correctness of the answer to the exoplanet transit probability question.

    The problem asks to compare the transit probabilities of two planets.
    The ratio of probabilities p1/p2 can be derived as (9/2)^(1/3).

    The provided answer is 'B', which states:
    "Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit."

    This check verifies two things:
    1. Is Planet_1 indeed the preferred target (i.e., is the ratio p1/p2 > 1)?
    2. Is the calculated ratio approximately 1.65?
    """

    # Step 1: Define the relationships from the problem statement as ratios.
    # P2 = 3 * P1  => P2_over_P1 = 3
    # Ms1 = 2 * Ms2 => Ms1_over_Ms2 = 2
    P2_over_P1 = 3.0
    Ms1_over_Ms2 = 2.0

    # Step 2: Calculate the theoretical ratio of transit probabilities (p1/p2).
    # The derivation shows p1/p2 = a2/a1 = [ (P2/P1)^2 * (Ms2/Ms1) ]^(1/3).
    # Ms2/Ms1 is the inverse of Ms1/Ms2.
    Ms2_over_Ms1 = 1.0 / Ms1_over_Ms2
    
    # Calculate the term inside the cube root
    term_inside_cuberoot = (P2_over_P1**2) * Ms2_over_Ms1
    
    # The final calculated ratio of probabilities p1/p2
    calculated_ratio = term_inside_cuberoot**(1/3)

    # Step 3: Define the claims made by the selected answer 'B'.
    expected_preferred_planet = "Planet_1"
    expected_ratio_value = 1.65

    # Step 4: Verify the claims against the calculation.

    # Check which planet is preferred.
    # If calculated_ratio (p1/p2) > 1, Planet_1 is preferred.

    if determined_preferred_planet != expected_preferred_planet:
        return f"Incorrect: The answer states {expected_preferred_planet} is preferred, but the calculation shows {determined_preferred_planet} is preferred because the probability ratio p1/p2 is {calculated_ratio:.4f}, which is not greater than 1."
