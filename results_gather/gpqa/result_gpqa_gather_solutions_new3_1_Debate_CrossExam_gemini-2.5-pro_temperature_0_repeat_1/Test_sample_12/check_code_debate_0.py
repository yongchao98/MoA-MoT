    # --- Chemical Derivation ---
    # We will derive the major product step-by-step.
    
    # Step 1: Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene
    # Principle: Catalytic hydrogenation (H2, Pd/C) selectively reduces the less substituted double bond.
    # Application: The exocyclic (disubstituted) double bond of the isopropenyl group is reduced,
    # while the endocyclic (trisubstituted) double bond remains. The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected.
    # Product 1: (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene. Stereochemistry: C4=(R).
    
    # Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1
    # Principle: m-CPBA epoxidation is stereoselective. The reagent attacks from the less sterically hindered face.
    # Application: The bulky isopropyl group at C4 directs the attack to the opposite (*anti*) face of the ring.
    # This results in the major epoxide isomer with stereochemistry (1S, 2R, 4R).
    # Product 2: (1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane.
    
    # Step 3: Epoxide Ring-Opening
    # Principle: Under basic conditions (NaOMe), a strong nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered
    # carbon of the epoxide via an SN2 mechanism, causing inversion of configuration.
    # Application: The methoxide ion (CH3O-) attacks the secondary carbon C2 (less hindered than tertiary C1).
    # The configuration at C2 inverts from (R) to (S). Configurations at C1 and C4 are retained.
    # Product 3: (1S, 2S, 4R)-2-methoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol.
    
    # Step 4: Steglich Esterification
    # Principle: Esterification with DCC/DMAP converts the alcohol to an ester with retention of configuration.
    # Application: The hydroxyl group at C1 is converted to a propionate ester. All stereocenters are unchanged.
    # Product 4: (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.
