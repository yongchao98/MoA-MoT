    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the exoplanet orbital period problem.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. The impact parameter 'b' is proportional to the semi-major axis 'a' (b ‚àù a),
       since the inclination 'i' and stellar radius 'R_s' are constant for the system.
       b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s
       Therefore, a2/a1 = b2/b1.
    2. The maximum period for planet 2 corresponds to the maximum semi-major axis, which
       in turn corresponds to the maximum impact parameter for a transit, b2_max.
    3. The standard definition for a transit is that the planet's center must pass
       over the star's disk, so the limiting case is b2_max = 1.
    4. From Kepler's Third Law, (P2/P1)^2 = (a2/a1)^3.
    5. Combining these gives P2_max = P1 * (b2_max / b1)^(3/2).

    # Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes
    a2_div_a1 = b2_max / b1
