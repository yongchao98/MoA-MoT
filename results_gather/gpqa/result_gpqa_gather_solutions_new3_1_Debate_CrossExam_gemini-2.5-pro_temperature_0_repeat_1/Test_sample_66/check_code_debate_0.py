    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the quantum mechanics problem.

    The problem asks for the probability of measuring m1=-1 and m2=-1
    from an initial state |l=2, m=-1>, which is formed by coupling two
    l=1 particles.

    The probability is given by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:
    P = |<l1, m1; l2, m2 | l, m>|^2
      = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>|^2

    A fundamental selection rule states this coefficient is zero unless m = m1 + m2.
