    # 1. + H2O -> Alcohol (no change in methyl count)
    # 2. + PDC -> Ketone (no change in methyl count)
    # 3. + H2CPPh3 -> Alkene (adds a =CH2 group, not a methyl group)
    # 4. + TsOH -> Rearranged Alkene (protonates the =CH2 to form a new -CH3 group)
    # Therefore, the final product must have 2 (original) + 1 (new) = 3 methyl groups.

    # --- Constraint 2: Skeletal Rearrangement ---
    # The starting material contains a strained four-membered 'cyclobuta' ring.
    # The final step involves an acid-catalyzed reaction that forms a carbocation
    # adjacent to this strained ring. This provides a strong thermodynamic driving
    # force for a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement to expand the ring and relieve strain.
    # Therefore, the final product is expected to have a rearranged skeleton,
    # meaning it should NOT contain the original 'cyclobuta' ring system.
