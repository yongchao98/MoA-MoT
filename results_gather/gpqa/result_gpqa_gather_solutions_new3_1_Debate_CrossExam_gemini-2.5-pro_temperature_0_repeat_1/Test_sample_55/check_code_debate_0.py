Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, considering the provided candidate answers.

### Step 1: Deconstruct the Physics Problem

The core task is to analyze the decay of a hydrogen atom from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state. This is not a direct transition but a cascade involving two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, which means it must pass through an intermediate state. We need to identify a valid path and its corresponding probability.

### Step 2: Apply Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules

The rules governing which transitions are allowed are fundamental to solving this problem. For an E1 transition, the quantum numbers must change as follows:
*   **Δl = ±1**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by one.
*   **Δm = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number can remain the same or change by one.
*   The principal quantum number *n* must decrease for spontaneous emission, but there is no other restriction on its change.

### Step 3: Analyze the Transition Path

The decay proceeds in two steps: |3,0,0⟩ → |n',l',m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.

1.  **First Transition: |3,0,0⟩ → |n',l',m'⟩**
    *   The initial state has *l*=0. Applying the Δ*l*=±1 rule, the intermediate state must have *l'*=1.
    *   The initial state has *m*=0. Applying the Δ*m*=0,±1 rule, the intermediate state can have *m'* = -1, 0, or +1.
    *   The options provided in the question suggest the intermediate state has a principal quantum number *n'*=2.
    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.

2.  **Second Transition: |n',l',m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩**
    *   We must check if a transition from the possible intermediate states (with *l'*=1) to the final state (with *l*=0) is allowed.
    *   The change in *l* is Δ*l* = 0 - 1 = -1, which satisfies the selection rule.
    *   The change in *m* from any *m'*∈{-1,0,1} to the final *m*=0 is also allowed (Δ*m* would be +1, 0, or -1).
    *   Conclusion: All three paths, via any of the |2,1,m'⟩ states, are physically allowed by the selection rules.

### Step 4: Calculate the Transition Probability

The probability of a specific cascade is the product of the probabilities (branching ratios) of each step.

*   **Probability of the first step (|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩):**
    The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is an *s*-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. This is a crucial point. Because the initial state has no preferred direction in space, the decay must be isotropic. This means the probability of transitioning to any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels (*m'*=-1, 0, or 1) of the |2,1⟩ state must be equal. Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability for any single one is **1/3**. This can be formally proven using the Wigner-Eckart theorem.

*   **Probability of the second step (|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩):**
    Once the atom is in any of the |2,1,m'⟩ states, it will decay to a lower energy level. The only available lower energy level is *n*=1, which only has an *l*=0 subshell (the |1,0,0⟩ state). Therefore, the decay from |2,1,m'⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is the only possible E1 decay channel. Its probability is 1.

*   **Total Probability:**
    The total probability for any of the three valid routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:
    P(Total) = P(Step 1) × P(Step 2) = (1/3) × 1 = **1/3**.

### Step 5: Evaluate the Options

Now we compare our calculated result with the given options. We are looking for an option that presents a valid path with a probability of 1/3.

*   A) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 2/3: The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect.
*   B) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3: The path is valid, and the probability is correct.
*   C) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4: The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect.
*   D) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4: The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect.

The only option that correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability is B. The consensus among the reasoning of the candidate answers confirms the physical calculation, even if they disagree on the final letter due to variations in the options they were shown. Based on the options presented here, B is the unambiguous answer.
