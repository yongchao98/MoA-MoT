def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the provided answer for the exoplanet temperature ratio problem.

    The solution involves these steps:
    1.  Relate equilibrium temperature (T_eq) to orbital distance (a): T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2).
    2.  Relate orbital distance (a) to orbital period (P) using Kepler's Third Law: a ∝ P^(2/3).
    3.  Combine these to relate temperature to period: T_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2) = P^(-1/3).
    4.  Calculate the ratio T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4/P2)^(-1/3) = (P2/P4)^(1/3).
    5.  Use the given period ratios P2=2 and P4=3.5.
    6.  Compute the final value and compare it with the provided answer.
