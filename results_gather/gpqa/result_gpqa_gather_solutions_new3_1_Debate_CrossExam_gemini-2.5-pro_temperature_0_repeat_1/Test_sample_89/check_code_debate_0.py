    # --- 2. Step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence ---
    
    # Starting Material: 3,4-dimethylhexanedial (C8H14O2)
    # A 6-carbon chain (hexane) with two aldehydes (dial) and two methyl groups.
    # Total carbons = 6 + 2 = 8.
    
    # Step 1: Intramolecular Aldol Condensation
    # A 1,6-dialdehyde undergoes intramolecular aldol condensation to form a 5-membered ring.
    # Heat promotes dehydration, forming an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.
    # The reaction involves the loss of one water molecule (-H2O).
    # Intermediate 1 formula: C8H12O
    
    # Step 2: Grignard Reaction
    # CH3CH2MgBr adds an ethyl group (2 carbons) to the aldehyde.
    # The aldehyde is converted to a secondary alcohol.
    # Intermediate 2 formula: C8H12O + C2H6 = C10H18O
    
    # Step 3: PCC Oxidation
    # The secondary alcohol is oxidized to a ketone.
    # This reaction involves the loss of two hydrogen atoms (-H2).
    # Intermediate 3 formula: C10H18O - H2 = C10H16O
    
    # Step 4: Oxidative Ozonolysis
    # The C=C double bond is cleaved. The H2O workup is oxidative.
    # A C=C carbon with no hydrogens becomes a ketone.
    # A C=C carbon with one hydrogen becomes a carboxylic acid.
    # The reaction adds three oxygen atoms.
    # Final product formula: C10H16O + O3 = C10H16O4
    
    # --- 3. Analyze the proposed final product ---
