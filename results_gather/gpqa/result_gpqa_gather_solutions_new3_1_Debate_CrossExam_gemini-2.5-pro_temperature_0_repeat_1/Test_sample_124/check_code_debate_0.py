Answer 1:
The problem describes a three-dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues for such a system are given by the formula $E_n = (n + 3/2)\hbar\omega$, where $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the principal quantum number and can be any non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...).

*   **Ground state:** For the ground state, $n=0$. The energy is $E_0 = (0 + 3/2)\hbar\omega = (3/2)\hbar\omega$.
*   **First excited state:** For the first excited state, $n=1$. The energy is $E_1 = (1 + 3/2)\hbar\omega = (5/2)\hbar\omega$.
*   **Second excited state:** For the second excited state, $n=2$. The energy is $E_2 = (2 + 3/2)\hbar\omega = (7/2)\hbar\omega$.
*   **Third excited state:** For the third excited state, $n=3$. The energy is $E_3 = (3 + 3/2)\hbar\omega = (9/2)\hbar\omega$.

The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of different quantum states that have that same energy. For the n-th energy level of the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy, $g_n$, can be calculated using the formula $g_n = (n+1)(n+2)/2$.

For the third excited state, we have $n=3$. Plugging this into the degeneracy formula:

$g_3 = (3+1)(3+2)/2 = (4)(5)/2 = 10$.

This means there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions that correspond to the energy eigenvalue of the third excited state.

The possible combinations of the quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3 are:
*   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) - which is 3 states.
*   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) - which is 6 states.
*   The combination (1, 1, 1) - which is 1 state.

The total number of states is $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.

Therefore, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\hbar\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10.

Answer 2:
The problem describes a three-dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues for this system are given by the formula:

$E_n = (n + 3/2)\hbar\omega$

where $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the principal quantum number, and $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers representing the quantum numbers for the three Cartesian directions.

The energy levels are determined as follows:
*   **Ground state:** $n=0$. $E_0 = (0 + 3/2)\hbar\omega = (3/2)\hbar\omega$.
*   **First excited state:** $n=1$. $E_1 = (1 + 3/2)\hbar\omega = (5/2)\hbar\omega$.
*   **Second excited state:** $n=2$. $E_2 = (2 + 3/2)\hbar\omega = (7/2)\hbar\omega$.
*   **Third excited state:** $n=3$. $E_3 = (3 + 3/2)\hbar\omega = (9/2)\hbar\omega$.

The degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to the same value of $n$. This can be calculated using the formula:

$g_n = (n+1)(n+2)/2$

For the third excited state, we have $n=3$. The energy is:

$E_3 = (3 + 3/2)\hbar\omega = (9/2)\hbar\omega$

The degeneracy for $n=3$ is:

$g_3 = (3+1)(3+2)/2 = (4)(5)/2 = 10$

The combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3 are:
*   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) - (3 states)
*   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) - (6 states)
*   The combination (1, 1, 1) - (1 state)

The total number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) is the sum of these states: 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.

Therefore, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\hbar\omega$, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy.

Answer 3:
The problem describes a particle of mass $m$ in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, given by $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$. We need to find the energy and degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) of the third excited state.

The Schr√∂dinger equation for this system can be solved most easily by separating the variables in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$. The potential can be written as:
$V(x, y, z) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$

The Hamiltonian operator is:
$H = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} (\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2}) + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$

This Hamiltonian is a sum of three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians:
$H = H_x + H_y + H_z$
where $H_i = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_i^2} + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 x_i^2$ for $i = x, y, z$.

The energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator are given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \frac{1}{2})\hbar\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number for that dimension.

The total energy of the three-dimensional system is the sum of the energies of the three independent oscillators:
$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \frac{1}{2})\hbar\omega + (n_y + \frac{1}{2})\hbar\omega + (n_z + \frac{1}{2})\hbar\omega$
$E_N = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\omega$

Let's define a principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $N = 0, 1, 2, ...$. The energy levels are then given by:
$E_N = (N + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\omega$

Now, let's find the energy and degeneracy for the first few states:

1.  **Ground State (N=0):**
    *   $N = n_x + n_y + n_z = 0$. The only possible combination of non-negative integers is $(n_x, n_y, n_z) = (0, 0, 0)$.
    *   Energy: $E_0 = (0 + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\omega = \frac{3}{2}\hbar\omega$.
    *   Degeneracy: There is only 1 state, so the degeneracy is 1.

2.  **First Excited State (N=1):**
    *   $N = n_x + n_y + n_z = 1$. The possible combinations are $(1, 0, 0)$, $(0, 1, 0)$, and $(0, 0, 1)$.
    *   Energy: $E_1 = (1 + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\omega = \frac{5}{2}\hbar\omega$.
    *   Degeneracy: There are 3 possible states, so the degeneracy is 3.

3.  **Second Excited State (N=2):**
    *   $N = n_x + n_y + n_z = 2$. The possible combinations are:
        *   $(2, 0, 0)$, $(0, 2, 0)$, $(0, 0, 2)$ (3 states)
        *   $(1, 1, 0)$, $(1, 0, 1)$, $(0, 1, 1)$ (3 states)
    *   Energy: $E_2 = (2 + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\omega = \frac{7}{2}\hbar\omega$.
    *   Degeneracy: There are $3+3=6$ possible states, so the degeneracy is 6.

4.  **Third Excited State (N=3):**
    *   This is the state we are interested in.
    *   $N = n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$. The possible combinations are:
        *   One quantum number is 3, others are 0: $(3, 0, 0)$, $(0, 3, 0)$, $(0, 0, 3)$ (3 states).
        *   One is 2, one is 1, one is 0: $(2, 1, 0)$ and its permutations: $(2, 0, 1)$, $(1, 2, 0)$, $(0, 2, 1)$, $(1, 0, 2)$, $(0, 1, 2)$ (6 states).
        *   All three are 1: $(1, 1, 1)$ (1 state).
    *   Energy: $E_3 = (3 + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\omega = \frac{9}{2}\hbar\omega$.
    *   Degeneracy: The total number of states is the sum of the counts above: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.

The degeneracy of the N-th level can also be calculated using the formula for combinations with repetition:
$g_N = \binom{N+k-1}{k-1}$, where $k$ is the number of dimensions (here $k=3$).
$g_N = \binom{N+3-1}{3-1} = \binom{N+2}{2} = \frac{(N+2)(N+1)}{2}$.
For the third excited state, $N=3$:
$g_3 = \frac{(3+2)(3+1)}{2} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2} = 10$.

So, for the third excited state:
*   The energy is $E_3 = \frac{9}{2}\hbar\omega$.
*   The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) is 10.

Comparing this with the given options:
A) 11 \pi^2 \hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3 - Incorrect energy and degeneracy.
B) (9/2) \hbar \omega, 3 - Correct energy, but incorrect degeneracy.
C) 11 \pi^2 \hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10 - Incorrect energy.
D) (9/2) \hbar \omega , 10 - Correct energy and correct degeneracy.

Answer 4:
Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1.  **Identify the Physical System:**
    The problem describes a particle of mass $m$ in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$, where $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$. This potential is "isotropic" because it only depends on the radial distance $r$ and not on the angles.

2.  **Formulate the Hamiltonian:**
    The Hamiltonian operator for this system is the sum of the kinetic energy operator and the potential energy operator:
    $H = \frac{\hat{p}^2}{2m} + V(r) = \frac{\hat{p}_x^2 + \hat{p}_y^2 + \hat{p}_z^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$

3.  **Solve the Schr√∂dinger Equation (Method 1: Cartesian Coordinates):**
    The Hamiltonian can be separated into three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators, one for each Cartesian coordinate:
    $H = H_x + H_y + H_z$
    where $H_i = \frac{\hat{p}_i^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 q_i^2$ for $i = x, y, z$.

    The energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator are given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \frac{1}{2})\hbar\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, \dots$ is the quantum number for that dimension.

    The total energy of the 3D system is the sum of the energies of the three independent oscillators:
    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \frac{1}{2})\hbar\omega + (n_y + \frac{1}{2})\hbar\omega + (n_z + \frac{1}{2})\hbar\omega$
    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\omega$

    Let's define a principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels are then given by:
    $E_N = (N + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\omega$, where $N = 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots$

4.  **Determine the Energy of the Third Excited State:**
    The energy levels are determined by the value of $N$.
    *   **Ground State:** $N=0$. This is the lowest energy state.
    *   **First Excited State:** $N=1$.
    *   **Second Excited State:** $N=2$.
    *   **Third Excited State:** $N=3$.

    To find the energy of the third excited state, we set $N=3$ in the energy formula:
    $E_3 = (3 + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\omega = \frac{9}{2}\hbar\omega$

5.  **Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:**
    The degeneracy of an energy level $E_N$ is the number of different sets of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same energy. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to write the integer $N$ as a sum of three non-negative integers. For $N=3$, we need to find all combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ such that $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.

    Let's list the possible combinations:
    *   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:
        *   (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3)  ->  **3 states**
    *   One quantum number is 2, one is 1, and one is 0:
        *   (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2)  ->  **6 states**
    *   All three quantum numbers are 1:
        *   (1, 1, 1)  ->  **1 state**

    The total number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) is the sum of these possibilities:
    Degeneracy = 3 + 6 + 1 = **10**

    *   **Careful Point (Degeneracy Formula):** A general formula for the degeneracy of the N-th level of a d-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator is $g_N = \binom{N+d-1}{d-1}$. For our case, $d=3$, so the degeneracy is $g_N = \binom{N+2}{2} = \frac{(N+2)(N+1)}{2}$. For the third excited state ($N=3$), the degeneracy is $g_3 = \frac{(3+2)(3+1)}{2} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2} = 10$. This confirms our manual count.

### Conclusion

*   The energy of the third excited state ($N=3$) is $\frac{9}{2}\hbar\omega$.
*   The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy (degeneracy) is 10.

Comparing this result with the given options:
A) (9/2) \hbar \omega, 3
B) (9/2) \hbar \omega , 10
C) 11 \pi^2 \hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3
D) 11 \pi^2 \hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10

The correct option is B. The energy expression in options C and D corresponds to a particle in a spherical infinite potential well, which is a different physical system.

Answer 5:
Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:

1.  **Identify the Physical System:**
    The potential is given by $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term "isotropic" means that the potential is spherically symmetric, i.e., it depends only on the radial distance $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$, and the spring constant (and thus the angular frequency $\omega$) is the same in all three directions.

2.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:**
    The time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation for this system can be solved by separating variables in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$. The Hamiltonian operator is:
    $H = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$
    This can be separated into three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians:
    $H = H_x + H_y + H_z$, where $H_i = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_i^2} + \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2 x_i^2$.

    The energy eigenvalues for a 1D harmonic oscillator are given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \frac{1}{2})\hbar\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number for the $i$-th dimension.

    The total energy of the 3D system is the sum of the energies of the three independent 1D oscillators:
    $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \frac{1}{2})\hbar\omega + (n_y + \frac{1}{2})\hbar\omega + (n_z + \frac{1}{2})\hbar\omega$
    $E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\omega$

    Let's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$. The energy levels are then given by:
    $E_n = (n + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\omega$

3.  **Calculate the Energy of the Third Excited State:**
    The energy levels are determined by the value of $n$.
    *   **Ground State:** $n=0$. Energy $E_0 = (0 + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\omega = \frac{3}{2}\hbar\omega$.
    *   **First Excited State:** $n=1$. Energy $E_1 = (1 + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\omega = \frac{5}{2}\hbar\omega$.
    *   **Second Excited State:** $n=2$. Energy $E_2 = (2 + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\omega = \frac{7}{2}\hbar\omega$.
    *   **Third Excited State:** $n=3$. Energy $E_3 = (3 + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\omega = \frac{9}{2}\hbar\omega$.

    So, the energy of the third excited state is $\frac{9}{2}\hbar\omega$.

4.  **Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:**
    The degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different sets of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same total energy. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is $n=3$.

    This is a combinatorial problem. The formula for the degeneracy $g_n$ of the $n$-th level of a $d$-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator is:
    $g_n = \binom{n+d-1}{d-1} = \frac{(n+d-1)!}{n!(d-1)!}$

    For our case, $d=3$ and we are interested in the third excited state, so $n=3$.
    $g_3 = \binom{3+3-1}{3-1} = \binom{5}{2} = \frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \frac{5!}{2!3!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10$.

    Alternatively, we can list all possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:
    *   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0: (3, 0, 0). The permutations are (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3). This gives 3 states.
    *   One quantum number is 2, one is 1, one is 0: (2, 1, 0). The permutations are (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2). This gives 6 states.
    *   All three quantum numbers are 1: (1, 1, 1). There is only 1 such state.

    The total number of states (degeneracy) is the sum: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.
    Each of these 10 states corresponds to a unique, linearly independent eigenfunction.

5.  **Conclusion:**
    The energy of the third excited state is $\frac{9}{2}\hbar\omega$.
    The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy (i.e., the degeneracy) is 10.

    Comparing this result with the given options:
    A) $11 \pi^2 \hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10$ - Incorrect energy.
    B) $11 \pi^2 \hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3$ - Incorrect energy and degeneracy.
    C) $(9/2) \hbar \omega , 10$ - Correct energy and degeneracy.
    D) $(9/2) \hbar \omega, 3$ - Correct energy, but incorrect degeneracy.

The correct option is C.

*   **Plan:**
    1.  Identify the quantum mechanical system from the given potential.
    2.  Write down the energy eigenvalue formula for this system.
    3.  Determine the quantum number corresponding to the third excited state.
    4.  Calculate the energy of the third excited state using the formula.
    5.  Calculate the degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) for this energy level.
    6.  Compare the results with the given options.

*   **Execution:**

        *   Second excited state: $n=2$
        *   Third excited state: $n=3$
    4.  For the third excited state, we set $n=3$ in the energy formula:
        $E_3 = (3 + \frac{3}{2}) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$.
    5.  The degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to $n$. The formula for the degeneracy $g_n$ is $g_n = \frac{(n+2)(n+1)}{2}$. For the third excited state ($n=3$):
        $g_3 = \frac{(3+2)(3+1)}{2} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2} = 10$.
        Alternatively, we can list the possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:
        *   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) -> 3 states
        *   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) -> 6 states
        *   Permutations of (1, 1, 1): (1,1,1) -> 1 state
        Total number of states (degeneracy) = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.
    6.  The energy of the third excited state is $(9/2) \hbar \omega$, and its degeneracy is 10. This matches option A.

Answer 7:
The problem describes a three-dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues for such a system are given by the formula:

$E_n = (n + 3/2) \hbar \omega$

Here, $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers representing the quantum numbers for the three Cartesian directions. The ground state corresponds to $n=0$.

The energy levels are as follows:
*   **Ground state (n=0):** $E_0 = (0 + 3/2) \hbar \omega = (3/2) \hbar \omega$
*   **First excited state (n=1):** $E_1 = (1 + 3/2) \hbar \omega = (5/2) \hbar \omega$
*   **Second excited state (n=2):** $E_2 = (2 + 3/2) \hbar \omega = (7/2) \hbar \omega$
*   **Third excited state (n=3):** $E_3 = (3 + 3/2) \hbar \omega = (9/2) \hbar \omega$

The degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to $n$. The formula for the degeneracy, $g_n$, is:

$g_n = (n+1)(n+2)/2$

For the third excited state, we have $n=3$. Plugging this into the degeneracy formula:

$g_3 = (3+1)(3+2)/2 = (4)(5)/2 = 10$

Therefore, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2) \hbar \omega$, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to this energy.

This can be verified by listing the possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:
*   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) - **3 states**
*   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) - **6 states**
*   The combination (1, 1, 1) - **1 state**

The total number of states is 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.

Answer 8:
The problem describes a three-dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues for such a system are given by the formula:

$E_n = (n + 3/2)\hbar\omega$

where $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the principal quantum number, and $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers corresponding to the quantum numbers for each of the three Cartesian dimensions.

The energy levels are determined as follows:
*   **Ground state:** $n = 0$. The energy is $E_0 = (0 + 3/2)\hbar\omega = (3/2)\hbar\omega$.
*   **First excited state:** $n = 1$. The energy is $E_1 = (1 + 3/2)\hbar\omega = (5/2)\hbar\omega$.
*   **Second excited state:** $n = 2$. The energy is $E_2 = (2 + 3/2)\hbar\omega = (7/2)\hbar\omega$.
*   **Third excited state:** $n = 3$. The energy is $E_3 = (3 + 3/2)\hbar\omega = (9/2)\hbar\omega$.

The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy level is known as its degeneracy. For the n-th energy level of the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy, $g_n$, can be calculated using the formula:

$g_n = (n+1)(n+2)/2$

For the third excited state, we have $n=3$. Plugging this into the degeneracy formula gives:

$g_3 = (3+1)(3+2)/2 = (4)(5)/2 = 10$

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\hbar\omega$, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for this energy eigenvalue.

Answer 9:
For a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the potential is given by $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$. The energy eigenvalues for this system are determined by the principal quantum number $n$, which can take non-negative integer values ($n=0, 1, 2, ...$).

The energy of a given state is calculated using the formula:
$E_n = (n + 3/2)\hbar\omega$

The different energy states are:
*   **Ground State (n=0):** This is the lowest energy level.
    $E_0 = (0 + 3/2)\hbar\omega = (3/2)\hbar\omega$
*   **First Excited State (n=1):**
    $E_1 = (1 + 3/2)\hbar\omega = (5/2)\hbar\omega$
*   **Second Excited State (n=2):**
    $E_2 = (2 + 3/2)\hbar\omega = (7/2)\hbar\omega$
*   **Third Excited State (n=3):**
    $E_3 = (3 + 3/2)\hbar\omega = (9/2)\hbar\omega$

Therefore, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\hbar\omega$.

The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy level is known as the degeneracy of that level. For the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy, $g_n$, for a state with principal quantum number $n$ is given by the formula:
$g_n = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$

To find the number of possible linearly independent eigenfunctions for the third excited state, we set $n=3$:
$g_3 = \frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \frac{4 \times 5}{2} = 10$

Thus, for the third excited state, there are 10 possible linearly independent eigenfunctions.

Based on these calculations, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\hbar\omega$, and the degeneracy is 10.

ACTION: TEXT
GUIDANCE:
The system described is a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator.

The energy eigenvalues for this system are given by the formula:
$E_n = (n + \frac{3}{2}) \hbar \omega$
where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the principal quantum number.

The ground state corresponds to $n=0$.
The first excited state corresponds to $n=1$.
The second excited state corresponds to $n=2$.
The third excited state corresponds to $n=3$.

To find the energy of the third excited state, we set $n=3$:
$E_3 = (3 + \frac{3}{2}) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$

The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy level is its degeneracy. The degeneracy, $g_n$, for the n-th energy level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by the formula:
$g_n = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$

For the third excited state ($n=3$), the degeneracy is:
$g_3 = \frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \frac{4 \times 5}{2} = 10$

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions (i.e., the degeneracy is 10).

Comparing this with the given options:
A) (9/2) \hbar \omega, 3
B) 11 \pi^2 \hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3
C) (9/2) \hbar \omega , 10
D) 11 \pi^2 \hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10

The correct option is C.

Answer 12:
The problem describes a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues for such a system are given by the formula:

$E_n = (n + 3/2) \hbar \omega$

where $n = n_x + n_y + n_z = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the principal quantum number.

The energy levels are:
*   **Ground state (n=0):** This is the lowest energy state. $E_0 = (0 + 3/2) \hbar \omega = (3/2) \hbar \omega$.
*   **First excited state (n=1):** $E_1 = (1 + 3/2) \hbar \omega = (5/2) \hbar \omega$.
*   **Second excited state (n=2):** $E_2 = (2 + 3/2) \hbar \omega = (7/2) \hbar \omega$.
*   **Third excited state (n=3):** $E_3 = (3 + 3/2) \hbar \omega = (9/2) \hbar \omega$.

The energy of the third excited state is therefore $(9/2) \hbar \omega$.

The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy level $E_n$, known as the degeneracy ($g_n$), is the number of ways the integer $n$ can be written as the sum of three non-negative integers ($n_x, n_y, n_z$). The formula for the degeneracy is:

$g_n = (n+1)(n+2)/2$

For the third excited state, $n=3$. The degeneracy is:

$g_3 = (3+1)(3+2)/2 = (4)(5)/2 = 10$.

These 10 independent states correspond to the different combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:
*   (3,0,0) and its 2 permutations: 3 states.
*   (2,1,0) and its 5 permutations: 6 states.
*   (1,1,1): 1 state.

The total number of linearly independent eigenfunctions is $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2) \hbar \omega$, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for this energy.

Answer 14:
The problem asks for the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state of a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$.

The energy eigenvalues for this system are given by:
$E_N = (N + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\omega$
where $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the principal quantum number, and $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers representing the quantum numbers for the three Cartesian dimensions.

The energy levels are ordered by the value of $N$:
*   **Ground State:** $N=0$. Energy $E_0 = (0 + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\omega = \frac{3}{2}\hbar\omega$.
*   **First Excited State:** $N=1$. Energy $E_1 = (1 + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\omega = \frac{5}{2}\hbar\omega$.
*   **Second Excited State:** $N=2$. Energy $E_2 = (2 + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\omega = \frac{7}{2}\hbar\omega$.
*   **Third Excited State:** $N=3$. Energy $E_3 = (3 + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\omega = \frac{9}{2}\hbar\omega$.

The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy level is its degeneracy. The degeneracy, $g_N$, is the number of distinct combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to $N$. This can be calculated using the formula for combinations with repetition:
$g_N = \binom{N+k-1}{k-1}$, where $k=3$ is the number of dimensions.
$g_N = \binom{N+2}{2} = \frac{(N+2)(N+1)}{2}$

For the third excited state ($N=3$):
*   **Energy:** $E_3 = \frac{9}{2}\hbar\omega$.
*   **Degeneracy:** $g_3 = \frac{(3+2)(3+1)}{2} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2} = 10$.

The combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3 are:
1.  (3, 0, 0) and its 2 permutations: (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3). (3 states)
2.  (2, 1, 0) and its 5 permutations: (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2). (6 states)
3.  (1, 1, 1). (1 state)
Total degeneracy = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is $\frac{9}{2}\hbar\omega$, and it has a degeneracy of 10. This corresponds to option B.

Answer 15:
Proposer: The problem asks for the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state of a three-dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator. The potential is given by $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$.

The energy eigenvalues for this system are given by the formula $E_n = (n + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\omega$, where $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the principal quantum number, and $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers.

The states are:
*   Ground state: n=0.
*   First excited state: n=1.
*   Second excited state: n=2.
*   Third excited state: n=3.

For the third excited state (n=3), the energy is:
$E_3 = (3 + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\omega = \frac{9}{2}\hbar\omega$.

The degeneracy of the n-th energy level is the number of different combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to n. The formula for the degeneracy is $g_n = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$.
For the third excited state (n=3), the degeneracy is:
$g_3 = \frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \frac{4 \times 5}{2} = 10$.

This corresponds to the combinations:
*   (3,0,0): 3 permutations
*   (2,1,0): 6 permutations
*   (1,1,1): 1 permutation
Total degeneracy = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.

Thus, the energy is $(\frac{9}{2})\hbar\omega$ and the degeneracy is 10. This matches option A. Options B and D show an energy dependence of $1/r^2$, which is characteristic of a particle in an infinite spherical well, not a harmonic oscillator.

My proposed action is to run a search to confirm the energy levels and degeneracy formula for the 3D isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator.

Skeptic: Your derivation is based on standard formulas. However, it's crucial to be certain about the definitions. Does "third excited state" unambiguously correspond to n=3? Is the degeneracy formula $g_n = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$ correct and have you applied it correctly? The presence of completely different energy forms in options B and D, while likely incorrect, warrants a quick check to ensure we are not misinterpreting the potential. The proposed search is a good step to verify these foundational formulas before concluding.

Decided action: I will proceed with the search to confirm the energy eigenvalues and degeneracy for the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator.Proposer: The search results confirm my initial analysis.
The energy eigenvalues for the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by $E_n = (n + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\omega$, where $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The ground state corresponds to n=0, the first excited state to n=1, the second to n=2, and the third to n=3.

For the third excited state (n=3), the energy is indeed $E_3 = (3 + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\omega = \frac{9}{2}\hbar\omega$.

The degeneracy of the n-th level is given by the formula $g_n = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$. For n=3, this gives a degeneracy of $g_3 = \frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10$. The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions is equal to the degeneracy of the energy eigenvalue.

Therefore, the energy of the third excited state is $(\frac{9}{2})\hbar\omega$, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for this energy. This matches option A.

Skeptic: The search results are comprehensive and directly support the proposed solution. The formulas for both energy and degeneracy are consistently reported across multiple sources. The relationship between the principal quantum number 'n' and the excited state level is also clear. The reasoning is sound.

Convergence: Both roles agree on the solution. The initial reasoning was correct and has been thoroughly verified by the search results. The energy of the third excited state is $(\frac{9}{2})\hbar\omega$ and its degeneracy is 10.

The response is:
Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, including a self-debate to ensure a robust conclusion.

### Self-Debate

**Proposer:**
The task is to determine the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator.
1.  **Identify the System and Formulas:** The potential $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$ describes a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues for this system are given by $E_N = (N + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\omega$, where $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the principal quantum number ($N=0, 1, 2, ...$).
2.  **Identify the State:** The ground state corresponds to $N=0$. Therefore, the first, second, and third excited states correspond to $N=1$, $N=2$, and $N=3$, respectively. We are interested in the third excited state, so $N=3$.
3.  **Calculate the Energy:** Substituting $N=3$ into the energy formula gives:
    $E_3 = (3 + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\omega = \frac{9}{2}\hbar\omega$.
4.  **Calculate the Degeneracy:** The degeneracy, $g_N$, is the number of ways to form the integer $N$ from the sum of three non-negative integers ($n_x, n_y, n_z$). The general formula is $g_N = \frac{(N+1)(N+2)}{2}$. For $N=3$, the degeneracy is:
    $g_3 = \frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \frac{4 \times 5}{2} = 10$.
5.  **Conclusion:** The energy is $\frac{9}{2}\hbar\omega$ and the degeneracy is 10. This matches option B. My proposed action is to perform a search to confirm these standard formulas.

**Skeptic:**
The proposer's logic is sound and follows standard textbook procedures. The search results confirm the proposed formulas. Specifically, the energy eigenvalues are $E_N = (N + 3/2)\hbar\omega$, and the degeneracy is $g_N = (N+1)(N+2)/2$. The third excited state corresponds to N=3. However, it is crucial to be meticulous. Many of the provided candidate answers, despite showing correct reasoning, selected the wrong final option. This suggests a high potential for simple mistakes.

**Careful Points to Consider:**
1.  **System Identification:** The potential $V(r) \propto r^2$ is definitively a harmonic oscillator, not a particle in a spherical well, which would have an energy dependence like $1/r^2$. Options C and D are therefore incorrect.
2.  **Definition of "Third Excited State":** The ground state is the lowest energy level, which corresponds to $N=n_x+n_y+n_z=0$. The excited states are indexed sequentially. Thus, the first excited state is $N=1$, the second is $N=2$, and the third is $N=3$. This is a standard convention and is correctly applied.
3.  **Energy Calculation:** For $N=3$, the energy is $E_3 = (3 + 3/2)\hbar\omega = (9/2)\hbar\omega$. This is consistent across all valid analyses.
4.  **Degeneracy Calculation:** The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions is the degeneracy of the energy level. For $N=3$, the formula $g_3 = (3+1)(3+2)/2$ gives 10. This is also confirmed by manually counting the combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:
    *   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): 3 states.
    *   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): 6 states.
    *   The state (1, 1, 1): 1 state.
    *   Total: 3 + 6 + 1 = 10 states.
5.  **Final Option Selection:** The calculated energy is $(9/2)\hbar\omega$ and the degeneracy is 10. This corresponds exactly to option B. The frequent errors in the candidate answers highlight the importance of carefully matching the derived result to the given options.

**Convergence:**
The proposer's initial analysis is correct and has been rigorously confirmed by the search results and a careful review of the problem's definitions. Both roles agree that the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\hbar\omega$ and that there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy.
