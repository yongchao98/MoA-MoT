    Checks the correctness of the provided answer for the chemistry problem.

    The logic is to verify which option presents a self-consistent pair of (pH, volume).
    For a given pH, we can calculate the total moles of H+ required:
    Total H+ = (H+ needed for reaction) + (H+ needed to remain for final pH)
    From this, we can calculate the required volume of acid and check if it matches the
    volume given in the option.
