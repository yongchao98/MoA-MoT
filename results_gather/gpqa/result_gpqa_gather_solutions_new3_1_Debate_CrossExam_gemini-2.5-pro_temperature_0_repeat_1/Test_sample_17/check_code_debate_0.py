    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to the astrophysics problem.

    The problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, which is interpreted as
    the ratio of their silicon-to-hydrogen abundance fractions: (n_Si/n_H)_1 / (n_Si/n_H)_2.

    The calculation relies on the properties of the standard astronomical abundance notation [X/Y].
