    # --- Final Conclusion ---
    # The code confirms the following:
    # 1. The relationship between concentration and Ct is inverted (Statement C is a valid, critical error).
    # 2. The deviation between replicates is high (Statement D is a valid, but less critical error).
    # 3. The spacing between dilutions is NOT more than 3.3 (Statement A is false).
    # 4. Statement B ("qPCR cannot be used...") is false by general scientific knowledge.
    #
    # The provided answer 'C' is chosen because the inverted relationship is the most fundamental and fatal flaw,
    # making the experiment invalid for its purpose. This judgment is scientifically sound.
    # The analysis correctly identifies that both C and D are factually true but correctly prioritizes C as the main issue.
