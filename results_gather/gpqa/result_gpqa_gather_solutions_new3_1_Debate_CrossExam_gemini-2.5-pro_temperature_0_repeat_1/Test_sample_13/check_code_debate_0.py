    # It correctly identifies that IKAROS forms complexes at promoters/enhancers.

    # The physical properties of heterochromatin (dense, repetitive) make it uniquely susceptible to over-crosslinking artifacts.

    # Step 3: Compare the hypotheses to determine the most likely answer.

    # While epitope masking (C) is a general possibility, the insolubility at repeats (B)
    # is directly tied to the specific, known biology of IKAROS binding to heterochromatin.
    # Furthermore, the complete *disappearance* of peaks is better explained by a catastrophic
    # technical failure like insolubility (affecting entire domains) than by epitope masking
    # (which might just reduce signal).
