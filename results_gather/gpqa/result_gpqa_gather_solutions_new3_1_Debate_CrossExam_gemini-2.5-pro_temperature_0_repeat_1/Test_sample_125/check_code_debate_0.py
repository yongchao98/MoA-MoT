    # Reaction: Reduction of a ketone creates a new stereocenter at C3.
    # Outcome: The original stereocenter (C5) is unchanged, while the new one (C3)
    # can be R or S. This creates two products: (3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S).

    # Reactant: Pentane-2,4-dione (achiral, symmetric)
    # Reaction: Reduction of two ketones creates two new stereocenters (C2, C4).
    # Outcome: Since the start is achiral, all possible stereoisomers are formed.
    # This results in a pair of enantiomers ((2R,4R) and (2S,4S)) and a
    # meso compound ((2R,4S), which is achiral).
