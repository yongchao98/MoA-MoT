    # This is a standard alpha-bromination of a ketone.
    product_1 = "2-bromocyclohexanone"

    # Step 2: Product 1 + NaOH (heat) -> Product 2

    # The alternative, E2 elimination, is ruled out by the next step which requires a carboxylic acid.

    # Step 3: Product 2 + SOCl2/pyridine -> Product 3
    # This is a standard conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acid chloride.

    # The task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.
    # This is determined by the molecule's symmetry.

    # The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the aldehyde group and C1 of the ring.
    # This makes C2 equivalent to C5, and C3 equivalent to C4.
    # However, protons on these carbons can be diastereotopic.

    # Let's count the distinct hydrogen environments:
    # 1. The aldehyde proton (-CHO): This is unique.

    # 2. The proton on C1 (the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde): This is unique.
    c1_h_types = 1

    # 3. The protons on C2 and C5: The two protons on each of these carbons are
    #    diastereotopic because C1 is a prochiral center. This gives two distinct types.
    c2_c5_h_types = 2

    # 4. The protons on C3 and C4: Similarly, the two protons on each of these carbons
    #    are diastereotopic, giving another two distinct types.
