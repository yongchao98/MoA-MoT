Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided information.

### **Analysis of Reaction A**

*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition. The reaction involves a ketone (2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one), an α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate), and a strong, sterically hindered base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK).
*   **Step 1: Enolate Formation.** The base's role is to deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon (a carbon adjacent to the C=O group) to form a nucleophilic enolate.
    *   The ketone has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.
    *   The C2 position is quaternary, meaning it is bonded to four other carbon atoms (the carbonyl C1, the ring C3, an ethyl group, and a methyl group). It has **no α-protons** and cannot be deprotonated.
    *   The C6 position is tertiary, bonded to three other carbon atoms (the carbonyl C1, the ring C5, and a methyl group) and one hydrogen atom. It has **one α-proton**.
    *   **Careful Point:** Since only the C6 position has a proton, the base will exclusively deprotonate at this site, regardless of sterics. This forms a single, specific enolate.
*   **Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack.** The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. This is a 1,4-conjugate addition.
*   **Step 3: Product Naming.** The product has a `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` group attached to the C6 position of the original ketone. The options name the product as a derivative of ethyl propanoate.
    *   The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate`.
    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.
    *   To name the ring as a substituent, its point of attachment (the original C6) is designated as C1'.
    *   The substituents on the ring are then located: a methyl group at C1', an oxo group at C2', and an ethyl and a methyl group at C3'.
    *   **Careful Point:** Assembling the name correctly gives `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.
    *   Therefore, the full name for product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.

### **Analysis of Reaction B**

*   **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition, specifically a nitro-Michael reaction. It involves a nitroalkane (1-nitropropane), an α,β-unsaturated nitrile ((E)-but-2-enenitrile), and a base (KOH).
*   **Step 1: Carbanion Formation.** The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon α to the electron-withdrawing nitro group in 1-nitropropane. The resulting resonance-stabilized carbanion (nitronate) is the nucleophile.
*   **Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack.** The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.
*   **Step 3: Product Naming.** The resulting structure is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.
    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so its carbon is C1.
    *   The longest carbon chain containing C1 has six carbons, making the parent name **hexanenitrile**.
    *   **Careful Point:** Numbering the chain from the nitrile end: `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.
    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.
    *   Therefore, the full name for product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.

### **Conclusion**

Based on the detailed analysis:
*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.
*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.

Now, we match these correct names to the given options:

*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Product B is incorrect)
*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Both products are incorrect)
*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Product A is incorrect)
*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Both products are correct**)

The only option that correctly identifies both major products is D.
