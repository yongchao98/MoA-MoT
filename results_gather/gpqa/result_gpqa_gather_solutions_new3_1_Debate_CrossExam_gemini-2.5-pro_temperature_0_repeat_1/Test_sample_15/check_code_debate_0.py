To determine the number of optically active compounds, each molecule must be analyzed for chirality. A compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral (non-superimposable on its mirror image) and is not present as a 50:50 racemic mixture. The compounds named with specific stereodescriptors (like R, S, or E/Z) are considered to be single, pure stereoisomers.

Here is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:

1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is an alkene. The atoms involved in the carbon-carbon double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry, which makes the molecule achiral.
    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.

2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS). This indicates that the compound is a single, specific stereoisomer of a complex molecule with chiral centers. Such a molecule is chiral and, as a single enantiomer, is by definition optically active.
    *   **Conclusion**: Optically active.

3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (at C2 and C3). However, the molecule is symmetric, with identical groups (H, CH₃, COOH) on both chiral carbons. The (2R,3S) configuration creates an internal plane of symmetry, making it a **meso compound**. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers.
    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.

4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The (2R,3R) configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and its mirror image is the (2S,3S) enantiomer. Since a single enantiomer is specified, it is optically active.
    *   **Conclusion**: Optically active.

5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The (R) designation specifies a single enantiomer. The carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group (C1) is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, and two different pathways within the ring (-CH=CH- and -CH₂-CH₂-). The molecule is chiral.
    *   **Conclusion**: Optically active.

6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This notation describes the isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis). This arrangement results in a highly symmetric molecule that possesses multiple planes of symmetry. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral.
    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.

7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An examination of this ketone's structure, `(CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`, reveals no chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. The molecule is achiral.
    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.

**Final Count**:
The compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:
*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione
*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid
*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol

There are a total of **3** optically active compounds. This corresponds to option C.
