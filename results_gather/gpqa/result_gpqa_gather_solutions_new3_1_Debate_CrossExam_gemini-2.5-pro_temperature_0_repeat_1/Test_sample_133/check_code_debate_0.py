    Checks the correctness of the calculated enthalpy of neutralization.
    The function will:
    1. Calculate the moles of all reacting ions (H+, OH-, Ba2+, SO4^2-).
    2. Calculate the enthalpy change from the neutralization reaction only.
    3. Calculate the enthalpy change from the precipitation reaction.
