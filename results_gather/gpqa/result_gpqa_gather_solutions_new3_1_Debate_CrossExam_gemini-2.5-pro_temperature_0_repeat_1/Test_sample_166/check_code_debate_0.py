def check_non_gaussianity_calculation():
    """
    Checks the calculation of non-Gaussianity (nG) for a Schr√∂dinger cat state.

    The function follows these steps:
    1. Defines the given parameters: alpha and phi.
    2. Recognizes that for the given phi, the state is an "odd cat state".
    3. Acknowledges that for a pure state, the non-Gaussianity nG = S(tau),
       where S(tau) is the entropy of the reference Gaussian state.
    4. Calculates the second moments <n> and <a^2> for the odd cat state.
    5. Calculates the symplectic eigenvalue 'nu' from these moments.
    6. Calculates the entropy S(tau) using 'nu'.
    7. Compares the final calculated nG with the provided answer.
