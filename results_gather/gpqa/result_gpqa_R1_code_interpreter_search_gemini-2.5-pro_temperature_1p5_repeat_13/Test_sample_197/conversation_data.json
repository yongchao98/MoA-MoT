    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **List the Knowns:**\n    *   Total cobalt concentration, `[Co]total` = 10⁻² M = 0.01 M.\n    *   Thiocyanate concentration, `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M.\n    *   Overall stability constants for the formation of cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes from `Co²⁺` and `SCN⁻`:\n        *   `Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺`,  `β₁ = 9`\n        *   `Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]`, `β₂ = 40`\n        *   `Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, `β₃ = 63`\n        *   `Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`, `β₄ = 16`\n\n3.  **Formulate the Chemical Equations:** The total concentration of cobalt, `[Co]total`, is the sum of the concentrations of all species containing cobalt:\n    `[Co]total = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n4.  **Use the Stability Constants:** The concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]`, the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`, and the corresponding stability constant `βn`:\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n5.  **Assumption:** The concentration of the ligand `[SCN⁻]` (0.1 M) is ten times higher than the total concentration of the metal ion `[Co]total` (0.01 M). This means the ligand is in large excess. Therefore, the amount of SCN⁻ that complexes with Co²⁺ is small compared to its total concentration. We can approximate the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand `[SCN⁻]` to be equal to its initial concentration: `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n\n6.  **Derive the Mole Fraction Formula:** We want to find the fraction (`α₂`) of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex. The mole fraction of a species is its concentration divided by the total concentration of all related species.\n    `α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / [Co]total`\n\n    Substitute the expressions from step 4 into the equation from step 3:\n    `[Co]total = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n    Factor out `[Co²⁺]`:\n    `[Co]total = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n    Now substitute `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²` and the expression for `[Co]total` into the mole fraction formula:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\n    The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, leaving a formula that depends only on the known ligand concentration and stability constants:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Result:** To avoid manual calculation errors, a simple Python script can be used to compute the value of `α₂` and the final percentage.\n\n```python\n# Known values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# Calculate the terms in the denominator\nterm0 = 1\nterm1 = beta1 * scn_conc\nterm2 = beta2 * scn_conc**2\nterm3 = beta3 * scn_conc**3\nterm4 = beta4 * scn_conc**4\n\n# The denominator is the sum of all terms\ndenominator = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# The numerator is the term for the desired complex, [Co(SCN)2]\nnumerator = term2\n\n# Calculate the fraction (alpha_2)\nalpha_2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha_2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n<<<C>>>",
    "The reasoning for solving this problem involves calculating the mole fraction (α) of the desired species, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species.\n\n**1. Define the species:**\nThe cobalt-containing species in the solution are:\n*   `Co²⁺` (free ion)\n*   `[Co(SCN)]⁺` (mono-thiocyanato complex)\n*   `[Co(SCN)₂]` (di-thiocyanato complex)\n*   `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻` (tri-thiocyanato complex)\n*   `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` (tetra-thiocyanato complex)\n\n**2. Express Total Cobalt Concentration:**\nThe total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n**3. Use Stability Constants (β):**\nThe concentrations of the complexes can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]`, the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`, and the overall stability constants `βn`:\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n**4. Substitute into the Total Concentration Equation:**\nSubstitute the expressions from step 3 into the equation from step 2:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nFactor out `[Co²⁺]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**5. Define the Mole Fraction (α₂):**\nWe want to find the percentage of the blue `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex. This is its mole fraction (`α₂`) multiplied by 100.\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\nSubstitute the expressions for `[[Co(SCN)₂]]` and `c(Co)`:\n`α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**6. Assumption about Ligand Concentration:**\nThe initial thiocyanate concentration `[SCN⁻]` is 0.1 M, which is 10 times the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M). Since the ligand is in large excess, the amount that complexes with cobalt is small relative to the total. Therefore, we can approximate the equilibrium concentration of free ligand `[SCN⁻]` as its initial concentration, `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n\n**7. Calculation:**\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nThe code you executed performed this calculation:\n*   **Numerator:** `term2 = β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   **Denominator:**\n    *   `term0 = 1`\n    *   `term1 = β₁ * [SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   `term2 = 0.4`\n    *   `term3 = β₃ * [SCN⁻]³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n    *   `term4 = β₄ * [SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n    *   `Sum = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n*   **Fraction (α₂):** `α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n*   **Percentage:** `0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.916%`\n\nThe result from the code output is `16.916180326482287`, which rounds to 16.9%. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
