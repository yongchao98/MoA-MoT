The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices.

    "*   **Analysis of the experimental setup:**\n    1.  **Construct Design:** The core of the problem lies in a bicistronic vector designed for conditional expression in the presence of Cre recombinase.\n        *   It has two main parts driven by a single promoter (CBA).\n        *   **Part 1 (Ligand):** Ligand ORF -> loxP-stop-loxP -> mCherry. In the presence of Cre, the stop cassette is removed, leading to a Ligand-mCherry fusion protein (red fluorescence).\n        *   **Part 2 (Receptor):** An IRES element allows translation to start again on the same mRNA. The sequence is IRES -> Receptor ORF -> lox2272-stop-lox2272 -> eGFP. In the presence of Cre, the stop cassette is removed, leading to a Receptor-eGFP fusion protein (green fluorescence).\n    2.  **In Vitro Test:** The plasmid is transfected into astrocytes. A Western blot shows a signal for the proteins. This confirms that the CBA promoter works and the IRES element is functional, allowing the translation of both the ligand and receptor proteins (without the fluorescent tags, as Cre is not present, and the stop cassettes are intact).\n    3.  **In Vivo Experiment:** The construct is put into a mouse. This mouse is crossed with a SOX10-Cre mouse. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, so Cre recombinase will be active in these cells.\n    4.  **Expected Outcome:** In SOX10-expressing cells, Cre should excise both stop cassettes, leading to the production of both Ligand-mCherry and Receptor-eGFP fusion proteins. Therefore, both red and green signals should be visible in these cells.\n    5.  **Observation:** No green signal (Receptor-eGFP) is observed.\n\n*   **Evaluation of the Options:**\n    *   **A) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame:** When Cre recombinase removes the DNA between the lox sites (lox2272 in this case), the remaining DNA must join the Receptor ORF and the eGFP ORF seamlessly, maintaining the correct translational reading frame. A single base pair added or removed incorrectly (a frameshift mutation) will alter every subsequent codon, leading to a completely different and likely non-functional amino acid sequence, which would almost certainly include a premature stop codon. The eGFP fluorophore would not be synthesized correctly, or at all. This is a common and critical technical error in designing such constructs and would perfectly explain a complete lack of green signal.\n    *   **B) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing:** This is incorrect. The construct uses the CBA promoter, which is a strong, composite promoter/enhancer element capable of driving expression in a wide variety of cells. The Western blot in astrocytes already confirmed the construct drives protein expression.\n    *   **C) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi:** The receptor is a transmembrane protein, so it traffics through the ER-Golgi pathway to the plasma membrane. If the eGFP fusion caused misfolding, the protein might be retained in the ER or Golgi. However, if it were simply stuck, it would still be fluorescent. One would observe a green signal, but it would be mislocalized to the perinuclear region (Golgi/ER) instead of the cell membrane. The problem states there is *no* green signal, implying a failure of synthesis, not just trafficking.\n    *   **D) ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship:** This describes how the cells communicate (a secreted ligand from one cell acts on a receptor on a neighboring cell). While the endogenous pair might have a paracrine relationship, the experimental construct expresses both in the *same cell*, creating an *autocrine* loop. More importantly, the mechanism of cell signaling (paracrine, autocrine) is irrelevant to whether the Receptor-eGFP protein is successfully translated and fluoresces inside the cell. Protein expression is a prerequisite for any signaling to occur.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The most direct and plausible explanation for a complete failure to produce a functional, fluorescent Receptor-eGFP protein, despite a design that should work in the presence of Cre, is a flaw in the molecular construction. A frameshift mutation resulting from the Cre-mediated excision is a classic error that would prevent the correct translation of eGFP.\n\n<<<A>>>"
