    "This problem requires us to find the minimum uncertainty in the energy (`ΔE`) of an electron, given its speed (`v`) and the uncertainty in its position (`Δx`).\n\n**1. Identify the Knowns and Unknowns:**\n*   Speed of electron, `v = 2 * 10^8 m/s`.\n*   Uncertainty in position, `Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 * 10^-9 m = 10^-10 m`.\n*   We need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, `ΔE_min`.\n\n**2. Select Relevant Physical Principles:**\n*   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle (Position-Momentum):** This principle states that the product of the uncertainties in a particle's position and momentum has a lower bound. The formal relation is:\n    `Δx * Δp_x ≥ ħ / 2`\n    where `Δp_x` is the uncertainty in momentum along the x-direction and `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (`ħ ≈ 1.054 * 10^-34 J·s`). The minimum uncertainty corresponds to the equality: `Δx * Δp_x_min = ħ / 2`.\n\n*   **Energy-Momentum Relation:** The energy (`E`) of a particle is related to its momentum (`p`). The velocity of the particle (`v`) is given by the derivative of energy with respect to momentum, `v = dE/dp`. This is a general result from wave mechanics where the group velocity of a wave packet is `v_g = dω/dk`, and since `E = ħω` and `p = ħk`, we get `dE/dp = d(ħω)/d(ħk) = dω/dk = v`.\n    This means we can relate the uncertainty in energy to the uncertainty in momentum:\n    `ΔE ≈ (dE/dp) * Δp = v * Δp`\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (`Δp_x_min`).**\n    Using the uncertainty principle:\n    `Δp_x_min = ħ / (2 * Δx)`\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy (`ΔE_min`).**\n    Using the relationship `ΔE = v * Δp`:\n    `ΔE_min = v * Δp_x_min = v * (ħ / (2 * Δx))`\n\n*   **Step 3: Substitute the given values and constants.**\n    `v = 2 * 10^8 m/s`\n    `Δx = 10^-10 m`\n    `ħ ≈ 1.054 * 10^-34 J·s`\n\n    `ΔE_min = (2 * 10^8 m/s) * (1.054 * 10^-34 J·s) / (2 * 10^-10 m)`\n    `ΔE_min = (10^8) * (1.054 * 10^-34) / (10^-10) J`\n    `ΔE_min = 1.054 * 10^(8 - 34 + 10) J`\n    `ΔE_min = 1.054 * 10^-16 J`\n\nThis result is approximately `10^-16 J`.\n\nTo verify the calculation, we can use a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Constants\nv = 2e8  # speed of the electron in m/s\ndelta_x = 0.1e-9  # uncertainty in position in m\nhbar = 1.054571817e-34  # reduced Planck constant in J.s\n\n# From Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, the minimum uncertainty in momentum is:\n# delta_p_min = hbar / (2 * delta_x)\n# The relationship between the uncertainty in energy and momentum is ΔE = v * Δp.\n# So, the minimum uncertainty in energy is:\ndelta_E_min = v * hbar / (2 * delta_x)\n\nprint(f\"{delta_E_min:.3e}\")\n```\n>>>\n1.055e-16\n<<<\n\nThe calculated value is `1.055 * 10^-16 J`, which is approximately `10^-16 J`. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) `~10^-19 J`\nB) `~10^-18 J`\nC) `~10^-16 J`\nD) `~10^-17 J`\n\nOur calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
