    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A single atomic nucleus is at rest.\n    *   Mass = M\n    *   Rest-mass energy = E_initial = Mc^2 = 300 GeV.\n    *   Since it's at rest, its initial momentum is zero.\n\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments.\n    *   Let the rest masses of the fragments be m1 and m2.\n    *   Let their kinetic energies be T1 and T2, and their momenta be p1 and p2.\n    *   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's designate m1 as the more massive fragment: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the final rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest Masses and Energies of the Fragments**\n\nWe can use the given relations to find the rest-mass energies of the two fragments.\n\n*   `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`\n*   `(m1 + m2)*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`(2*m2 + m2)*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2`\n`3 * m2*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2`\n\nNow, substitute the value of M*c^2 = 300 GeV:\n`3 * m2*c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV`\n`3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n`m2*c^2 = 297 GeV / 3 = 99 GeV`\n\nNow we can find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment, m1:\n`m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`\n\nSo, we have:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m1): `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (m2): `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released during the fission is the difference between the initial rest energy and the sum of the final rest energies. This released energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n\n*   Q = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV\n\nThis means the total kinetic energy of the fragments is `T_total = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Kinetic Energy T1 using Classical Mechanics**\n\nIn classical (non-relativistic) mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is momentum.\n\n*   By the law of conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the final total momentum must be zero. This means the two fragments fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction.\n    `p1 = p2 = p`\n*   Now we relate the kinetic energies:\n    `T1_classical = p^2 / (2*m1)`\n    `T2_classical = p^2 / (2*m2)`\n*   Take the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n    `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n*   Since `m1 = 2*m2`, we have `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2`.\n*   This gives us `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   We know the total kinetic energy: `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substitute `T2_classical`: `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Kinetic Energy T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass energy (mc^2) is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`.\nThe total energy is also `E = T + mc^2`, where T is the kinetic energy.\n\n*   Substituting E into the energy-momentum relation: `(T + mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`.\n*   Expanding this gives: `T^2 + 2*T*(mc^2) + (mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`.\n*   This simplifies to `(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(mc^2)`.\n*   Again, by conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2`, which means `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n*   So, we can set the expressions for the two fragments equal:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n*   We have `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`, and the total kinetic energy is `Q=3 GeV`, so `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 - T1`. Let's plug in these values (all in GeV):\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   The `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    `396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n*   Now, solve for T1:\n    `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n*   The correct (relativistic) kinetic energy is `T1 = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\n\nFinally, calculate the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation.\n\n*   Difference = T1 (relativistic) - T1_classical\n*   Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV\n*   Difference = 5 MeV\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
