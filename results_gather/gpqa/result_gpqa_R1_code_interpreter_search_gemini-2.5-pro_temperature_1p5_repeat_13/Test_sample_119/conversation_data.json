    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the relationship between the number of stars and their parallax.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Relationships:**\n    *   Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. For simplicity in calculations, we can write `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (number of stars per unit volume), is constant everywhere.\n\n2.  **Number of Stars in a Volume:**\n    *   Consider a thin spherical shell of space at a distance `d` from the observer, with a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The surface area of this sphere is `A = 4 * π * d^2`.\n    *   The volume of the thin shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = 4 * π * d^2 * dd`.\n\n3.  **Number of Stars in the Shell:**\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars (`dN`) within this thin shell is the density multiplied by the shell's volume:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * (4 * π * d^2 * dd)`\n\n4.  **Converting from Distance to Parallax:**\n    *   Our goal is to express the number of stars in terms of parallax (`plx`), not distance (`d`). We need to substitute `d` and `dd` with their parallax equivalents.\n    *   We already have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   To find the relationship between the infinitesimals `dd` and `d(plx)`, we differentiate `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = -1/plx^2`\n        So, `dd = - (1/plx^2) * d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign simply indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. When we consider the number of stars in a given range (an absolute quantity), we are interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign. `dd ≈ (1/plx^2) * d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Putting It All Together:**\n    *   Now, substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` into the equation for `dN`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx)^2 * [ (1/plx^2) * d(plx) ]`\n    *   Simplify the expression:\n        `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) * d(plx)`\n        `dN = (4 * π * ρ) * (1/plx^4) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Finding the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:**\n    *   The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax\", which is mathematically represented as `dN/d(plx)`. We can find this by rearranging the equation from the previous step:\n        `dN/d(plx) = (4 * π * ρ) / plx^4`\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are constants, we can see the direct proportionality:\n        **`dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^4`**\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax as `~ 1/plx^4`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
