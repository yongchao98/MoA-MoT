    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues to Identify Substance X:**\n\n    *   **Clue 1: \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\" and \"its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"** This strongly suggests a common reagent where hydrogen has been replaced by its heavier isotope, deuterium (D). Powerful reducing agents like Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) and Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) are frequently used in organic chemistry. Their deuterated analogs, Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄) and Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄), are also common for isotopic labeling. So, X is likely LiAlD₄ or NaBD₄.\n\n    *   **Clue 2: \"Reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\"**\n        *   Metal hydrides and deuterides react violently with water. Let's assume Y is water. If it's normal water (H₂O), the reaction with LiAlD₄ would produce a mix of gases (H₂, HD, D₂). If the liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O), the reaction is:\n            LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂\n        *   Let's analyze the gas produced, W = D₂ (Deuterium gas).\n        *   A single deuterium atom (D or ²H) contains 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n        *   A molecule of D₂ therefore contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This perfectly matches the clue that gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. This supports the idea that X is a deuteride and Y is heavy water (D₂O).\n\n    *   **Clue 3: \"A precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B.\"**\n        *   From the reaction above, the products are LiOD (soluble) and Al(OD)₃ (Aluminum deuteroxide). Aluminum hydroxide is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. So, G is Al(OD)₃.\n        *   When metal hydroxides/deuteroxides are heated, they decompose to the metal oxide and water/heavy water.\n            2 Al(OD)₃(s) --(heat)--> Al₂O₃(s) + 3 D₂O(g)\n        *   The substance *released* is B, which must be the volatile D₂O.\n\n    *   **Clue 4: \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"**\n        *   We deduced B is D₂O. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C).\n        *   276.97 K is indeed \"very close to 277 K\". This confirms that B is D₂O.\n\n    *   **Clue 5: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"**\n        *   A keto acid has a general structure R-(C=O)-R'-COOH. It contains 3 oxygen atoms.\n        *   LiAlH₄ is a strong reducing agent capable of reducing both ketones (>C=O) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) to alcohols (-CH(OH)-) and (-CH₂OH), respectively. NaBH₄ is generally not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids.\n        *   The reaction R-(C=O)-R'-COOH + LiAlD₄ → R-CD(OH)-R'-CD₂OH results in a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups), which contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n        *   This confirms that X must be the more powerful reducing agent, LiAlD₄, rather than NaBD₄.\n\n2.  **Identify the Elements and Their Masses:**\n\n    *   Based on the analysis, **Substance X is LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride).\n    *   The elements present in the molecule are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Deuterium (D), which is an isotope of Hydrogen.\n    *   To find the lightest and heaviest elements, we compare their atomic masses (or simply their position in the periodic table).\n        *   Deuterium (D or ²H): An isotope of Hydrogen (Z=1). Mass number = 2.\n        *   Lithium (Li): (Z=3). Atomic mass ≈ 7 u.\n        *   Aluminium (Al): (Z=13). Atomic mass ≈ 27 u.\n    *   Therefore, the **lightest element is Deuterium (D)** and the **heaviest element is Aluminium (Al)**.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". This means we must sum the mass of all atoms of the lightest element and all atoms of the heaviest element found in one formula unit of LiAlD₄. We will use integer mass numbers, which is standard for this type of problem and aligns with the integer answer choices.\n    *   **Heaviest element (Aluminium):** There is one atom of Al in LiAlD₄. Its mass number is 27.\n        *   Mass from Al = 1 × 27 = 27\n    *   **Lightest element (Deuterium):** There are four atoms of D in LiAlD₄. The mass number of D is 2.\n        *   Mass from D = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Cumulative (total) mass:**\n        *   Total = (Mass from Al) + (Mass from D) = 27 + 8 = 35\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>"
