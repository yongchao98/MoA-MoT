    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct reagents for the given reactions.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves a ketone (butan-2-one) reacting with a cyanide source (NaCN) to form a cyanohydrin (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile).\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:** The formation of a cyanohydrin is a nucleophilic addition reaction.\n    *   The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n    *   This attack breaks the C=O pi bond, forming a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n    *   `CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂CH₃ + CN⁻  ⇌  CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂CH₃`\n    *   This alkoxide intermediate must be protonated to form the final stable product, which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   `CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂CH₃ + H⁺  ⟶  CH₃-C(OH)(CN)-CH₂CH₃` (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile)\n3.  **Determine the role of reagent A:** Reagent 'A' must be a source of protons (H⁺) to complete the reaction by protonating the alkoxide intermediate. The reaction is typically carried out by adding a mineral acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄) to a solution of NaCN to generate hydrocyanic acid (HCN) in situ. The overall process requires an acidic component. Therefore, 'A' must be an acid.\n4.  **Evaluate the options for A:**\n    *   `H₃O⁺`: This represents a strong acid in aqueous solution (e.g., from HCl or H₂SO₄). This is a suitable proton source for the reaction.\n    *   `NaHSO₃` (Sodium bisulfite): This reagent undergoes its own characteristic addition reaction with ketones to form bisulfite addition products. It is not the correct reagent to facilitate cyanohydrin formation.\n5.  **Conclusion for A:** Reagent 'A' must be `H₃O⁺`. This eliminates options B and C.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a classic hydrolysis of a nitrile.\n2.  **Analyze the reaction conditions:** Nitrile hydrolysis can be carried out under either strong acidic or strong basic conditions, usually with heating. The reaction is written as `... + B (H₂O) ---> ...`, indicating that B is the catalyst used in water. The product is the carboxylic acid itself, not its salt, which suggests an acid-catalyzed pathway is the most direct route presented.\n    *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** `R-CN + 2 H₂O + H⁺  ⟶  R-COOH + NH₄⁺`. This is typically done by refluxing the nitrile with a strong aqueous acid like HCl or H₂SO₄.\n    *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** `R-CN + OH⁻ + H₂O  ⟶  R-COO⁻ + NH₃`. This initially forms the carboxylate salt. A separate acidification step (`H₃O⁺`) is required to obtain the final carboxylic acid (`R-COOH`). Since the reaction shows direct formation of the acid, an acidic catalyst is implied.\n3.  **Determine the role of reagent B:** Reagent 'B' acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis. For an efficient reaction, a strong acid is required.\n4.  **Evaluate the options for B:** We are choosing between the remaining options A and D.\n    *   `CH₃COOH` (Acetic acid): This is a weak acid. It is generally not effective for hydrolyzing nitriles under standard conditions. The reaction would be extremely slow.\n    *   `HCl` (Hydrochloric acid): This is a strong acid and is a common and effective reagent for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n5.  **Conclusion for B:** Reagent 'B' must be `HCl`.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\n*   For the first reaction, `A` must be `H₃O⁺`.\n*   For the second reaction, `B` must be `HCl`.\n\nCombining these two conclusions, the correct pair of reagents is A = `H₃O⁺` and B = `HCl`. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
