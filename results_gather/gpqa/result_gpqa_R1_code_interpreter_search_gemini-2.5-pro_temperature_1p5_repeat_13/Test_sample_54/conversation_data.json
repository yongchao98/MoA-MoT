    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**1. Analyze the Number of Signals and Integrations:**\nThe 1H NMR spectrum shows four distinct signals with the following integrations (number of protons):\n*   Signal 1: 1H (a single proton)\n*   Signal 2: 1H (a single proton)\n*   Signal 3: 3H (a methyl group)\n*   Signal 4: 3H (another methyl group)\nThe total number of protons is 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8 protons.\n\nLet's check the chemical formulas of the options:\n*   Propenyl acetate (CH3-COO-CH=CH-CH3): C5H8O2. This has 3+1+1+3 = 8 protons. This matches.\n*   Butenyl acetate (CH3-COO-CH=CH-CH2-CH3): C6H10O2. This has 3+1+1+2+3 = 10 protons. This does not match.\n\nThis initial analysis immediately rules out both Cis-butenyl acetate and Trans-butenyl acetate, as they do not have 8 protons. We are left with Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Signal in Detail:**\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This corresponds to a methyl group (CH3).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is typical for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (an acyl methyl group).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** The protons are not coupled to any adjacent protons.\n    *   **Assignment:** This signal is characteristic of the acetate methyl group (`CH3-COO-`) in all the proposed structures.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This corresponds to a second methyl group (CH3).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** According to the n+1 rule, this methyl group is adjacent to a carbon with one proton (a CH group).\n    *   **Assignment:** This signal must be the methyl group attached to the double bond (`=CH-CH3`).\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This is a single proton on the double bond (a vinylic proton).\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons.\n        *   The 'd' (doublet) part means it's coupled to one other proton. This must be the other proton on the double bond.\n        *   The 'q' (quartet) part means it's coupled to three equivalent protons (a CH3 group). This must be the methyl group at 1.6 ppm.\n    *   **Assignment:** This is the vinylic proton adjacent to the methyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This is the second vinylic proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is significantly downfield, which is expected for a vinylic proton attached to an electronegative oxygen atom (`-O-CH=`).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This proton is coupled to only one other proton, which is the proton at 5.5 ppm.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the most crucial piece of information for determining the stereochemistry. The coupling constant (J) between two protons across a double bond is highly dependent on their relative positions:\n        *   **Trans-coupling (³J_trans):** Typically in the range of 12-18 Hz.\n        *   **Cis-coupling (³J_cis):** Typically in the range of 6-12 Hz.\n    *   The observed value of 16.0 Hz falls squarely within the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\n*   The number of protons rules out the butenyl acetate options.\n*   The coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) between the two vinylic protons (at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm) definitively indicates a *trans* stereochemistry.\n*   Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nLet's draw the final structure and confirm the assignments:\n\n```\n      H(b) 7.0 ppm (d)\n     /\nH3C(d)-C(c) 5.5 ppm (dq)\n     \\\\\n      C(b) - O - C(=O) - CH3(a) 2.1 ppm (s)\n     /\n    H(c)\n(Structure shown in a simplified way)\n\nCorrected drawing and assignments:\n\n      H(b) 7.0 ppm         CH3(a) 2.1 ppm\n        \\                  /\n         C = C - O - C = O\n        /     \\\n       H(c)   CH3(d)\n    5.5 ppm    1.6 ppm\n\n- H(b) and H(c) are trans to each other, resulting in a large J-coupling (J = 16.0 Hz).\n- H(b) is a doublet because it only couples to H(c).\n- H(c) is a doublet of quartets because it couples to H(b) (d) and the three protons of CH3(d) (q).\n- CH3(d) is a doublet because it couples to H(c).\n- CH3(a) is a singlet because it has no adjacent protons.\n```\nAll data points are consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
