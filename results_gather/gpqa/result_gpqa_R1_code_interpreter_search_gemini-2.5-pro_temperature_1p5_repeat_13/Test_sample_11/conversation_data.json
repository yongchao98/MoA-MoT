    "This problem involves the decay of a stationary particle, which is a classic application of the principles of conservation of energy and momentum in the context of special relativity.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the Process:** The decay is $\\pi^+ \\to \\mu^+ + \\nu_\\mu$. A positive pion decays into a positive muon and a muon neutrino.\n\n2.  **State the Knowns:**\n    *   The pion ($\\pi^+$) is stationary, meaning its initial momentum is zero ($p_{\\pi^+} = 0$) and its initial kinetic energy is zero ($KE_{\\pi^+} = 0$).\n    *   Rest mass energy of the pion, $E_{\\pi^+} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = 139.6 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   Rest mass energy of the muon, $m_{\\mu^+}c^2 = 105.7 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   The muon neutrino ($\\nu_\\mu$) is assumed to be massless, so its rest mass energy $m_{\\nu_\\mu}c^2 = 0$. For a massless particle, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy ($E_{\\nu_\\mu} = KE_{\\nu_\\mu}$) and is related to its momentum by $E = pc$.\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial pion is at rest (momentum = 0), the total momentum of the final products must also be zero.\n        $\\vec{p}_{\\text{initial}} = \\vec{p}_{\\text{final}}$\n        $0 = \\vec{p}_{\\mu^+} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu_\\mu}$\n        This implies that the muon ($\\mu^+$) and the neutrino ($\\nu_\\mu$) fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this momentum magnitude 'p'.\n        $p_{\\mu^+} = p_{\\nu_\\mu} = p$\n\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n        $E_{\\text{initial}} = E_{\\text{final}}$\n        The initial energy is just the rest energy of the stationary pion. The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n        $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = E_{\\mu^+} + E_{\\nu_\\mu}$\n        $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = (m_{\\mu^+}c^2 + KE_{\\mu^+}) + E_{\\nu_\\mu}$\n\n4.  **Solve for Kinetic Energies:**\n\n    We can express the energies in terms of the common momentum, p.\n    *   For the massless neutrino: $E_{\\nu_\\mu} = KE_{\\nu_\\mu} = pc$.\n    *   For the massive muon, we use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E_{\\mu^+}^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$.\n\n    Now substitute these into the energy conservation equation:\n    $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = E_{\\mu^+} + pc$\n    Rearrange to isolate $E_{\\mu^+}$:\n    $E_{\\mu^+} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc$\n\n    Square this equation:\n    $E_{\\mu^+}^2 = (m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc)^2 = (m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2$\n\n    Now, set the two expressions for $E_{\\mu^+}^2$ equal to each other:\n    $(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2 = (m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2$\n\n    The $(pc)^2$ terms on both sides cancel out:\n    $(m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2 = (m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc)$\n\n    Solve for `pc` (the momentum of each particle):\n    $2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n    $pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)}$\n\n    Now we can calculate the kinetic energies:\n\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino ($KE_{\\nu_\\mu}$):**\n        $KE_{\\nu_\\mu} = pc = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6} = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.78 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon ($KE_{\\mu^+}$):**\n        The total energy released (Q-value) is the difference in rest masses, which is shared as kinetic energy between the products.\n        $Q = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - m_{\\mu^+}c^2 = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n        $Q = KE_{\\mu^+} + KE_{\\nu_\\mu}$\n        $KE_{\\mu^+} = Q - KE_{\\nu_\\mu} = 33.9 - 29.78 \\approx 4.12 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\nLet's use a Python script for a more precise calculation.\n```python\n# Given rest masses in MeV/c^2\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# --- Method 1: Deriving momentum first ---\n# pc = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n# KE_nu = pc\n# KE_mu = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2 - KE_nu\n\n# --- Method 2: A more direct formula for the heavier particle's KE ---\n# This formula is derived in the reasoning process: KE = (delta_m)^2 / (2 * m_initial)\nke_mu = (m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2)**2 / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# Calculate the Q-value (total kinetic energy released)\nq_value = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\n\n# The remaining energy is the kinetic energy of the neutrino\nke_nu = q_value - ke_mu\n\nprint(f\"KE of muon (mu+): {ke_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino (nu): {ke_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n>KE of muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV\nKE of neutrino (nu): 29.78 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon ($\\mu^+$) and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino ($\\nu_\\mu$).

    "The problem asks for the kinetic energies of the two product particles, a muon ($\\mu^+$) and a neutrino ($\\nu$), from the decay of a stationary pion ($\\pi^+$).\n\n**1. Principles**\nWe will use the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum from special relativity.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial pion is stationary, so its momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the products must also be zero. This means the muon and the neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    *   $\\vec{p}_{\\pi^+} = 0$\n    *   $\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu} = 0 \\implies |\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay equals the total energy after the decay. The initial energy is the rest mass energy of the pion since it is stationary. The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n    *   $E_{\\text{initial}} = E_{\\text{final}}$\n    *   $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = E_{\\mu^+} + E_{\\nu}$\n\n**2. Given Values**\n*   Rest mass energy of pion, $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = 139.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   Rest mass energy of muon, $m_{\\mu^+}c^2 = 105.7 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   The neutrino ($\\nu$) is considered massless, so its rest mass is zero, and its energy is purely kinetic ($E_{\\nu} = KE_{\\nu}$).\n\n**3. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\nFor any particle, its total energy ($E$), momentum ($p$), and rest mass ($m$) are related by:\n$E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$\n\n*   For the massless neutrino ($m_\\nu = 0$): $E_{\\nu}^2 = (pc)^2 \\implies E_{\\nu} = pc$. Since the neutrino's rest mass is zero, its total energy is its kinetic energy: $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} = pc$.\n*   For the massive muon: $E_{\\mu^+}^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$. Its kinetic energy is $KE_{\\mu^+} = E_{\\mu^+} - m_{\\mu^+}c^2$.\n\n**4. Calculation**\n\nLet's use the conservation of energy equation:\n$m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = E_{\\mu^+} + E_{\\nu}$\n\nSubstitute $E_{\\nu} = pc$ and isolate $E_{\\mu^+}$:\n$E_{\\mu^+} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc$\n\nSquare this equation:\n$E_{\\mu^+}^2 = (m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc)^2 = (m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2$\n\nNow, equate this with the energy-momentum relation for the muon:\n$(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2 = (m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2$\n\nThe $(pc)^2$ term cancels from both sides. We can now solve for the momentum term, $pc$:\n$(m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2 = (m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc)$\n$2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n$pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)}$\n\nNow, plug in the given values:\n$pc = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6} = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.78 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nThis value, $pc$, is the kinetic energy of the massless neutrino.\n$KE_{\\nu} = pc \\approx 29.8 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nTo find the kinetic energy of the muon, we can use the fact that the total kinetic energy released (the Q-value) is the initial rest energy minus the final rest energies:\n$Q = KE_{\\mu^+} + KE_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - m_{\\mu^+}c^2 - m_{\\nu}c^2$\n$Q = 139.6 \\text{ MeV} - 105.7 \\text{ MeV} - 0 = 33.9 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nNow we can find the muon's kinetic energy:\n$KE_{\\mu^+} = Q - KE_{\\nu} = 33.9 \\text{ MeV} - 29.78 \\text{ MeV} = 4.12 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are:\n*   Kinetic Energy of muon ($\\mu^+$): 4.12 MeV\n*   Kinetic Energy of neutrino ($\\nu$): 29.8 MeV\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nB) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nC) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nD) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
