These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three reactions to determine the correct reactants and major products.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a base (sodium ethoxide, NaOEt), the highly acidic α-proton between the two ester groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃. The β-carbon is electrophilic due to conjugation with the carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the central carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   This attack pushes the π-electrons onto the α-carbon, forming a new enolate intermediate: `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - C⁻H-COOCH₃`.\n    *   This enolate is then protonated by the solvent (ethanol, EtOH) to yield the final neutral product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The final product has the structure: `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n\n4.  **Name Product A:**\n    *   To name this molecule, we can consider it a derivative of propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid.\n    *   The carbon chain is: C¹(H)(COOCH₃)₂ - C²(H)(p-tolyl) - C³(H₂)COOCH₃.\n    *   The IUPAC name is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n    *   This matches the name given for A in options A and B. Options C and D list a different constitutional isomer, trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, which is incorrect.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type, Donor, and Acceptor:**\n    *   This is a Stork enamine alkylation, which is a variation of the Michael addition.\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the α-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN. It is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium ion at the cyclohexanone part and a carbanion stabilized by the nitrile group.\n    *   The reaction is followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺). This workup serves two purposes:\n        1.  It protonates the carbanion to give `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n        2.  It hydrolyzes the iminium salt back into a ketone (cyclohexanone) and piperidinium salt.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The result is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2).\n    *   The substituent is derived from the butenenitrile: `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The final product is 2-[CH(CH₃)CH₂CN]-cyclohexanone.\n\n4.  **Name Product B:**\n    *   The parent structure is butanenitrile.\n    *   The substituent at position 3 of the butanenitrile chain is a (2-oxocyclohexyl) group.\n    *   The IUPAC name is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n    *   This corresponds to the name for B in options A and B. The name in options C and D, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, represents the enol tautomer, which is generally the minor product compared to the more stable keto form under these conditions.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction in Reverse (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   This is a Michael addition where the product is known, and we must identify the starting nucleophile (Reactant C).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The main structure is a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring, and the substituent at position 2 is a `3-oxobutyl` group (-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃.\n    *   In a Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the acceptor. Here, the β-carbon is the CH₂ group. After the reaction and protonation, the acceptor becomes the `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃` fragment, which is exactly the `3-oxobutyl` group seen in the product.\n    *   Therefore, the bond is formed between the C2 of the nucleophile and the β-carbon of MVK.\n\n2.  **Identify Reactant C:**\n    *   The nucleophile (`C`) must be the molecule that, after losing a proton, becomes the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` anion which attacks MVK.\n    *   The starting material `C` is therefore **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The protons on the methylene carbon between the two carbonyls (C2) are very acidic (pKa ≈ 5) and are readily removed by KOH to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options for C:**\n    *   Options A and D suggest C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione. This is consistent with our analysis.\n    *   Options B and C suggest C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione. This is incorrect; the reactant is the simple dione.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **Product B:** 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **Reactant C:** cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nCombining these findings, the only option that correctly identifies all three components is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
