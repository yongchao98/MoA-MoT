    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction and the Goal**\n\nThe reaction is the electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) of various monosubstituted benzene derivatives with excess bromine (Br₂). The goal is to arrange the starting substances in order of *increasing* yield of the *para-brominated* product. This yield depends on the directing effect (ortho, meta, or para) and the steric properties of the substituent already on the benzene ring.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\n\nFirst, we classify each substituent based on its effect on the benzene ring's reactivity and its directing influence:\n\n*   **Activating, ortho/para-directing groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive, and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   **1) -CH₃ (methyl):** Alkyl group, activating, o,p-directing.\n    *   **5) -C₂H₅ (ethyl):** Alkyl group, activating, o,p-directing.\n\n*   **Deactivating, ortho/para-directing groups:** These groups withdraw electron density (deactivating) but have lone pairs that can be donated via resonance, directing the electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   **3) -Cl (chloro):** Halogen, deactivating, o,p-directing.\n\n*   **Deactivating, meta-directing groups:** These groups strongly withdraw electron density, making the ring less reactive, and direct the electrophile to the meta position. For these groups, the yield of the para-isomer will be very low.\n    *   **2) -COOC₂H₅ (ethyl ester):** Deactivating, m-directing.\n    *   **4) -NO₂ (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, m-directing.\n    *   **6) -COOH (carboxylic acid):** Deactivating, m-directing.\n\n**3. Analyze the Groups with Low Para Yield (Meta-Directors)**\n\nThe substances with meta-directing groups (2, 4, 6) will produce the smallest amount of the para-isomer. To order them, we need to consider the strength of their deactivating effect. A stronger deactivating group makes the ortho and para positions even less favorable, leading to an even lower para yield.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is generally: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n*   **-NO₂ (4)** is the strongest deactivating group in the list. It will result in the highest proportion of the meta product and, consequently, the lowest proportion of the para product.\n*   **-COOH (6)** is a strong deactivator, but less so than -NO₂.\n*   **-COOC₂H₅ (2)** is the weakest deactivator among the three meta-directors. The ethyl group is slightly electron-donating, which slightly mitigates the deactivating effect of the carbonyl compared to the acidic proton in -COOH.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for these three is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**4. Analyze the Groups with High Para Yield (Ortho/Para-Directors)**\n\nThe substances with ortho/para-directing groups (1, 3, 5) will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer. The ratio of para to ortho product is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** A bulkier substituent will sterically hinder the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, thus increasing the proportion of substitution at the less crowded para position.\n    *   The size of the groups is: **-C₂H₅ > -CH₃**. The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group.\n    *   Therefore, ethylbenzene (**5**) will produce a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene (**1**).\n\n*   **Electronic and Steric Effects for -Cl:** The chlorine atom (**3**) is a special case. It is deactivating due to its strong inductive electron withdrawal (-I effect), but it directs ortho/para due to resonance (+R effect). The strong -I effect deactivates the ortho positions more significantly than the more distant para position. Furthermore, the size of the chlorine atom also provides steric hindrance. Both effects strongly favor substitution at the para position. Experimental data for the bromination of chlorobenzene shows a very high para selectivity (around 87-90% para). This is a higher para selectivity than for alkylbenzenes like toluene (around 62% para).\n\nTherefore, comparing the ortho/para directors, the order of increasing para yield is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**5. Combine the Groups to Form the Final Order**\n\nNow, we combine the two sequences. The meta-directors will have lower para yields than the ortho/para-directors.\n\n*   Low para yield sequence: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   High para yield sequence: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nCombining them gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence:\nNitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate < Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene\n\n**6. Match with the Given Options**\n\nThe derived order **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3** matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
