    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental data provided:**\n    *   **1H NMR Spectroscopy:** The key finding is the presence of two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton.\n        *   The total integral for these two peaks is 1H, which is the expected value for a single proton.\n        *   The integrals of the two peaks are roughly equal, suggesting the two species responsible for these peaks are present in a roughly 1:1 ratio.\n        *   Spin-spin coupling is ruled out, meaning the peak splitting is not due to neighboring protons. This implies the two peaks arise from two different chemical species.\n    *   **LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry):**\n        *   The analysis shows two separate peaks in the liquid chromatogram (LC). This confirms the presence of two distinct chemical species that can be separated based on their physical properties (i.e., how they interact with the chromatography column).\n        *   The intensities of the two LC peaks are equal, which corroborates the NMR observation of a 1:1 mixture.\n        *   The mass spectrum (MS) for both peaks is identical and matches the mass of the expected peptide. This is a crucial piece of information.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the options based on the data:**\n\n    *   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** If an amino acid had coupled twice, the resulting molecule would have a different chemical formula and therefore a different molecular weight. The mass spectrum would not be consistent with the *expected* molecule. This contradicts the MS data.\n\n    *   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor (a starting material or an intermediate) would almost certainly have a different molecular weight than the final product. Again, this contradicts the MS data, which shows both species have the mass of the final product.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have the same chemical formula and thus the same molecular weight.\n        *   **NMR Properties:** Because they are different compounds, diastereoisomers have different physical and spectroscopic properties. They will produce distinct NMR spectra. It is expected that corresponding protons (like an alpha-proton) in a pair of diastereomers would have different chemical shifts. This perfectly explains the two peaks for the same alpha-proton.\n        *   **LC Properties:** Since they have different physical properties, diastereomers can be separated by standard (achiral) chromatography techniques like HPLC/LC. This explains the two peaks in the chromatogram.\n        *   **MS Properties:** Since they have the same molecular weight, they will give identical mass spectra. This matches the LC-MS data.\n        *   **In the context of peptides, how can diastereomers form?**\n            1.  **Epimerization:** One of the chiral centers (an alpha-carbon of an amino acid) could have partially or fully inverted its stereochemistry during synthesis, leading to a mixture of epimers (which are a type of diastereomer). For example, if you are making L-Ala-L-Val, some L-Ala could have converted to D-Ala, yielding a mixture of L-Ala-L-Val and D-Ala-L-Val.\n            2.  **Cis/Trans Isomerism:** The peptide (amide) bond has significant double-bond character, restricting rotation. This can lead to stable *cis* and *trans* isomers. These isomers are a form of diastereomer. This phenomenon is particularly common for peptide bonds involving a proline residue. These *rotamers* or *atropisomers* interconvert slowly on the NMR timescale, leading to a doubling of many peaks in the spectrum.\n        *   This option is fully consistent with all the experimental evidence.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.\n        *   **NMR Properties:** In a standard, achiral NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable. They have identical NMR spectra. You would see only a single peak for the alpha-proton, not two.\n        *   **LC Properties:** Enantiomers cannot be separated by standard, achiral LC. They would co-elute as a single peak. Separation requires a special chiral column or chiral additive.\n        *   This option contradicts both the NMR and the LC data (assuming standard achiral conditions for a crude analysis).\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The observation of two species that have the same mass but are separable by chromatography and distinguishable by NMR is the classic signature of a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<C>>>"
