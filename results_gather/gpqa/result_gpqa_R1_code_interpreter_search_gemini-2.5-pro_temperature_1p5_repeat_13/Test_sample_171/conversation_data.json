    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical principle:** The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars. The assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) means we can use the Boltzmann equation to describe this population distribution.\n\n2.  **State the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in a higher energy level ($N_j$) to the number of atoms in a lower energy level ($N_i$) as a function of temperature (T):\n    $$ \\frac{N_j}{N_i} = \\frac{g_j}{g_i} e^{-\\Delta E / (kT)} $$\n    where:\n    *   $g_j$ and $g_i$ are the statistical weights of the levels (constants for a given transition).\n    *   $\\Delta E$ is the energy difference between the levels ($E_j - E_i$).\n    *   $k$ is the Boltzmann constant ($k \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J/K}$).\n    *   $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Interpret the problem statement:** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". In the context of statistical mechanics, \"excitation\" refers to the ratio of the population of an excited state to a lower state. Let's define this ratio as $R = N_j / N_i$.\n    The problem statement can be mathematically written as:\n    $$ R_1 = 2 \\times R_2 $$\n    where $R_1$ is the ratio for star_1 (temperature $T_1$) and $R_2$ is the ratio for star_2 (temperature $T_2$).\n\n4.  **Apply the Boltzmann Equation to the two stars:**\n    *   For star_1 (temperature $T_1$):\n        $$ R_1 = \\frac{g_j}{g_i} e^{-\\Delta E / (kT_1)} $$\n    *   For star_2 (temperature $T_2$):\n        $$ R_2 = \\frac{g_j}{g_i} e^{-\\Delta E / (kT_2)} $$\n\n5.  **Combine the equations:** Substitute the expressions for $R_1$ and $R_2$ into the relationship $R_1 = 2 R_2$:\n    $$ \\frac{g_j}{g_i} e^{-\\Delta E / (kT_1)} = 2 \\times \\left( \\frac{g_j}{g_i} e^{-\\Delta E / (kT_2)} \\right) $$\n    The statistical weight factor $\\frac{g_j}{g_i}$ is the same for both stars and cancels out:\n    $$ e^{-\\Delta E / (kT_1)} = 2 \\cdot e^{-\\Delta E / (kT_2)} $$\n\n6.  **Solve for the relationship between T1 and T2:** To solve for the temperatures, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:\n    $$ \\ln(e^{-\\Delta E / (kT_1)}) = \\ln(2 \\cdot e^{-\\Delta E / (kT_2)}) $$\n    Using the logarithm properties $\\ln(e^x) = x$ and $\\ln(ab) = \\ln(a) + \\ln(b)$:\n    $$ -\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1} = \\ln(2) + \\ln(e^{-\\Delta E / (kT_2)}) $$\n    $$ -\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1} = \\ln(2) - \\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2} $$\n    Rearrange the terms to isolate $\\ln(2)$:\n    $$ \\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2} - \\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1} = \\ln(2) $$\n    Factor out the constant term $\\frac{\\Delta E}{k}$:\n    $$ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left( \\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1} \\right) = \\ln(2) $$\n    Combine the fractions inside the parentheses:\n    $$ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left( \\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \\right) = \\ln(2) $$\n\n7.  **Use the given numerical values:** The problem provides:\n    *   Energy difference, $\\Delta E \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J}$.\n    *   The value of the Boltzmann constant, $k \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J/K}$.\n\n    Let's compute the pre-factor $\\frac{\\Delta E}{k}$:\n    $$ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k} = \\frac{1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J}}{1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J/K}} = 1 \\text{ K} $$\n    This is a crucial simplification intended by the problem's design.\n\n8.  **Substitute the value back into the equation:**\n    $$ (1 \\text{ K}) \\left( \\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \\right) = \\ln(2) $$\n    In many physics problems presented as multiple-choice questions, physical constants are implicitly handled or assumed to be normalized to 1. If we treat the equation algebraically, ignoring the units for a moment (as the options do), we get:\n    $$ \\ln(2) = \\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} $$\n\n9.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    A) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ] - Incorrect denominator.\n    B) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)] - Incorrect sign (sum instead of difference).\n    C) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1] - Incorrect form.\n    D) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)] - This matches our derived equation.\n\nTherefore, the correct equation is the one given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
