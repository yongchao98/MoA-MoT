    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The question asks to identify which of the four described exoplanets has the highest density.\n\n2.  **Define Density:** Density is mass divided by volume (ρ = m/V). For a spherical planet, Volume is (4/3)πR³, so density depends on both mass and radius.\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Option:**\n\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is our baseline case. It is, by definition, a planet with Earth's density. The average density of Earth is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly given as ~5.5 g/cm³. This is essentially the same as Earth's density.\n\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This is the key option that requires physical reasoning.\n        *   \"Same composition\" means it's made of the same ratio of iron, nickel, silicates, etc., as Earth.\n        *   If the planet were just a scaled-up, incompressible version of Earth, its density would remain the same.\n        *   However, planets are not incompressible. A planet with 5 times Earth's mass has much stronger self-gravity.\n        *   This intense gravity compresses the material throughout the planet, especially in the core. The atoms are packed much closer together than they are inside Earth.\n        *   This gravitational compression means that for a given amount of mass, the volume will be smaller than you'd expect without compression.\n        *   Therefore, the overall density (total mass / total volume) will be significantly *higher* than Earth's density.\n\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** This is the opposite scenario of option (c).\n        *   It has the same building blocks as Earth but less mass.\n        *   With less mass, the force of self-gravity is weaker.\n        *   This leads to less gravitational compression compared to Earth.\n        *   Therefore, its material will be less tightly packed, and its overall density will be *lower* than Earth's density.\n\n4.  **Compare the Densities:**\n\n    *   Planet (a): Density ≈ 5.51 g/cm³ (Earth's density)\n    *   Planet (b): Density ≈ 5.5 g/cm³ (Given)\n    *   Planet (c): Density > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to high gravitational compression)\n    *   Planet (d): Density < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to low gravitational compression)\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** By comparing the four options, it's clear that the 5-Earth-mass planet (c) will be the densest because of the significant effect of gravitational compression at higher masses. Planet (a) and (b) have roughly the same density, and planet (d) is the least dense.\n\n6.  **Final Answer Formulation:** The reasoning points directly to option (c). The corresponding letter for the final answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
