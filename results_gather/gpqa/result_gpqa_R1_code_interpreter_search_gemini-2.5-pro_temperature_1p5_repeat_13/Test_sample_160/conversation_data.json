    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Definition of Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula for the mean free path is:\n\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the number of particles per unit volume).\n*   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"area\" a target particle presents to the moving particle for a collision to occur.\n\n**2. Analyze the Two Scenarios**\n\nThe problem describes two different mean free paths, λ1 and λ2. Let's apply the formula to both.\n\n*   **Scenario 1: Gas-Gas Collisions (λ1)**\n    *   This is the mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules.\n    *   The moving particles are gas molecules.\n    *   The target particles are also gas molecules.\n    *   Let `n_gas` be the number density of the gas molecules.\n    *   Let `σ_gas-gas` be the collision cross-section for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule.\n    *   So, **λ1 = 1 / (n_gas * σ_gas-gas)**\n\n*   **Scenario 2: Electron-Gas Scattering (λ2)**\n    *   This is the mean free path of an electron from the beam colliding (scattering) with a gas molecule.\n    *   The moving particles are high-energy electrons.\n    *   The target particles are the same gas molecules.\n    *   The number density of the target gas molecules, `n_gas`, remains the same because the temperature and pressure in the sample compartment have not changed.\n    *   Let `σ_electron-gas` be the collision cross-section for an electron scattering off a gas molecule.\n    *   So, **λ2 = 1 / (n_gas * σ_electron-gas)**\n\n**3. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ)**\n\nThe key to comparing λ1 and λ2 is to compare their respective collision cross-sections, `σ_gas-gas` and `σ_electron-gas`.\n\n*   **`σ_gas-gas`**: This is the *gas-kinetic cross-section*. Gas molecules are electrically neutral. Collisions between them are primarily short-range interactions, similar to billiard balls colliding. The cross-section is determined by the physical size of the molecules.\n\n*   **`σ_electron-gas`**: This is the *electron scattering cross-section*. The electron is a charged particle, and the gas molecule is composed of a positively charged nucleus and a cloud of negatively charged electrons. The electron from the beam interacts with the entire atom/molecule via the long-range **electromagnetic (Coulomb) force**.\n\n**4. The Critical Difference**\n\nThe Coulomb force has a much longer range than the short-range forces governing gas-molecule collisions. An incoming electron can be significantly deflected (i.e., \"scattered\" or effectively \"collided with\") by the electric field of a gas molecule even when passing at a distance much greater than the molecule's physical radius.\n\nThis means that a gas molecule presents a much larger effective target area to an incoming electron than it does to another neutral gas molecule.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude:\n\n**`σ_electron-gas` > `σ_gas-gas`**\n\n**5. Final Conclusion about λ1 and λ2**\n\nNow we can compare the two mean free path equations:\n\n*   λ1 = 1 / (n_gas * `σ_gas-gas`)\n*   λ2 = 1 / (n_gas * `σ_electron-gas`)\n\nSince `n_gas` is the same for both, and `σ_electron-gas` is larger than `σ_gas-gas`, the denominator in the equation for λ2 is larger than the denominator for λ1. A larger denominator results in a smaller value.\n\nThus, we must have:\n\n**λ2 < λ1**\n\nThe electron, being more likely to interact with the residual gas molecules due to its charge, will have a shorter average distance between collisions than the gas molecules will have with each other.\n\n<<<D>>>"
