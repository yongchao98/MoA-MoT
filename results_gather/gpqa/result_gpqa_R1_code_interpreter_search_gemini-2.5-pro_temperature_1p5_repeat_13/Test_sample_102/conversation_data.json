    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### 1.  Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   The parent chain is ethan-1-one, which means there is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n*   This acetyl group is attached to a phenyl ring. The resulting molecule is acetophenone.\n*   The phenyl ring is substituted with a bromo group (-Br) at position 3 and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 5, relative to the acetyl group at position 1.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      COCH3\n     /   \\\n    C     C\n   //    \\\\\n  C-NO2   C-Br\n   \\     //\n    C---C\n```\nThe three substituents (-COCH3, -Br, -NO2) are all meta to each other (in 1,3,5 positions).\n\n### 2.  Analyze the Substituent Directing Effects\n\nWe need to consider how each substituent directs the next incoming electrophile in an Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS) reaction:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Weakly deactivating and an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Amino group (-NH2):** Formed by reducing a nitro group (e.g., with Fe/HCl). It is strongly activating and an **ortho, para-director**. When protonated in strong acid to -NH3+, it becomes strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\nA key rule for Friedel-Crafts reactions (like acylation with CH3COCl/AlCl3) is that they **do not work** on strongly deactivated rings, such as those containing a -NO2 group or an -NH2 group (which complexes with the AlCl3 catalyst).\n\n### 3.  Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n**Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n\n*   **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. It correctly introduces the acetyl group. The product is acetophenone (C6H5COCH3). The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n*   **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the meta position (position 3). This step is correct.\n*   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Bromo-5-nitroacetophenone:** We are nitrating 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring has a meta-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an ortho,para-director (-Br at C3).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the new substituent to position 5.\n    *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    The directing groups are in conflict. However, the acetyl group is a very strong deactivator, especially for its ortho and para positions (2, 4, 6). The least deactivated position for an incoming electrophile is C5, which is meta to both existing groups. Therefore, nitration predominantly occurs at C5 to yield **3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone**, which is the target molecule `1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one`.\n\nThis sequence of the first three steps provides a high-yield synthesis of the desired product. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) would modify the product and are superfluous to its synthesis, but the initial sequence is chemically sound and successful.\n\n**Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n\n*   **i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene**\n*   **ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline**\n*   **iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt**\n*   **iv) Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene:** This sequence of four steps just returns to the starting material, benzene. It is a futile loop and thus an incorrect synthetic pathway.\n\n**Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n\n*   **i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene**\n*   **ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline**\n*   **iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → ?** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH2) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) to form a complex. This complex deactivates the ring so strongly that the Friedel-Crafts reaction does not proceed. Therefore, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n**Option D: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n\n*   **i) Benzene → Bromobenzene**\n*   **ii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-Bromonitrobenzene (major product):** Bromine is an ortho,para-director.\n*   **iii) 4-Bromonitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → ?** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a ring containing a nitro group. As mentioned earlier, Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on strongly deactivated rings. The nitro group prevents this reaction from occurring. Therefore, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n### 4.  Conclusion\n\n*   Options B, C, and D contain chemically unfeasible steps.\n*   Option A contains a correct and high-yield three-step synthesis to the target molecule. Although it lists extra, unnecessary steps, it is the only option that presents a valid pathway to the product. The question asks for a sequence that *would lead to* the synthesis, which the first part of sequence A accomplishes.\n\nTherefore, sequence A is the correct choice.\n\n<<<A>>>"
