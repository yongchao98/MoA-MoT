    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This indicates a benzene ring (which has 6 carbons) with two substituents attached. The core formula of this part is C6H4.\n*   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents contains a C=O group.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means one substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the benzene ring. A halogen atom contains zero carbon atoms.\n\nBased on this, we can deduce the two substituents:\n*   Substituent 1: A halogen (-X). This accounts for 0 of the 2 carbons.\n*   Substituent 2: A group that contains the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable chemical group fitting this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n\nSo, the molecule is an **acetophenone** with a halogen substituent on the aromatic ring. The general structure is **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C8H7XO. Let's check the proton count: 4 protons on the aromatic ring and 3 protons on the methyl group, for a total of 7 protons.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for the Proposed Structure**\n\nThe structure has two main parts that will give signals in the 1H NMR spectrum:\n*   **The acetyl group (-COCH3)**: The three methyl protons (-CH3) are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will appear as a **singlet (s)**. Since there are three of them, the integration will be **3H**. The chemical shift for protons of a methyl group next to a carbonyl (a methyl ketone) is typically in the range of **2.1-2.6 ppm**.\n*   **The aromatic protons**: There are 4 protons on the di-substituted benzene ring. Their chemical shift and splitting pattern depend on the relative positions of the two substituents (*ortho*, *meta*, or *para*).\n    *   Both the halogen (-X) and the acetyl (-COCH3) groups are electron-withdrawing, which means they will de-shield the aromatic protons, causing them to appear at a relatively high chemical shift (downfield), typically in the **7.0-8.5 ppm** range.\n    *   Let's consider the splitting pattern for the most common isomers:\n        *   ***para* (1,4) substitution**: The molecule has a plane of symmetry. This makes the two protons next to the acetyl group equivalent to each other, and the two protons next to the halogen equivalent to each other. This results in two signals in the aromatic region. Each signal is split by its one neighbor, resulting in two **doublets (d)**. The integration for each doublet will be **2H**. This pattern (two doublets, each 2H) is a classic fingerprint for *para*-disubstitution.\n        *   ***ortho* (1,2) or *meta* (1,3) substitution**: These isomers lack the symmetry of the *para* isomer. All four aromatic protons would be chemically distinct, leading to a much more complex spectrum with four separate signals (e.g., doublets, triplets, multiplets), each with an integration of 1H.\n\n**3. Compare the Predicted Spectrum with the Given Options**\n\nNow, let's analyze the choices:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **2.3 (3H, s)**: This is a singlet for 3 protons at 2.3 ppm. This perfectly matches the methyl group of our acetyl substituent (-COCH**3**).\n    *   **7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d)**: These are two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H. This pattern is the hallmark of a *para*-substituted benzene ring. The chemical shifts are appropriately downfield due to the electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   This option is an excellent match for **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   The signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are not in the typical range for aromatic protons. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring should have 4 aromatic protons. This data shows only one proton in the aromatic region (6.9 ppm). This is inconsistent.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton** (-CHO), not a ketone. The deduced structure is a ketone (-COCH3). This is a fundamental mismatch.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption A is the only one that matches all the structural features deduced from the problem description. The compound is a *para*-haloacetophenone, and the provided 1H NMR data correctly describes it with a singlet for the methyl ketone and two doublets for the *para*-substituted aromatic ring.\n\n<<<A>>>"
