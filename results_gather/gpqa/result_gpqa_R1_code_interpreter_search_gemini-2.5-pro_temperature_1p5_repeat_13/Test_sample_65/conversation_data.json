    "SMEFT, the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, is constructed as an extension of the Standard Model (SM). It is a quantum field theory that includes higher-dimensional operators to parametrize the effects of new physics at energy scales higher than the electroweak scale. The construction of SMEFT adheres to certain fundamental principles of quantum field theory and the observed symmetries of the Standard Model Lagrangian (besides the gauge symmetry, which is spontaneously broken).\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** Lorentz invariance is a fundamental principle of special relativity and a cornerstone of any quantum field theory, including the Standard Model and its effective extensions. All terms (operators) in the SMEFT Lagrangian must be Lorentz scalars, meaning they must be invariant under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts). Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n\n2.  **Poincare Symmetry:** Poincare symmetry is the full symmetry group of spacetime in special relativity, combining Lorentz transformations with spacetime translations. Like Lorentz symmetry, it is a foundational assumption for constructing the SMEFT. The Lagrangian density is constructed from fields and their derivatives at the same point, and the action is the integral of the Lagrangian density over all spacetime, which ensures translational invariance. Thus, Poincare symmetry must be respected.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry:** CP symmetry (Charge conjugation + Parity) is known to be violated in the Standard Model. The weak interaction violates both C and P, and the CKM matrix in the quark sector contains a complex phase that leads to CP violation. Since SMEFT is an extension of the SM, it naturally contains operators that reflect this violation. Moreover, new higher-dimensional operators in SMEFT can introduce new sources of CP violation. Therefore, not all operators in SMEFT are required to respect CP symmetry.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined transformation of CPT. SMEFT is constructed as a local, Lorentz-invariant effective field theory. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.\n\nBased on this reasoning:\n-   Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected.\n-   Poincare symmetry (2) must be respected.\n-   CP symmetry (3) is not a required symmetry.\n-   CPT symmetry (4) must be respected.\n\nTherefore, the symmetries that must be respected are 1, 2, and 4. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
