    "**1. Analysis of the Starting Compound (C8H9NO) using 1H-NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5. A DBE of 5 is characteristic of a benzene ring (4 units) plus one additional degree of unsaturation (e.g., a C=O double bond).\n\n*   **1H-NMR Spectroscopy Data Breakdown:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n=2, based on the n+1 rule), meaning it is part of a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggest a para-disubstituted benzene ring (A-A'-B-B' system). The upfield chemical shifts (below 7.2 ppm) indicate the presence of a strong electron-donating group (EDG) on the ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons, coupled with the presence of nitrogen in the formula, points to a primary amine group (-NH2). An amino group is a strong EDG, consistent with the upfield aromatic signals.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). The splitting, a doublet (d), indicates it is coupled to one adjacent proton (n=1). This perfectly matches the -CH2- group in the -CH2-CHO fragment, as it is coupled only to the aldehyde proton.\n\n*   **Structure Determination:**\n    Assembling the fragments gives a para-substituted benzene ring with an amino group (-NH2) and a 2-oxoethyl group (-CH2-CHO) as substituents.\n    The structure is **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**.\n    Let's verify the formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + CH2CHO = C8H9NO. The formula is correct.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal\n\n*   **Step 1 & 2: 1. NaNO2 + HCl; 2. H2O**\n    1.  The reaction of a primary aromatic amine with sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and a strong acid (HCl) at low temperatures (0-5 °C) is a **diazotization reaction**. This converts the amino group (-NH2) into a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-).\n    2.  Adding water (H2O) to the diazonium salt and warming leads to the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt, replacing the -N2+ group with a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   The intermediate after these two steps is **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   The reagent is a strong base (KOH) with heat, and the substrate is an aldehyde with α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group adjacent to the -CHO group). These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation reaction**.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        a.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from one molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion.\n        b.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate anion acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal.\n        c.  **Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated by water to yield a β-hydroxy aldehyde, the **aldol addition product**. This intermediate is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option C).\n        d.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions provides the energy for the elimination of a water molecule. The hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) and a hydrogen atom from the α-carbon (C2) are eliminated. This dehydration step is highly favored because it forms a C=C double bond that is conjugated with both the aldehyde's C=O group and the attached phenyl ring, resulting in a highly stabilized α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n*   **Final Product Identification:**\n    *   The aldol addition product is: (HO-C6H4)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(C6H4-OH)-CHO\n    *   Upon dehydration, it forms the aldol condensation product: (HO-C6H4)-CH2-CH=C(C6H4-OH)-CHO\n    *   Let's name this molecule based on IUPAC rules:\n        *   The parent chain is a butenal (4-carbon chain with an aldehyde and a double bond).\n        *   The double bond is between C2 and C3, so it is a **but-2-enal**.\n        *   There is a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group attached to C2.\n        *   There is a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group attached to C4.\n        *   Therefore, the name of the final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
