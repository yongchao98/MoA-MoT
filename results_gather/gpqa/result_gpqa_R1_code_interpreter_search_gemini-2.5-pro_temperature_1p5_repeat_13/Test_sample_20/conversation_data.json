    "**Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n1.  **Tautomerism** is an equilibrium between two isomers, called tautomers. A common type is **keto-enol tautomerism**, which requires the presence of an **alpha-hydrogen** — a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **Let's examine benzoquinone (specifically, 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two carbonyl groups at opposite positions (positions 1 and 4).\n    *   The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups (positions 2, 3, 5, 6) are part of carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C).\n    *   These carbons do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them.\n    *   Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Let's examine cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   The structure is a saturated six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   The carbon atoms between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are CH₂ groups.\n    *   The hydrogens on these CH₂ groups are alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to readily tautomerize to its enol form, which is phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). This enol form is particularly stable because it is aromatic.\n    *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Optical isomerism** occurs in **chiral** molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Let's examine methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   The structural formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's analyze the central carbon atom (carbon-2):\n        *   It is bonded to a hydrogen atom (-H).\n        *   It is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n        *   It is bonded to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n        *   It is bonded to a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃).\n    *   All four of these groups are different. Therefore, carbon-2 is a chiral center.\n    *   Since the molecule contains a chiral center, it is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism (it has two enantiomers).\n\n3.  **Let's examine dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   The structure is the *trans* isomer of an alkene: CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   The molecule is planar around the C=C double bond.\n    *   There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups; hence, there are no chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, which means it is **achiral**.\n    *   Achiral molecules do not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
