    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Goal:** The main objective is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the energy it absorbs from its host star. The formula is:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\times (1 - A)^{1/4} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\times (1 - A_1)^{1/4} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1}}}{T_{star} \\times (1 - A_2)^{1/4} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2}}}$\n    The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same. It also states that they have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\n4.  **Relate Orbital Parameters to Observables:** We need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes ($a_2/a_1$) using the provided data from the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV method measures the star's velocity wobble caused by an orbiting planet.\n    The semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, $K$, is given by:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_*^{2/3} (1-e^2)^{1/2}}$\n    For circular orbits ($e=0$), this simplifies to:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_*^{2/3}}$\n    From Kepler's Third Law, for $M_p \\ll M_*$, we have $P^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 a^3}{G M_*}$. We can substitute $P$ to relate $K$ directly to $a$.\n    A more direct approach is to use the conservation of momentum. For a circular orbit, $M_p v_p = M_* v_*$, where $v_p$ and $v_*$ are the orbital velocities of the planet and the star around their common center of mass. The maximum observed RV of the star is $K = v_* \\sin i$. The orbital velocity of the planet is $v_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{G(M_* + M_p)}{a}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$.\n    Substituting these, we get:\n    $K = \\frac{M_p}{M_*} v_p \\sin i \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}} \\sin i = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{\\sqrt{M_*}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n    Since the planets were detected by the transit method, their orbital planes are nearly edge-on to our line of sight, meaning the inclination angle $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin i \\approx 1$.\n    So, $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{M_*}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** Rearranging the formula to solve for $a$:\n    $K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_* a}$\n    $a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes ($a_2/a_1$):**\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_2^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_1^2 / (M_* K_1^2)}$\n    The gravitational constant $G$ and the star's mass $M_*$ cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_2^2 / K_2^2}{M_1^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratios of Mass and Velocity:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio:**\n        $M_1 = 7 M_{Earth}$, $M_2 = 5 M_{Earth}$\n        $\\frac{M_2}{M_1} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   **Velocity Amplitude Ratio (K):** The Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ is related to the radial velocity $v_r$ by $\\Delta\\lambda / \\lambda_0 = v_r / c$. The semi-amplitude $K$ is the maximum radial velocity, so $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n        $K_1 \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n        $K_2 \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n        $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n8.  **Substitute and Calculate:** Now, substitute these ratios back into the expressions for $a_2/a_1$ and then $T_{eq,1}/T_{eq,2}$.\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n    Finally, calculate the temperature ratio:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n9.  **Final Numerical Value:** To compare with the given options, we compute the numerical value of the fraction.\n    $\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Masses of the planets in Earth masses\nM1 = 7.0\nM2 = 5.0\n\n# Maximum Doppler shifts in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda1 = 0.03\ndelta_lambda2 = 0.04\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 is sqrt(a2 / a1).\n# The ratio of semi-major axes a2 / a1 = (M2/M1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2.\n# The ratio of radial velocity semi-amplitudes K1 / K2 is equal to the ratio of Doppler shifts delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2.\n\n# Calculate the ratio of masses (M2 / M1)\nmass_ratio = M2 / M1\n\n# Calculate the ratio of RV semi-amplitudes (K1 / K2)\nK_ratio = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2\n\n# Calculate the ratio of semi-major axes (a2 / a1)\na_ratio = (mass_ratio**2) * (K_ratio**2)\n\n# Calculate the final ratio of equilibrium temperatures\nT_eq_ratio = math.sqrt(a_ratio)\n\nprint(f\"{T_eq_ratio:.4f}\")\n```\n>>>0.5357\n\n<<<B>>>",
