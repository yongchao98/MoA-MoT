    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the initial reaction to identify the reactive intermediate.**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene and 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium iodide (NaI) at elevated temperature.\n*   **Stoichiometry:** 2 equivalents of the diene precursor are used for every 1 equivalent of the norbornadiene derivative.\n\nThe first reactant, 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, is a norbornadiene derivative. It contains two isolated double bonds, making it an excellent **dienophile** for Diels-Alder reactions.\n\nThe second reactant, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, is treated with NaI at high temperatures. This combination of a complex poly-halide and NaI under forcing conditions is often designed in chemical puzzles to generate a well-known, stable molecule. A direct reaction mechanism is difficult to trace, but a plausible and logical outcome is the formation of a stable aromatic diene. Given the carbon skeleton and the requirement to react twice, the most likely diene generated is **anthracene (C₁₄H₁₀)**. This transformation involves a complex dimerization, dehalogenation, and aromatization process, which is assumed to proceed to form the thermodynamically stable anthracene. Anthracene is a well-known diene that participates in Diels-Alder reactions across its central 9,10-positions.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 1.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Double Diels-Alder reaction.\n*   **Diene:** Anthracene (2 equivalents).\n*   **Dienophile:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (1 equivalent).\n\nEach of the two double bonds of the norbornadiene derivative reacts with one molecule of anthracene. This forms **Product 1**, a large, symmetric molecule. The structure consists of a central 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane (now saturated) core, with two identical anthracene adducts fused to it. The molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Treatment of Product 1 with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄/H₂O).\n*   **Transformation:** This is a standard acidic deprotection of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (-OtBu) is cleaved to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n\n**Product 2** is the same as Product 1, but with a hydroxyl group at the 7-position of the central norbornane core instead of the tert-butoxy group.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of Product 3.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Treatment of Product 2 with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO.\n*   **Transformation:** This is a Parikh-Doering oxidation, which converts primary or secondary alcohols to aldehydes or ketones. Product 2 has a secondary alcohol at C7.\n\n**Product 3** is the ketone corresponding to Product 2. The C7-OH group is oxidized to a C7=O (carbonyl) group. The central core is now a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-7-one derivative, fused to the two anthracene adducts.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the structure of the final product(s) 4.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Heating Product 3 at 150°C.\n*   **Transformation:** Diels-Alder reactions are reversible. Heating a Diels-Alder adduct often causes a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**. Product 3, being a double adduct, will fragment back into its constituent parts.\n\n    Product 3 → 2 × Anthracene + 1 × bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one\n\n*   **Further Reaction:** The dienophile generated, bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one, is known to be thermally unstable. It readily undergoes a **cheletropic elimination** of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the very stable aromatic molecule, **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n    bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one → Benzene + CO\n\nTherefore, the final stable organic products, collectively named **4**, are **Anthracene** and **Benzene**.\n\n**Step 6: Count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final products.**\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4. In the context of spectroscopy (like ¹H NMR), this means counting the total number of unique proton environments in the final product mixture.\n\n*   **Benzene (C₆H₆):** Benzene is a highly symmetric molecule (D₆h point group). All six hydrogen atoms are chemically equivalent. Therefore, benzene has **1** distinct type of hydrogen atom.\n*   **Anthracene (C₁₄H₁₀):** Anthracene has a D₂h point group symmetry. This results in three distinct sets of hydrogen atoms:\n    1.  The four 'alpha' protons at positions 1, 4, 5, and 8.\n    2.  The four 'beta' protons at positions 2, 3, 6, and 7.\n    3.  The two 'gamma' (or 'meso') protons at positions 9 and 10.\n    Therefore, anthracene has **3** distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product mixture (4) is the sum of the signals from each component.\n\nTotal distinct H atoms = (Distinct H in Benzene) + (Distinct H in Anthracene) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThe final product mixture would show 4 signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
