    "Here's the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to calculate the uncertainty in the operator $P_z$, which is denoted by $\\Delta P_z$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Uncertainty:** The uncertainty of an operator $A$ in a quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by the standard formula:\n    $\\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2}$\n    In our case, the operator is $P_z$, so the formula is:\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n\n3.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The state of the system is given by the column vector (ket state):\n        $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The matrix representation of the operator $P_z$ is:\n        $P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The problem also provides matrices for $P_x$ and $P_y$ and states that $|\\psi\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $P_x$ with eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. This information is useful to confirm that the problem is physically consistent, but it's not directly needed for the calculation of $\\Delta P_z$.\n\n4.  **Plan the Calculation:** To use the uncertainty formula, we need to compute two quantities:\n    *   The expectation value of $P_z$, denoted as $\\langle P_z \\rangle$.\n    *   The expectation value of $P_z^2$, denoted as $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$:**\n    *   The formula for the expectation value is $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z|\\psi\\rangle$.\n    *   First, we need the bra vector $\\langle\\psi|$, which is the conjugate transpose of $|\\psi\\rangle$. Since all components are real, it's just the transpose:\n        $\\langle\\psi| = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Next, calculate the action of the operator $P_z$ on the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $P_z|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Finally, compute the inner product of $\\langle\\psi|$ with $P_z|\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi| (P_z|\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        $\\langle P_z \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(\\hbar/2) = \\hbar/4 + 0 - \\hbar/4 = 0$\n    *   So, $\\langle P_z \\rangle = 0$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$:**\n    *   First, we need the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$. We get this by squaring the matrix for $P_z$:\n        $P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Now, we calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle$.\n    *   Calculate the action of $P_z^2$ on $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Compute the inner product of $\\langle\\psi|$ with $P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi| (P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) = \\hbar^2/4 + 0 + \\hbar^2/4 = 2\\hbar^2/4 = \\hbar^2/2$\n    *   So, $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2/2$.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$:**\n    *   Now substitute the calculated expectation values into the uncertainty formula:\n        $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n        $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}}$\n        $\\Delta P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\n8.  **Final Verification (using Python code):** To ensure accuracy, the calculation can be verified using a numerical tool like Python with NumPy. This step confirms the manual calculation.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# We can let hbar = 1 and add it back at the end to simplify the numbers.\nhbar = 1.0\n\n# Define the state vector of the system\npsi = np.array([[-1/2], [1/np.sqrt(2)], [-1/2]])\n\n# Define the matrix for the operator P_z\nPz = hbar * np.array([[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]])\n\n# The conjugate transpose of the state vector (the \"bra\" vector)\npsi_dagger = psi.conj().T\n\n# Calculate the expectation value of P_z, which is <psi|P_z|psi>\nexp_Pz = (psi_dagger @ Pz @ psi).item()\n\n# Calculate the matrix for the operator P_z^2 by squaring the Pz matrix\nPz_squared = Pz @ Pz\n\n# Calculate the expectation value of P_z^2, which is <psi|P_z^2|psi>\nexp_Pz_squared = (psi_dagger @ Pz_squared @ psi).item()\n\n# Calculate the uncertainty in P_z using the standard formula\nuncertainty_Pz = np.sqrt(exp_Pz_squared - exp_Pz**2)\n\n# The output of the script will show the values, which we can compare to our manual calculation.\n# print(f\"Expectation value <Pz> = {exp_Pz} hbar\")\n# print(f\"Expectation value <Pz^2> = {exp_Pz_squared} hbar^2\")\n# print(f\"Uncertainty Delta Pz = {uncertainty_Pz} hbar\") # This will be ~0.707\n# Since sqrt(2) is approx 1.414, 1/sqrt(2) is approx 0.707.\n# The result is hbar/sqrt(2).\n\nprint(f\"The calculated uncertainty Delta Pz, in units of hbar, is: {uncertainty_Pz}\")\n```\n>>>\n```\nThe calculated uncertainty Delta Pz, in units of hbar, is: 0.7071067811865476\n```\nThe numerical result $0.7071...$ is the decimal representation of $1/\\sqrt{2}$.

    "Here is the step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to calculate the uncertainty in the operator $P_z$, denoted as $\\Delta P_z$, for a system in a given quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\n**2. Recall the Formula for Uncertainty**\n\nThe uncertainty of any operator $A$ in a quantum state is defined by the formula:\n$$ \\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2} $$\nFor this problem, we need to find the uncertainty of $P_z$, so the formula becomes:\n$$ \\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} $$\n\nTo find $\\Delta P_z$, we must calculate two quantities:\n*   The expectation value of $P_z$, which is $\\langle P_z \\rangle$.\n*   The expectation value of $P_z^2$, which is $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$.\n\n**3. Identify the Given Information**\n\n*   **State Vector (ket):** The state of the system is given by the column vector:\n    $$ |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n*   **Bra Vector:** The corresponding \"bra\" vector is the conjugate transpose of the ket. Since all elements are real, it's simply the transpose:\n    $$ \\langle\\psi| = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n*   **Operator Matrix:** The matrix representation of the operator $P_z$ is:\n    $$ P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n**4. Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$**\n\nThe expectation value is calculated as $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\nFirst, we apply the operator $P_z$ to the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$$ P_z|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nNext, we take the inner product of $\\langle\\psi|$ with the resulting vector $P_z|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$$ \\langle P_z \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\langle P_z \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(\\hbar/2) = \\frac{\\hbar}{4} + 0 - \\frac{\\hbar}{4} = 0 $$\nSo, the expectation value of $P_z$ is $\\langle P_z \\rangle = 0$.\n\n**5. Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$**\n\nFirst, we need to find the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$ by squaring the $P_z$ matrix:\n$$ P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & (-\\hbar)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow we calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$$ P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{2\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} $$\nSo, the expectation value of $P_z^2$ is $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$.\n\n**6. Calculate the Uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$**\n\nNow we plug our calculated expectation values into the uncertainty formula:\n$$ \\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} $$\n$$ \\Delta P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\n\nThis result matches the code output, where $0.7071...$ is the decimal approximation for $1/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n**7.
