    "This problem is based on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n*   **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle, known as complementary variables, can be known simultaneously. For energy (E) and time (t), the relationship is:\n    ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in the energy of a state.\n    *   Δt is the lifetime of the state.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h / 2π).\n\n*   **Interpretation:** A quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt) cannot have a perfectly defined energy. Its energy will have an intrinsic \"blurriness\" or \"width\" (ΔE). This ΔE represents the minimum uncertainty in the energy of the state. We can approximate this minimum uncertainty using the relation:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt\n\n*   **Condition for Resolving Energy Levels:** For two energy levels, E1 and E2, to be clearly distinguished or \"resolved,\" the difference in their energies (|E1 - E2|) must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (ΔE1 + ΔE2). At the very least, the energy difference must be larger than the larger of the two uncertainties.\n    |E2 - E1| > (ΔE1 + ΔE2)\n\n*   **Given Values:**\n    *   Lifetime of the first state, Δt1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Lifetime of the second state, Δt2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Value of the reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Calculate the energy uncertainty for the first state (ΔE1):\n        ΔE1 ≈ ħ / Δt1 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    2.  Calculate the energy uncertainty for the second state (ΔE2):\n        ΔE2 ≈ ħ / Δt2 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n    3.  Calculate the minimum energy difference required for resolution:\n        The total energy uncertainty is ΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2.\n        ΔE_total ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n        ΔE_total ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The energy difference between the two states, |E2 - E1|, must be greater than approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV. We now examine the given options to see which one satisfies this condition.\n\n**2. Python Code for Calculation:**\nThe following Python code performs the calculations to confirm the required energy difference.\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nhbar_eVs = 6.582e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\ndt1 = 1e-9\ndt2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty for each state using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (Delta_E ~ hbar / Delta_t)\nDelta_E1 = hbar_eVs / dt1\nDelta_E2 = hbar_eVs / dt2\n\n# The condition to resolve the two levels is that their energy difference must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties.\nmin_energy_difference = Delta_E1 + Delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty of state 1 (Delta_E1): {Delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty of state 2 (Delta_E2): {Delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Minimum energy difference required for resolution (Delta_E1 + Delta_E2): {min_energy_difference:.3e} eV\")\n\n# Given options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-8,\n    \"B\": 1e-4,\n    \"C\": 1e-9,\n    \"D\": 1e-11\n}\n\nprint(\"\\nChecking the options:\")\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > min_energy_difference:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is a possible energy difference because it is greater than {min_energy_difference:.3e} eV.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is NOT a possible energy difference because it is less than or equal to {min_energy_difference:.3e} eV.\")\n```\n\n**3. Comparing with Options:**\n\n*   The required energy difference must be greater than ~7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   A) 10⁻⁸ eV is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **B) 10⁻⁴ eV is much greater than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.**\n*   C) 10⁻⁹ eV is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option B provides an energy difference large enough to clearly resolve the two quantum states, given their lifetimes.\n\n<<<B>>>",
