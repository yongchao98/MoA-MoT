    "This problem concerns the quantum mechanics of a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential.\n\n**1. Identify the system and its energy spectrum:**\nThe potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues for this system are given by the formula:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$\nwhere $n$ is the principal quantum number, which can take non-negative integer values ($n = 0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$).\n\n**2. Determine the energy levels:**\nWe can find the energy for the first few states by substituting the value of $n$:\n*   **Ground State:** This corresponds to $n=0$.\n    $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{3}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n*   **First Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=1$.\n    $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{5}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n*   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$.\n    $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{7}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n*   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=3$.\n    $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n\n**3. Determine the degeneracy of the third excited state:**\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of distinct quantum states (eigenfunctions) that have that same energy. In Cartesian coordinates, the quantum number $n$ is the sum of the quantum numbers for each dimension: $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers.\n\nFor the third excited state, we have $n=3$. We need to find the number of combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3.\n\nWe can list them out:\n*   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n    *   (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) - This gives 3 states.\n*   One quantum number is 2, one is 1, one is 0:\n    *   (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) - This gives 6 states.\n*   All three quantum numbers are 1:\n    *   (1, 1, 1) - This gives 1 state.\n\nThe total number of states is the sum of these possibilities: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\nSo, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the energy eigenvalue $E_3 = \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n\nAlternatively, the degeneracy $g_n$ for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator can be calculated using the formula:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\nFor the third excited state, $n=3$:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\nThe energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$, and the number of possible linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) is 10. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
