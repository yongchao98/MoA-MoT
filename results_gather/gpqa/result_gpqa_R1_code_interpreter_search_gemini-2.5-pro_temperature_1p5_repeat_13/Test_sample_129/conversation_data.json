    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Concepts:**\n    *   **Lyman-alpha (Lyα) line:** This is a specific spectral line of neutral hydrogen with a rest wavelength (`λ_rest`) of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å). This light is in the far-ultraviolet (UV) part of the spectrum.\n    *   **Redshift (z):** Due to the expansion of the universe, light from distant objects like quasars is stretched to longer wavelengths. The observed wavelength (`λ_obs`) is related to the rest wavelength and redshift by the formula: `λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z)`.\n    *   **Ground-based Optical Telescopes:** These telescopes operate from Earth's surface and detect light in the \"optical window.\" This window is the range of wavelengths that can pass through Earth's atmosphere. Crucially, the atmosphere, primarily due to ozone (O₃), blocks most UV radiation.\n\n2.  **Identify the Constraint:**\n    For the redshifted Lyman-alpha line to be detected by a ground-based telescope, its observed wavelength (`λ_obs`) must be long enough to pass through the atmosphere. The atmosphere becomes opaque at wavelengths shorter than about 3200-3500 Å (320-350 nm). This is the atmospheric cutoff. To find the *lower limit* on the redshift, we need to find the minimum `z` that shifts the 1216 Å line to at least this cutoff wavelength.\n\n3.  **Set up the Calculation:**\n    We need to find the minimum redshift, `z_min`. This occurs when the observed wavelength is equal to the atmospheric cutoff wavelength (`λ_cutoff`).\n    *   `λ_obs ≥ λ_cutoff`\n    *   Substituting the redshift formula: `λ_rest * (1 + z) ≥ λ_cutoff`\n    *   Solving for the minimum `z`: `z_min = (λ_cutoff / λ_rest) - 1`\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation and Evaluate Options:**\n    We can test the given options to see which one represents a plausible lower limit. Let's calculate the observed wavelength for each redshift value.\n\n    *   `λ_rest = 1216 Å`\n\n    Let's use a Python script to quickly calculate the observed wavelength for each option.\n\n    ```python\n    # Rest wavelength of Lyman-alpha in Angstroms\n    lyman_alpha_rest = 1216\n\n    # Redshift values from the options\n    options = {\n        \"A\": 1.2,\n        \"B\": 3.0,\n        \"C\": 1.9,\n        \"D\": 2.4\n    }\n\n    # Atmospheric cutoff is around 3200-3500 Angstroms.\n    # Light with wavelength shorter than this is blocked.\n\n    print(\"Calculating observed wavelength for each redshift option:\")\n    for key, z in options.items():\n        observed_wavelength = lyman_alpha_rest * (1 + z)\n        print(f\"Option {key} (z={z}): Observed Wavelength = {observed_wavelength:.0f} Å\")\n\n    # Now, let's calculate the minimum redshift required to get past a typical\n    # atmospheric cutoff of ~3500 Angstroms, which is the very blue edge of the optical window.\n    cutoff_wavelength = 3500\n    min_z = (cutoff_wavelength / lyman_alpha_rest) - 1\n    print(f\"\\nMinimum redshift to see Lyα past a {cutoff_wavelength} Å cutoff is approximately: {min_z:.2f}\")\n\n    ```\n    execution\n    ```text\n    Calculating observed wavelength for each redshift option:\n    Option A (z=1.2): Observed Wavelength = 2675 Å\n    Option B (z=3.0): Observed Wavelength = 4864 Å\n    Option C (z=1.9): Observed Wavelength = 3526 Å\n    Option D (z=2.4): Observed Wavelength = 4134 Å\n\n    Minimum redshift to see Lyα past a 3500 Å cutoff is approximately: 1.88\n    ```\n5.  **Interpret the Results:**\n    *   **Option A (z=1.2):** `λ_obs` = 2675 Å. This is deep in the UV and is completely blocked by the atmosphere. It cannot be detected from the ground.\n    *   **Option B (z=3.0):** `λ_obs` = 4864 Å. This is in the blue-green part of the visible spectrum and is easily detectable.\n    *   **Option C (z=1.9):** `λ_obs` = 3526 Å. This wavelength is right at the boundary of the near-UV and the violet part of the visible spectrum. It is at the very edge of what is observable from the ground, representing a plausible lower limit.\n    *   **Option D (z=2.4):** `λ_obs` = 4134 Å. This is in the violet part of the spectrum and is detectable.\n\n    The question asks for the **lower limit** on the redshift for detection. While objects at z=2.4 and z=3.0 are detectable, z=1.9 is the lowest redshift among the viable options that shifts the Lyman-alpha line into the observable window. The calculation also shows that a redshift of ~1.88 is needed to clear a 3500 Å atmospheric cutoff, making 1.9 the best answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
