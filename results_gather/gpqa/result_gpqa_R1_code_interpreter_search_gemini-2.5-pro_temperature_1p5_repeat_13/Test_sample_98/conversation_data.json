    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data\n\nFirst, let's interpret the information given from the characterization techniques.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options provided are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the candidates.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four candidate structures are saturated, so this is consistent with all of them.\n    *   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** This splitting pattern arises from a single proton that is coupled to three different, adjacent groups of protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (giving the **d**oublet).\n        *   A group of two equivalent neighboring protons (like a -CH₂- group), giving the **t**riplet.\n        *   A group of three equivalent neighboring protons (like a -CH₃ group), giving the **q**uartet.\n        So, we are looking for a proton in a `CH-CH(R)-CH₂` environment, where the carbon atom also has a methyl group attached: `CH₃-C*(H)-CH-CH₂`.\n    *   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** This splitting pattern arises from a single proton that is coupled to three different, adjacent groups of protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (giving the **d**oublet).\n        *   A group of two equivalent neighboring protons (a -CH₂- group), giving the first **t**riplet.\n        *   Another, chemically non-equivalent group of two neighboring protons (another -CH₂- group), giving the second **t**riplet.\n        So, we are looking for a proton in a `CH-C*(H)-CH₂` environment, where the carbon atom is also attached to another group containing a `CH₂` (like an ethyl group): `CH₂-C*(H)(R)-CH`, where R is `CH₂CH₃`. The complete fragment would look like `CH₂-C*(H)(CH₂CH₃)-CH`.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the Candidate Structures\n\nNow we need to examine each of the four possible structures to see which one would produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nFirst, let's correctly identify the IUPAC names for the given condensed formulas. This requires finding the longest carbon chain that includes the carboxylic acid carbon.\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `HOOC-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Me)-CH(4)(Me)-CH₃`\n    *   H3 is coupled to CH₂(t), H4(d), and its own Me(q) → **dtq**.\n    *   There is no proton coupled to one CH and two different CH₂ groups. No **dtt**.\n\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `HOOC-CH(2)(Me)-CH(3)(Me)-CH₂(4)-CH₃`\n    *   H3 is coupled to H2(d), its own Me(q), and CH₂(4)(t) → **dqt** (same as dtq).\n    *   There is no proton coupled to one CH and two different CH₂ groups. No **dtt**.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    `HOOC-CH(2)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(4)-CH₃`\n    *   H3 is coupled to H2(d), CH₂(4)(t), and the CH₂ of its ethyl group(t) → **dtt**.\n    *   H2 is coupled to H3(d) and the CH₂ of its ethyl group(t) → dt. No clear **dtq** without assuming long-range coupling.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\n    Let's determine the correct IUPAC name for this structure: `CH₃-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`.\n    The longest carbon chain containing the COOH group is not the horizontal 5-carbon chain, but one that incorporates part of an ethyl group.\n    `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    The substituents on this 6-carbon (hexanoic acid) chain are a methyl group at C4 and an ethyl group at C3.\n    The correct name is **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**.\n    Now let's analyze the protons in **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**:\n    `CH₃(Me on C4) - CH(4) - CH(3)(CH₂CH₃) - CH₂(2) - COOH(1)`\n    The chain continues from C4 to `-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\n    *   **Proton at C3 (H3):** This proton is adjacent to:\n        1.  The `CH` group at C4 (1 proton → **doublet, d**).\n        2.  The `CH₂` group at C2 (2 protons → **triplet, t**).\n        3.  The `CH₂` of the ethyl group attached to C3 (2 protons → **triplet, t**).\n        The resulting signal for H3 is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches Signal 2.\n    *   **Proton at C4 (H4):** This proton is adjacent to:\n        1.  The `CH` group at C3 (1 proton → **doublet, d**).\n        2.  The `CH₂` group at C5 (2 protons → **triplet, t**).\n        3.  The `CH₃` group attached to C4 (3 protons → **quartet, q**).\n        The resulting signal for H4 is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches Signal 1.\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nThe structure of **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**, which corresponds to the formula given in option B, is the only candidate that produces both a `dtt` signal (from H3) and a `dtq` signal (from H4) due to standard vicinal (3-bond) couplings. Therefore, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<B>>>"
