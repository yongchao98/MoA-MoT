    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main objective is to determine the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M1) to the total mass of system_2 (M2). This ratio is `M1 / M2`.\n\n2.  **Extract Given Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Velocity Amplitude of star A (K1a) = 10 km/s\n        *   Velocity Amplitude of star B (K1b) = 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Velocity Amplitude of star A (K2a) = 15 km/s\n        *   Velocity Amplitude of star B (K2b) = 10 km/s\n\n3.  **Identify Key Concepts and Formulas:**\n    The problem involves spectroscopic binary stars. The total mass of such a system can be determined using a combination of the observed radial velocities and the orbital period. The relevant formula for the total mass (M = m1 + m2) of a double-lined spectroscopic binary is:\n    `M = (P * (K1 + K2)^3) / (2 * π * G * sin^3(i))`\n    where:\n    *   `M` is the total mass of the system.\n    *   `P` is the orbital period.\n    *   `K1` and `K2` are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n4.  **Analyze the Assumptions:**\n    *   The problem states that both systems \"exhibit eclipses.\" For eclipses to occur, our line of sight must be very close to the orbital plane, meaning the inclination angle `i` must be close to 90°. When `i = 90°`, `sin(i) = 1`, and therefore `sin^3(i) = 1`. This is a standard and crucial assumption for eclipsing binaries.\n    *   The problem also mentions \"sinusoidal variations\" of radial velocities. This indicates that the orbits are circular, which validates the use of the above formula (which is simplest for circular orbits).\n\n5.  **Simplify the Mass Formula:**\n    With the assumption that `sin^3(i) = 1`, the formula for the total mass simplifies to:\n    `M = (P * (K1 + K2)^3) / (2 * π * G)`\n    This means the total mass is directly proportional to the period and the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes: `M ∝ P * (K_sum)^3`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Sum of Velocity Amplitudes for Each System:**\n    *   For System 1: `K1_sum = K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s`\n    *   For System 2: `K2_sum = K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s`\n\n7.  **Set up the Mass Ratio Calculation:**\n    We need to find the ratio `M1 / M2`.\n    `M1 / M2 = [ (P1 * (K1_sum)^3) / (2 * π * G) ] / [ (P2 * (K2_sum)^3) / (2 * π * G) ]`\n    The constant term `1 / (2 * π * G)` cancels out from the numerator and the denominator, leaving a simpler expression for the ratio:\n    `M1 / M2 = (P1 / P2) * (K1_sum / K2_sum)^3`\n\n8.  **Substitute the Values and Compute the Final Ratio:**\n    Now, we plug in the known values for the periods and the summed velocity amplitudes into the ratio formula.\n\n```python\n# System 1 parameters\nP1 = 2.0  # years\nK1_sum = 10.0 + 5.0  # km/s\n\n# System 2 parameters\nP2 = 1.0  # year\nK2_sum = 15.0 + 10.0  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the mass ratio M1 / M2\n# M1/M2 = (P1/P2) * (K1_sum / K2_sum)^3\nmass_ratio = (P1 / P2) * (K1_sum / K2_sum)**3\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.432\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculation yields a mass ratio of 0.432. Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ 1.2\nB) ~ 0.4\nC) ~ 0.6\nD) ~ 0.7\n\nThe calculated value of 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to find the ratio of their total masses, `M1 / M2`.\n\nThe total mass `M` of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system is given by Kepler's third law as applied to such systems:\n\n`M1 + M2 = M_total = (P / (2 * π * G)) * ( (K1 + K2) / sin(i) )^3`\n\nwhere:\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `K1` and `K2` are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n\nThe problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This implies that we are viewing the systems edge-on, so the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90 degrees. For `i = 90°`, `sin(i) = 1`, and `sin^3(i) = 1`. This simplifies the mass equation considerably.\n\nThe ratio of the total mass of system_1 (`M_total_1`) to the total mass of system_2 (`M_total_2`) can be written as:\n\n`M_total_1 / M_total_2 = [ (P1 / (2 * π * G)) * (K1a + K1b)^3 ] / [ (P2 / (2 * π * G)) * (K2a + K2b)^3 ]`\n\nThe constant term `1 / (2 * π * G)` cancels out, leaving:\n\n`M_total_1 / M_total_2 = (P1 / P2) * ( (K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b) )^3`\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   `P1 = 2` years\n*   `K1a = 10` km/s\n*   `K1b = 5` km/s\n*   Sum of velocities: `K1a + K1b = 10 + 5 = 15` km/s\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   `P2 = 1` year\n*   `K2a = 15` km/s\n*   `K2b = 10` km/s\n*   Sum of velocities: `K2a + K2b = 15 + 10 = 25` km/s\n\nNow, substitute these values into the ratio equation:\n\n`M_total_1 / M_total_2 = (2 / 1) * (15 / 25)^3`\n`M_total_1 / M_total_2 = 2 * (3 / 5)^3`\n`M_total_1 / M_total_2 = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n`M_total_1 / M_total_2 = 54 / 125`\n`M_total_1 / M_total_2 = 0.432`\n\nThe ratio of the mass of system_1 to system_2 is 0.432. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.2\nB) ~ 0.4\nC) ~ 0.6\nD) ~ 0.7\n\nThe calculated value of 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
