    "This problem requires a two-step equilibrium calculation. First, we determine the hydrogen ion concentration, [H+], from the primary buffer system, and then we use that value to calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions, [PO4^3-], from the second equilibrium.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components.**\n\nThe buffer system consists of the conjugate acid-base pair H2PO4- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4●2H2O).\n\n*   **Moles of H2PO4-:**\n    *   Mass of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar mass of KH2PO4 = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n\n*   **Moles of HPO4^2-:**\n    *   Mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n*   **Volume of solution:**\n    *   Volume = 200.00 cm3 = 0.20000 L\n\n*   **Concentration of H2PO4-:**\n    *   [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n\n*   **Concentration of HPO4^2-:**\n    *   [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**Step 2: Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H+].**\n\nThe relevant equilibrium for this buffer is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\nH2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-\nThe equilibrium constant is Ka2 = 6.2 x 10^-8.\n\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, but it is more direct to use the Ka expression to find [H+]:\nKa2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n[H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\n[H+] = (6.2 x 10^-8) * (0.03674 M) / (0.02809 M)\n[H+] = 8.11 x 10^-8 M\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions [PO4^3-].**\n\nThe orthophosphate ion is formed in the third dissociation step:\nHPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-\nThe equilibrium constant is Ka3 = 1.8 x 10^-12.\n\nWe can write the equilibrium expression for Ka3 and solve for [PO4^3-]:\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n[PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\n\nNow, we substitute the values we have calculated:\n*   Ka3 = 1.8 x 10^-12\n*   [HPO4^2-] = 0.02809 M (We assume this concentration is not significantly changed by the third dissociation, which is a valid assumption given the very small value of Ka3).\n*   [H+] = 8.11 x 10^-8 M\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8 x 10^-12) * (0.02809) / (8.11 x 10^-8)\n[PO4^3-] = 6.236 x 10^-7 M\n\nThis value is very close to option B.
