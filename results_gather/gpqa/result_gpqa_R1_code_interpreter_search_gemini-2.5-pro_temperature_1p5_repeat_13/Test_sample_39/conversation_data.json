    "This is a common piece of slang used by organic chemists. Let's break down the context to understand what it means.\n\n1.  **The setting:** A synthetic organic chemistry lab. A major part of the work in such a lab, after running a chemical reaction, is to purify the desired product from unreacted starting materials, byproducts, and catalysts.\n2.  **The problem:** \"My compounds are on top of each other.\" This phrase refers to the result of a separation technique. The most common separation technique used in this context is **chromatography**, specifically Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) for quick analysis and column chromatography for preparative separation.\n3.  **How chromatography works:** Chromatography separates compounds based on their differential partitioning between a stationary phase (e.g., silica gel, which is polar) and a mobile phase (a solvent or mixture of solvents, which is typically less polar).\n    *   Compounds that are less polar spend more time in the mobile phase and travel further/faster.\n    *   Compounds that are more polar \"stick\" more strongly to the polar stationary phase and travel shorter distances/slower.\n4.  **What \"on top of each other\" means in chromatography:** When viewing a TLC plate, different compounds appear as distinct spots at different heights. If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will travel at almost the same rate and their spots will overlap, appearing visually \"on top of each other.\" Similarly, in column chromatography, compounds with similar polarities will exit (elute from) the column at the same time, making their separation impossible under those conditions.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) The compounds they are working with have similar polarities.** This is the direct cause of compounds being \"on top of each other\" in chromatography. If their polarities are too similar, the chromatographic separation fails. This is the most likely meaning.\n*   **B) The compounds they are working with have similar optical rotations.** Optical rotation is a physical property related to chirality and is measured with a polarimeter. It is not a property used for separation in standard chromatography or distillation. While separating compounds with similar optical properties (i.e., enantiomers) is a challenge, the phrase \"on top of each other\" refers to a separation issue, not the measurement of an optical property.\n*   **C) The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.** While molecules do interact via these forces, this is a general statement about all molecules. It doesn't specifically describe a failed separation. The failure is a macroscopic observation (overlapping spots/peaks), which is a consequence of a physical property like polarity.\n*   **D) The compounds they are working with have similar boiling points.** Having similar boiling points makes separation by distillation difficult. While a chemist might be frustrated by this, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is much more commonly and specifically used to describe a failed chromatographic separation than a failed distillation. The visual metaphor fits chromatography perfectly.\n\n**Conclusion:** The chemist is most likely complaining that they cannot separate their compounds (e.g., product from starting material) using chromatography because the compounds have very similar polarities.\n\n<<<A>>>"
