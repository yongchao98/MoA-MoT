    "This problem requires understanding the selectivity of two different reducing agents, Lithium borohydride (`LiBH4`) and Borane (`BH3`), when reacting with a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an ester functional group.\n\n### **Analysis of the Starting Material and Product**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, which is a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone). The chiral center is at position 4, which bears an ethyl group. The reactions produce two different stereoisomers: (R) in the first reaction and (S) in the second.\n    *   Structure: A six-membered ring containing `O-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-`.\n*   **Starting Material:** The proposed starting materials are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu`.\n    *   This molecule contains two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) at one end and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`) at the other.\n    *   It has a chiral center at position 3, the carbon with the ethyl group. This chiral center will become position 4 in the final lactone product. The reactions described (reduction and cyclization) do not alter the stereochemistry at this center.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reagents and Reactions**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is the differing selectivity of the two reducing agents:\n\n1.  **Lithium borohydride (`LiBH4`)**: This is a moderately strong reducing agent. It can reduce aldehydes, ketones, and **esters**, but it is generally unreactive towards carboxylic acids.\n2.  **Borane (`BH3`)**: This reducing agent has a unique and high selectivity for **carboxylic acids**, reducing them to primary alcohols. It is much less reactive towards esters, especially in the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n\n### **Reaction 1: A + LiBH4 → (R)-product**\n\n1.  **Reduction:** `LiBH4` will selectively reduce the **ester** group (`-C(=O)O-iBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`), leaving the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) untouched.\n    `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu` --(`LiBH4`)--> `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n2.  **Cyclization (Lactonization):** In the presence of acid (`H+`), the resulting 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid undergoes an intramolecular esterification. The hydroxyl group (`-OH`) attacks the carboxylic acid carbonyl carbon to form the stable six-membered lactone ring.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The reaction does not affect the chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material (A) must be the same as the stereochemistry of the product. Since the product is `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, the starting material **A must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: B + BH3 → (S)-product**\n\n1.  **Reduction:** `BH3` will selectively reduce the **carboxylic acid** group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`), leaving the ester group (`-C(=O)O-iBu`) untouched.\n    `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu` --(`BH3`)--> `HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu`\n2.  **Cyclization (Transesterification):** In the presence of acid (`H+`), the resulting 5-hydroxy ester undergoes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl carbon, displacing the isobutoxy group (`-OiBu`) to form the lactone.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** This reaction sequence also does not affect the chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material (B) must match that of the product. Since the product is `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, the starting material **B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting Material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting Material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
