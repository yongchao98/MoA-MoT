    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products of Decomposition**\n\nThe problem states that a 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B is heated, and the resulting gas mixture is passed through three tubes. Let's analyze the effect of each tube to identify the products and their quantities.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2**\n    *   This substance is a strong dehydrating agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass of the tube increased by 3.60 g. This means 3.60 g of H₂O was produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution (limewater)**\n    *   This solution absorbs acidic gases like CO₂.\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change. This indicates that no CO₂ or other acidic gases were formed during the decomposition. Therefore, the original salts do not contain carbon that would oxidize to CO₂.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper (Cu)**\n    *   Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The mass increase of the tube is due to the oxygen atoms that bind to the copper.\n    *   Mass of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since these oxygen atoms came from O₂ molecules, the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n    *   Mass of O₂ gas = 0.025 mol * 32.0 g/mol = 0.80 g.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C**\n    *   After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n**2. Verify Mass Conservation and Identify Gas C**\n\nLet's check if the total mass of the identified products equals the initial mass of the mixture.\n*   Total mass of products = mass(H₂O) + mass(O₂) + mass(Gas C)\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Total mass accounted for so far = 3.60 g + 0.80 g = 4.40 g.\n*   The initial mass was 7.20 g. Therefore, the mass of gas C must be:\n    *   Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g.\n*   Now we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n    *   Molar Mass (Gas C) = Mass(Gas C) / Moles(Gas C) = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A diatomic gas with a molar mass of ~28 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂). Gas C is unreactive towards Ca(OH)₂ and hot Cu, which is consistent with N₂.\n*   So, the products are: 0.2 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.1 mol N₂.\n\n**3. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Salts**\n\nThe decomposition was performed without air, so all the atoms in the products must have come from the original salts A and B. The salts must be composed of Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n\nLet's calculate the total moles of each element:\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All H is in H₂O. Moles of H = 2 × moles(H₂O) = 2 × 0.2 mol = 0.4 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All N is in N₂. Moles of N = 2 × moles(N₂) = 2 × 0.1 mol = 0.2 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in H₂O and O₂. Moles of O = (1 × moles(H₂O)) + (2 × moles(O₂)) = (1 × 0.2) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\nThe empirical atomic ratio in the mixture is H:N:O = 0.4 : 0.2 : 0.25. Multiplying by 20 gives the integer ratio H₁₆:N₄:O₅.\n\n**4. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe salts are composed of N, H, and O. This strongly suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxoanions (e.g., nitrite, nitrate).\n*   The 0.4 mol of H atoms most likely come from the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺).\n*   Moles of NH₄⁺ = Moles of H / 4 = 0.4 mol / 4 = 0.1 mol.\n*   The problem states the mixture is equimolar, meaning we have n moles of salt A and n moles of salt B. Let's assume each salt contains one NH₄⁺ ion.\n*   Total moles of NH₄⁺ = n + n = 2n = 0.1 mol.\n*   This gives n = 0.05 mol. So, the mixture contains **0.05 mol of salt A** and **0.05 mol of salt B**.\n\nNow, let's determine the anions. The anions must contain the remaining N and all the O.\n*   N in anions = Total N - N in NH₄⁺ = 0.2 mol - 0.1 mol = 0.1 mol.\n*   O in anions = Total O = 0.25 mol.\n\nLet the formula of the anion in salt A be (NₐOₑ)⁻ and in salt B be (N𝕔Oₔ)⁻.\nFor the 0.05 mol of each salt:\n*   Total N in anions: 0.05a + 0.05c = 0.1  => a + c = 2\n*   Total O in anions: 0.05e + 0.05d = 0.25 => e + d = 5\n\nWe need to find two common nitrogen-based anions that satisfy these conditions.\nLet's test common anions:\n*   Nitrite: NO₂⁻ (a=1, e=2)\n*   Nitrate: NO₃⁻ (c=1, d=3)\nChecking if these fit:\n*   a + c = 1 + 1 = 2 (Correct)\n*   e + d = 2 + 3 = 5 (Correct)\n\nThis is a perfect fit. So, the salts are Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's verify the total mass:\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14+4+14+32 = 64 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14+4+14+48 = 80 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol × 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80 g/mol) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass perfectly.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salt A and salt B.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite): NH₄NO₂**\n    *   Atoms = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate): NH₄NO₃**\n    *   Atoms = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nTo be certain, let's verify with a short Python script.\n```python\n# Final calculation confirmation\n# Salt A: NH4NO2\natoms_A = 1 + 4 + 1 + 2\n# Salt B: NH4NO3\natoms_B = 1 + 4 + 1 + 3\n\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\nprint(f\"Number of atoms in NH4NO2: {atoms_A}\")\nprint(f\"Number of atoms in NH4NO3: {atoms_B}\")\nprint(f\"Total number of atoms in salts A and B: {total_atoms}\")\n```\n>>>\nNumber of atoms in NH4NO2: 8\nNumber of atoms in NH4NO3: 9\nTotal number of atoms in salts A and B: 17\n\nThe calculations are confirmed.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "An equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, undergoes thermal decomposition. The products are analyzed to determine the composition of the original salts.\n\n**1. Analysis of Decomposition Products:**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂):** The mass of this tube did not change. This indicates that no acidic gases, such as CO₂, were produced. This rules out the presence of carbon in the original salts that could be oxidized to CO₂.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot Cu):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen gas (O₂): 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the oxygen atoms that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen gas exists as O₂ molecules, the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of oxygen atoms.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** After passing through the tubes, 2.24 L of gas C remained at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   According to Avogadro's law, 1 mole of any gas at STP occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n**2. Identification of Gas C and Mass Conservation:**\n\nThe initial mass of the mixture was 7.20 g. The total mass of the gaseous products must also be 7.20 g.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.025 mol × 32.0 g/mol = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of Gas C = Total Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g\n*   Now we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n    *   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A diatomic gas that is unreactive with the reagents in the tubes and has a molar mass of 28 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**3. Elemental Composition and Identification of Salts A and B:**\n\nThe decomposition was done without air, so all the elements in the products (N, H, O) must have come from the original salts.\n*   **Total moles of Nitrogen (N):** From 0.1 mol of N₂ → 2 × 0.1 = 0.2 mol N.\n*   **Total moles of Hydrogen (H):** From 0.2 mol of H₂O → 2 × 0.2 = 0.4 mol H.\n*   **Total moles of Oxygen (O):** From 0.2 mol of H₂O and 0.025 mol of O₂ → (1 × 0.2) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n\nThe salts are composed of N, H, and O, which strongly suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions.\n*   The 0.4 mol of H corresponds to 0.1 mol of ammonium ions (NH₄⁺), since each ion has 4 H atoms (0.4 mol H / 4 = 0.1 mol NH₄⁺).\n*   The problem states the mixture is equimolar. If we have n moles of salt A and n moles of salt B, and each contains one ammonium ion, then 2n = 0.1 mol, which means n = 0.05 mol.\n*   The mixture contains 0.05 mol of salt A and 0.05 mol of salt B.\n*   Let's find the anions. The anions must contain the remaining nitrogen and all the oxygen.\n    *   N in anions = Total N - N in NH₄⁺ = 0.2 mol - 0.1 mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   O in anions = Total O = 0.25 mol.\n*   For 0.05 mol of each salt, if the anions are (NₓOᵧ) and (NₐOᵦ), then:\n    *   0.05x + 0.05a = 0.1  =>  x + a = 2\n    *   0.05y + 0.05b = 0.25 =>  y + b = 5\n*   The two most common nitrogen oxyanions are nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻).\n    *   If one anion is NO₂⁻ (x=1, y=2) and the other is NO₃⁻ (a=1, b=3):\n        *   x + a = 1 + 1 = 2 (Correct)\n        *   y + b = 2 + 3 = 5 (Correct)\n*   Therefore, the salts are Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n*   **Verification by mass:**\n    *   M(NH₄NO₂) = 64 g/mol; Mass = 0.05 mol × 64 g/mol = 3.20 g\n    *   M(NH₄NO₃) = 80 g/mol; Mass = 0.05 mol × 80 g/mol = 4.00 g\n    *   Total Mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g. This matches the given information.\n\n**4. Final Calculation:**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in their chemical formulas).\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n*   **Total number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\n<<<B>>>"
