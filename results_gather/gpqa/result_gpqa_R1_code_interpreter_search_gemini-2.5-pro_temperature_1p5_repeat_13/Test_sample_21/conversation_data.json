    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first part of the statement (Thermodynamics).**\n\nThe first blank asks about the thermodynamic strength of oxygen as an oxidant in basic solutions. The strength of an oxidizing agent is quantified by its standard reduction potential (E°). A more positive (larger) E° value indicates a stronger oxidizing agent.\n\nI need to compare the standard reduction potential of oxygen in acidic solution versus basic solution.\n\n*   **In acidic solution**, the half-reaction for the reduction of oxygen is:\n    O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l)\n    The standard reduction potential for this reaction is E° = +1.23 V.\n\n*   **In basic solution**, the half-reaction is:\n    O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq)\n    The standard reduction potential for this reaction is E° = +0.40 V.\n\nTo determine if oxygen is a \"stronger\" or \"weaker\" oxidant in basic solutions, I compare its potential in basic solution (+0.40 V) to its potential in acidic solution (+1.23 V).\n\nSince +0.40 V is significantly less positive than +1.23 V, the thermodynamic driving force for oxygen to act as an oxidant is lower in basic solutions. Therefore, thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions compared to acidic solutions.\n\nThis conclusion eliminates options A and B, leaving C and D as possible answers.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second part of the statement (Kinetics).**\n\nThe second blank asks about the kinetic rate (speed) of oxygen's reaction in acidic solutions. This is a question about reaction kinetics, which is determined by factors like activation energy, not just the thermodynamic potential.\n\nThe reduction of oxygen involves breaking the strong O=O double bond, which requires a high activation energy. For this reason, oxygen reactions are often kinetically slow, or \"sluggish,\" under many conditions. The question, however, asks for a *comparison* of the rate in acidic versus basic solutions.\n\nLet's consider the role of H⁺ ions. In the acidic half-reaction (O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O), protons (H⁺) are a reactant. In many chemical reactions, the presence of acid acts as a catalyst, providing a lower-energy pathway for the reaction to proceed.\n\nA very common and illustrative real-world example is the corrosion (rusting) of iron. Rusting is an electrochemical process where iron is oxidized, and oxygen is reduced. This process is known to be significantly accelerated in the presence of acid. This acceleration is due to the increased rate of the cathodic reaction, which is the reduction of oxygen.\n\nTherefore, kinetically, oxygen reacts **faster** in acidic solutions than in neutral or basic solutions.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the conclusions.**\n\n*   From Step 1 (Thermodynamics): Oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n*   From Step 2 (Kinetics): Oxygen reacts **faster** in acidic solutions.\n\nThe correct pair of words to complete the statement is \"weaker\" and \"faster\".\n\nLet's check this against the given options:\nA) stronger – faster\nB) stronger – slower\nC) weaker – faster\nD) weaker - slower\n\nOur derived pair, \"weaker – faster\", matches option C.\n\nThe completed statement is: \"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts **faster** in acidic solutions.\"\n\n<<<C>>>"
