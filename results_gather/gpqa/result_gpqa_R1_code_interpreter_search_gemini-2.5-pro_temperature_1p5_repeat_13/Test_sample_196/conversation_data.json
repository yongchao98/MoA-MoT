    "*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum of Compound X:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad signal is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption typical for the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions are in the region for C=C stretching in an aromatic ring (like benzene).\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The presence of both a broad O-H and a C=O at ~1720 cm⁻¹ strongly indicates that Compound X is a carboxylic acid. The signals at 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ suggest it's an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Compound X:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A signal this far downfield and described as a broad singlet (bs) is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). This confirms the IR analysis.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. They are both doublets (d) and each integrates to 2 protons. This pattern is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents are different, causing the two sets of protons on the ring to have different chemical shifts. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the signal at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the other, electron-donating, substituent.\n    *   Now, let's decipher the structure of the other substituent from the remaining signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-). Fragment: -CH₂-CH₃.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons. This is likely the -CH₂- group from the fragment above. Its multiplicity ('m') is due to splitting by both the adjacent methyl group and another proton.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a single proton (-CH-). Fragment: -CH-CH₃.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton. Its downfield shift suggests it's a benzylic proton (attached to the aromatic ring). This must be the -CH- that is splitting the methyl group at 1.4 ppm.\n    *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** We have a -CH- group attached to the benzene ring. This -CH- is also attached to a methyl group (-CH₃) and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The full structure of this alkyl group is -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃), which is a *sec*-butyl group.\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. This is option (C).\n\n3.  **Identify the Reaction and Predict the Product:**\n    *   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a very powerful reducing agent combination. It is one of the few reagents capable of reducing a carboxylic acid (-COOH) all the way down to a methyl group (-CH₃). It also reduces ketones, aldehydes, and alcohols to the corresponding alkanes.\n    *   **Applying the reaction:** The starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the ring to a methyl group (-CH₃). The *sec*-butyl group and the benzene ring will not be affected by these reagents.\n    *   **Product:** The product will be 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n4.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect structure.\n    *   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: This matches the predicted product.\n    *   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n    *   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: This has an isobutyl group, not a *sec*-butyl group. The NMR data clearly pointed to a *sec*-butyl group.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
