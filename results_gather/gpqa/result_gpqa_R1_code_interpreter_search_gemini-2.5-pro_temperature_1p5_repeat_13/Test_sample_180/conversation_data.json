    "This problem requires us to understand the sources of solar neutrinos at different energies and how they are affected by a hypothetical change in the Sun's nuclear reactions.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Baseline Solar Neutrino Spectrum\n\nThe Sun produces neutrinos through several nuclear reaction chains. The main ones are the proton-proton (pp) chains and the CNO cycle. Each reaction produces neutrinos with a characteristic energy spectrum.\n\n*   **pp-I chain:** Produces `pp` neutrinos with a continuous spectrum up to 0.42 MeV.\n*   **pp-II chain:** Produces monoenergetic (single-energy) neutrinos from electron capture on Beryllium-7 (`7Be`). The most prominent line is at **0.861 MeV (861 keV)**, containing about 90% of the `7Be` neutrinos. This branch is a major contributor to the total neutrino flux.\n*   **pp-III chain:** Produces `8B` (Boron-8) neutrinos with a continuous, high-energy spectrum up to about 15 MeV.\n*   **CNO cycle:** Produces neutrinos from `13N` and `15O` decays, both having continuous spectra extending up to 1.20 MeV and 1.73 MeV, respectively.\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Hypothetical Scenario\n\nThe question states that the **pp-III branch suddenly stops**. This means the production of **`8B` neutrinos ceases**. All other reactions are assumed to continue as they were. We need to find the new ratio of neutrino fluxes in two adjacent energy bands:\n*   **Band 1:** 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV)\n*   **Band 2:** 800-900 keV (0.8-0.9 MeV)\n\n### 3. Identifying Neutrino Sources in Each Band (After the Change)\n\nLet's determine which reactions contribute to the flux in each band after the `8B` neutrinos are gone.\n\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n    *   `pp` neutrinos: No, their maximum energy is 420 keV.\n    *   `7Be` neutrinos: No, the line is at 861 keV.\n    *   `8B` neutrinos: No, this branch has stopped.\n    *   `CNO` neutrinos (`13N`, `15O`): Yes, their continuous spectra cover this energy range.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The flux in Band 1 is solely due to CNO cycle neutrinos.\n\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n    *   `pp` neutrinos: No.\n    *   `7Be` neutrinos: **Yes**, the extremely strong line at **861 keV** falls right in the middle of this band.\n    *   `8B` neutrinos: No.\n    *   `CNO` neutrinos: Yes, their continuous spectra also cover this range.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The flux in Band 2 is due to the `7Be` line plus a contribution from CNO neutrinos.\n\n### 4. Comparing the Flux Magnitudes\n\nNow we need to compare the flux in Band 1 to the flux in Band 2.\n\n*   **Flux(Band 1) = Flux_CNO(700-800 keV)**\n*   **Flux(Band 2) = Flux_7Be(861 keV line) + Flux_CNO(800-900 keV)**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is recognizing the vast difference in the magnitudes of these fluxes:\n1.  The `7Be` line flux from the pp-II chain is very large. According to the Standard Solar Model, its flux at Earth is approximately **~5 x 10⁹ neutrinos / (cm² s)**.\n2.  The CNO cycle contributes only about 1% of the Sun's total energy, and its neutrino fluxes are consequently lower than the main pp chain fluxes. The total flux from all CNO neutrinos (`13N` + `15O`) is roughly **~5 x 10⁸ neutrinos / (cm² s)**.\n3.  The CNO spectrum is continuous (spread out over a range of energies), while the `7Be` flux is concentrated in a single, sharp line.\n\n### 5. Calculating the Ratio\n\nLet's approximate the fluxes:\n\n*   **Flux in Band 2:** The `7Be` line flux (~5 x 10⁹) is much larger than the CNO contribution in that small energy band. So, we can approximate the flux in Band 2 as being almost entirely the `7Be` line flux.\n    *   Flux(Band 2) ≈ Flux_7Be ≈ 5 x 10⁹\n\n*   **Flux in Band 1:** This is the flux from CNO neutrinos integrated over the 100 keV window from 700 to 800 keV. Since the total CNO flux of ~5 x 10⁸ is spread over an energy range of ~1.7 MeV, the flux in a small 100 keV window will be a small fraction of the total. We can estimate this fraction. A 100 keV (0.1 MeV) slice out of a ~1 MeV effective width of the CNO spectrum would contain roughly 10% of the total CNO flux.\n    *   Flux(Band 1) ≈ 10% of Total CNO Flux ≈ 0.1 * (5 x 10⁸) = 5 x 10⁷\n\n*   **The Ratio:**\n    Flux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2) ≈ (5 x 10⁷) / (5 x 10⁹) = 1 / 100 = 10⁻² = 0.01\n\nThe flux in the 700-800 keV band (from a slice of the CNO spectrum) is about 100 times smaller than the flux in the 800-900 keV band (which is dominated by the intense `7Be` line).\n\nTherefore, the approximate ratio is 0.01.\n\n<<<B>>>"
