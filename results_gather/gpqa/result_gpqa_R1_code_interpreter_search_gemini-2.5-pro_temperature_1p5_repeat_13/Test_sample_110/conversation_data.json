    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1 Analysis: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is a ketone.\n    *   **Reagent:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which acts as a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction is a Michael addition. The base will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form an enolate, which then acts as a nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate:**\n    *   We need to identify the acidic α-protons on the ketone. The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n        *   **C2:** is a quaternary carbon, bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has **no α-protons**.\n        *   **C6:** is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, the base t-BuOK can only abstract the proton from C6. This forms a specific enolate where the nucleophilic carbon is C6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate anion (with the negative charge effectively on C6) attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon (the CH₂) of the ethyl acrylate molecule.\n\n4.  **Structure of the Product (Product A):**\n    *   After the reaction and workup (protonation), a `-(CH₂-CH₂-COOEt)` group is attached to C6 of the original ketone.\n    *   The resulting molecule is **2-ethyl-6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n5.  **Matching with Options (Nomenclature Issue):**\n    *   The names provided in the options, such as `ethyl 3-(...cyclohexyl)propanoate`, treat the cyclohexane part as a substituent on the propanoate chain. This is a valid IUPAC naming convention. Let's try to name our product in this way: `ethyl 3-(2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl-1-oxocyclohexan-6-yl)propanoate`.\n    *   This name does not match any of the options provided. For example, option A/B is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`. This name implies a different connectivity or a different starting material.\n    *   Let's analyze the structure corresponding to the name in option A: `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n        *   This product would be formed from the Michael addition of the enolate of **3-ethyl-1,3-dimethylcyclohexan-2-one** at its C1 position onto ethyl acrylate.\n    *   There appears to be a typo in the name of the starting ketone in the problem statement. Given the options, it is highly probable that the intended starting material was **3-ethyl-1,3-dimethylcyclohexan-2-one**. Assuming this correction:\n        *   **Corrected Starting Ketone:** 3-ethyl-1,3-dimethylcyclohexan-2-one. α-protons are only at C1 (C3 is quaternary).\n        *   **Enolate Formation:** The bulky base t-BuOK deprotonates the less hindered C1 position.\n        *   **Attack:** The C1 enolate attacks ethyl acrylate.\n        *   **Product:** The `-(CH₂-CH₂-COOEt)` group attaches to C1.\n        *   **Naming:** Let's name this product. The attachment point is C1, which also has a methyl group. The carbonyl is at C2. An ethyl and a methyl group are at C3. Naming it as a propanoate derivative gives: `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n    *   This name exactly matches the name for **A** in options A and B.\n\n### Reaction 2 Analysis: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂-NO₂) has acidic α-protons on the carbon adjacent to the nitro group.\n    *   **Reagent:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a Michael addition. The base deprotonates the 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate).\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   KOH removes a proton from the carbon bonded to the nitro group:\n        `CH₃CH₂CH₂-NO₂ + OH⁻  ⇌  CH₃CH₂CH(-)-NO₂ + H₂O`\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbanion (`CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂`) attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile. In `CH₃(γ)-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`, the β-carbon is the CH group bonded to the methyl group.\n\n4.  **Structure of the Product (Product B):**\n    *   After the attack and protonation (from water), a new C-C bond is formed.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `NC-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(NO₂)-CH₂CH₃`\n\n5.  **Naming Product B:**\n    *   We identify the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile group. The nitrile carbon is C1.\n        ```\n              NO₂\n              |\n        NC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)\n        ```\n    *   The main chain is a hexanenitrile.\n    *   There is a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n6.  **Matching with Options:**\n    *   This name for product **B** matches the one given in options A and D.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A** is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n*   **Product B** is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n\nCombining these results, we find that Option A provides the correct names for both products.\n\n<<<A>>>"
