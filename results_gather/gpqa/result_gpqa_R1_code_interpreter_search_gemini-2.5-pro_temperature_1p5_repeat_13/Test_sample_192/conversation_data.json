    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information:**\n    The problem states that \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx⁵\". This describes the distribution of stars as a function of their parallax. In mathematical terms, it gives us the number of stars per unit of parallax, which we can write as a number density function `dN/d(plx)`.\n    So, we are given:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵`\n    where `N` is the number of stars and `plx` is the parallax.\n\n2.  **Identify the goal:**\n    The question asks \"How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?\". This is asking for the number density function with respect to distance, `r`. In mathematical terms, we need to find the proportionality for `dN/dr`.\n\n3.  **Establish the fundamental relationship between distance and parallax:**\n    Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The standard formula is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    From this, we can also write `r = 1/plx`.\n\n4.  **Use the chain rule to transform the distribution:**\n    To find `dN/dr` from `dN/d(plx)`, we can use the chain rule from calculus:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n    Since the number of stars in a given slice of the sky (`dN`) must be positive, and `dr` and `d(plx)` will have opposite signs (as `r` increases, `plx` decreases), we should use the absolute value of the derivative (the Jacobian of the transformation) to ensure the density `dN/dr` is positive:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n\n5.  **Calculate the derivative `d(plx)/dr`:**\n    We need to differentiate the relationship `plx = 1/r` with respect to `r`.\n    `plx = r⁻¹`\n    `d(plx)/dr = d/dr(r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    The absolute value is:\n    `|d(plx)/dr| = |-1/r²| = 1/r²`\n\n6.  **Substitute the relationships into the transformation equation:**\n    We have the following proportionalities and equations:\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵`\n    *   `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`\n    *   `plx = 1/r`\n\n    Substitute these into the chain rule formula:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx⁵) * (1/r²)`\n\n7.  **Express everything in terms of distance `r`:**\n    To get the final relationship for `dN/dr` in terms of `r`, we replace `plx` with `1/r` in the expression:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)⁵) * (1/r²)`\n\n8.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    First, simplify the `1/(1/r)⁵` term:\n    `1 / (1/r)⁵ = 1 / (1/r⁵) = r⁵`\n    Now substitute this back into the proportionality:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²) `\n    Finally, combine the powers of `r`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\n9.  **Conclusion:**\n    The number of stars per unit range of distance, `dN/dr`, is proportional to the cube of the distance, `r³`. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
