    "*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning its molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Common features that lead to chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (as seen in certain substituted biphenyls or allenes). A molecule that has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral and will not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   This is a biphenyl derivative. Biphenyls can be chiral if there is restricted rotation (hindered rotation) around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism, which is a form of axial chirality.\n    *   Hindered rotation occurs when there are large, bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6').\n    *   In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted: two nitro groups (-NO2) at positions 6 and 6', and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3) at positions 2 and 2'.\n    *   These groups are bulky enough to prevent free rotation around the central C-C bond. This forces the two phenyl rings to be non-coplanar.\n    *   The resulting twisted conformation lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making the molecule chiral. It can exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).\n    *   Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   This compound is also known as methyl lactate. Its structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group).\n    *   This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center (or stereocenter).\n    *   The presence of a single chiral center makes the entire molecule chiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound exists as a pair of enantiomers and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   The structure is C6H5-CO-C6H5. It is a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n    *   The carbonyl carbon is sp2-hybridized and is only bonded to three atoms (one oxygen and two carbons). It cannot be a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule possesses a C2 axis of symmetry passing through the C=O bond. Even though the phenyl rings are twisted out of the plane, the molecule as a whole is achiral because it is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   Therefore, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid.\n    *   The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   The molecule is essentially planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the molecular plane itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   Specifically, dimethyl fumarate has a center of inversion (at the midpoint of the C=C bond) and a plane of symmetry perpendicular to the molecular plane, bisecting the C=C bond.\n    *   Since the molecule is achiral, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will show optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not.\n\nThus, the correct option includes 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
