    "This is a classic problem in quantum mechanics involving spin dynamics, specifically Larmor precession. Let's break down the solution step-by-step.\n\n### 1. Initial State (`t < 0`)\n*   A spin-1/2 particle has a magnetic moment `vec(μ) = γ * vec(S)`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `vec(S)` is the spin angular momentum operator.\n*   The particle is in a uniform magnetic field `vec(B) = B * z_hat` (pointing in the +Z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian for this situation is `H_initial = -vec(μ) ⋅ vec(B) = - (γ * vec(S)) ⋅ (B * z_hat) = -γ * B * S_z`.\n*   The statement \"the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with the magnetic field\" means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`. The eigenstates of `H_initial` are the eigenstates of `S_z`, which are spin-up `|+z>` and spin-down `|-z>`.\n    *   `S_z |+z> = +(ħ/2) |+z>`, giving energy `E_up = -γ * B * (ħ/2)`.\n    *   `S_z |-z> = -(ħ/2) |-z>`, giving energy `E_down = -γ * B * (-ħ/2) = +γ * B * (ħ/2)`.\n*   Assuming `γ` is positive (as is typical for protons), the lower energy state is `E_up`, corresponding to the spin-up state `|+z>`. So, the initial state of the system at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2. Dynamics for `t > 0`\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to `vec(B) = B * y_hat` (pointing in the +Y direction).\n*   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution for `t > 0` is `H_new = -vec(μ) ⋅ vec(B) = - (γ * vec(S)) ⋅ (B * y_hat) = -γ * B * S_y`.\n*   The state of the system evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, the solution of which is:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * H_new * t / ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * (-γ * B * S_y) * t / ħ) |+z>`\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(i * γ * B * S_y * t / ħ) |+z>`\n\n### 3. Calculating the Expectation Value\nWe want to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)> = γ * <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n\nThere are two common ways to solve this: the Schrödinger picture (evolving the state) or the Heisenberg picture (evolving the operator). The Heisenberg picture is often more direct for this type of problem.\n\n**Using the Heisenberg Picture:**\n\nIn the Heisenberg picture, the operators evolve in time, and the state vector remains fixed at `|ψ(0)>`. The equation of motion for an operator `A` is:\n`d(A)/dt = (1/iħ) * [A, H] + ∂A/∂t`\n\nLet's find the equations of motion for the spin operators. Let `ω = γB`. This is the Larmor frequency. The Hamiltonian is `H = -ω * S_y`.\n\n*   **For `S_z`:**\n    `dS_z/dt = (1/iħ) * [S_z, H] = (1/iħ) * [S_z, -ω * S_y] = (-ω/iħ) * [S_z, S_y]`\n    Using the commutation relation `[S_y, S_z] = iħ * S_x`, we get `[S_z, S_y] = -iħ * S_x`.\n    `dS_z/dt = (-ω/iħ) * (-iħ * S_x) = ω * S_x`\n\n*   **For `S_x`:**\n    `dS_x/dt = (1/iħ) * [S_x, H] = (1/iħ) * [S_x, -ω * S_y] = (-ω/iħ) * [S_x, S_y]`\n    Using the commutation relation `[S_x, S_y] = iħ * S_z`.\n    `dS_x/dt = (-ω/iħ) * (iħ * S_z) = -ω * S_z`\n\nNow we have a system of coupled differential equations for the operators:\n1.  `dS_z/dt = ω * S_x`\n2.  `dS_x/dt = -ω * S_z`\n\nTo solve for `S_z(t)`, we can differentiate the first equation and substitute the second:\n`d²S_z/dt² = ω * (dS_x/dt) = ω * (-ω * S_z) = -ω² * S_z`\n`d²S_z/dt² + ω² * S_z = 0`\n\nThis is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator. The general solution is:\n`S_z(t) = A * cos(ωt) + C * sin(ωt)`\nThe constants `A` and `C` are determined by the initial conditions at `t=0`. Since the operators in the Heisenberg picture at `t=0` are just the Schrödinger picture operators, we have:\n`A = S_z(0) = S_z`\n`C * ω = (dS_z/dt)|_(t=0) = ω * S_x(0) = ω * S_x`. So, `C = S_x`.\nThe full solution for the operator is `S_z(t) = S_z * cos(ωt) + S_x * sin(ωt)`.\n\nNow, we find the expectation value by \"sandwiching\" this operator between the initial state `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n`<S_z>(t) = <+z| S_z(t) |+z> = <+z| (S_z * cos(ωt) + S_x * sin(ωt)) |+z>`\n`<S_z>(t) = cos(ωt) * <+z| S_z |+z> + sin(ωt) * <+z| S_x |+z>`\n\nWe need to evaluate the matrix elements:\n*   `<+z| S_z |+z> = ħ/2` (by definition of the `|+z>` state).\n*   `S_x |+z> = (ħ/2)|-z>`. Therefore, `<+z| S_x |+z> = (ħ/2) * <+z|-z> = 0` (because `|+z>` and `|-z>` are orthogonal).\n\nSubstituting these values back:\n`<S_z>(t) = cos(ωt) * (ħ/2) + sin(ωt) * 0 = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nThe expectation value of the z-component of spin is `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`.\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n`<μ_z>(t) = γ * <S_z>(t) = γ * (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`\n\nSubstituting `ω = γB`:\n`<μ_z>(t) = (γħ/2) * cos( (γB) * t)`\n\nThis expression describes an oscillation. The term inside the cosine function is `(γB) * t`, which is of the form `(angular frequency) * t`.\nThus, the angular oscillation frequency is `ω = γB`.\n\nThe options provided are:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nD) gamma*B\n\nThe calculated oscillation frequency matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
