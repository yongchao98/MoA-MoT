    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Understand the Information Provided**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14.\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n*   **¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n    *   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n**2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectra of Each Potential Compound**\n\nLet's predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each of the four options based on their molecular structure and symmetry. The number of signals corresponds to the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C₆H₂(CH₃)₄ = C₁₀H₁₄. (Correct)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetric. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one signal**. Since they have no adjacent non-equivalent protons, this signal will be a **singlet**. The integration will be for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one signal**, a **singlet**, integrating to 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C₆H₂(CH₃)₄ = C₁₀H₁₄. (Correct)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is less symmetric. There are no simple planes of symmetry that make protons or methyl groups equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at position 4 and the proton at position 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two distinct signals**. Since they are meta to each other, the coupling is negligible, so both signals appear as **singlets**. Each integrates to 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are four methyl groups in different environments. One might expect four separate signals. However, due to very similar chemical environments (accidental equivalence), the spectrum typically shows **three singlet signals** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 alkyl singlets (ratio 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C₆H₂(CH₃)₄ = C₁₀H₁₄. (Correct)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing between the C2-C3 bond and the C5-C6 bond.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one signal**. Since they are equivalent, they don't split each other, appearing as a **singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent to each other but different from the first pair. This results in **two singlet signals**, each integrating to 6H (a 1:1 ratio).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,4-Diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Formula:** C₆H₄(C₂H₅)₂ = C₁₀H₁₄. (Correct)\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four protons on the ring are equivalent, producing **one singlet** that integrates to 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The methylene (CH₂) protons will be a **quartet** (split by the CH₃), and the methyl (CH₃) protons will be a **triplet** (split by the CH₂).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (4H), 1 alkyl quartet (4H), 1 alkyl triplet (6H).\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we combine the predicted spectra for each pair in a 1:1 ratio and compare with the experimental data.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   Aromatic: 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two singlets (1H each). The total spectrum would have **three aromatic signals**. This does not match the data (\"two signals\").\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,4-TMB:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one singlet (2H). This mixture will show **two aromatic singlets**. Since it's a 1:1 molar mixture, the integration ratio will be 2H : 2H, which simplifies to **1:1**. This perfectly matches the aromatic data.\n    *   **Alkyl:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). The total spectrum will have **three alkyl singlets**. The integration ratio will be 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the alkyl data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   Aromatic: 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two singlets (1H each). The total spectrum would have **three aromatic signals**. This does not match the data (\"two signals\").\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-TMB and 1,4-Diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Alkyl: This mixture would contain singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB, but also a quartet and a triplet from 1,4-diethylbenzene. The experimental data states there are only **three singlets** in the alkyl region. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair that fits all the spectral data is the 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
