As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct conclusion.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the role of Gene G2\n\n*   **Single Mutant `g2`:** The `g2` knockout mutant shows 0% resistance. This is a complete loss of the resistance phenotype, making it the most severe single-mutant effect. This suggests G2 plays an essential, non-redundant role in the resistance pathway.\n*   **Double Mutants with `g2`:**\n    *   The `g1g2` double mutant also has 0% resistance.\n    *   The `g2g3` double mutant also has 0% resistance.\n*   **Epistasis:** When the phenotype of a double mutant (`g1g2` or `g2g3`) is identical to the phenotype of one of the single mutants (`g2`), this is a classic case of epistasis. The gene whose phenotype is expressed in the double mutant (`g2`) is called the **epistatic** gene, and it is said to mask the effect of the other (hypostatic) gene.\n*   **Pathway Interpretation:** This epistatic relationship strongly suggests that G2 acts upstream of both G1 and G3 in a linear pathway. If G2's function is required to \"turn on\" G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 will result in 0% resistance, regardless of whether G1 or G3 are functional. The problem states that one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, and this evidence perfectly fits the description of **G2 being that transcription factor**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the relationship between Genes G1 and G3\n\n*   **Single Mutants:**\n    *   `g1` knockout causes a loss of resistance (from 100% to 75%, a 25% drop).\n    *   `g3` knockout causes a loss of resistance (from 100% to 50%, a 50% drop).\n*   **Double Mutant `g1g3`:**\n    *   If the genes acted independently and additively, the expected loss of resistance in the double mutant would be the sum of individual losses: 25% + 50% = 75%. This would leave 25% resistance.\n    *   However, the observed resistance of the `g1g3` double mutant is 10%, which represents a 90% loss of resistance.\n*   **Synergy and Redundancy:** The fact that the combined loss (90%) is much greater than the sum of the individual losses (75%) points to a **synergistic interaction**. This type of interaction is characteristic of **gene redundancy**, where two genes perform similar or overlapping functions. When only one gene is knocked out, the other can partially compensate. When both are knocked out, the function is almost completely lost, leading to a much more severe phenotype than expected. Therefore, we can conclude that **G1 and G3 show gene redundancy**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Epistasis between G1 and G3\n\n*   The term \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" would mean that the `g1g3` double mutant has the same phenotype as the `g1` single mutant.\n    *   `g1g3` resistance = 10%\n    *   `g1` resistance = 75%\n    *   Since 10% ≠ 75%, G1 is not epistatic to G3.\n*   Similarly, \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\" would mean `g1g3` has the same phenotype as `g3`.\n    *   `g1g3` resistance = 10%\n    *   `g3` resistance = 50%\n    *   Since 10% ≠ 50%, G3 is not epistatic to G1.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the provided options\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   G2 is a TF: Correct.\n    *   G1/G3 show pleiotropy: Incorrect. Pleiotropy is one gene affecting multiple traits. We only have data for one trait (resistance). The interaction is redundancy, not pleiotropy.\n    *   G1 is epistatic towards G3: Incorrect.\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   G2 is a TF: Correct.\n    *   G1/G3 show gene redundancy: Correct.\n    *   G1 is epistatic towards G3: Incorrect, as demonstrated above. However, the first two statements are the most accurate descriptions of the genetic interactions based on the data.\n*   **C) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   G1 is a TF: Incorrect. The evidence points strongly to G2.\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   G2 is a TF: Correct.\n    *   G1/G3 has the same promoter: We cannot conclude this from the data, although it is a possibility for redundant genes. It remains an assumption.\n    *   G3 is epistatic towards G1: Incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption B correctly identifies the two most important relationships in the pathway: that G2 is the upstream transcription factor and that G1 and G3 have a redundant relationship downstream. Although the third clause (\"G1 is epistatic towards G3\") is factually incorrect based on the data, Option B is by far the \"best\" and most accurate choice among the options provided, as the other options contain more significant errors. It is likely that the third clause in option B is an error in the question itself.\n\n<<<B>>>"
