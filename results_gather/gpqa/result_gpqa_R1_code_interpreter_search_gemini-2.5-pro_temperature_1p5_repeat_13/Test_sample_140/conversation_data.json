    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   The reactant is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule where a bromine atom is at position C1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) is at position C2. The other positions (C3, C4, C5, C6) have regular hydrogen atoms (H).\n    *   The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base (the amide ion, :NH2⁻).\n    *   This combination of a substituted benzene with a leaving group (Br) and a very strong base points to an **elimination-addition reaction mechanism**, which proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination to Form Benzyne Intermediate(s)**\n    *   The strong base, :NH2⁻, abstracts an acidic proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine).\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n        *   Position C2, which has a deuterium (D).\n        *   Position C6, which has a hydrogen (H).\n\n    *   This leads to two possible, parallel elimination pathways:\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Removal of H⁺ from C6**\n        *   The amide ion removes the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n        *   The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect). Therefore, this pathway is kinetically favored (faster).\n        *   The electron pair from the C-H bond shifts to form a triple bond between C1 and C6, and the bromide ion (Br⁻) is expelled from C1.\n        *   The resulting intermediate is a benzyne with the triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains on the ring. This intermediate is called **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Removal of D⁺ from C2**\n        *   The amide ion removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2.\n        *   This pathway is slower than Pathway A due to the stronger C-D bond. However, it is still a possible reaction.\n        *   The electron pair from the C-D bond shifts to form a triple bond between C1 and C2, and the bromide ion (Br⁻) is expelled from C1.\n        *   The resulting intermediate is a benzyne with the triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was removed, this intermediate has no deuterium atoms. It is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n         \n\n    *   So, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: **3-deuterobenzyne** and **benzyne**.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition of Amide to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n    *   The nucleophile (:NH2⁻) now attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. This is followed by protonation of the resulting carbanion by the solvent (ammonia, NH3).\n\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n        *   The NH2⁻ can attack either C1 or C6 of the triple bond. These two attacks lead to different products.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group adds to C1. A negative charge develops at C6, which is then protonated by NH3. The final product has the -NH2 group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH2 group adds to C6. A negative charge develops at C1, which is protonated. The final product has the -NH2 group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n    *   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n        *   The NH2⁻ attacks the symmetrical benzyne intermediate.\n        *   The -NH2 group adds to one carbon of the triple bond (e.g., C1), and the other carbon (C2) is protonated.\n        *   The final product has no deuterium. This is simply **aniline**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Counting the Possible Products**\n    The reaction produces a mixture of all possible products from both pathways. The unique organic products formed are:\n    1.  2-deuterioaniline\n    2.  3-deuterioaniline\n    3.  Aniline\n\nThese three are distinct chemical compounds (isomers or different molecular formulas). Therefore, there are a total of **3** possible organic products.\n\n<<<C>>>"
