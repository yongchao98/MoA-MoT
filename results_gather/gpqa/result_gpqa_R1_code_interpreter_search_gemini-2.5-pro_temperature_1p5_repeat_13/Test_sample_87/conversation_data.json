    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the experimental setup and observations.**\n    *   **Antigen:** GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus. Rotavirus is a gut pathogen.\n    *   **Delivery:** Oral gavage, mimicking natural infection route.\n    *   **Location of Interest:** Peyer's patches, which are gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) and function as secondary lymphoid organs. This is where immune responses to intestinal antigens are initiated.\n    *   **Cell Population:** A \"proliferating cell population\" is isolated. In a secondary lymphoid organ after antigen exposure, proliferation indicates clonal expansion of lymphocytes (B cells and/or T cells) that have recognized the antigen.\n    *   **Molecular Analysis:** Sequencing of the \"variable heavy chain gene\" is performed. The heavy chain is part of the B cell receptor (BCR) and antibodies. The \"variable\" region is responsible for antigen binding.\n    *   **Key Finding:** \"High variability\" is observed in the variable heavy chain gene of this specific proliferating cell population.\n\n*   **Step 2: Evaluate the provided options in the context of the key finding.**\n    *   The core of the question is to identify the immunological process that introduces \"high variability\" into the *variable heavy chain gene* of *proliferating B cells* in a *secondary lymphoid organ* after antigen encounter.\n\n    *   **A) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This process occurs in activated B cells that are proliferating within germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). SHM introduces point mutations specifically into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes. The purpose is to generate B cell clones with higher affinity for the antigen (a process called affinity maturation). This directly causes \"high variability\" in the variable heavy chain gene. This matches the observations perfectly.\n\n    *   **B) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system, involving a cascade of plasma proteins. It helps clear pathogens but does not involve genetic changes to lymphocyte receptors. Therefore, it cannot be the cause of the observed genetic variability.\n\n    *   **C) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that creates the initial, vast repertoire of B cell receptors. It occurs in developing B cells within the primary lymphoid organ (the bone marrow). It happens *before* a B cell ever encounters an antigen. The process described in the question is happening in a secondary lymphoid organ *after* antigen exposure in an already-matured but now-proliferating cell. VDJ recombination has already occurred in these cells.\n\n    *   **D) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers, often concurrently with somatic hypermutation. However, CSR changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene, not the variable region. This switches the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgG or IgA) and alters the antibody's effector function, but it does *not* change its antigen-binding specificity or introduce variability in the *variable* region.\n\n*   **Step 3: Conclude the best fit.**\n    *   The process that specifically introduces high variability into the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating B cells in a secondary lymphoid organ following antigen stimulation is somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
