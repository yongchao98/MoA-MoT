    "The code execution has confirmed the result of the calculation.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principle**: The core principle governing this particle annihilation process is the **Conservation of Energy**. The total energy before the reaction must equal the total energy after the reaction.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Initial State**:\n    *   The initial system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which is a common physics problem approximation for being at rest. So, we assume both the proton and antiproton are at rest.\n    *   When a particle is at rest, its energy is entirely its rest mass energy, given by Einstein's famous equation $E=mc^2$.\n    *   The rest mass energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately $938.27 \\text{ MeV}$. An antiproton has the same rest mass.\n    *   Therefore, the total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is:\n        $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times (938.27 \\text{ MeV}) = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n3.  **Analyze the Final State**:\n    *   The final system consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n    *   These four particles are produced from the energy released by the annihilation and will be moving at high velocity, $v$.\n    *   The energy of a moving particle is its total relativistic energy, $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The problem gives the rest mass energy of particle A as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   By symmetry (and conservation of momentum, since the initial momentum was zero), all four A particles must have the same speed and therefore the same energy.\n    *   The total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\n        $E_{final} = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2) = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV}) = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Energy**:\n    *   Set the initial energy equal to the final energy:\n        $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n        $1876.54 \\text{ MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Now, solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.54}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n5.  **Calculate Velocity from the Lorentz Factor**:\n    *   The final step is to find the velocity $v$ from the calculated value of $\\gamma$.\n    *   Starting with the formula for $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for the ratio $v/c$:\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n        $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Substitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n        $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n\n6.  **Conclusion**:\n    *   The calculated velocity is $v \\approx 0.7688c$.\n    *   The Python code `print(v_over_c)` executed this calculation precisely and gave the output `0.7688132097988656`.\n    *   Rounding this result to two decimal places gives $0.77c$.\n    *   Comparing this to the multiple-choice options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
