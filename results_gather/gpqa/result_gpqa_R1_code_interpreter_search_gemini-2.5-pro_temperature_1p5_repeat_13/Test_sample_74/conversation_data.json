    "This is a molecular biology problem that requires analyzing a DNA sequence to troubleshoot a failed protein expression experiment.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning process:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The researcher wants to express a mouse GADD45G protein in CHO cells. The protein is engineered to have an HA tag at its N-terminus.\n2.  **Identify the Problem:** The protein is not being expressed as expected. The provided DNA sequence is the likely culprit.\n3.  **Analyze the Provided DNA Sequence:** The sequence is given as the \"plus strand\" or coding strand. This means we can read it directly in groups of three (codons) to determine the amino acid sequence, just like an mRNA molecule (with T instead of U).\n4.  **Deconstruct the Sequence:** The construct should have three parts in order:\n    *   A start codon (ATG).\n    *   The coding sequence for the HA tag.\n    *   The coding sequence for the GADD45G protein.\n    *   A stop codon at the very end.\n5.  **Examine the N-terminus and HA Tag:**\n    *   The sequence starts with `ATG`, which correctly codes for Methionine (M) and serves as the start codon.\n    *   The problem states the tag is the \"influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant\". The standard peptide sequence for this (the \"HA tag\") is `YPYDVPDYA`.\n    *   Let's translate the DNA sequence following the initial `ATG`:\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n        *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n        *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n        *   `GTT` -> Valine (V)\n        *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n        *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n        *   `GCC` -> Alanine (A)\n    *   The translated sequence is `M-YPYDVPDYA`. This matches the expected structure of a start codon followed by the HA tag. Therefore, the HA tag sequence itself does not have a missense mutation (ruling out option C).\n\n6.  **Examine the Sequence Immediately After the HA Tag:**\n    *   The DNA sequence for the HA tag ends at `...TAC GCC`.\n    *   The very next codon in the sequence is `AAA`, which codes for Lysine (K).\n    *   The codon after that is `TGA`.\n    *   In the universal genetic code, `TGA` is a **stop codon**.\n\n7.  **Draw the Conclusion:** The presence of a `TGA` stop codon immediately after the HA tag sequence will signal the ribosome to detach from the mRNA and cease protein synthesis. Instead of producing the full-length HA-GADD45G protein, the cell will only produce a tiny, non-functional peptide (M-YPYDVPDYA-K). This premature termination of translation is the reason the researcher cannot detect the overexpression of the full-length protein.\n\n8.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain: While a short peptide would be produced and likely degraded, the *root cause* is not proteolysis or the lack of a linker, but the fact that the full protein is never synthesized in the first place.\n    *   B) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse: This is irrelevant. The experiment uses CHO cells, the stop codon is `TGA` (not `TAA`), and stop codons are *supposed* to lack a corresponding tRNA to terminate translation. The issue is the *presence* of the stop codon in the wrong place.\n    *   C) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation: Our analysis in step 5 showed the HA tag sequence is correct.\n    *   D) The ribosome terminated the translation early: This is exactly what happens. The premature `TGA` stop codon causes early termination of translation.\n\nTherefore, the correct reason for the failed experiment is the early termination of translation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
