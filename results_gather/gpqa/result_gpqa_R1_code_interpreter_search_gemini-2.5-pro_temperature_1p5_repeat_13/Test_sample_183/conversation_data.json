    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Backbone:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  An ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3)\n    2.  A tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3)\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO2)\n*   **Regiochemistry (Substitution Pattern):** The substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern. Based on IUPAC nomenclature, the ethoxy group gets priority and is at position C1. The tert-butyl group is at C2, and the nitro group is at C3.\n\n    ```\n          OCH2CH3 (1)\n         / \\\n      (2)tBu -- C -- NO2 (3)\n       ||   ||\n       CH == CH\n        \\ /\n         CH\n    ```\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), the existing substituents on the benzene ring direct the position of new incoming groups.\n*   **-OCH2CH3 (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-C(CH3)3 (tert-butyl):** Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director. It is very bulky, so para substitution is strongly favored over ortho.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino, a common intermediate):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-NH3+ (anilinium, formed in strong acid):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director. It can be used as a \"blocking group\" as it can be removed later.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nThe goal is a \"high-yield\" synthesis, which means each step should be efficient and highly regioselective, producing the desired isomer as the major product. The final product must have the 1,2,3 substitution pattern.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option D:**\n*   i) **Benzene → Nitrobenzene:** Standard nitration.\n*   ii) **Nitrobenzene → Aniline:** Standard reduction.\n*   iii) **Aniline + tBuCl/AlCl3 → 3-tert-butylaniline:** Aniline is a base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst AlCl3. The resulting complex (-NH2+-AlCl3-) is a strong deactivator and a *meta*-director. So, Friedel-Crafts alkylation will occur at the meta position. This step correctly produces a 1,3-disubstituted benzene derivative.\n*   iv) **Nitration of 3-tert-butylaniline:** This step is problematic. In the nitrating conditions (HNO3/H2SO4), the amine group becomes protonated to -NH3+, which is a *meta*-director. The t-butyl group is an *ortho,para*-director. We have a deactivating m-director (-NH3+ at C1) competing with a weakly activating o,p-director (-tBu at C3). The directing effects conflict, and the ring is deactivated, so this step is unlikely to be high-yield or give a clean, predictable product. Moreover, none of the possible products lead to the desired final structure after subsequent steps.\n\n**Option B:**\n*   i) **Benzene → tert-butylbenzene**\n*   ii) **tert-butylbenzene → 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene** (para product is major)\n*   iii) **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid** (Sulfonation is directed ortho to t-Bu and meta to NO2)\n*   iv) **Product from (iii) + NaNO2/HCl → ???** This step is chemically incorrect. NaNO2/HCl is used to diazotize a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The substrate here has no amino group. Therefore, this sequence is impossible.\n\n**Option C:**\n*   i) **Benzene → tert-butylbenzene**\n*   ii) **tert-butylbenzene → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid** (Sulfonation at the para position to block it)\n*   iii) **Nitration → 2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid** (Nitration is directed ortho to the t-Bu group)\n*   The resulting intermediate has substituents at positions 1 (t-Bu), 2 (NO2), and 4 (SO3H). This is a **1,2,4-substitution pattern**. No matter how the subsequent reactions proceed (reduction of NO2, diazotization, removal of SO3H), the fundamental 1,2,4-relationship between the original benzene carbons is fixed. The target molecule has a **1,2,3-pattern**. Therefore, this sequence cannot produce the target molecule.\n\n**Option A:**\n*   i) **Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.** Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n*   ii) **tert-butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene.** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group, the para product is heavily favored over the ortho product.\n*   iii) **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → 4-tert-butylaniline.** Standard reduction of a nitro group to an amine.\n*   iv) **4-tert-butylaniline + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline.** Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. The powerful activating amino group (-NH2) directs ortho/para. The para position is blocked by the t-butyl group. Thus, nitration occurs ortho to the amino group, at the C2 position. The t-butyl group is at C4.\n*   The intermediate, 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline, has substituents at positions 1 (NH2), 2 (NO2), and 4 (tBu). This is a **1,2,4-substitution pattern**.\n*   v) **Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl)** of the amine.\n*   vi) **Hydrolysis (H3O+, H2O/Heat)** of the diazonium salt to a phenol (-OH).\n*   vii) **Williamson Ether Synthesis (NaOH/EtBr)** to convert the phenol to an ethoxy ether (-OEt).\n*   The final product of this sequence is **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nA detailed analysis reveals that sequences A and C lead to a 1,2,4-substituted isomer, not the required 1,2,3-isomer. Sequence B contains an impossible chemical step. Sequence D involves a complex and low-yield nitration step and also fails to produce the correct isomer.\n\nThere appears to be an error in the question, as none of the provided options lead to the synthesis of the named target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\nHowever, in the context of a multiple-choice question, we must choose the \"best\" option. Sequence A consists of a series of standard, high-yield, and predictable textbook reactions. The only flaw is that it produces an isomer of the target molecule (1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene) rather than the target itself. The other options have more severe flaws: B is impossible, C also produces the wrong isomer skeleton, and D involves chemically problematic and unpredictable steps. Therefore, it is most likely that the question intended to ask for the synthesis of the isomer produced by sequence A, and the name of the target molecule is a typo. Based on this reasoning, Option A represents the most chemically sound *sequence* of reactions among the choices.\n\n<<<A>>>"
