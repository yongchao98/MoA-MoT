    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Parent Structure and Principal Functional Group**\n\n*   The molecule is based on a **benzene ring**.\n*   The highest priority functional group mentioned is the **carboxylic acid** (-COOH).\n*   Therefore, the parent name of the molecule will be **benzoic acid**.\n*   According to IUPAC rules, the carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the principal functional group (-COOH) is assigned locant **C1**.\n\n**2. Map the Substituents based on their Positions**\n\nLet's place the substituents on the benzene ring relative to C1.\n\n*   **\"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\"**: The para position to C1 is C4. So, the methoxy group (-OCH3) is at **C4**.\n*   **\"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\"**: The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, a hydroxyl group (-OH) is at one of these positions, and a dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) is at the other.\n*   **\"A benzene ring has a carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another\"**:\n    *   The carboxylic acid is at C1. The meta positions to C1 are C3 and C5.\n    *   This means the carbaldehyde (-CHO, named as a \"formyl\" substituent) and the cyano (-CN) group must be at C3 and C5.\n    *   The condition that the carbaldehyde and cyano group are also meta to each other is satisfied if one is at C3 and the other at C5.\n\nAt this point, our ring looks like this:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2: -OH or -N(CH3)2\n*   C3: -CHO or -CN\n*   C4: -OCH3\n*   C5: -CN or -CHO (the opposite of C3)\n*   C6: -N(CH3)2 or -OH (the opposite of C2)\n\n**3. Use the Final Clue to Determine the Exact Structure**\n\n*   **\"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"**\n    *   The methoxy group is fixed at C4. For it to be ortho to the nitrile (-CN), the nitrile must be at C3 or C5. This is consistent with our previous finding.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must also be ortho to the nitrile.\n    *   Let's test the two possibilities for the nitrile's position:\n        *   **Case 1: Nitrile (-CN) is at C5.** For the alcohol to be ortho to C5, it must be at C4 or C6. C4 is already occupied by the methoxy group. Therefore, the alcohol (-OH) must be at **C6**. This means the dimethylamino group must be at **C2**, and the formyl group must be at **C3**.\n        *   **Case 2: Nitrile (-CN) is at C3.** For the alcohol to be ortho to C3, it must be at C2 or C4. C4 is occupied by the methoxy group. Therefore, the alcohol (-OH) must be at **C2**. This means the dimethylamino group must be at **C6**, and the formyl group must be at **C5**.\n\nBoth cases lead to a fully defined structure. Let's see if they are the same molecule, just numbered differently.\n*   **Structure from Case 1:** C1-COOH, C2-N(CH3)2, C3-CHO, C4-OCH3, C5-CN, C6-OH.\n*   **Structure from Case 2:** C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH3, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH3)2.\nIf you rotate Structure 1 in the plane or flip it, you cannot turn it into Structure 2. However, the IUPAC naming rules will select only one of these as the correctly numbered version of a single molecule. Let's realize that Structure 1 is just Structure 2 numbered in the opposite direction (counter-clockwise vs. clockwise). The molecule itself is unique.\n\n**4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules**\n\nThe goal is to number the ring (starting with C1 for the -COOH group) to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants. In this case, substituents are at C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6, so the locant set is {2,3,4,5,6} regardless of which direction we number (clockwise or counter-clockwise).\n\nWhen the locant sets are identical, we break the tie by giving the lowest number to the substituent that comes first alphabetically.\n\n*   Let's list the substituents alphabetically:\n    1.  **C**yano (-CN)\n    2.  **D**imethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n    3.  **F**ormyl (-CHO)\n    4.  **H**ydroxy (-OH)\n    5.  **M**ethoxy (-OCH3)\n\n*   Now let's check our two numbering directions for the unique molecule:\n    *   **Numbering Path A (corresponding to Case 2):** C2 is -OH, C3 is -CN, C5 is -CHO, C6 is -N(CH3)2.\n    *   **Numbering Path B (corresponding to Case 1):** C2 is -N(CH3)2, C3 is -CHO, C5 is -CN, C6 is -OH.\n\n*   The first substituent alphabetically is **cyano**.\n    *   In Path A, cyano is at **C3**.\n    *   In Path B, cyano is at **C5**.\n\n*   Since 3 < 5, **Path A is the correct IUPAC numbering**.\n\n**5. Construct the Final IUPAC Name**\n\nUsing the correct numbering (Path A), the positions are:\n*   C2: hydroxy\n*   C3: cyano\n*   C4: methoxy\n*   C5: formyl\n*   C6: dimethylamino\n\nNow, we list these substituents alphabetically, prefixed with their locants, before the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n1.  3-cyano\n2.  6-(dimethylamino)\n3.  5-formyl\n4.  2-hydroxy\n5.  4-methoxy\n\nCombining these in alphabetical order gives the final name:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n**6. Compare with the Given Options**\n\n*   A) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n*   B) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect: substituents not listed alphabetically)\n*   C) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect: based on the wrong numbering direction)\n*   D) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect: based on the wrong numbering direction)\n\nThe name we derived matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
