    "Here's a step-by-step derivation to find the energy spectrum.\n\n**1. Analyze the Potential**\n\nThe given potential is in polar coordinates (r, θ):\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n\nTo solve the Schrödinger equation, it's often best to work in Cartesian coordinates (x, y) if the potential simplifies. The relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\nx = r cos(θ)\ny = r sin(θ)\nr^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\n**2. Convert the Potential to Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nLet's convert each term of the potential V(r, θ) into Cartesian coordinates.\n- The first term is `1/2 kr^2`. Substituting `r^2 = x^2 + y^2`, we get:\n  `1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) = 1/2 kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2`\n\n- The second term is `3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)`. We can rewrite this as `3/2 k (r cos(θ))^2`. Since `x = r cos(θ)`, this term becomes:\n  `3/2 kx^2`\n\nNow, add the two terms together to get the full potential in Cartesian coordinates, V(x, y):\nV(x, y) = (1/2 kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2) + (3/2 kx^2)\nV(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2)kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\nV(x, y) = (4/2)kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\nV(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\n**3. Separate the Schrödinger Equation**\n\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation in two dimensions is:\n(-ħ²/2m) (∂²Ψ/∂x² + ∂²Ψ/∂y²) + V(x, y)Ψ = EΨ\n\nOur potential V(x, y) is separable, meaning it can be written as a sum of a function of x and a function of y:\nV(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\nwhere:\nV_x(x) = 2kx²\nV_y(y) = 1/2 ky²\n\nBecause the potential is separable, the Schrödinger equation can be separated into two independent one-dimensional equations. The total energy E will be the sum of the energies from each dimension, E = E_x + E_y, and the wave function will be a product, Ψ(x, y) = ψ_x(x)ψ_y(y).\n\n**4. Solve the 1D Schrödinger Equations**\n\nBoth V_x(x) and V_y(y) are potentials for a simple harmonic oscillator. The general form of a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator potential is `1/2 mω²z²`, and its energy spectrum is `E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω`.\n\n**For the x-direction:**\nThe equation is `(-ħ²/2m) d²ψ_x/dx² + 2kx² ψ_x = E_x ψ_x`.\nComparing `V_x(x) = 2kx²` with the general form `1/2 mω_x²x²`, we get:\n1/2 mω_x² = 2k\nω_x² = 4k/m\nω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for the x-direction are:\nE_nx = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k/m))\nE_nx = (2n_x + 1)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n**For the y-direction:**\nThe equation is `(-ħ²/2m) d²ψ_y/dy² + 1/2 ky² ψ_y = E_y ψ_y`.\nComparing `V_y(y) = 1/2 ky²` with the general form `1/2 mω_y²y²`, we get:\n1/2 mω_y² = 1/2 k\nω_y² = k/m\nω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for the y-direction are:\nE_ny = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n**5. Find the Total Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of E_nx and E_ny:\nE = E_nx + E_ny\nE = (2n_x + 1)ħ * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nFactor out the common term `ħ * sqrt(k/m)`:\nE = [ (2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2) ] ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = [ 2n_x + n_y + 1 + 1/2 ] ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n**6. Compare with the Options**\n\nThe calculated energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ*sqrt(k/m).\nLet's compare this with the given options:\nA) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nB) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nC) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\nD) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\nOur result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
