    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State:**\n    The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. This means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are `l1 = 1` and `l2 = 1`.\n    The system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket `|l1, l2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`.\n    *   `l1 = 1`: orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 1.\n    *   `l2 = 1`: orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 2.\n    *   `l = 2`: total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the 2-electron system.\n    *   `m = -1`: the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum (`Lz`). The eigenvalue of `Lz` is `mħ = -ħ`.\n\n2.  **Understand the Measurement:**\n    We are performing a measurement of the z-components of the individual angular momenta, `L1z` and `L2z`. The eigenstates of these operators are `|l1, m1>` and `|l2, m2>` respectively. The joint measurement corresponds to finding the system in a state `|l1, m1; l2, m2>`, which is often written as `|m1, m2>` for simplicity when `l1` and `l2` are known.\n    *   The possible eigenvalues for `L1z` are `m1ħ`, where `m1` can be `-1, 0, 1`.\n    *   The possible eigenvalues for `L2z` are `m2ħ`, where `m2` can be `-1, 0, 1`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Desired Outcome:**\n    The question asks for the joint probability of getting the eigenvalue of `L1z` as `-ħ` AND the eigenvalue of `L2z` as `-ħ`.\n    This corresponds to the measurement outcome where `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1`. We are looking for the probability of finding the system in the uncoupled state `|m1=-1, m2=-1>`.\n\n4.  **Relate the Initial State to the Measured State (The Key Principle):**\n    In quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a particular outcome is given by the square of the absolute value of the projection of the system's state vector onto the state vector of the measurement outcome.\n    Let the initial state be `|Ψ_initial> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`.\n    Let the state corresponding to the desired measurement outcome be `|Ψ_outcome> = |1, -1; 1, -1>`.\n    The probability `P` is given by `P = |<Ψ_outcome | Ψ_initial>|^2`.\n\n5.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum's Z-Component:**\n    A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components.\n    `Lz = L1z + L2z`\n    This implies that the corresponding quantum numbers must also add up:\n    `m = m1 + m2`\n    The initial state `|1, 1, 2, -1>` is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operator `Lz` with the eigenvalue `m = -1`. Any measurement on this state must yield a combination of `m1` and `m2` that sums to `-1`.\n\n6.  **Analyze the Desired Measurement Outcome:**\n    The desired outcome is `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1`.\n    For this outcome, the sum of the z-component quantum numbers would be:\n    `m1 + m2 = -1 + (-1) = -2`.\n\n7.  **Compare and Conclude:**\n    The initial state has `m = -1`.\n    The desired measurement outcome requires `m1 + m2 = -2`.\n    Since `m ≠ m1 + m2` (`-1 ≠ -2`), the state `|m1=-1, m2=-1>` cannot be a component of the initial state `|l=2, m=-1>`. In the language of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, the coefficient `<l1, m1; l2, m2 | l, m>` is zero unless `m = m1 + m2`.\n    Therefore, the inner product `<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>` is zero.\n\n8.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    `P = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2 = |0|^2 = 0`.\n    The probability of getting this measurement result is zero.\n\n<<<A>>>"
