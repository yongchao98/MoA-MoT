    "*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This corresponds to the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (the M+2 peak) with a relative intensity of 32%.\n    *   The ratio of the intensities of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 100:32, which is very close to a 3:1 ratio. This isotopic pattern is a classic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of the isotopes ³⁵Cl, ~75.8%, and ³⁷Cl, ~24.2%).\n    *   Let's calculate the molecular weight of the proposed structures using the most abundant isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ¹⁶O, ³⁵Cl). The formula for all options A, B, C, and D is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n        *   Molecular Weight = (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + 35 + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156.\n        *   The M+2 peak would come from the ³⁷Cl isotope: (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + 37 + (2 × 16) = 158.\n    *   All four options have the correct molecular weight and would exhibit this isotopic pattern. So, the MS data confirms the molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. This specific frequency is typical for a carbonyl in a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   This IR data strongly suggests the unknown compound is an aromatic carboxylic acid. This eliminates options C (which is an aldehyde and a phenol) and D (which is a chloroformate and has no O-H group). We are left with options A and B.\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm range is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). The 's' indicates it is a singlet (it does not couple with nearby protons), which is typical. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). We have a total of four aromatic protons. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The symmetry of the para-substituted ring makes the two protons on one side of the axis of symmetry chemically equivalent to each other, and the same for the two protons on the other side. This creates an AA'BB' spin system that often appears as two distinct doublets.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Remaining Options:**\n    *   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted ring. Due to the lack of symmetry, all four aromatic protons would be chemically distinct and in different environments. We would expect to see a more complex splitting pattern with four separate signals (e.g., multiplets), not two simple doublets of 2H each. This does not match the NMR data.\n    *   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a para-substituted ring. It has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom. This structure has the necessary symmetry to produce the observed NMR spectrum: two doublets in the aromatic region, each representing two equivalent protons. The carboxylic acid proton would appear around 11 ppm. This structure is perfectly consistent with all the provided spectral data (MS, IR, and ¹H NMR).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combination of all the spectral data points unequivocally to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown solid.\n\n<<<B>>>"
