    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method:** The RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The star wobbles as it orbits the common center of mass with the planet. This wobble causes its light to be blueshifted when it moves towards us and redshifted when it moves away.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:** The observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) along the line of sight. The maximum wavelength shift corresponds to the maximum radial velocity, which is known as the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K).\n    *   Δλ / λ = v_r / c\n    *   This means K ∝ Δλ_max.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ratio of RV Semi-Amplitudes:** We are given the periodic wavelength shifts for the two planets. This refers to the amplitude of the shift.\n    *   For Planet #1, Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom.\n    *   For Planet #2, Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom.\n    *   Since K ∝ Δλ, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is:\n        K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4.\n        Or, K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7.\n\n4.  **Use the Formula for RV Semi-Amplitude:** The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n    K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_s + m_p)^(2/3)\n    Where:\n    *   P = orbital period\n    *   m_p = planet's mass\n    *   M_s = star's mass\n    *   G = gravitational constant\n    *   i = orbital inclination (angle between the line of sight and the orbital axis)\n\n5.  **Simplify the Formula:** Since the planets have masses similar to Neptune and the stars have masses similar to the Sun, the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (m_p << M_s). Therefore, we can approximate (M_s + m_p) ≈ M_s.\n    K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_s^(2/3)\n\n6.  **Interpret the \"Mass\" Information:** In RV measurements, the quantity that can be determined is the \"minimum mass,\" which is `m_p * sin(i)`. The actual mass `m_p` is unknown unless the inclination `i` is known (e.g., from observing a transit). The problem states that the planets have \"masses similar to that of Neptune.\" The most reasonable interpretation in this context is that their measured minimum masses are similar.\n    *   So, we assume m_p₁ * sin(i₁) ≈ m_p₂ * sin(i₂).\n\n7.  **Relate Orbital Period (P) to RV Semi-Amplitude (K):** Let's rearrange the simplified formula to solve for the period P.\n    *   K³ ≈ (2πG / P) * (m_p * sin(i))³ / M_s²\n    *   P ≈ (2πG * (m_p * sin(i))³) / (K³ * M_s²)\n\n8.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods (P₂ / P₁):** Now we can set up the ratio for the two systems.\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = [ (2πG * (m_p₂ * sin(i₂))³) / (K₂³ * M_s₂²) ] / [ (2πG * (m_p₁ * sin(i₁))³) / (K₁³ * M_s₁²) ]\n\n    We are given or have inferred the following:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: M_s₁ = M_s₂.\n    *   The planets have similar minimum masses: m_p₁ * sin(i₁) ≈ m_p₂ * sin(i₂).\n    *   The constant 2πG is the same for both.\n\n    Most of the terms cancel out:\n    *   P₂ / P₁ ≈ 1 / (K₂³ / K₁³)\n    *   P₂ / P₁ ≈ (K₁ / K₂)³\n\n9.  **Compute the Final Value:** Substitute the ratio of the semi-amplitudes into the equation.\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\n\nThis calculation can be done using a simple script.\n```python\n# The ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes is K1/K2 = 5/7.\nratio_K = 5/7\n\n# The ratio of the periods P2/P1 is related by (K1/K2)^3.\nratio_P = ratio_K**3\nprint(ratio_P)\n```\n> 실행 결과\n```\n0.3644314868804665\n```\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.364. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
