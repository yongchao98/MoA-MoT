    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the correct molecular formula.\n\n**1. Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum:**\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadening is caused by hydrogen bonding between molecules. While alcohols also show an O-H stretch, it is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid appears around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. This further supports the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the NMR spectrum unequivocally confirms the existence of an alkene functional group in the molecule.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum:**\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Mass of [COOH]⁺ = Mass(C) + Mass(O) + Mass(O) + Mass(H) ≈ 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    This fragmentation strongly reinforces the conclusion that the compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n**4. Determining the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\nThe combined spectral evidence indicates the presence of two key structural features that contribute to the degree of unsaturation:\n*   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid). This accounts for **one degree of unsaturation**.\n*   One C=C double bond (from the alkene). This accounts for a **second degree of unsaturation**.\nTherefore, the correct molecular formula must have a total Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 2.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Candidate Formulas:**\nWe can calculate the DoU for each option using the formula:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n(Oxygen atoms do not affect the DoU calculation).\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This formula has two oxygen atoms, which is required for a carboxylic acid. The DoU of 2 matches our deductions (one C=O and one C=C). **This is a perfect match.**\n\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O₂:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU is insufficient to account for both a carbonyl group and an alkene group.\n\n*   **C) C₆H₁₀O:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. While the DoU is correct, this formula only has one oxygen atom. A carboxylic acid requires two oxygen atoms.\n\n*   **D) C₆H₁₂O:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This formula has both an incorrect DoU and an insufficient number of oxygen atoms.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of all provided data, the only molecular formula that accommodates a carboxylic acid group, an alkene group, and the corresponding degree of unsaturation is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>"
