    "This problem deals with the probability of radioactive decay, which is a process that follows an exponential distribution. A key feature of this distribution is its \"memoryless\" property.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Modeling the Decay:**\n    The time `T` until a single atom decays is a random variable that follows an exponential distribution. The probability that the atom has *not* decayed by time `t` (i.e., it survives past `t`) is given by the survival function:\n    `P(T > t) = S(t) = e^(-λt)`\n    Here, `λ` is the decay constant, which is specific to the type of atom.\n\n2.  **Using the Given Information:**\n    We are told that the probability of the atom decaying within the first 100 minutes is 32%.\n    `P(T ≤ 100) = 0.32`\n    This means the probability of it *surviving* for 100 minutes is:\n    `P(T > 100) = 1 - P(T ≤ 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    Using our survival function from step 1, we can write:\n    `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`\n\n3.  **Formulating the Question:**\n    We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, *given* that it has already survived for 50 minutes. This is a conditional probability.\n    We are looking for: `P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50)` which is `P(T ≤ 200 | T > 50)`.\n\n4.  **Applying the Memoryless Property:**\n    The memoryless property of exponential decay states that the probability of decay in a future time interval is independent of how long the atom has already survived.\n    In mathematical terms: `P(T > t + s | T > t) = P(T > s)`.\n    This means the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay probability. The \"clock resets\".\n    Therefore, the probability of it decaying in the *next* 150 minutes is the same as the probability of a brand-new atom decaying in 150 minutes.\n    So, we need to calculate: `P(T ≤ 150)`.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Final Probability:**\n    The probability we want is `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - P(T > 150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`.\n    We can find this value using the information from step 2 (`e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`).\n    Let's manipulate the expression:\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    Now, substitute the known value:\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n    Finally, the probability of decay is:\n    `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\n    To get the numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The probability of survival for 100 minutes is 0.68.\n# We want to find the probability of decay within 150 minutes, which is 1 - (survival probability for 150 minutes).\n# Survival(150) = Survival(100)^1.5 = 0.68^1.5\n# Probability of decay = 1 - Survival(150)\n\nprob_decay = 1 - (0.68 ** 1.5)\nprint(prob_decay)\n```\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.4399, which rounds to 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem is about radioactive decay, which follows an exponential distribution. A key characteristic of this process is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of decay in a future interval is independent of how long the atom has already survived. The clock effectively resets at any given moment.\n\n1.  **Define the Survival Probability:** Let `P(t)` be the probability that the atom survives for a duration of `t`. This is given by the exponential decay formula `P(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n\n2.  **Use the Given Information:** We are told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n    *   Probability of decay in 100 min: `1 - P(100) = 0.32`\n    *   This means the probability of *survival* for 100 min is `P(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n    *   So, we have the relation: `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:** The question asks for the probability of decay in the *next* 150 minutes, given that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes. Because of the memoryless property, the fact that it survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant. The problem is equivalent to finding the probability that a new atom will decay within 150 minutes.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Probability:** We need to find the probability of decay within 150 minutes, which is `1 - P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`.\n    *   We can relate `e^(-λ * 150)` to our known value `e^(-λ * 100)`:\n        `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    *   Now, substitute the value from step 2:\n        `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The probability of survival for 150 minutes is `(0.68)^1.5`.\n    *   The probability of decay within 150 minutes is `1 - (0.68)^1.5`.\n    *   Using the provided calculation output: `1 - (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.439257`\n    *   Converting to a percentage, we get `43.9257%`, which is approximately 44%.\n\nTherefore, the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes is 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>"
