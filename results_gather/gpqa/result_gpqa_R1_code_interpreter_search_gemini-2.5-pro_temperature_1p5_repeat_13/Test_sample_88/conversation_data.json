    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the initial reaction to determine the structure of Product 1.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂). Adamantane has a rigid tetracyclic cage structure.\n*   **Reaction:** Heated with excess KOH at 240°C. These are harsh conditions, suggesting elimination or rearrangement reactions, which are normally difficult at bridgehead positions. Such reactions on adamantane derivatives often lead to skeletal rearrangements.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   **Formula:** The ¹H NMR shows 14 protons, the same as the starting material. The IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbonyl group (C=O), likely a ketone. This implies the incorporation of an oxygen atom and loss of 2 Br and 2 H atoms, which are replaced by the oxygen atom (e.g., C₁₀H₁₄Br₂ → C₁₀H₁₄O). The molecular formula is likely C₁₀H₁₄O.\n    *   **Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):** For C₁₀H₁₄O, DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (14/2) = 4.\n    *   **Spectroscopy:** The IR confirms a C=O group (1 DoU). The ¹H NMR shows a signal at 4.79 ppm (2H). This chemical shift is characteristic of vinylic protons on a C=C double bond. A 2H signal suggests the two protons are equivalent, implying symmetry. A C=C double bond accounts for another 1 DoU.\n    *   **Structure Deduction:** With 1 DoU from C=O and 1 DoU from C=C, the remaining 2 DoU must come from rings. This means Product 1 is a **bicyclic enone** (a molecule with two rings, a ketone, and an alkene). The adamantane cage (tetracyclic) must have undergone a ring-opening rearrangement/fragmentation.\n    *   The structure of Product 1 must be a symmetric bicyclic C₁₀ enone. Finding the exact structure is challenging and may not be necessary, but we have established its key features.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (a ketone) is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide (Al(O-iPr)₃).\n*   **Reagent Function:** This is the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which selectively reduces aldehydes and ketones to alcohols. The C=C double bond is unaffected.\n*   **Product 2 Structure:** The ketone group (C=O) in Product 1 is reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH). Product 2 is therefore a **bicyclic enol** (a molecule with two rings, an alcohol, and an alkene).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3 and analyze its NMR.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Reagent Function:** This is an ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup. It cleaves the C=C double bond and converts the carbons of the double bond into carbonyl groups (aldehydes or ketones). Since the workup is reductive (DMS), ozonides are converted to carbonyls without over-oxidation.\n*   **Key Insight for the final answer:** The final answer options are specific coupling patterns (triplet, pentet, etc.). The most direct way to obtain a **triplet** for an aldehyde proton is if it is adjacent to a methylene (-CH₂) group. Let's explore this possibility.\n    *   If the ozonolysis product (Product 3) contains a **-CH₂-CHO** moiety, the aldehyde proton (-CHO) would be split by the two adjacent protons of the -CH₂- group. According to the n+1 rule, its signal would be a **triplet** (n=2, so 2+1=3).\n    *   For ozonolysis to produce a -CH₂-CHO group, the alkene in Product 2 must have had the structure **=CH-CH₂-**.\n*   **Connecting back to Product 1:** This implies that the original C=C bond in Product 1 had a methylene group (-CH₂) adjacent to one of its vinylic carbons. For the two vinylic protons to be equivalent (as suggested by the 2H signal at 4.79 ppm), the alkene must have been symmetric, i.e., of the form **-CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂-** embedded within a cyclic system.\n    *   An example of such a system is cyclooctene, -(CH₂)₆-CH=CH-. Ozonolysis of cyclooctene yields OHC-(CH₂)₆-CHO. The aldehyde protons are at the end of the chain, adjacent to -CH₂- groups, so their ¹H NMR signal would be a triplet.\n*   **Putting it all together for this specific problem:** Let's assume the complex rearrangement from 1,3-dibromoadamantane leads to a bicyclic system where a symmetric C=C bond is flanked on both sides by -CH₂- groups. The reduction to Product 2 preserves this structure. Ozonolysis of Product 2 would cleave the C=C bond, opening a ring and creating two -CH₂-CHO termini.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion on the Coupling Pattern.**\n\n*   **Product 3 Structure:** The ozonolysis leads to a dialdehyde where each aldehyde group (-CHO) is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** The aldehyde protons are the most deshielded non-exchangeable protons in the molecule (typically δ = 9-10 ppm).\n*   **Coupling Pattern:** Each aldehyde proton is coupled to the two protons of the adjacent -CH₂- group. By the n+1 rule, the signal for these protons will be a triplet (n=2, 2+1=3).\n\nTherefore, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in Product 3 is a triplet.\n\n<<<B>>>"
