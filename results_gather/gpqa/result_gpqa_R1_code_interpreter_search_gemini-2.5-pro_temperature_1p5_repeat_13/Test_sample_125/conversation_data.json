    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in each HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with one stereocenter at carbon C5, which has the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. The carbonyl carbon (C3) is prochiral. The hydride ion can attack from either face of the carbonyl group, creating a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** The existing stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S). This leads to the formation of two products:\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are stereoisomers but not mirror images of each other. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Since the attack of the hydride is generally not stereospecific without a directing group, both diastereomers will be formed.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral and symmetric.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH4 will reduce both ketone groups at C2 and C4 to secondary alcohols. This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:** We need to consider all possible stereoisomers for a molecule with two stereocenters (C2 and C4).\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, making them an **enantiomeric pair**. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, these will be formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) form has an internal plane of symmetry (passing through C3), which makes it an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) form is identical to the (2R, 4S) form (just flipping the molecule upside down).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of **five** distinct chemical compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity).\n*   It **can** separate constitutional isomers (like the products from Reaction I and Reaction II, which have different molecular formulas C7H16O2 vs C5H12O2).\n*   It **can** separate diastereomers, as they have different physical properties.\n*   It **cannot** separate enantiomers, as they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I ((1) and (2)) have different properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II's products, the meso compound (3) is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair ((4) and (5)). Therefore, the meso compound will be separated from the pair. This gives **1 peak** for the meso compound.\n*   The enantiomers from Reaction II ((4) and (5)) cannot be separated and will elute together as a single peak. This gives **1 peak** for the racemic pair.\n*   Since the products of Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally very different, all these peaks will be distinct.\n\nTotal peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (meso diol) + 1 (racemic diol) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Predict the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\nHPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers. Assuming an effective chiral column, it should be able to resolve all structurally different molecules.\n*   The mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers ((1), (2), (3), (4), and (5)).\n*   A chiral column will separate the diastereomers ((1) vs (2); and (3) vs (4)/(5)).\n*   Crucially, a chiral column will also separate the enantiomeric pair ((4) vs (5)).\n*   Therefore, each of the five compounds in the mixture will produce a separate peak.\n\nTotal peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Summary**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nB) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nC) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\nD) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
