    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    In a conservative system, the total energy remains constant. For a relativistic particle moving in a potential field, the total energy $E_{total}$ is the sum of its relativistic energy (which includes rest energy and kinetic energy) and its potential energy $U(x)$.\n    The total energy is given by:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$\n    where:\n    *   $m$ is the rest mass of the particle.\n    *   $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   $v$ is the speed of the particle.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   $U(x)$ is the potential energy at position $x$.\n\n2.  **Determine the potential energy.**\n    The force is given by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. The potential energy $U(x)$ is the negative integral of the force with respect to displacement, assuming $U(0)=0$:\n    $U(x) = - \\int_0^x F(x') dx' = - \\int_0^x (-kx') dx' = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n3.  **Apply the conservation of energy at two key points in the oscillation.**\n    The total energy must be the same at every point in the particle's path. We will evaluate the total energy at the point of maximum amplitude and at the point of maximum speed.\n\n    *   **Point 1: Maximum Amplitude ($x=A$)**\n        At the maximum amplitude, the particle momentarily stops before changing direction.\n        *   Position: $x = A$\n        *   Speed: $v = 0$\n        *   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$\n        *   Potential energy: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n        The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = (1) \\cdot mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    *   **Point 2: Equilibrium Position ($x=0$)**\n        The particle reaches its maximum speed as it passes through the equilibrium position, where the potential energy is zero.\n        *   Position: $x = 0$\n        *   Speed: $v = v_{max}$\n        *   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n        *   Potential energy: $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$\n        The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n4.  **Equate the energies and solve for $v_{max}$.**\n    Since energy is conserved, the total energy at both points must be equal:\n    Energy at $x=A$ = Energy at $x=0$\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n    Now, we solve for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Next, we substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$ and solve for $v_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    To isolate $v_{max}$, we can first square both sides of the equation:\n    $\\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2$\n\n    Then, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Rearrange the terms to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n5.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The derived expression for $v_{max}$ is:\n    $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n    This matches option C exactly.\n\n    *   Option A is incorrect due to signs and a missing $c^2$.\n    *   Option B, $v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$, is the non-relativistic (classical) limit, obtained when total energy $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2$ is much smaller than the rest energy $mc^2$.\n    *   Option D is physically impossible as it would lead to $v_{max} > c$.\n\nTherefore, the correct expression for the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator is given by option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
