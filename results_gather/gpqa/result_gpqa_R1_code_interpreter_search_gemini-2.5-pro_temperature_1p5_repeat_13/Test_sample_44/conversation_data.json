    "This problem requires us to determine the energies of the three lowest states (ground state, first excited state, and second excited state) for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n### 1. Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nFirst, let's establish the energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L. The energy of the n-th level is given by:\n$E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\nwhere *n* = 1, 2, 3, ... is the principal quantum number.\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\nSo, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n$E_n = n^2 E$\n\nThe first few energy levels are:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n*   and so on.\n\n### 2. The Pauli Exclusion Principle\n\nThe particles are described as \"identical spin-1/2 particles,\" which means they are fermions. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state for a particle in this system is defined by its principal quantum number (n) and its spin magnetic quantum number ($m_s$). For a spin-1/2 particle, $m_s$ can be either +1/2 (spin up) or -1/2 (spin down).\n\nThis means that each spatial energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of **two** particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Total Energies of the System\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the individual particles. We need to find the configurations of the four particles that result in the three lowest possible total energies.\n\n#### a) Ground State Energy ($E_{GS}$)\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the energy levels starting from the lowest one, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle, until all four particles are placed.\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy 1E):** We can place 2 particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   **Level n=2 (Energy 4E):** We place the remaining 2 particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n\nTotal Ground State Energy = (Energy of 2 particles in n=1) + (Energy of 2 particles in n=2)\n$E_{GS} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = (2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n#### b) First Excited State Energy ($E_{1st}$)\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy above the ground state. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the next available unoccupied level.\n*   The ground state configuration has particles in n=1 and n=2.\n*   The highest occupied level is n=2. The lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n*   We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   The new configuration is: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, and 1 particle in n=3.\n\nTotal First Excited State Energy = (Energy of 2 particles in n=1) + (Energy of 1 particle in n=2) + (Energy of 1 particle in n=3)\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n#### c) Second Excited State Energy ($E_{2nd}$)\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next-lowest energy. We need to consider all possible low-energy excitations from the ground state and identify the one with the second-lowest excitation energy.\n\nLet's compare the energies of the next possible configurations:\n*   **Configuration 1 (First Excited State, calculated above):** Move one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Occupation: {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3}\n    *   Energy = 15E\n\n*   **Configuration 2:** Move one particle from a lower level, n=1, to the next available level, n=3.\n    *   Occupation: {1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}\n    *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$\n\n*   **Configuration 3:** Excite both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Occupation: {2 in n=1, 2 in n=3}\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$\n\nComparing the energies of these excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, ...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state) and the next lowest is 18E. Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n### Summary\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State Energy:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
