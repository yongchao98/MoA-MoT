    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture Shape:**\n    The problem describes an aperture in the shape of a regular N-sided polygon. The key information is that the number of sides, N, is infinitely large (N -> ∞). A regular polygon with an infinite number of sides converges to a circle.\n\n2.  **Determine the Radius of the Circular Aperture:**\n    The problem states that all apothems have the same length 'a'. The apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. As N approaches infinity, the polygon's sides become infinitesimally small, and the polygon becomes indistinguishable from its inscribed and circumscribed circles. The apothem 'a' becomes the radius of this limiting circle. Therefore, we are dealing with a circular aperture of radius R = a.\n\n3.  **Identify the Physical Phenomenon:**\n    When monochromatic light passes through an aperture and is observed in the \"far field region,\" the phenomenon is Fraunhofer diffraction. The diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern.\n\n4.  **Locate the Minima in the Airy Pattern:**\n    The intensity distribution of an Airy pattern is described using the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x). The intensity I(θ) at an angle θ from the central axis is given by:\n    I(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) / (k * a * sin(θ))]²\n    where:\n    *   I₀ is the intensity at the center (θ = 0).\n    *   k is the wave number, k = 2π/λ.\n    *   'a' is the radius of the circular aperture.\n    *   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n\n    The intensity minima (dark rings) occur when the numerator is zero, i.e., J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) = 0, but the argument itself is not zero (which would be the central maximum).\n\n5.  **Use the Zeros of the Bessel Function:**\n    The minima correspond to the zeros of the Bessel function J₁(x). Let xₘ denote the m-th positive zero of J₁(x). The condition for the m-th minimum is:\n    k * a * sin(θₘ) = xₘ\n    Substituting k = 2π/λ, we get:\n    (2π/λ) * a * sin(θₘ) = xₘ\n\n6.  **Apply the Small Angle Approximation:**\n    The problem states that we can assume the angles are small, so sin(θ) ≈ θ. The condition for the m-th minimum becomes:\n    (2π/λ) * a * θₘ = xₘ\n    Solving for the angular position θₘ:\n    θₘ = xₘ * (λ / (2π * a))\n\n7.  **Calculate the Angular Positions of the First Two Minima:**\n    We need the first two positive zeros of the J₁(x) function. These are well-known values:\n    *   First zero, x₁ ≈ 3.8317\n    *   Second zero, x₂ ≈ 7.0156\n\n    Now, we find the angular positions of the first and second minima (θ₁ and θ₂):\n    *   θ₁ = x₁ * (λ / (2π * a)) ≈ 3.8317 / (2π) * (λ/a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ/a)\n    *   θ₂ = x₂ * (λ / (2π * a)) ≈ 7.0156 / (2π) * (λ/a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ/a)\n\n8.  **Calculate the Angular Distance:**\n    The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\n    Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (x₂ - x₁) * (λ / (2π * a))\n    Δθ = (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π) * (λ/a)\n    Δθ = 3.1839 / (2π) * (λ/a)\n\n    To get the numerical coefficient, we compute 3.1839 / (2π). I will use a python script for better precision.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# First two positive zeros of the Bessel function J1(x)\nx1 = 3.83170597\nx2 = 7.01558667\n\n# The angular distance is delta_theta = coefficient * (lambda / a)\n# The coefficient is (x2 - x1) / (2 * pi)\ncoefficient = (x2 - x1) / (2 * np.pi)\n\nprint(f\"{coefficient=}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\ncoefficient=0.5067810330419266\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculation shows the coefficient to be approximately 0.5068.\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated angular distance is Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ/a).\n    Let's compare this with the given options:\n    A) 0.500 λ / a\n    B) 1.220 λ /a\n    C) 0.506 λ / a\n    D) 0.610 λ / a\n\n    The calculated value 0.5068 λ/a is closest to option C. Note that option D, 0.610 λ/a, corresponds to the position of the *first* minimum (θ₁), not the distance between the first and second minima.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture Shape**: The problem describes an aperture in the shape of a regular N-sided polygon.

The apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. As N → ∞, the apothem becomes equal to the radius of the limiting circle. Therefore, we are dealing with a circular aperture of radius R = a.\n\n3.  **Identify the Physical Phenomenon**: The problem describes the formation of intensity maxima and minima in the far-field region after monochromatic light passes through the aperture. This phenomenon is known as Fraunhofer diffraction. For a circular aperture, the resulting pattern is called an Airy pattern, consisting of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings.\n\n4.  **Locate the Minima in the Airy Pattern**: The intensity distribution I(θ) of an Airy pattern at a viewing angle θ is given by:\n    I(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) / (k * a * sin(θ))]²\n    where:\n    *   I₀ is the intensity at the center.\n    *   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n    *   `k` is the wave number, defined as k = 2π/λ.\n    *   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n    *   J₁(x) is the first-order Bessel function of the first kind.\n\n    The intensity minima (dark rings) occur when the numerator is zero, which means J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) = 0, for non-zero arguments. The values of the argument `x` for which J₁(x) = 0 are called the zeros of the Bessel function.\n\n5.  **Use the Zeros of the Bessel Function**: Let xₘ be the m-th positive zero of J₁(x). The condition for the m-th minimum is:\n    k * a * sin(θₘ) = xₘ\n    Substituting k = 2π/λ:\n    (2π/λ) * a * sin(θₘ) = xₘ\n\n6.  **Apply the Small Angle Approximation**: The problem allows for the small angle approximation, so sin(θ) ≈ θ. The condition for the m-th minimum becomes:\n    (2π/λ) * a * θₘ = xₘ\n    Solving for the angular position θₘ of the m-th minimum:\n    θₘ = xₘ * (λ / (2π * a))\n\n7.  **Calculate the Angular Positions of the First Two Minima**: We need the first two positive zeros of the J₁(x) function. These are well-established mathematical constants:\n    *   First zero, x₁ ≈ 3.8317\n    *   Second zero, x₂ ≈ 7.0156\n\n    Now, we find the angular positions of the first minimum (θ₁) and the second minimum (θ₂):\n    *   θ₁ = x₁ * (λ / (2π * a)) ≈ (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ/a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ/a)\n    *   θ₂ = x₂ * (λ / (2π * a)) ≈ (7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ/a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ/a)\n\n    *Self-check*: The angular position of the first minimum, ≈ 0.610 λ/a, corresponds to option D. This is a common value related to the Airy disk but is not the answer to the question asked.\n\n8.  **Calculate the Angular Distance**: The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\n    Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (x₂ * (λ / (2π * a))) - (x₁ * (λ / (2π * a)))\n    Δθ = (x₂ - x₁) * (λ / (2π * a))\n    Substituting the values for the zeros:\n    Δθ = (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π) * (λ/a)\n    Δθ = 3.1839 / (2π) * (λ/a)\n\n9.  **Compute the Final Coefficient**:\n    Δθ ≈ (3.1839 / 6.2832) * (λ/a)\n    Δθ ≈ 0.50678 * (λ/a)\n\n10. **Compare with Options**: The calculated angular distance is approximately 0.5068 * (λ/a). Let's compare this with the given options:\n    A) 0.500 λ / a\n    B) 1.220 λ /a\n    C) 0.506 λ / a\n    D) 0.610 λ / a\n\n    The calculated coefficient 0.5068 is extremely close to the value in option C, 0.506. The minor difference can be attributed to the precision of the constants used. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
