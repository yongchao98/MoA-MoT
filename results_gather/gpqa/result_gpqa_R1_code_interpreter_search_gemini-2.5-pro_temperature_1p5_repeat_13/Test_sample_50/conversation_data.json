    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem and Choosing the Right Method\n\nThe problem asks for the potential energy of a system consisting of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere. A \"grounded\" sphere has its electric potential maintained at zero (V=0).\n\nThe presence of the charge `q` will induce a distribution of charge on the surface of the conducting sphere. The total potential energy is the work done to assemble this configuration. Specifically, it's the work done to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance to a distance `d` from the center of the grounded sphere.\n\nThe most effective way to solve this electrostatic problem is the **method of images**. This method simplifies the problem by replacing the conducting sphere and its complex induced surface charge with a single, imaginary \"image charge\" inside the sphere. The value and position of this image charge are chosen to satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero.\n\n### 2. Finding the Image Charge and its Position\n\nLet:\n*   `R` be the radius of the sphere.\n*   The center of the sphere be the origin (0, 0, 0).\n*   The real charge `q` be placed on the z-axis at a distance `d` from the center (i.e., at `z = d`).\n*   The image charge, `q'`, be placed at a distance `b` from the center along the same axis (at `z = b`), where `b < R`.\n\nThe potential at any point on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) must be zero. The total potential is the sum of the potential from the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n`V(surface) = V_q + V_{q'} = 0`\n`k * q / (distance from q) + k * q' / (distance from q') = 0`\n\nBy solving this equation for all points on the surface, we can find the unique values for `q'` and `b`. The standard result from the method of images for a grounded sphere is:\n\n*   **Position of the image charge:** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of the image charge:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\nSo, the complex system of the charge `q` and the grounded sphere can be replaced by a much simpler system of two point charges: `q` at `z=d` and `q'` at `z=b`, for calculating the field and potential *outside* the sphere.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at `d`. This work is done against the force exerted on `q` by the induced charges on the sphere. In our image model, this is the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\nThe potential energy `U` of the charge `q` in the potential created by the induced charge (`V_induced`) is given by:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nA factor of 1/2 is essential here. The potential `V_induced` is not a fixed external potential; it is created by the presence of `q` itself. As `q` is brought from infinity, the induced charge on the sphere builds up from zero. The work done is `W = ∫ F⋅dl`. The force `F` on `q` due to the induced charge is proportional to `q`. The induced charge itself is also proportional to `q`. Therefore, the force is proportional to `q^2`, and the potential energy, which is the integral of this force, is also proportional to `q^2`. A detailed derivation shows the work done is `(1/2)QV`, not just `QV`.\n\nNow, we calculate `V_induced` at the location of charge `q`. In the method of images, this is simply the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the position `d`.\n\n*   The image charge `q'` is at `b = R^2/d`.\n*   The real charge `q` is at `d`.\n*   The distance between them is `d - b = d - R^2/d`.\n\nThe potential at `d` due to `q'` is:\n`V_induced = V_{q'} = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\nSubstitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n`V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n`d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\nSubstitute this back into the potential expression:\n`V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n`V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, substitute this potential back into the energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n`U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 4. Comparing with Options\n\nLet's check the given options:\nA) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) - Incorrect.\nB) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) - **This matches our result.**\nC) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect.\nD) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect.\n\nThe correct expression for the net potential energy of the system is given by option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
