    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine**\nThis reaction is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. In the presence of an acid or base catalyst (or upon initiation by light/heat), cyclohexanone will be brominated at the alpha-position (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclohexanone and Bromine (Br₂).\n*   **Product 1:** 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide**\nThis reaction involves an α-halo ketone with a strong base (NaOH). Two major pathways are possible: E2 elimination or a Favorskii rearrangement.\n*   **E2 Elimination:** Would lead to 2-cyclohexen-1-one.\n*   **Favorskii Rearrangement:** Occurs when there is a proton on the other α-carbon (α'-position). 2-bromocyclohexanone has protons at C-6. The base abstracts a proton from C-6 to form an enolate, which then undergoes intramolecular Sₙ2 displacement of the bromide to form a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. Nucleophilic attack by hydroxide on the carbonyl carbon, followed by ring-opening of the strained three-membered ring, leads to the formation of a carboxylate with a five-membered ring. After acidification (during workup), the final product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\nTo decide which pathway occurs, we look at the next step.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\nThis reagent mixture is standard for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. It does not typically react with α,β-unsaturated ketones like 2-cyclohexen-1-one. Therefore, the reaction in Step 2 must have been the Favorskii rearrangement.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2).\n*   **Reaction:** Conversion of the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to an acid chloride group (-COCl).\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\nThis reagent is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is well-known for selectively reducing acid chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at the aldehyde stage and preventing over-reduction to the corresponding primary alcohol.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3).\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the acid chloride group (-COCl) to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The carbon atom of the ring to which the aldehyde group is attached (C1) is bonded to four different groups: the CHO group, a hydrogen atom, the C2 carbon of the ring, and the C5 carbon of the ring. Therefore, C1 is a chiral center.\n*   **Symmetry:** Because the molecule possesses a chiral center, it is a chiral molecule. It lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. The point group of the molecule is C₁.\n*   **Chemical Equivalence:** In a molecule with no symmetry (a C₁ point group), no two atoms are chemically equivalent, unless they can be interconverted by a rapid conformational process like free rotation (e.g., the three hydrogens of a methyl group). In this molecule, there are no such groups.\n\nLet's count all the hydrogen atoms in the structure:\n1.  **Aldehyde hydrogen:** One H atom attached to the carbonyl carbon. It is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **C1 hydrogen:** One H atom on the chiral center (C1). It is unique. (1 type)\n3.  **C2 hydrogens:** Two H atoms on the C2 carbon. These two are diastereotopic because of the chiral center at C1. They are chemically distinct from each other and from all other hydrogens. (2 types)\n4.  **C3 hydrogens:** Two H atoms on the C3 carbon. These are also diastereotopic. (2 types)\n5.  **C4 hydrogens:** Two H atoms on the C4 carbon. These are also diastereotopic. (2 types)\n6.  **C5 hydrogens:** Two H atoms on the C5 carbon. These are also diastereotopic. Furthermore, because C2 and C5 are diastereotopically related with respect to the chiral center C1, the hydrogens on C5 are chemically distinct from those on C2. (2 types)\n\nCounting the number of distinct types:\n1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (on C2) + 2 (on C3) + 2 (on C4) + 2 (on C5) = **10** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\nEach of the ten hydrogen atoms in a single enantiomer of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde is in a unique chemical environment. The 1H NMR spectrum of the racemic mixture would therefore be expected to show 10 distinct signals (although some may overlap accidentally in a real spectrum).\n\nFinal answer is 10.\n\n<<<A>>>"
