    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let's determine its empirical and molecular formula.\n    The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by:\n    Mass Fraction (H) = (Total mass of H) / (Total molecular mass)\n    14.28% is very close to 1/7 or ~0.142857.\n    Let's test the general formulas for hydrocarbons:\n    *   For an alkane (CnH2n+2), the mass fraction of H is (2n + 2) / (12n + 2n + 2) = (2n + 2) / (14n + 2). Setting this to 1/7 gives 14n + 14 = 14n + 2, which is impossible.\n    *   For an alkene or cycloalkane (CnH2n), the mass fraction of H is 2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 2/14 = 1/7. This matches the given value perfectly.\n    *   So, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n    The problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent and does not react further with hydrogen, implying it is a stable, saturated compound. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common solvent and is a stable cycloalkane. This fits the description.\n    Therefore, **Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Characterize Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them C and D.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y. So, let **C = cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means both C and D must be saturated or aromatic compounds (which do not react with aqueous bromine under normal conditions). Cyclohexane is saturated.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means hydrogenation of C gives cyclohexane (which is trivial) and hydrogenation of D must also give cyclohexane.\n    *   We need to find a liquid D that does not decolorize bromine water and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. The most logical candidate, especially in the context of a disproportionation reaction involving a C6 ring, is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene is a liquid, does not decolorize bromine water, and its complete hydrogenation product is cyclohexane.\n    *   Therefore, **Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction: Mixture X → Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n    *   The reaction is described as a disproportionation. In this context, it refers to a catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction where one component is reduced (gains hydrogen) and the other is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n    *   The reaction is: `Mixture X (A + B) --(Pt, heat)--> Mixture Y (C + D)`\n    *   Substituting the components of Y, we get: `A + B → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`\n    *   Since X and Y are both equimolar mixtures, the reaction stoichiometry must be 1:1, meaning one molecule of A reacts with one molecule of B to produce one molecule of cyclohexane and one molecule of benzene.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**\n    *   According to the principle of conservation of atoms, the total number of each type of atom must be the same on both sides of the reaction.\n    *   The problem implies that all compounds (A, B, C, D, and Z) share the same carbon skeleton, as they all yield Z upon hydrogenation. Since Z is cyclohexane (a C6 ring), A and B must also be C6 compounds.\n    *   Let's balance the hydrogen atoms for the reaction `A + B → C6H12 + C6H6`:\n    *   (Number of H atoms in A) + (Number of H atoms in B) = (Number of H atoms in C6H12) + (Number of H atoms in C6H6)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (i.e., in one molecule of compound A and one molecule of compound B) is 18.\n\n6.  **Verification (Optional but Recommended)**\n    Can we find plausible compounds A and B?\n    *   We need H(A) + H(B) = 18.\n    *   A and B must be C6 unsaturated compounds that decolorize bromine water.\n    *   A and B must not have conjugated double bonds.\n    *   In the reaction A + B → C6H12 + C6H6, one compound gets reduced and one gets oxidized. This is a transfer of hydrogen atoms. Let's say B is reduced and A is oxidized.\n    *   B + nH → C6H12 (Reduction)\n    *   A - nH → C6H6 (Oxidation)\n    *   A logical candidate for B is **cyclohexene (C6H10)**. It gets reduced to cyclohexane by gaining 2 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   A logical candidate for A is a **cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**. It gets oxidized to benzene by losing 2 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Let's check the number of hydrogen atoms: 10 (from cyclohexene) + 8 (from cyclohexadiene) = 18. This matches our calculation.\n    *   The condition that there are no conjugated bonds means that the cyclohexadiene must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**, not the conjugated 1,3-isomer.\n    *   So, a possible composition for Mixture X is an equimolar mix of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) and cyclohexene (C6H10). This fits all the conditions described in the problem.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which we have determined to be 18.\n\n<<<B>>>"
