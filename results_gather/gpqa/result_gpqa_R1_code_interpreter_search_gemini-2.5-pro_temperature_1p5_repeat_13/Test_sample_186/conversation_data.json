From a latitude of 24.6° S, Polaris is permanently below the horizon and is therefore **impossible to observe**.\n*   **c), d), e), f) Stars with DEC = 0°:** These stars are located on the celestial equator. The celestial equator is visible from almost anywhere on Earth, including Paranal.\n\nTherefore, we can immediately conclude that **Polaris (b) is not detectable** by this instrument, as it is not visible from the observatory.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Apparent Magnitude (m_V) for Each Observable Star**\n\nNow we assess the remaining stars to see if they are brighter than the m_V = 20 limit.\n\n**a) Canopus**\nThe provided information confirms that Canopus has an apparent magnitude of **-0.74**. Since -0.74 is much less than 20, **Canopus is detectable.**\n\n**c), d), e), f) Stars with Absolute Magnitude M_V = 15**\nWe use the distance modulus formula, which relates apparent magnitude (m_V), absolute magnitude (M_V), and distance in parsecs (d):\n`m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5`\n\nWith M_V = 15, the formula becomes `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(d) - 5 = 10 + 5 * log10(d)`.\n\nLet's run the calculation for each star:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_apparent_magnitude(absolute_magnitude, distance_pc):\n    \"\"\"Calculates apparent magnitude given absolute magnitude and distance in parsecs.\"\"\"\n    m_V = absolute_magnitude + 5 * math.log10(distance_pc) - 5\n    return m_V\n\n# Given Absolute Magnitude\nM_V = 15\n\n# Distances for stars c, d, e, f\ndistances = {\n    'c': 10,\n    'd': 200,\n    'e': 5,\n    'f': 50\n}\n\n# ESPRESSO limiting magnitude\nlimit_mag = 20\n\n# Print results\nprint(\"Results for stars c, d, e, f:\")\nfor star_id, dist in distances.items():\n    m_V = calculate_apparent_magnitude(M_V, dist)\n    is_detectable = \"Yes\" if m_V <= limit_mag else \"No\"\n    print(f\"Star {star_id} (distance = {dist} pc): Apparent Magnitude m_V = {m_V:.2f}. Detectable: {is_detectable}\")\n\n```\n<execution_result>\nResults for stars c, d, e, f:\nStar c (distance = 10 pc): Apparent Magnitude m_V = 15.00. Detectable: Yes\nStar d (distance = 200 pc): Apparent Magnitude m_V = 21.51. Detectable: No\nStar e (distance = 5 pc): Apparent Magnitude m_V = 13.50. Detectable: Yes\nStar f (distance = 50 pc): Apparent Magnitude m_V = 18.50. Detectable: Yes\n</execution_result>\nThe results are:\n*   **c) Star at 10 pc:** m_V = 15.00. Since 15.00 ≤ 20, **it is detectable.**\n*   **d) Star at 200 pc:** m_V = 21.51. Since 21.51 > 20, **it is not detectable.**\n*   **e) Star at 5 pc:** m_V = 13.50. Since 13.50 ≤ 20, **it is detectable.**\n*   **f) Star at 50 pc:** m_V = 18.50. Since 18.50 ≤ 20, **it is detectable.**\n\n### **Step 4: Final Count**\n\nLet's tally the detectable stars:\n*   a) Canopus: **Yes**\n*   b) Polaris: **No** (not visible)\n*   c) Star at 10 pc: **Yes**\n*   d) Star at 200 pc: **No** (too faint)\n*   e) Star at 5 pc: **Yes**\n*   f) Star at 50 pc: **Yes**\n\nA total of **4** stars from the list are detectable.\n\n<<<D>>>"
