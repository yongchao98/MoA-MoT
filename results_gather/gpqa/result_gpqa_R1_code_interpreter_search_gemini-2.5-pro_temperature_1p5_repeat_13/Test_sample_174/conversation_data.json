    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Radiation Source**\n\nThe problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution\" that is \"spheroid in shape\" with a \"symmetry axis along z-axis\". This setup implies an oscillation along a specific direction (the z-axis). In electromagnetism, the simplest and most dominant form of radiation from a localized oscillating charge distribution is electric dipole radiation.\n\n*   An oscillation of charge along the z-axis creates an oscillating electric dipole moment, **p**, aligned with the z-axis. We can write it as **p**(t) = p₀cos(ωt) **ẑ**, where p₀ is the amplitude of the dipole moment and ω is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n*   Higher-order multipole radiations (like electric quadrupole) are also possible but are generally much weaker than dipole radiation unless the dipole moment is zero due to some symmetry. The problem description strongly suggests a non-zero dipole moment as the primary source. Therefore, we model the source as an oscillating electric dipole.\n\n### **2. Recall the Formula for Electric Dipole Radiation**\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) from an oscillating electric dipole is given by the formula:\n\ndP/dΩ = (p₀²ω⁴ / (32π²ε₀c³)) * sin²(θ)\n\nWhere:\n*   `p₀` is the amplitude of the dipole moment.\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n*   `ε₀` is the permittivity of free space.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n*   `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of the dipole (the z-axis in this case).\n\nThe problem states that the radiated power per unit solid angle is a function `f(λ, θ)`. So, `f(λ, θ) = dP/dΩ`.\n\n### **3. Determine the Angular Dependence and the Fraction of Power**\n\nThe angular dependence of the radiated power is given by the `sin²(θ)` term.\n\n*   `f(λ, θ) ∝ sin²(θ)`\n\nThe maximum radiated power, `A`, occurs when `sin²(θ)` is at its maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which happens at `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n\n*   `A = f_max ∝ sin²(90°) = 1`\n\nWe need to find the fraction of `A` that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. Let's calculate the power at this angle, `f(λ, 30°)`.\n\n*   `f(λ, 30°) ∝ sin²(30°)`\n\nWe know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`. Therefore:\n\n*   `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`\n\nThe fraction of the maximum power `A` is the ratio of the power at 30° to the maximum power:\n\n*   Fraction = `f(λ, 30°) / A = sin²(30°) / sin²(90°) = (1/4) / 1 = 1/4`\n\nSo, the first part of the answer is **1/4**.\n\n### **4. Determine the Wavelength Dependence**\n\nNow, we need to find the dependence of the function `f` on the wavelength `λ`. Let's look at the full formula for `f` again:\n\n*   `f(λ, θ) = (p₀²ω⁴ / (32π²ε₀c³)) * sin²(θ)`\n\nThe terms `p₀`, `ε₀`, and `c` are constants. The power depends on `ω⁴`. The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by the expression:\n\n*   `ω = 2πν = 2πc/λ`\n\nSubstituting this into the proportionality for power:\n\n*   `f ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (2πc/λ)⁴ ∝ 1/λ⁴`\n\nSo, the radiated power per unit solid angle is proportional to `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n*   `f(λ, θ) ∝ λ⁻⁴ sin²(θ)`\n\nThis means a possible form for `f` includes a **`λ⁻⁴`** term. This dependence is a hallmark of dipole radiation, also famously seen in Rayleigh scattering.\n\n### **5. Combine the Results**\n\n1.  The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n2.  A possible form for the power function `f` has a dependence of **`λ⁻⁴`**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) 1/4, λ⁻³\n*   B) 3/4, λ⁻⁶\n*   C) 1/4, λ⁻⁴\n*   D) 1/2, λ⁻⁴\n\nOption C matches both of our findings.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Part 1: Calculate the power fraction ---\n\n# The radiated power per unit solid angle is proportional to sin^2(theta).\n# P(theta) = k * sin^2(theta)\n# The maximum power A occurs at theta = 90 degrees.\n# A = P(90) = k * sin^2(90) = k * 1^2 = k\n# The power at theta = 30 degrees is:\n# P(30) = k * sin^2(30)\n# The fraction of A is P(30) / A = (k * sin^2(30)) / k = sin^2(30).\n\n# Angle in degrees\ntheta_deg = 30\n\n# Convert angle to radians for Python's math functions\ntheta_rad = math.radians(theta_deg)\n\n# Calculate sin^2(30)\nfraction = math.sin(theta_rad)**2\n\nprint(f\"The fraction of maximum power at 30 degrees is: {fraction}\")\n\n# --- Part 2: Determine the wavelength dependence ---\n\n# The power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency (omega^4).\n# P ~ omega^4\n# The angular frequency is related to wavelength (lambda) by omega = 2 * pi * c / lambda, where c is the speed of light.\n# So, P ~ (1/lambda)^4 = lambda^(-4).\n\nprint(\"The power dependence on wavelength is lambda^(-4).\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem describes an oscillating charge distribution that is spheroidal with its symmetry axis along the z-axis. This configuration implies that the charges are oscillating along the z-axis, creating an oscillating electric dipole moment **p**(t) along the z-axis. The radiation from such a source is predominantly electric dipole radiation.\n\n### **Part 1: Angular Dependence and Power Fraction**\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) for an oscillating electric dipole is given by the formula:\n\n`dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere `θ` is the angle between the observation direction and the axis of the dipole (the z-axis in this case).\n\nThe problem states that `f(λ, θ)` is the radiated power per unit solid angle. Thus, we have:\n\n`f(λ, θ) ∝ sin²(θ)`\n\nThe maximum radiated power, denoted by `A`, occurs where `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (in the xy-plane, perpendicular to the oscillation).\n\nSo, `A` corresponds to the value of the function when `sin²(θ) = 1`.\n`A ∝ 1`\n\nWe need to find the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. Let's calculate the value of the proportionality factor `sin²(θ)` for this angle:\n\n`sin(30°) = 1/2`\n`sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`\n\nThe power radiated at 30° is proportional to 1/4. The fraction of the maximum power `A` is the ratio of the power at 30° to the maximum power:\n\nFraction = (Power at 30°) / (Maximum Power) = `sin²(30°) / sin²(90°) = (1/4) / 1 = 1/4`\n\nSo, the first part of the answer is **1/4**.\n\n### **Part 2: Wavelength Dependence**\n\nThe full expression for the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle from an oscillating electric dipole is:\n\n`dP/dΩ = (p₀²ω⁴ / (32π²ε₀c³)) * sin²(θ)`\n\nHere, `ω` is the angular frequency of the oscillation. The power `f` is directly proportional to `ω⁴`:\n\n`f ∝ ω⁴`\n\nThe angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by the relation `ω = 2πν = 2πc/λ`, where `c` is the speed of light and `ν` is the frequency.\n\nSubstituting this into our proportionality:\n\n`f ∝ (2πc/λ)⁴`\n`f ∝ 1/λ⁴`\n`f ∝ λ⁻⁴`\n\nThis `λ⁻⁴` dependence is characteristic of radiation from an electric dipole (and is also the reason for Rayleigh scattering, which explains why the sky is blue).\n\nTherefore, a possible form for the function `f` is proportional to `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nCombining the two results:\n1.  The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n2.  A possible form for the function `f` has a wavelength dependence of **`λ⁻⁴`**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
