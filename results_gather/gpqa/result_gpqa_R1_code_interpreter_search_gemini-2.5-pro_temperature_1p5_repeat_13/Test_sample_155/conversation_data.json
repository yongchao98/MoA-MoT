    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the stereochemical outcome of two reactions and a subsequent understanding of how the resulting mixture of isomers will be analyzed by both achiral and chiral chromatography.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2      H\n                   \\   /\n                    C=C\n                   /   \\\n                  H     CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction on the alkene. The addition of the oxygen atom is a *syn*-addition, meaning it adds to the same face of the double bond. The epoxidation of a *trans*-alkene results in a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is achiral, the attack from the top face and bottom face are equally likely, producing a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** This reagent opens the epoxide ring via an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. The mechanism involves protonation of the epoxide oxygen, followed by a backside attack of a water molecule (nucleophile) on one of the epoxide carbons. This ring-opening is an *anti*-addition.\n\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step process (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed ring opening) is equivalent to an *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** A well-established rule in stereochemistry is that the *anti*-dihydroxylation of a *trans*-alkene results in a *meso*-compound.\n    *   Let's verify: Opening the (4R,5R)-epoxide via backside attack at either C4 or C5 results in the (4R,5S)-diol, which is a *meso*-compound due to an internal center of symmetry. Opening its enantiomer, the (4S,5S)-epoxide, also yields the same (4R,5S)-meso-diol.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single product, the achiral **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2      CH2CH2CH3\n                   \\   /\n                    C=C\n                   /   \\\n                  H     H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** Same as Reaction 1 (mCPBA, then H3O+). This is again an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The *anti*-dihydroxylation of a *cis*-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n    *   Let's verify: Epoxidation of the *cis*-alkene produces a *cis*-epoxide, which is a *meso*-compound ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane). The subsequent *anti*-addition (ring-opening) to this *meso*-epoxide will produce two enantiomers. Attack at C4 (let's say it's R) gives the (4S,5S)-diol, while attack at C5 (S) gives the (4R,5R)-diol. These two products are enantiomers and are formed in equal amounts.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral column separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity) in an achiral environment.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, so they cannot be separated by an achiral column. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will elute together as a **single peak**.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and are separable on an achiral column. The meso-diol will have a different retention time from the enantiomeric pair. It will appear as a **separate peak**.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, will be separated into **two distinct peaks**.\n    *   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and will appear as its own **third peak**.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>"
