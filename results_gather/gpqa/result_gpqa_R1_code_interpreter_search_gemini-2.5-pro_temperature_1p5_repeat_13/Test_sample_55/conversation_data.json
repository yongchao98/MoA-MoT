    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The problem describes a two-step decay process of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|\\psi_i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|\\psi_f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$. The decay occurs via two sequential electric dipole (E1) transitions, which means there must be an intermediate state, $|\\psi_{int}\\rangle = |n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Determine the intermediate state using selection rules:** The selection rules for electric dipole transitions are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any non-zero integer. For decay (spontaneous emission), energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n    *   **First transition:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$\n        *   $l_{initial} = 0$. So, $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l'$ must be non-negative, we must have $l'=1$.\n        *   $m_{initial} = 0$. So, $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$, which means $m'$ can be $0, 1, -1$.\n        *   $n_{initial} = 3$. For decay, $n' < 3$. So $n'$ can be 1 or 2.\n\n    *   **Second transition:** $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   $l_{final} = 0$. We must have had $l' = 1$ for this transition to be allowed ($\\Delta l = 0-1 = -1$). This is consistent with the first transition.\n        *   $m_{final} = 0$. So, $\\Delta m = 0 - m' = 0, \\pm 1$, which implies $m'$ can be $0, 1, -1$. This is also consistent.\n        *   $n_{final} = 1$. For decay, $n' > 1$.\n\n    *   **Combining the conditions:** The intermediate state must have $l'=1$, $m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$, and $1 < n' < 3$. This uniquely determines $n'=2$. So, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$. The decay must proceed through one of these three paths:\n        *   Path 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Path 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Path 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n3.  **Calculate the probability for each path:** The question asks for \"the corresponding probability\". In the context of multiple decay paths, this refers to the branching ratio: the probability of the decay occurring via a specific path, relative to all other possible paths for this process.\n\n    *   The probability of a specific path is determined by the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n    *   The probability of path $m'$ is $P(m') = BR(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m') \\times BR(2,1,m' \\to 1,0,0)$.\n\n    *   **Branching ratio for the second step:** Consider the state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$. What are its possible E1 decay channels? The final state must have $l_{final} = 0$ or $l_{final} = 2$.\n        *   If $l_{final}=2$, then $n_{final} \\geq l_{final}+1=3$. Since decay requires $n_{final} < n'=2$, this is not possible.\n        *   If $l_{final}=0$, then $n_{final} \\geq l_{final}+1=1$. Decay requires $n_{final} < n'=2$, so the only possible final state is $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   Therefore, the decay from any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is the only possible E1 decay channel. This means the branching ratio for the second step is 1, regardless of $m'$.\n        *   $BR(2,1,m' \\to 1,0,0) = 1$ for $m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$.\n\n    *   **Branching ratio for the first step:** The probability of taking a specific path is now reduced to the branching ratio of the first step: $P(m') = BR(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m')$. The branching ratio is the ratio of the decay rate to the specific state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the total decay rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   $BR(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m') = \\frac{\\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m')}{\\sum_{m''=-1}^{1} \\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m'')}$\n        *   The decay rate $\\Gamma(i \\to f)$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f |e\\mathbf{r}| i \\rangle|^2$.\n        *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the transitions to the different magnetic substates $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ must be equally probable. The atom has an equal chance of emitting a photon with polarization corresponding to $\\Delta m = +1$, $\\Delta m = -1$, or $\\Delta m = 0$.\n        *   This can be confirmed by explicit calculation using the Wigner-Eckart theorem or by direct calculation of the matrix elements $\\langle 2,1,m'|x|3,0,0 \\rangle$, $\\langle 2,1,m'|y|3,0,0 \\rangle$, and $\\langle 2,1,m'|z|3,0,0 \\rangle$. The transition strength, summed over polarizations, is $|\\langle 2,1,m'|e\\mathbf{r}|3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$, which is found to be independent of $m'$.\n        *   Thus, $\\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,1) = \\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,0) = \\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,-1)$.\n\n    *   **Final Probability:** Since the three possible paths of the first step have equal rates, their branching ratios are equal. As there are three paths, each must have a probability of $1/3$.\n        *   $BR(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m') = 1/3$ for each $m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$.\n        *   The overall probability for the decay to proceed via the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is $P(m') = (1/3) \\times 1 = 1/3$.\n\n4.  **Match with options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect. Our calculation gives $1/3$.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$  and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect. Our calculation gives $1/3$.\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect. Our calculation gives $1/3$.\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. Both the transition route and the calculated probability match.\n\nThe transition route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n<<<D>>>"
