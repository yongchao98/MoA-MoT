    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of the Problem**\n\nThe problem presents two scenarios that produce a similar photometric signal (a dip in observed brightness):\n\n*   **Scenario 1: Rotational Modulation due to Starspots.** A star has one hemisphere covered with cool, dark spots. As the star rotates, this spotted hemisphere faces the observer, causing the total brightness to decrease. When the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer, the brightness is at its maximum. The difference between the maximum and minimum brightness is the amplitude of the signal.\n*   **Scenario 2: Exoplanet Transit.** A planet passes in front of its star from our point of view. The planet blocks a portion of the star's light, causing a temporary dip in brightness. The depth of this dip is the amplitude of the transit signal.\n\nThe goal is to find the size of a hypothetical planet (relative to its star) that would cause the same amplitude of brightness dip as the starspots.\n\n**2. Calculate the Brightness Variation due to Starspots**\n\nThe energy radiated per unit area by a star (its surface brightness) is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the flux (F) is proportional to the fourth power of the effective temperature (T):\nF ∝ T⁴\n\nWe need to compare the flux from the star when the unspotted hemisphere is visible (F_max) to when the spotted hemisphere is visible (F_min). Let's assume the \"filling factor\" (f) of 20% refers to the fraction of the star's visible disk that is covered by spots when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer.\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** When the clean hemisphere is facing us, the entire visible disk has a temperature of T_star. The flux is proportional to the star's surface brightness.\n    F_max ∝ T_star⁴\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, 20% of the disk area is covered by cooler spots (at T_spot), and the remaining 80% is at the star's normal temperature (T_star). The total flux is a weighted average.\n    F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴\n\nThe amplitude of the variation is the fractional drop in flux:\nAmplitude_spots = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n\nSubstituting the expressions for flux:\nAmplitude_spots = [T_star⁴ - ((1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴)] / T_star⁴\nAmplitude_spots = [T_star⁴ - T_star⁴ + f * T_star⁴ - f * T_spot⁴] / T_star⁴\nAmplitude_spots = [f * T_star⁴ - f * T_spot⁴] / T_star⁴\nAmplitude_spots = f * [1 - (T_spot⁴ / T_star⁴)]\nAmplitude_spots = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴]\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   Filling factor, f = 20% = 0.20\n*   Star's effective temperature, T_star = 6000 K\n*   Spot temperature difference, ΔT = 1000 K\n*   Spot temperature, T_spot = T_star - ΔT = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n\nAmplitude_spots = 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴]\nAmplitude_spots = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]\n\n**3. Calculate the Brightness Variation due to an Exoplanet Transit**\n\nThe amplitude of a transit signal (the transit depth) is the fraction of the star's light blocked by the planet. This is simply the ratio of the projected area of the planet to the projected area of the star.\nAmplitude_planet = (Area_planet / Area_star)\nAmplitude_planet = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)\nAmplitude_planet = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n**4. Equate the Amplitudes and Solve**\n\nThe problem states that the two signals have the same amplitude.\nAmplitude_planet = Amplitude_spots\n(R_pl / R_star)² = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴]\n\nNow we can solve for the relative radius, R_pl / R_star:\nR_pl / R_star = √[ f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴) ]\n\nLet's perform the final calculation using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given parameters\nf = 0.20  # Filling factor of spots\nT_star = 6000.0  # Star's effective temperature in K\nT_spot = 5000.0  # Spot temperature in K\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the signal due to rotational modulation of spots.\n# This is equivalent to the transit depth of the hypothetical planet.\namplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)**4)\n\n# The transit depth is also equal to (R_pl / R_star)^2.\n# Therefore, R_pl / R_star is the square root of the amplitude.\nrelative_radius = math.sqrt(amplitude)\n\nprint(f\"{relative_radius:.4f}\")\n```\n\nExecution of the code yields:\n```\n0.3218\n```\n\nThe calculated relative radius is approximately 0.3218. This value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Flux Drop from Starspots:** The brightness drop is caused by replacing a part of the star's hot surface with a cooler, spotted region. The energy radiated (flux) is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann Law: F ∝ T⁴).\n    *   Let the star's normal flux be proportional to T_star⁴.\n    *   Let the flux from the spots be proportional to T_spot⁴.\n    *   The star's temperature (T_star) is 6000 K.\n    *   The spots are 1000 K cooler, so their temperature (T_spot) is 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K.\n    *   When the spotted hemisphere is in view, 20% (or a fraction of 0.20) of the visible disk is covered by spots.\n\n    The fractional drop in flux (the amplitude of the signal) is calculated as:\n    Amplitude_spots = (Flux_unspotted - Flux_spotted) / Flux_unspotted\n    This simplifies to:\n    Amplitude_spots = filling_factor * [1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴]\n    Amplitude_spots = 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴]\n    Amplitude_spots = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]\n    Amplitude_spots = 0.20 * [1 - 0.48225]\n    Amplitude_spots ≈ 0.1035\n\n2.  **Calculate the Flux Drop from a Planet Transit:** When a planet transits, it blocks a portion of the star's light. The amount of light blocked (the amplitude of the signal) is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n    Amplitude_planet = (Area_planet) / (Area_star)\n    Amplitude_planet = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)\n    Amplitude_planet = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n3.  **Equate the two scenarios:** We want the planet transit to produce the same amplitude signal as the starspots.\n    Amplitude_planet = Amplitude_spots\n    (R_pl / R_star)² = 0.1035\n\n4.  **Solve for the relative radius (R_pl / R_star):**\n    R_pl / R_star = √0.1035\n    R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<A>>>"
