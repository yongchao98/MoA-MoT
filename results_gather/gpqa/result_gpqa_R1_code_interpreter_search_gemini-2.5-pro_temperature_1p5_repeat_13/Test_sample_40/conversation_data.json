    "This is a problem that requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula from Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:** We need to consider two inertial frames of reference.\n    *   **Frame S (Laboratory Frame):** This is the frame where the observer is at rest. The glass is observed to be moving with velocity `v`.\n    *   **Frame S' (Glass's Rest Frame):** This is the frame moving along with the glass. In this frame, the glass is at rest.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   **Velocity of the glass relative to the lab (v_glass_lab):** This is the velocity of frame S' relative to frame S. The problem gives this as `v`. So, `v_S'_S = v`.\n    *   **Velocity of light relative to the glass (v_light_glass):** This is the velocity of the light beam as measured in the S' frame. The speed of light in a medium with refractive index `n` is `c/n`. Since the problem states `c=1`, this velocity is `1/n`. We'll call this `u'`. So, `u' = 1/n`. The beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass is moving.\n    *   **Velocity of light relative to the lab (v_light_lab):** This is the velocity of the light beam as measured by the observer in the S frame. This is the quantity we need to find. We'll call this `u`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    When two velocities are in the same direction, the formula to transform a velocity `u'` from a moving frame S' (which moves at velocity `v` relative to frame S) to the stationary frame S is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Given Values:**\n    *   `u'` (velocity of light in the glass's frame) = `1/n`\n    *   `v` (velocity of the glass in the lab frame) = `v`\n    *   `c` (speed of light in vacuum) = `1`\n\n    Substituting these into the formula:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v / 1^2)`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To remove the fractions within the main fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (n*(1/n) + n*v) / (n*1 + n*(v/n))`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated speed `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)` matches the expression given in option D.\n\n    *   A) 1\n    *   B) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    *   C) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n    *   D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
