    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\nThe notation `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers:\n- `2S+1 = 1` => Total spin `S_i = 0`.\n- `L` is `S` => Orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n- `J` is `0` => Total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n\nThe parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i`.\n- `P_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\nThe problem also mentions the Pauli principle for two-nucleon states: `T + S + L` must be odd.\nFor the initial `1S0` state, `S_i=0` and `L_i=0`. For `T_i + 0 + 0` to be odd, the isospin of the initial state must be `T_i = 1`.\n\n### 2. Deconstruct the Decay Process\nThe decay process is `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`.\n- Particle X has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n- The final NN state is given to have isospin `T_f = 0`.\n- The lowercase letter `s, p, d, f` denotes the orbital angular momentum of the particle X relative to the final NN system. Let's call this `L_X`.\n    - `s`: `L_X = 0`\n    - `p`: `L_X = 1`\n    - `d`: `L_X = 2`\n    - `f`: `L_X = 3`\n- We assume the emitted particle X has no intrinsic spin (`s_X = 0`), which is a standard assumption in such problems unless stated otherwise. Its total angular momentum is therefore `j_X = L_X`.\n\n### 3. Identify the Conservation Laws and Rules\nTo determine if a transition is permitted, we must check it against conservation laws and given selection rules.\n\n**Rule 1: Angular Momentum Conservation**\nThe total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n- `vec(J_i) = vec(J_f) = vec(J_f_NN) + vec(j_X)`\n- Since `J_i = 0`, we must have `vec(J_f_NN) + vec(j_X) = 0`.\n- This implies the vectors must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, `J_f_NN = j_X`.\n- With our assumption `s_X = 0`, this becomes `J_f_NN = L_X`.\n\n**Rule 2: Parity Conservation**\nThe total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n- `P_i = P_f = P_f_NN * P_X_intrinsic * P_X_orbital`\n- The parity of a state with orbital angular momentum `L` is `(-1)^L`.\n- `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n- `P_f_NN = (-1)^L_f_NN`.\n- `P_X_intrinsic = -1` (given).\n- `P_X_orbital = (-1)^L_X`.\n- So, `+1 = (-1)^L_f_NN * (-1) * (-1)^L_X`.\n- `+1 = (-1)^(L_f_NN + L_X + 1)`.\n- This requires the exponent `L_f_NN + L_X + 1` to be an even number.\n- Therefore, `L_f_NN + L_X` must be an odd number.\n\n**Rule 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final State**\nThe problem explicitly states a rule for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\nIt is also given that the final NN state has `T_f = 0`.\n- Plugging `T_f = 0` into the rule: `0 = S_f_NN + L_f_NN + 1 (mod 2)`.\n- This means `S_f_NN + L_f_NN + 1` must be an even number.\n- Therefore, `S_f_NN + L_f_NN` must be an odd number.\n\nA transition is not permitted if it violates any of these three rules.\n\n### 4. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will check each option against the three rules we've established.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n- Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n- Particle X state `f`: `L_X=3`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = L_X`? => `3 = 3`. (✓)\n2.  **P Conservation:** `L_f + L_X` is odd? => `2 + 3 = 5`. (✓)\n3.  **Pauli Rule:** `S_f + L_f` is odd? => `1 + 2 = 3`. (✓)\n- This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n- Final NN state `7D1`: `2S+1=7` => `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n- Particle X state `p`: `L_X=1`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = L_X`? => `1 = 1`. (✓)\n2.  **P Conservation:** `L_f + L_X` is odd? => `2 + 1 = 3`. (✓)\n3.  **Pauli Rule:** `S_f + L_f` is odd? => `3 + 2 = 5`. (✓)\n- According to the three transition rules, this transition is **permitted**. (Note: A two-nucleon system cannot have S=3. This makes the final state physically impossible. However, the question asks to check the properties of the transition (partial wave), and the transition itself satisfies all the given rules. In such cases, one must focus on violations of the stated rules for the process.)\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n- Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n- Particle X state `p`: `L_X=1`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = L_X`? => `1 = 1`. (✓)\n2.  **P Conservation:** `L_f + L_X` is odd? => `0 + 1 = 1`. (✓)\n3.  **Pauli Rule:** `S_f + L_f` is odd? => `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓)\n- This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n- Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n- Particle X state `s`: `L_X=0`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = L_X`? => `0 = 0`. (✓)\n2.  **P Conservation:** `L_f + L_X` is odd? => `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓)\n3.  **Pauli Rule:** `S_f + L_f` is odd? => `1 + 1 = 2`. (✗)\n- The sum `S_f + L_f` is even, but the rule for a `T_f=0` final state requires it to be odd. This transition violates the Pauli statistics rule given in the problem.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nThe transition described in option D, `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`, is the only one that violates the selection rules provided in the problem statement. Specifically, it violates the Pauli principle requirement for the final two-nucleon state.\n\n<<<D>>>"
