    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical reaction:** The problem involves the dissociation of the calcium-EDTA complex ($[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$). The complex dissociates into calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ions ($EDTA^{4-}$). The equilibrium reaction is:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Relate the formation constant (K_f) to the dissociation constant (K_d):** The problem provides the formation constant ($K_{f}$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$) for the complex, which describes the formation reaction ($Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$). The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction. Therefore, the dissociation constant ($K_d$) is the reciprocal of the formation constant.\n    $K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n3.  **Set up the equilibrium expression:** The equilibrium expression for the dissociation reaction is:\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}$\n\n4.  **Use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine equilibrium concentrations:** We start with a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n|             | $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$ | $Ca^{2+}$ | $EDTA^{4-}$ |\n| :---------- | :------------------ | :-------- | :---------- |\n| **Initial** | 0.02 M              | 0 M       | 0 M         |\n| **Change**  | -x                  | +x        | +x          |\n| **Equilibrium** | 0.02 - x            | x         | x           |\n\n    The term \"ideal pH\" implies we don't need to consider the protonation of EDTA, and we can use the given formation constant directly.\n\n5.  **Solve for x:** Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the dissociation constant expression:\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)}$\n\n    Since $K_d$ is very small, the amount of dissociation (x) will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can simplify the denominator:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    The equation becomes:\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the value of x:**\n    $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times 0.02$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$\n\n    From the ICE table, $x = [Ca^{2+}]$. So, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches option B.\n\nTo verify the calculation with more precision, a simple python script can be used.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nK_f = 5e10  # Formation constant\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02  # Initial concentration of Ca-EDTA complex in M\n\n# The reaction is [Ca-EDTA]^2- <=> Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-\n# Kd = 1 / Kf\n# Kd = [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-] / [[Ca-EDTA]^2-]\n# Let x be the concentration of Ca^2+ at equilibrium.\n# Then [EDTA^4-] = x and [[Ca-EDTA]^2-] = initial_complex_conc - x\n# Since Kd is very small, we can approximate [[Ca-EDTA]^2-] as initial_complex_conc.\n# Kd = x^2 / initial_complex_conc\n# x^2 = Kd * initial_complex_conc\n# x = sqrt(Kd * initial_complex_conc)\n# x = sqrt((1/Kf) * initial_complex_conc)\n\nx = math.sqrt((1 / K_f) * initial_complex_conc)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n>>>\n6.32e-07\n\nThe calculation confirms that the concentration of calcium ions is $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, in a solution that initially contains 0.02 M of the calcium-EDTA complex, $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$.\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant chemical equilibrium:**\n    The complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions.
