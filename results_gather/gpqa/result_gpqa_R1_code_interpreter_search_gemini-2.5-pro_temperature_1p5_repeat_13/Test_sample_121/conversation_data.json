    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the reaction sequence and the structure of the final product (4).**\n\n1.  **Acetic acid + Br2, Pyridine, Acetic Anhydride -> Product 1:**\n    This is an alpha-bromination of a carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is brominated at the alpha-carbon.\n    *   **Product 1:** Br-CH2-COOH (2-bromoacetic acid)\n\n2.  **Product 1 + Ethanol (CH3CH2OH), H2SO4 -> Product 2:**\n    This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid is converted to an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Br-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3 (ethyl 2-bromoacetate)\n\n3.  **Product 2 + Sodium Cyanide (NaCN) -> Product 3:**\n    This is an SN2 reaction. The nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN-) displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** NC-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3 (ethyl 2-cyanoacetate)\n\n4.  **Product 3 + excess Sodium Hydride (NaH) + 1,5-dibromopentane -> Product 4:**\n    This is a two-step process involving alkylation and cyclization.\n    *   **a) Deprotonation:** Ethyl cyanoacetate has acidic protons on the alpha-carbon (the CH2 group). NaH, a strong base, removes one proton to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (an enolate).\n        `NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH -> [NC-CH-COOEt]- Na+ + H2`\n    *   **b) Alkylation:** The carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br) in an SN2 reaction.\n        `[NC-CH-COOEt]- + Br-(CH2)5-Br -> NC-CH( (CH2)5-Br )-COOEt`\n    *   **c) Cyclization:** The product of the first alkylation still has an acidic proton on the alpha-carbon. \"Excess NaH\" ensures this proton is also removed, creating a new carbanion. This carbanion then undergoes a rapid intramolecular SN2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromide ion. This cyclization is highly favored as it forms a stable 6-membered ring (a Thorpe-Ziegler reaction).\n    *   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOEt) group attached to the same carbon (C1). The structure is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the structure of Product 4 for symmetry.**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is:\n```\n      CN\n      |\n C1--(CO-O-CH2-CH3)\n/  \\\nCH2--CH2\n|    |\nCH2--CH2\n \\  /\n  CH2\n```\n*   Let's check for chirality. The C1 carbon is attached to four groups: -CN, -COOEt, and the cyclohexane ring via C2 and C6. To determine if C1 is a chiral center, we check if these four groups are different. The path from C1 through C2 back to C1 is identical to the path from C1 through C6 back to C1 (-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-). Therefore, the two ring connections are identical. C1 is not a chiral center, and the molecule is **achiral**.\n*   Due to rapid chair-flipping at room temperature, the molecule has an effective **plane of symmetry** that passes through the C1 and C4 atoms, as well as the CN and COOEt substituents.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.**\n\nWe must count the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons in the molecule, considering the effects of symmetry and diastereotopicity. The question specifies counting \"chemically distinct hydrogens,\" which implies a rigorous analysis.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH3) are equivalent. This is **1 signal**.\n    *   Since the overall molecule is achiral, the two protons of the methylene group (-O-CH2-) are enantiotopic. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent (isochronous). This is **1 signal**.\n    *   Total from the ethyl group: **2 signals**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    The plane of symmetry makes pairs of carbons (and their protons) equivalent: C2 is equivalent to C6, and C3 is equivalent to C5. C4 is unique as it lies on the plane.\n    However, within each CH2 group, the two protons are diastereotopic. This is because C1 has two different substituents (CN and COOEt), making the two faces of the ring non-equivalent. Diastereotopic protons are chemically distinct and should give separate signals.\n\n    *   **C2 and C6 protons:** The two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (let's call them H2a and H2b). The two protons on C6 are also diastereotopic (H6a, H6b). The plane of symmetry makes H2a equivalent to H6a, and H2b equivalent to H6b. But H2a and H2b are not equivalent to each other. Therefore, these four protons give rise to **2 signals**.\n    *   **C3 and C5 protons:** The same logic applies. The four protons at these positions are also divided into two sets of two equivalent protons. This gives another **2 signals**.\n    *   **C4 protons:** This carbon lies on the symmetry plane. However, its two protons are still diastereotopic with respect to the rest of the molecule. They are chemically distinct from each other. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n3.  **Total Count:**\n    *   From the ethyl group: 2 signals\n    *   From the C2/C6 ring positions: 2 signals\n    *   From the C3/C5 ring positions: 2 signals\n    *   From the C4 ring position: 2 signals\n    *   Total = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = **8 signals**.\n\nThus, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
