    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Element Y\nThe problem describes a series of reactions involving five binary fluorides of an element Y. A key piece of information is that substance A2, a fluoride of Y, has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n\nLet the formula of A2 be YFₙ (assuming a single atom of Y, which is common for simple binary compounds).\nThe formula for mass percentage is:\nɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\nWhere M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol and M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n\nRearranging for M(Y):\nM(Y) * 0.3196 = n * 19.00 * (1 - 0.3196)\nM(Y) = n * (19.00 * 0.6804 / 0.3196)\nM(Y) ≈ n * 40.45\n\nWe also know that some of these fluorides (A1, A3) are extremely strong oxidizing agents, capable of reacting with Xenon. This points to elements that can achieve very high oxidation states, such as the later actinides or some p-block/d-block elements. High oxidation states are common for fluorides. Let's test plausible integer values for n, the oxidation state of Y in A2.\n\n*   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 (Ca, Sc). Not known for such reactive fluorides.\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 (Br, Se). Selenium is a possibility.\n*   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 (Sb). Antimony forms SbF₃, SbF₅.\n*   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 (Dy, Tb). Lanthanides, can reach +4 state.\n*   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 (Au, Hg, Bi). Bismuth forms BiF₅.\n*   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7. This is very close to the molar masses of late actinides like Americium (Am, 243 g/mol) and Plutonium (Pu, 244 g/mol).\n\nActinides like Pu and Am are well-known for forming multiple, highly reactive fluorides, including hexafluorides (YF₆). This is a very strong match.\nLet's verify with Y = Americium (Am, M=243 g/mol) and A2 = AmF₆ (n=6).\nɷF(AmF₆) = (6 * 19) / (243 + 6 * 19) = 114 / 357 ≈ 0.3193 = 31.93%.\nThis is extremely close to the given 31.96%. Thus, it's highly probable that **Y is Americium (Am)** and **A2 is Americium Hexafluoride (AmF₆)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify A1, A3, and A5\n*   **A1**: Decomposes at 293 K (20 °C) into A2 (AmF₆) and fluorine. This means A1 is a higher, unstable fluoride, like a hypothetical AmF₇ or AmF₈. Its properties (bright-red, unstable, oxidizes xenon) are consistent with a \"super-fluoride\".\n*   **A3**: Obtained by fluorinating Y (Am) and it also reacts with xenon. The direct fluorination of americium can produce its highest stable fluoride, AmF₆. AmF₆ is an extremely strong oxidizing agent and would react with xenon. So, **A3 is also AmF₆**.\n*   **A4 and A5**: The core reaction is: Y + A4 → A5 (1:1 molar ratio). The reaction takes place in a \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". Since Y (Am) is an element (a metal), it will act as a reducing agent. A4 must be an oxidizing agent. The fact that the solution of A4 is colorless and the context of Xenon reactivity strongly suggest that A4 could be a fluoride of a noble gas, like krypton or xenon, which are colorless solids that can form colorless solutions in anhydrous HF.\n\n### Step 3: Identify A4 by analyzing the reaction\nThe reaction is **Am + A4 → A5** with a **1:1 molar ratio**. This implies a direct relationship between the number of electrons lost by one atom of Americium and the number of electrons gained by one molecule of A4.\nAm → Amⁿ⁺ + n e⁻\nA4 + n e⁻ → Products\n\nLet's test potential candidates for A4 that fit the description and the MW ranges.\n\n*   **Krypton difluoride (KrF₂)**: MW = 121.8 g/mol (Range B).\n    *   Reaction: Kr(II) + 2e⁻ → Kr(0). This requires n=2.\n    *   So, Am + KrF₂ → AmF₂ + Kr. The product is Am(II). This is a possible oxidation state.\n    *   However, KrF₂ is unstable and decomposes upon heating. The reaction in a \"hot\" solution makes this choice unlikely.\n\n*   **Xenon difluoride (XeF₂)**: MW = 169.3 g/mol (**Range A**).\n    *   Reaction: Xe(II) + 2e⁻ → Xe(0). This requires n=2.\n    *   So, Am + XeF₂ → AmF₂ + Xe. The product is Am(II). This is chemically plausible, although Am(III) is more stable. The product A5 would be AmF₂, which is known to decompose in water. This is a strong candidate.\n\n*   **Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄)**: MW = 207.3 g/mol (Not in any range).\n    *   Reaction: Xe(IV) + 4e⁻ → Xe(0). This requires n=4.\n    *   So, Am + XeF₄ → AmF₄ + Xe. The product is Am(IV), a known oxidation state. Chemically, this is very sound. However, its molecular weight does not fit any of the provided ranges.\n\n*   **Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆)**: MW = 245.3 g/mol (Very close to, but outside of Range D: 220-240).\n    *   Reaction: Xe(VI) + 6e⁻ → Xe(0). This requires n=6.\n    *   So, Am + XeF₆ → AmF₆ + Xe. The product is Am(VI), which matches A2 and A3. This is chemically plausible. The only issue is the molecular weight being slightly outside the given range.\n\n*   **Iodine pentafluoride (IF₅)**: MW = 221.9 g/mol (**Range D**).\n    *   Reaction: I(V) + 2e⁻ → I(III) (as IF₃). This requires n=2.\n    *   So, Am + IF₅ → AmF₂ + IF₃. The product is Am(II). This is plausible. A5 would be a mixture of AmF₂ and IF₃, both of which decompose in water.\n    *   However, the problem has strong thematic links to Xenon chemistry, making an iodine compound a less likely answer.\n\n### Step 4: Final Evaluation and Conclusion\nWe are left with two primary candidates that fit a range and have plausible (if not perfect) chemistry:\n1.  **A4 = XeF₂** (MW 169.3 g/mol, in Range A). Thematic link is strong.\n2.  **A4 = IF₅** (MW 221.9 g/mol, in Range D). No thematic link.\n\nThe problem's repeated mention of xenon (A1 oxidizes Xe, A3 interacts with Xe) is a significant hint that the chemistry is centered around species of this type. This makes XeF₂ a far more probable candidate for A4 than IF₅ or any other non-xenon compound. The reaction Am + XeF₂ → AmF₂ + Xe is stoichiometrically balanced in a 1:1 ratio. While Am(III) is generally more stable, the formation of Am(II) under specific conditions is not impossible, and for the sake of the puzzle's constraints, it is a valid pathway.\n\nTherefore, the most logical conclusion is that A4 is XeF₂.\nThe molecular weight of XeF₂ is M(Xe) + 2 * M(F) ≈ 131.3 + 2 * 19.0 = 169.3 g/mol.\nThis value falls within the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<A>>>"
