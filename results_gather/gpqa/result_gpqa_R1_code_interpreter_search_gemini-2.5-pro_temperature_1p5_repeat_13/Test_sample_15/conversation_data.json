    "A molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral centers). However, a molecule with stereocenters can still be achiral if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion; such a compound is called a meso compound.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is Cl-CH=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃. This molecule contains a C=C double bond, but no stereocenters (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). The molecule is planar and thus has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself), making it achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name itself provides the key information. The prefixes `(3aR,7aS)` indicate the presence of at least two chiral centers with a specific absolute configuration. This defines a single stereoisomer. For a compound with multiple stereocenters to be inactive, it must be a meso compound. Given the complexity and lack of symmetry of the bridged ring system, especially with an attached `(E)-chloromethylene` group (=CHCl), it is extremely unlikely that the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. A specific, single enantiomer like this is, by definition, chiral. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. This molecule has two stereocenters, C2 and C3. The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (H, CH₃, COOH). The `(2R,3S)` configuration means the two stereocenters have opposite configurations. This is the defining characteristic of the meso isomer of this compound. A meso compound has a plane of symmetry and/or a center of inversion, making it achiral despite having stereocenters. Thus, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration indicates that the two stereocenters have the same configuration. This molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion and is chiral. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer. As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: This molecule has a stereocenter at C1. The four groups attached to C1 are: -OH, -H, the ring segment -CH₂-CH=CH-, and the ring segment -CH₂-CH₂-CH=. These two ring segments are different. Since there is only one stereocenter, the molecule is guaranteed to be chiral. The name `(R)-` specifies one of the two enantiomers. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: The `(1s,3s,5s)` nomenclature suggests the *cis,cis* relative stereochemistry, meaning all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. In its most stable chair conformation, all three -OH groups are in equatorial positions. This molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry (each one passing through a C-OH group and the opposite CH₂ group) as well as a C₃ axis of rotation. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral. The carbons C1, C3, and C5 are prochiral, not chiral centers. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is (CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-(cyclopentyl ring). Let's examine the molecule for stereocenters. The carbonyl carbon is sp² hybridized and not a stereocenter. No carbon in the cyclopentyl ring is a stereocenter as the paths around the ring from the point of attachment are identical. In the isobutyl group, the C3 atom is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a stereocenter. With no stereocenters or any other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality), the molecule is achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>"
