    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a \"dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene\" that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The resulting anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid. Dehydration of maleic acid yields **maleic anhydride**.\n        *   Let's check the NMR data for maleic anhydride. Due to its C₂ᵥ symmetry, the two vinyl protons are chemically and magnetically equivalent. They appear as a single peak. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is appropriate for vinyl protons next to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n        *   Also due to symmetry, there are only two types of carbon atoms: the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O) and the two equivalent vinyl carbons (C=C). The peak at ~165 ppm is characteristic for an anhydride carbonyl carbon, and the peak at ~137 ppm is characteristic for a double-bond carbon.\n        *   Therefore, the dienophile is **maleic anhydride** (C₄H₂O₃).\n\n    *   **Diene:** The problem states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n        *   Let's determine its molecular formula to verify the product's formula later. The cyclopentadiene ring has 5 carbons. Four are substituted with methyl groups (C₁-C₄) and C₅ has two hydrogens. There are no other hydrogens on the ring itself. The four methyl groups contribute 4 x 3 = 12 hydrogens. Total hydrogens = 2 (at C₅) + 12 (from methyls) = 14. The formula is **C₉H₁₄**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n    *   The product has a molecular formula of C₁₃H₁₆O₃. Let's check: C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This matches the information given.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes typically form two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n    *   According to the **endo rule**, the *endo* adduct is usually the major product because its transition state is stabilized by secondary orbital overlap. The *exo* adduct is the minor product.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of the Major Product (Endo Adduct):**\n    *   The product is a tricyclic compound with a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   The diene is symmetric (it has a C₂ symmetry axis passing through C₅ and the midpoint of the C₂=C₃ bond). The dienophile is also symmetric. Therefore, the product will have a plane of symmetry (Cs symmetry).\n    *   This plane of symmetry makes pairs of protons and methyl groups chemically equivalent. Let's identify the proton signals we expect in the ¹H NMR spectrum:\n        *   **Bridgehead Methyls:** The two methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C₁ and C₄ of the original diene) are equivalent. They are attached to saturated quaternary carbons and should appear as a **6H singlet** at a high field (e.g., ~1.0 ppm).\n        *   **Vinyl Methyls:** The two methyl groups on the double bond (C₂ and C₃ of the original diene) are equivalent. They should appear as a **6H singlet** at a lower field than the other methyls (e.g., ~1.7 ppm).\n        *   **Bridge Protons:** The two protons of the CH₂ bridge (C₅ of the original diene) are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. They should appear as a **2H singlet**. Their chemical shift is sensitive to the endo/exo geometry.\n        *   **Fused Methine Protons:** The two protons from the maleic anhydride moiety are equivalent. They are alpha to carbonyl groups and should be significantly deshielded, appearing as a **2H singlet** at a low field (e.g., ~3.5 ppm).\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Cross-Peak:**\n    *   The question states that a specific NOESY cross-peak is present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product. A NOESY cross-peak indicates that two nuclei are close in space (typically < 5 Å). We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n    *   Let's compare the spatial arrangement in the two isomers:\n        *   **Endo Isomer (Major):** The anhydride ring is \"tucked under\" the diene, on the same side (*syn*) as the C₅H₂ bridge. The two methine protons from the anhydride part (let's call them H_fused) are on the *exo* face of the newly formed ring, pointing \"upwards\". The vinyl methyl groups are also on the \"top\" of the molecule. Therefore, the **H_fused protons are close to the vinyl methyl groups**.\n        *   **Exo Isomer (Minor):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C₅H₂ bridge. This means the H_fused protons are now on the *endo* face, pointing \"downwards\". The vinyl methyl groups are still on top. Therefore, the **H_fused protons are far from the vinyl methyl groups**.\n\n    *   This analysis reveals that a NOE between the **vinyl methyl groups** and the **H_fused protons** will be a unique feature of the major (*endo*) product.\n\n5.  **Match Analysis with a Multiple-Choice Option:**\n    *   We need to find the option that describes a cross-peak between the vinyl methyls and the H_fused protons.\n    *   Based on our signal assignment in step 3:\n        *   Vinyl methyls = 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.\n        *   H_fused protons = 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n    *   Let's examine the options:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl methyls). This NOE would likely be present in both isomers, as the distance between these groups is fixed by the carbon skeleton.\n        *   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. The \"1H doublet\" is inconsistent with the expected symmetry of the product.\n        *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. The \"1H doublet\" is inconsistent with the expected symmetry.\n        *   D) **A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.** This perfectly matches our prediction for the vinyl methyl protons and the H_fused protons, which show a unique spatial proximity in the major (endo) product.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connects the resonance of the vinyl methyl groups (~1.7 ppm) and the resonance of the fused methine protons (~3.5 ppm).\n\n<<<D>>>"
