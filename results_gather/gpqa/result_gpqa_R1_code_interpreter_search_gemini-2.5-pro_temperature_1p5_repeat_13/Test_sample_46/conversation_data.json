    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as follows:\n        DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n        DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring. The remaining degree of unsaturation (1) suggests the presence of a double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The two distinct bands in this region are characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching of a primary amine (-NH2). This rules out secondary amines or amides with only one N-H bond.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group of a conjugated ester. Amides usually appear at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm-1).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, in the aromatic region is a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield shift of the doublet at 8.0 ppm indicates it is adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group (like the carbonyl ester). The upfield shift of the doublet at 7.0 ppm indicates it is adjacent to an electron-donating group (like the amine).\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the signature pattern of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates the methylene (-CH2-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, as in an ester (-O-CH2-).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons corresponds to the two exchangeable protons of the primary amine (-NH2) group, which was also identified from the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **Putting it all together**\n    1.  From the DoU and NMR, we have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  From IR and NMR, one substituent is a primary amine (-NH2).\n    3.  From IR and NMR, the other substituent is an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    4.  The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group are the ones at 8.0 ppm.\n    5.  The protons ortho to the electron-donating amine group are the ones at 7.0 ppm.\n    \n    Assembling these pieces gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n    *   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This would show a meta-splitting pattern in the NMR, not two doublets. The IR for the amide C=O would be at a lower frequency.\n    *   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but the ester linkage is different (-O-CO-R). The -CH2- group of the propionate would be next to the carbonyl, giving a signal around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide. The IR would show only one N-H band. The NMR would show a proton for the N-H and another for the formyl (-CHO) proton.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
