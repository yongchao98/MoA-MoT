    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution.\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge q. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n2.  **Recall the General Formulas for Potentials:** The scalar and vector potentials are generally given by the retarded potential formulas for continuous charge and current distributions, $\\rho$ and $\\vec{J}$:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{d} d\\tau'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{d} d\\tau'$\n    where:\n    *   $\\vec{r}$ is the observation point.\n    *   $\\vec{r}'$ is the source point.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'$, and $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n    *   $t_r = t - d/c$ is the retarded time, which is the time at which the signal (field) must have been emitted from the source at $\\vec{r}'$ to reach the observer at $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n    *   $d\\tau'$ is the volume element of the source.\n\n3.  **Model a Moving Point Charge:** For a single point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities are represented using Dirac delta functions:\n    *   $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    *   $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = d\\vec{s}/dt'$ is the velocity of the charge.\n\n4.  **Substitute into the Potential Integrals:** We substitute these density expressions into the general formulas. For the scalar potential V:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{d} d\\tau'$\n    Here, the integral is over the source coordinates $\\vec{r}'$. The delta function is non-zero only when $\\vec{r}' = \\vec{s}(t_r)$. This makes the integration non-trivial because the retarded time $t_r$ itself depends on $\\vec{r}'$ ($t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$).\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Integral:** A standard method to solve this integral is to change the integration variable. The effect of the retarded time means we are integrating over the \"apparent\" volume of the charge, which is distorted by its motion. The result of this integration, which involves a careful evaluation of a Jacobian factor, is:\n    $\\int \\dfrac{\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{d} d\\tau' = \\left[ \\dfrac{1}{d(1 - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/(dc))} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    The subscript \"ret\" means all quantities inside the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n6.  **Formulate the Scalar Potential (V):**\n    Substituting this result back into the formula for V:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d(1 - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/(dc))} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    Let's simplify the denominator:\n    $d(1 - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/(dc)) = d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c} = \\dfrac{dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}$\n    So, the potential becomes:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{(\\frac{dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}} = \\dfrac{q c}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}\\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    where it is understood that $d$, $\\vec{d}$, and $\\vec{v}$ are all evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$. The notation in the question matches this convention.\n\n7.  **Formulate the Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):** The derivation for the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is almost identical. We start with:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{q \\vec{v}(t_r) \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{d} d\\tau'$\n    The velocity $\\vec{v}$ is evaluated at the retarded time and can be taken outside the spatial integral.\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} [\\vec{v}]_{\\text{ret}} \\int \\dfrac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{d} d\\tau'$\n    The integral is the same as before. So we get:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\vec{v} \\cdot \\dfrac{q}{d(1 - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/(dc))} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    Simplifying this gives:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q c \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}\\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    Again, all time-dependent quantities are at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** Let's compare our derived expressions with the given options.\n    *   Our derived V: $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    *   Our derived A: $\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$ (assuming $\\mu$ in the question means $\\mu_o$)\n\n    *   A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n        (Incorrect sign in the denominator)\n    *   B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n        (This is the static potential, which is incorrect for a moving charge. The relation for A is also incorrect.)\n    *   C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n        (This is the static potential. While the relation $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the expression for V is wrong.)\n    *   D) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n        (This matches our derived expressions perfectly.)\n\nThe correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
