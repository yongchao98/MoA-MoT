    "Here's a step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Hamiltonian:** The Hamiltonian is given by $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    *   $\\varepsilon$ is a constant with the dimension of energy.\n    *   $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary unit vector, meaning its magnitude is 1 ($|\\vec{n}| = 1$). We can write it in terms of its components as $\\vec{n} = n_x \\hat{i} + n_y \\hat{j} + n_z \\hat{k}$, with $n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$.\n    *   $\\vec{\\sigma}$ is the vector of Pauli matrices: $\\vec{\\sigma} = \\sigma_x \\hat{i} + \\sigma_y \\hat{j} + \\sigma_z \\hat{k}$.\n\n2.  **Relate Eigenvalues of H to H²:** If $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of an operator $H$ corresponding to an eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$, i.e., $H|\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda|\\psi\\rangle$, then the corresponding eigenvalue of $H^2$ is $\\lambda^2$.\n    *   $H^2|\\psi\\rangle = H(H|\\psi\\rangle) = H(\\lambda|\\psi\\rangle) = \\lambda(H|\\psi\\rangle) = \\lambda(\\lambda|\\psi\\rangle) = \\lambda^2|\\psi\\rangle$.\n    *   This shows that if we can find the eigenvalues of $H^2$, we can easily find the eigenvalues of $H$.\n\n3.  **Calculate H²:**\n    *   $H^2 = (\\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2$.\n    *   We need to evaluate $(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2$. This can be done using a well-known identity for Pauli matrices:\n        $(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{a})(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{b}) = (\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b})I + i\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot (\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b})$\n        where $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n    *   In our case, both $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ are the unit vector $\\vec{n}$. So we set $\\vec{a} = \\vec{b} = \\vec{n}$.\n    *   $(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2 = (\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n}) = (\\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{n})I + i\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot (\\vec{n} \\times \\vec{n})$.\n    *   Now we use the properties of the vector $\\vec{n}$:\n        *   Since $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector, the dot product with itself is $\\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{n} = |\\vec{n}|^2 = 1^2 = 1$.\n        *   The cross product of any vector with itself is the zero vector: $\\vec{n} \\times \\vec{n} = \\vec{0}$.\n    *   Substituting these results back into the identity:\n        $(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2 = (1)I + i\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot (\\vec{0}) = I$.\n    *   So, we find that the square of the operator $(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})$ is simply the identity matrix.\n    *   Now we can find $H^2$:\n        $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$.\n\n4.  **Find the Eigenvalues:**\n    *   We have the relation $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$. Let $\\lambda$ be the eigenvalues of $H$. As established in step 2, the eigenvalues of $H^2$ must be $\\lambda^2$.\n    *   The matrix $H^2$ is $\\varepsilon^2 I = \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\varepsilon^2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues of this diagonal matrix are simply its diagonal elements, which is $\\varepsilon^2$ (with a degeneracy of 2).\n    *   Therefore, we must have $\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$.\n    *   Solving for $\\lambda$, we get $\\lambda = \\pm \\sqrt{\\varepsilon^2} = \\pm \\varepsilon$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n}$ are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$.\n\n6.  **Compare with options:**\n    *   A) +1, -1: Incorrect dimensions.\n    *   B) + \\varepsilon, -\\varepsilon: This matches our derived result.\n    *   C) +\\hbar/2, -\\hbar/2: Incorrect. This relates to the spin operator $S_z$.\n    *   D) +\\varepsilon \\hbar/2, - \\varepsilon \\hbar/2: Incorrect. This would be the result if the Hamiltonian was defined in terms of the spin operator $\\vec{S} = (\\hbar/2)\\vec{\\sigma}$ instead of the Pauli vector $\\vec{\\sigma}$.\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
