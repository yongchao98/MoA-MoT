The discrepancies in the chosen letters (A, B, C, or D) are unequivocally an artifact of the multiple-choice options being presented in a scrambled order to each agent. The core logic and calculation are consistent and correct across all provided answers. The definitive solution is reached by verifying this universally agreed-upon method.\n\n1.  **Identify the Relevant Physical Principles**: To solve the problem, we must connect a planet's orbital period ($P$) with its equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$). This is accomplished by combining two fundamental laws of astrophysics:\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature**: A planet's equilibrium temperature is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the thermal energy it radiates. For planets orbiting the same star and having the same albedo (reflectivity), the equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance ($a$).\n      $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law**: This law describes the relationship between a planet's orbital period ($P$) and its orbital distance ($a$). For all planets orbiting the same central star, the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the distance.\n      $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\n2.  **Combine the Laws to Find the Temperature-Period Relationship**: Since the problem provides orbital periods, we need a direct relationship between temperature and period. This is found by eliminating the orbital distance variable ($a$).\n    *   First, we rearrange Kepler's Law to express distance in terms of period: $a \\propto P^{2/3}$.\n    *   Next, we substitute this expression for distance into the equilibrium temperature formula: $T_{eq} \\propto (P^{2/3})^{-1/2}$.\n    *   Using the rules of exponents ($(x^m)^n = x^{m \\cdot n}$), we multiply the powers: $(2/3) \\times (-1/2) = -1/3$. This yields the crucial final relationship:\n      $T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n3.  **Formulate and Calculate the Specific Ratio**: The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to that of Planet_2 ($T_{eq4} / T_{eq2}$).\n    *   Using the relationship from Step 2, we can write the ratio:\n      $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{P_4}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3}$\n    *   To simplify the calculation with a positive exponent, we invert the fraction inside the parentheses:\n      $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n4.  **Substitute Given Values and Compute**: The problem states the ratio of orbital periods is $1:2:2.5:3.5:5$. We use these as the relative values for the periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n    *   $P_2 = 2$\n    *   $P_4 = 3.5$\n    *   Plugging these values into the formula gives:\n      Ratio = $(\\frac{2}{3.5})^{1/3} \\approx (0.5714)^{1/3} \\approx 0.82987$\n    *   Rounding this to two decimal places gives **0.83**. This numerical result is confirmed by all candidate answers.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Correct Physical Laws:** The entire solution hinges on the correct application of the Stefan-Boltzmann law for equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$) and Kepler's Third Law ($P^2 \\propto a^3$). An error in stating or combining these laws would invalidate the result.\n*   **Exponent Algebra:** A critical calculation step is the correct multiplication of exponents: $(2/3) \\times (-1/2) = -1/3$. This was performed correctly by all candidates.\n*   **Ratio Inversion:** Because temperature has an *inverse* relationship with the period ($T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$), the temperature ratio $T_4/T_2$ is equal to the period ratio raised to a negative power, which is equivalent to the *inverted* period ratio to a positive power: $(P_2/P_4)^{1/3}$. Forgetting this inversion is a common potential mistake.\n*   **Physical Sanity Check:** Planet 4 has a longer period than Planet 2, meaning it is farther from the star and must therefore be colder. This requires the ratio of its temperature to Planet 2's temperature ($T_4/T_2$) to be less than 1. Our result of `~0.83` satisfies this check, adding a layer of confidence.\n*   **Focus on Numerical Consensus:** The key insight from analyzing the candidate answers is to trust the universally agreed-upon numerical result (`~0.83`) and disregard the conflicting final letter choices, as they were based on differently ordered lists of options.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The details about the discovery method (TTV) and orbital resonance are important for astrophysical context but are not directly needed for the calculation itself, as the period ratios are explicitly given.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBased on the universally agreed-upon physics, derivation, and calculation, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately **0.83**. This verified numerical result must be matched against the specific options provided in the question.\n\n**Question's Options:**\nA) ~0.57\nB) ~0.83\nC) ~0.69\nD) ~0.75\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.83 corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers from other agents, a definitive conclusion can be reached. The agents show a powerful and unanimous consensus on the core physics, mathematical derivation, and the final numerical result.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze Consensus among Candidate Answers:**\n    Every single candidate answer, regardless of the final letter chosen, follows the exact same logical path:\n    *   **Physics:** They all correctly identify that the solution requires combining two fundamental principles: the law for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$) and Kepler's Third Law ($P^2 \\propto a^3$).\n    *   **Derivation:** They all correctly combine these laws to derive the relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature and its orbital period: $T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$.\n    *   **Calculation:** They all correctly set up the ratio of temperatures as $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_4})^{1/3}$, substitute the given period values ($P_2=2$ and $P_4=3.5$), and arrive at a numerical result of approximately 0.8298, which rounds to **0.83**.\n\n2.  **Explain the Discrepancy:** The only point of disagreement among the answers is the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D). This is a clear artifact of the multiple-choice options being presented in a different, randomized order to each agent. The unanimous agreement on the numerical value of **~0.83** is the critical piece of information and confirms the correctness of the calculation.\n\n3.  **Independent Verification:**\n    The universally agreed-upon method is sound. Let's verify it once more.\n    *   **Goal:** Find the ratio $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}}$.\n    *   **Relationship:** As correctly derived by all agents, $T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$.\n    *   **Formula:** $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_4})^{1/3}$.\n    *   **Values:** From the given orbital period ratio of $1:2:2.5:3.5:5$, we take $P_2 = 2$ and $P_4 = 3.5$.\n    *   **Computation:** Ratio = $(\\frac{2}{3.5})^{1/3} \\approx (0.5714)^{1/3} \\approx 0.8298...$\n\n4.  **Final Decision:**\n    The verified numerical result, confirmed by all candidate answers, is **~0.83**. This value must be matched to the specific options provided in your question prompt:\n    *   A) ~0.57\n    *   B) ~0.69\n    *   C) ~0.75\n    *   D) ~0.83\n\n    The calculated result directly corresponds to option D.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Physics Derivation:** The core of the solution is the derivation that equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period ($T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$). This step is fundamental.\n*   **Ratio Inversion:** It is a common mistake to forget that since the relationship is *inverse*, the temperature ratio $T_4/T_2$ uses the *inverted* period ratio $(P_2/P_4)$ with a positive exponent.\n*   **Physical Sanity Check:** A simple check adds confidence. Planet 4 has a longer period, meaning it is farther from the star and must be colder than Planet 2. Therefore, the ratio of their temperatures, $T_4/T_2$, must be less than 1. Our result of ~0.83 satisfies this condition.\n*   **Data Extraction:** The problem contains contextual information (TTV method, circular orbits) that is important for realism but not required for the calculation itself once the period ratios are given. One must simply extract the correct period values for Planet_2 and Planet_4 from the list.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on a comprehensive review of the provided candidate answers and an independent analysis of the problem, the following steps lead to the definitive solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze Consensus Across Candidate Answers**: There is a unanimous and powerful consensus among all provided answers on the essential points:\n    *   **Governing Physics**: Every candidate correctly identified that the solution requires combining two fundamental principles: the law for equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$, where 'a' is the orbital distance) and Kepler's Third Law ($P^2 \\propto a^3$, where 'P' is the orbital period).\n    *   **Core Derivation**: Every candidate correctly derived the key relationship between temperature and period by substituting one law into the other, arriving at the correct formula: $T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$. This shows that a planet's equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of its orbital period.\n    *   **Mathematical Calculation**: Every candidate correctly set up the specific ratio for Planet 4 and Planet 2 as $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$, substituted the given relative period values ($P_2 = 2$ and $P_4 = 3.5$), and computed a numerical result that rounds to **0.83**.\n    *   **Source of Discrepancy**: The only variation among the answers is the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D). This is an artifact of the multiple-choice options being presented in a different, randomized order to each agent. The unanimous agreement on the numerical value of `~0.83` is the critical finding.\n\n2.  **Independent Verification**: To confirm the consensus, the calculation is performed independently.\n    *   **Relationship**: $T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n    *   **Ratio Formula**: $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    *   **Values**: From the provided period ratio `1:2:2.5:3.5:5`, we have $P_2 = 2$ and $P_4 = 3.5$.\n    *   **Calculation**:\n        ```python\n        p2 = 2.0\n        p4 = 3.5\n        ratio = (p2 / p4)**(1/3)\n        print(f\"{ratio:.2f}\")\n        ```\n    The calculation yields a value of approximately `0.8298`, which rounds to **0.83**.\n\n3.  **Final Decision**: The verified numerical result of **0.83** must be matched against the specific options provided in the problem description.\n\n    *   A) ~0.75\n    *   B) ~0.57\n    *   C) ~0.83\n    *   D) ~0.69\n\n    The calculated value directly corresponds to option C.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Key Assumptions**: The solution is valid because the problem states the planets orbit the same star and possess the same albedo. These conditions allow various constants to cancel out when forming a ratio.\n*   **Exponent Algebra**: The derivation of the temperature-period relationship hinges on the correct multiplication of exponents: $(2/3) \\times (-1/2) = -1/3$. An error at this step would invalidate the entire solution.\n*   **Ratio Inversion**: This is a common pitfall. Since temperature is *inversely* proportional to the cube root of the period, the temperature ratio ($T_4/T_2$) must be based on the *inverted* ratio of the periods ($(P_2/P_4)^{1/3}$) to yield a correct answer.\n*   **Physical Sanity Check**: Planet 4 has a longer period ($P_4=3.5$) than Planet 2 ($P_2=2$), which means it is further from the star and must be colder. Therefore, the ratio of its temperature to Planet 2's temperature ($T_4/T_2$) must be less than 1. The result of `~0.83` is consistent with this physical intuition.\n*   **Irrelevant Information**: The fact that the planets were discovered by the TTV method and are in resonance provides context but is not needed for the calculation itself, as the direct period ratios are provided.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nBased on an analysis of the provided candidate answers, there is a unanimous and correct consensus on the physical principles, mathematical derivation, and the final numerical result.

The discrepancies in the chosen letters (A, B, C, or D) across the different answers stem from the multiple-choice options being presented in a scrambled order to each agent. The correct approach is to independently verify the calculation and match the resulting number to the specific options provided in this question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physical Laws:** The problem requires relating a planet's orbital period ($P$) to its equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$). This is accomplished by combining two fundamental laws of astrophysics:\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature:** For planets orbiting the same star and possessing the same albedo, their equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is inversely proportional to the square root of their orbital distance ($a$). This is because the incoming stellar energy flux decreases with the square of the distance ($1/a^2$), and the planet's radiated energy is proportional to $T_{eq}^4$. In equilibrium, these balance out to give $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$.\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** For planets orbiting the same central star, the square of the orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance ($a$), written as $P^2 \\propto a^3$.\n\n2.  **Derive the Temperature-Period Relationship:** To solve the problem, a direct relationship between temperature and period must be found by eliminating the distance variable ($a$).\n    *   First, we rearrange Kepler's Law to express distance in terms of period: $a \\propto P^{2/3}$.\n    *   Next, we substitute this expression for distance into the equilibrium temperature formula: $T_{eq} \\propto (P^{2/3})^{-1/2}$.\n    *   Using the rules of exponents, we multiply the powers: $(2/3) \\times (-1/2) = -1/3$. This gives the final, critical relationship:\n        $T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n        This shows that equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n3.  **Formulate and Calculate the Specific Ratio:** The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet\\_4 to that of Planet\\_2 ($T_{eq4} / T_{eq2}$).\n    *   Using the derived relationship: $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{P_4}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3}$.\n    *   To simplify calculation with a positive exponent, this is inverted to: $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$.\n    *   From the problem statement, the ratio of orbital periods is $1:2:2.5:3.5:5$. We extract the relative periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4: $P_2 = 2$ and $P_4 = 3.5$.\n    *   Substituting these values into the formula gives: $\\left(\\frac{2}{3.5}\\right)^{1/3} \\approx (0.5714)^{1/3} \\approx 0.82987$.\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the numerical result is **0.83**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Underlying Assumptions:** The entire calculation is valid because the problem states the planets orbit the same star and implicitly assumes they have the same albedo by not providing differing values. These conditions allow various constants to cancel out.\n*   **Correctness of the Derivation:** The core of the solution is the derivation of $T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$. An error here, particularly in the exponent algebra, would invalidate the entire result. The unanimous agreement from all candidates provides high confidence in this step.\n*   **Ratio Inversion:** A very common mistake in these types of problems is forgetting to invert the ratio of periods. Because temperature is *inversely* proportional to the cube root of the period, the temperature ratio ($T_4/T_2$) correctly uses the *inverted* period ratio ($P_2/P_4$) to a positive power.\n*   **Physical Sanity Check:** Planet 4 has a longer period ($P_4=3.5$) than Planet 2 ($P_2=2$), meaning it orbits farther from the star. It must therefore be colder. This means the temperature ratio $T_4/T_2$ must be less than 1. The calculated value of ~0.83 is consistent with this physical reality.\n*   **Contextual Information:** The fact that the planets were found using the Transit Timing Variation (TTV) method explains *why* astronomers know they are in orbital resonance, but this information is not directly used in the calculation itself, as the period ratios are given.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBased on the consistent derivation and calculation across all candidate answers, and confirmed by independent analysis, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately **0.83**.

The scientific and mathematical reasoning is consistent and robust across all answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physical Laws**: The problem requires finding a relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) and its orbital period ($P$). This is achieved by combining two fundamental physical principles:\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature**: For planets with the same albedo orbiting the same star, their equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of their orbital distance ($a$). This is derived from the balance between absorbed stellar energy and radiated thermal energy.\n        $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law**: This law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance ($a$).\n        $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\n2.  **Derive the Temperature-Period Relationship**: To find a direct relationship between temperature and period, we must eliminate the orbital distance variable ($a$) by combining the two laws.\n    *   First, we rearrange Kepler's Law to express distance in terms of period: $a \\propto P^{2/3}$.\n    *   Next, we substitute this into the equilibrium temperature relationship: $T_{eq} \\propto (P^{2/3})^{-1/2}$.\n    *   Using the rules of exponents ($(x^m)^n = x^{m \\cdot n}$), we multiply the powers: $(2/3) \\times (-1/2) = -1/3$.

We extract the relative period values for the two planets in question:\n    *   $P_2 = 2$\n    *   $P_4 = 3.5$\n    *   Substituting these values into the formula:\n        Ratio = $(\\frac{2}{3.5})^{1/3} \\approx (0.5714)^{1/3} \\approx 0.82987$\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the final numerical result is **0.83**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Underlying Physics:** The entire solution hinges on the correct application of the Stefan-Boltzmann law for equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$) and Kepler's Third Law ($P^2 \\propto a^3$).\n*   **Exponent Algebra:** The most critical calculation step is the correct multiplication of the exponents, $(2/3) \\times (-1/2) = -1/3$.

Forgetting to invert the base is a common error.\n*   **Physical Sanity Check:** Planet_4 has a longer period than Planet_2 ($3.5 > 2$), which means it must be farther from the star and therefore colder.

This is accomplished by combining two key physical laws:\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature:** For planets with the same properties (albedo) orbiting the same star, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's orbital distance ($a$). This is because the stellar energy a planet receives decreases with the square of the distance ($1/a^2$), and the planet's temperature is related to the fourth root of this energy flux. Thus:\n      $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital period to its orbital distance. For planets orbiting the same star:\n      $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\n2.  **Combine the Laws to Derive the T-P Relationship:** The goal is to create a single equation relating temperature and period by eliminating the distance variable ($a$).\n    *   First, rearrange Kepler's Law to express distance in terms of period: $a \\propto P^{2/3}$.\n    *   Next, substitute this expression for distance into the equilibrium temperature formula: $T_{eq} \\propto (P^{2/3})^{-1/2}$.\n    *   Using the rule for exponents ($(x^m)^n = x^{m \\cdot n}$), multiply the powers: $(2/3) \\times (-1/2) = -1/3$.\n    *   This gives the final, crucial relationship: $T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$. This shows that equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Specific Ratio and Substitute Values:** The question asks for the ratio of the temperature of Planet_4 to that of Planet_2 ($T_{eq4} / T_{eq2}$).\n    *   Using the derived relationship: $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{P_4}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3}$.\n    *   To simplify the calculation with a positive exponent, we invert the base: $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$.\n    *   From the given period ratio `1:2:2.5:3.5:5`, we extract the relative periods: $P_2 = 2$ and $P_4 = 3.5$.\n    *   Substitute these values into the formula: Ratio = $\\left(\\frac{2}{3.5}\\right)^{1/3}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Result:**\n    *   The calculation is $(2 / 3.5)^{1/3} \\approx (0.5714)^{1/3} \\approx 0.82987...$\n    *   Rounding this to two decimal places gives **0.83**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Analysis of Consensus:** All candidate answers unanimously agree on the derived formula ($T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$) and the final numerical result (`~0.83`). The disagreement on the letter choices (A, B, C, D) is an artifact of the agents receiving shuffled options and should be disregarded. The consensus on the number itself is the key takeaway.\n*   **Ratio Inversion:** A critical step is inverting the period ratio when making the exponent positive. Since temperature is *inversely* proportional to a power of the period, the temperature ratio $T_4/T_2$ must be related to the period ratio $P_2/P_4$.\n*   **Physical Sanity Check:** Planet 4 has a longer period ($P_4=3.5$) than Planet 2 ($P_2=2$), meaning it is farther from the star and must be colder. Therefore, the ratio of its temperature to Planet 2's temperature ($T_4/T_2$) must be less than 1. Our result of `~0.83` satisfies this check.\n*   **Exponent Algebra:** The derivation relies on the correct multiplication of exponents: $(2/3) \\times (-1/2) = -1/3$. Any error here would fundamentally change the relationship and the result.\n*   **Irrelevant Information:** The fact that the planets were discovered by the TTV method and are in orbital resonance is interesting context but is not needed for the calculation once the period ratios are given.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe universally confirmed numerical result for the temperature ratio is `~0.83`.

This is achieved by combining two fundamental physical principles:\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature:** For planets orbiting the same star and having the same albedo, their equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of their orbital distance ($a$).\n      $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance.\n      $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\n2.  **Combine Laws to Relate Temperature and Period:** To solve the problem, we must find a direct relationship between temperature and period by eliminating the distance variable ($a$).\n    *   First, rearrange Kepler's Law to express distance in terms of period: $a \\propto P^{2/3}$.\n    *   Next, substitute this expression for distance into the temperature relationship: $T_{eq} \\propto (P^{2/3})^{-1/2}$.\n    *   Using the rules of exponents, we multiply the powers: $(2/3) \\times (-1/2) = -1/3$. This gives the final, critical relationship:\n      $T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n3.  **Formulate and Calculate the Specific Ratio:** The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to that of Planet_2 ($T_{eq4} / T_{eq2}$).\n    *   Using the derived proportionality, the ratio is: $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{P_4}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3}$.\n    *   To simplify the calculation, we invert the fraction to make the exponent positive: $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$.\n\n4.  **Substitute Values and Compute:** From the provided orbital period ratio ($1:2:2.5:3.5:5$), we extract the relative values for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n    *   $P_2 = 2$\n    *   $P_4 = 3.5$\n    *   Plugging these values into the formula gives: $\\text{Ratio} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3.5}\\right)^{1/3} \\approx 0.82987...$\n\n5.  **Final Decision:** The calculated value, when rounded to two decimal places, is **0.83**.

The given conditions (same star, same albedo) are crucial for this simplified relationship to be valid.\n*   **Correct Algebraic Manipulation:** The combination of exponents to arrive at the $T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$ relationship is a critical step where errors can occur.\n*   **Ratio Inversion:** This is a very common pitfall. Due to the inverse proportionality, the temperature ratio ($T_4/T_2$) corresponds to the *inverted* period ratio ($P_2/P_4$) raised to a positive power.\n*   **Physical Sanity Check:** Planet 4 has a longer period than Planet 2, meaning it orbits farther from the star and must be colder. Therefore, the temperature ratio $T_4/T_2$ must be less than 1. The result of ~0.83 is consistent with this expectation and provides a quick check against major errors.\n*   **Data Extraction:** One must be careful to select the correct values from the provided ratio list: $P_2$ corresponds to the second value (2) and $P_4$ corresponds to the fourth value (3.5).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\nAn analysis of the fifteen candidate answers reveals a clear and unanimous consensus on the scientific principles, the mathematical derivation, and the final numerical result. The discrepancy in the chosen letter (A, B, C, or D) is an artifact of the multiple-choice options being presented in a different, randomized order to each agent.

    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physical Laws**: The problem's solution requires combining two fundamental principles of astrophysics to relate a planet's orbital period ($P$) to its equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$). All candidate answers correctly identify these laws:\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature**: For planets that orbit the same star and have the same albedo (reflectivity), their equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of their orbital distance ($a$). This is because the stellar energy flux decreases as $1/a^2$, and temperature is related to the fourth root of this flux ($T^4 \\propto \\text{Flux}$). Therefore:\n        $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law**: This law states that for all planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance ($a$).\n        $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\n2.  **Derive the Temperature-Period Relationship**: To find a direct relationship between temperature and period, the distance variable ($a$) must be eliminated by combining the two laws. This step was performed correctly and identically in all candidate answers.\n    *   Rearrange Kepler's Law to express distance in terms of period: $a \\propto P^{2/3}$.\n    *   Substitute this expression for distance into the equilibrium temperature formula: $T_{eq} \\propto (P^{2/3})^{-1/2}$.\n    *   Apply the rule of exponents ($(x^m)^n = x^{m \\cdot n}$) by multiplying the powers: $(2/3) \\times (-1/2) = -1/3$.\n    *   This yields the crucial relationship:\n        $T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n3.  **Formulate and Calculate the Specific Ratio**: The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet\\_4 to that of Planet\\_2 ($\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}}$).\n    *   Using the derived relationship, we write the ratio: $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{P_4}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3}$.\n    *   To simplify the calculation with a positive exponent, the base is inverted: $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$.\n\n4.  **Substitute Values and Compute**: The problem states the ratio of orbital periods is `1:2:2.5:3.5:5`. We extract the relative period values for the two planets in question:\n    *   $P_2 = 2$ (the second value in the ratio)\n    *   $P_4 = 3.5$ (the fourth value in the ratio)\n    *   Plugging these values into the formula:\n        Ratio = $(\\frac{2}{3.5})^{1/3} \\approx (0.571428)^{1/3} \\approx 0.82987$\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the final numerical result is **0.83**.\n\n5.  **Final Decision**: There is a unanimous consensus among all candidate answers on the numerical result of **~0.83**. The only discrepancies are the letter choices (A, B, C, D), which is an artifact of the options being presented in a scrambled order.

These conditions are critical as they allow many constants in the full equilibrium temperature formula to cancel out, leaving the simple proportionality.\n*   **Correct Derivation**: The heart of the problem is the derivation of $T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$. A mistake in this step, particularly in the exponent algebra, would invalidate the entire solution. The consensus across all answers strongly supports the correctness of this step.\n*   **Ratio Inversion**: This is a major potential pitfall. Because temperature is *inversely* proportional to the cube root of the period, the temperature ratio ($T_4/T_2$) corresponds to the *inverted* period ratio ($P_2/P_4$) raised to a positive power. Forgetting to invert the base would lead to an incorrect answer greater than 1.\n*   **Physical Sanity Check**: Planet 4 has a longer period ($P_4=3.5$) than Planet 2 ($P_2=2$), meaning it is farther from the star and must be colder. Therefore, the ratio of its temperature to Planet 2's temperature ($T_4/T_2$) must be less than 1. The result of `~0.83` is consistent with this physical reality, providing a useful check against major errors.\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The mention of the \"TTV method\" and \"orbital resonance\" provides realistic context but is not needed for the calculation itself, as the required period ratios are given directly.\n*   **Interpreting Agent Consensus**: It is vital to recognize that the unanimous consensus is on the numerical value `~0.83`, not the letter choice.

The core logic and calculation are consistent and correct across all provided answers. The definitive solution is reached by verifying this universally agreed-upon method.\n\n1.  **Identify the Relevant Physical Principles**: To solve the problem, we must connect a planet's orbital period ($P$) with its equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$). This is accomplished by combining two fundamental laws of astrophysics:\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature**: A planet's equilibrium temperature is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the thermal energy it radiates. For planets orbiting the same star and having the same albedo (reflectivity), the equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance ($a$).\n      $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law**: This law describes the relationship between a planet's orbital period ($P$) and its orbital distance ($a$). For all planets orbiting the same central star, the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the distance.\n      $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\n2.  **Combine the Laws to Find the Temperature-Period Relationship**: Since the problem provides orbital periods, we need a direct relationship between temperature and period. This is found by eliminating the orbital distance variable ($a$).\n    *   First, we rearrange Kepler's Law to express distance in terms of period: $a \\propto P^{2/3}$.\n    *   Next, we substitute this expression for distance into the equilibrium temperature formula: $T_{eq} \\propto (P^{2/3})^{-1/2}$.\n    *   Using the rules of exponents ($(x^m)^n = x^{m \\cdot n}$), we multiply the powers: $(2/3) \\times (-1/2) = -1/3$. This yields the crucial final relationship:\n      $T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n3.  **Formulate and Calculate the Specific Ratio**: The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to that of Planet_2 ($T_{eq4} / T_{eq2}$).\n    *   Using the relationship from Step 2, we can write the ratio:\n      $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{P_4}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3}$\n    *   To simplify the calculation with a positive exponent, we invert the fraction inside the parentheses:\n      $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n4.  **Substitute Given Values and Compute**: The problem states the ratio of orbital periods is $1:2:2.5:3.5:5$. We use these as the relative values for the periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n    *   $P_2 = 2$\n    *   $P_4 = 3.5$\n    *   Plugging these values into the formula gives:\n      Ratio = $(\\frac{2}{3.5})^{1/3} \\approx (0.5714)^{1/3} \\approx 0.82987$\n    *   Rounding this to two decimal places gives **0.83**.

An error in stating or combining these laws would invalidate the result.\n*   **Exponent Algebra:** A critical calculation step is the correct multiplication of exponents: $(2/3) \\times (-1/2) = -1/3$. This was performed correctly by all candidates.\n*   **Ratio Inversion:** Because temperature has an *inverse* relationship with the period ($T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$), the temperature ratio $T_4/T_2$ is equal to the period ratio raised to a negative power, which is equivalent to the *inverted* period ratio to a positive power: $(P_2/P_4)^{1/3}$. Forgetting this inversion is a common potential mistake.\n*   **Physical Sanity Check:** Planet 4 has a longer period than Planet 2, meaning it is farther from the star and must therefore be colder. This requires the ratio of its temperature to Planet 2's temperature ($T_4/T_2$) to be less than 1. Our result of `~0.83` satisfies this check, adding a layer of confidence.\n*   **Focus on Numerical Consensus:** The key insight from analyzing the candidate answers is to trust the universally agreed-upon numerical result (`~0.83`) and disregard the conflicting final letter choices, as they were based on differently ordered lists of options.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The details about the discovery method (TTV) and orbital resonance are important for astrophysical context but are not directly needed for the calculation itself, as the period ratios are explicitly given.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBased on the universally agreed-upon physics, derivation, and calculation, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately **0.83**.

This step is fundamental.\n*   **Ratio Inversion:** It is a common mistake to forget that since the relationship is *inverse*, the temperature ratio $T_4/T_2$ uses the *inverted* period ratio $(P_2/P_4)$ with a positive exponent.\n*   **Physical Sanity Check:** A simple check adds confidence. Planet 4 has a longer period, meaning it is farther from the star and must be colder than Planet 2. Therefore, the ratio of their temperatures, $T_4/T_2$, must be less than 1. Our result of ~0.83 satisfies this condition.\n*   **Data Extraction:** The problem contains contextual information (TTV method, circular orbits) that is important for realism but not required for the calculation itself once the period ratios are given.

The discrepancies in the chosen letters (A, B, C, or D) across the different answers stem from the multiple-choice options being presented in a scrambled order to each agent. The correct approach is to independently verify the calculation and match the resulting number to the specific options provided in this question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physical Laws:** The problem requires relating a planet's orbital period ($P$) to its equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$). This is accomplished by combining two fundamental laws of astrophysics:\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature:** For planets orbiting the same star and possessing the same albedo, their equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is inversely proportional to the square root of their orbital distance ($a$). This is because the incoming stellar energy flux decreases with the square of the distance ($1/a^2$), and the planet's radiated energy is proportional to $T_{eq}^4$. In equilibrium, these balance out to give $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$.\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** For planets orbiting the same central star, the square of the orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance ($a$), written as $P^2 \\propto a^3$.\n\n2.  **Derive the Temperature-Period Relationship:** To solve the problem, a direct relationship between temperature and period must be found by eliminating the distance variable ($a$).\n    *   First, we rearrange Kepler's Law to express distance in terms of period: $a \\propto P^{2/3}$.\n    *   Next, we substitute this expression for distance into the equilibrium temperature formula: $T_{eq} \\propto (P^{2/3})^{-1/2}$.\n    *   Using the rules of exponents, we multiply the powers: $(2/3) \\times (-1/2) = -1/3$. This gives the final, critical relationship:\n        $T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n        This shows that equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n3.  **Formulate and Calculate the Specific Ratio:** The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet\\_4 to that of Planet\\_2 ($T_{eq4} / T_{eq2}$).\n    *   Using the derived relationship: $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{P_4}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3}$.\n    *   To simplify calculation with a positive exponent, this is inverted to: $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$.\n    *   From the problem statement, the ratio of orbital periods is $1:2:2.5:3.5:5$. We extract the relative periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4: $P_2 = 2$ and $P_4 = 3.5$.\n    *   Substituting these values into the formula gives: $\\left(\\frac{2}{3.5}\\right)^{1/3} \\approx (0.5714)^{1/3} \\approx 0.82987$.\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the numerical result is **0.83**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Underlying Assumptions:** The entire calculation is valid because the problem states the planets orbit the same star and implicitly assumes they have the same albedo by not providing differing values. These conditions allow various constants to cancel out.\n*   **Correctness of the Derivation:** The core of the solution is the derivation of $T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$. An error here, particularly in the exponent algebra, would invalidate the entire result. The unanimous agreement from all candidates provides high confidence in this step.\n*   **Ratio Inversion:** A very common mistake in these types of problems is forgetting to invert the ratio of periods. Because temperature is *inversely* proportional to the cube root of the period, the temperature ratio ($T_4/T_2$) correctly uses the *inverted* period ratio ($P_2/P_4$) to a positive power.\n*   **Physical Sanity Check:** Planet 4 has a longer period ($P_4=3.5$) than Planet 2 ($P_2=2$), meaning it orbits farther from the star. It must therefore be colder. This means the temperature ratio $T_4/T_2$ must be less than 1. The calculated value of ~0.83 is consistent with this physical reality.\n*   **Contextual Information:** The fact that the planets were found using the Transit Timing Variation (TTV) method explains *why* astronomers know they are in orbital resonance, but this information is not directly used in the calculation itself, as the period ratios are given.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBased on the consistent derivation and calculation across all candidate answers, and confirmed by independent analysis, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately **0.83**.

The result of ~0.83 satisfies this condition, providing a good sanity check.\n*   **Irrelevant Information:** The fact that the planets were discovered using the Transit Timing Variation (TTV) method, while scientifically interesting and consistent with orbital resonance, is not needed for the calculation itself, as the period ratios are directly provided.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided candidate answers and an independent verification of the physics and mathematics, the following step-by-step reasoning leads to the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Consensus Among Candidates:** A review of all candidate answers reveals a unanimous agreement on the fundamental approach and numerical result.\n    *   **Physics:** All candidates correctly identified the two governing physical laws: the law for equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$, where `a` is the orbital distance) and Kepler's Third Law ($P^2 \\propto a^3$, where `P` is the orbital period).\n    *   **Derivation:** All candidates correctly combined these laws to derive the crucial relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature and its orbital period: $T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$.\n    *   **Calculation:** All candidates correctly set up the ratio $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$ and used the given values ($P_2=2$, $P_4=3.5$) to calculate a result of approximately `0.83`.\n    *   **Discrepancy:** The only disagreement among the answers is the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D). This indicates that the multiple-choice options were presented in a different, randomized order to each agent. The unanimous agreement on the numerical value provides extremely high confidence in its correctness.\n\n2.  **Independent Verification of the Solution:**\n    *   **Goal:** Find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures, $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}}$.\n    *   **Given:** Planets orbit the same star, have the same albedo, and have orbital periods with a relative ratio of $1:2:2.5:3.5:5$.\n    *   **Derivation:**\n        1.  Start with the equilibrium temperature relation: $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$.\n        2.  Use Kepler's Third Law to relate distance and period: $P^2 \\propto a^3$, which rearranges to $a \\propto P^{2/3}$.\n        3.  Substitute the expression for distance into the temperature relation: $T_{eq} \\propto (P^{2/3})^{-1/2}$.\n        4.  Simplify the exponents: $(2/3) \\times (-1/2) = -1/3$. This gives the final relationship: $T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$.\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        1.  Formulate the specific ratio based on the inverse proportionality: $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{P_4}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$.\n        2.  Substitute the relative period values: $P_2 = 2$ and $P_4 = 3.5$.\n        3.  Calculate the value:\n            ```python\n            # Calculate the temperature ratio\n            p2 = 2.0\n            p4 = 3.5\n            temperature_ratio = (p2 / p4)**(1/3)\n            print(f\"{temperature_ratio:.4f}\")\n            ```\n            The calculation is $(\\frac{2}{3.5})^{1/3} \\approx 0.8298...$\n    *   **Result:** The calculated value, when rounded to two decimal places, is **0.83**.\n\n3.  **Final Decision:**\n    The verified numerical result of `~0.83` must be matched against the specific options provided in the question.\n    A) ~0.57\n    B) ~0.69\n    C) ~0.83\n    D) ~0.75\n\n    The calculated value directly corresponds to option C.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Underlying Physics:** The entire solution depends on the correct application of the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance ($T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$) and Kepler's Third Law ($P^2 \\propto a^3$). An error in stating or combining these laws would invalidate the result.\n*   **Exponent Algebra:** The multiplication of exponents, $(2/3) \\times (-1/2) = -1/3$, is a critical mathematical step. It is a common point of error in these types of problems.\n*   **Ratio Inversion:** Because temperature is *inversely* proportional to a power of the period, the temperature ratio $T_4/T_2$ is equal to the period ratio raised to a negative power, $(P_4/P_2)^{-1/3}$, which is equivalent to the *inverted* period ratio to a positive power, $(P_2/P_4)^{1/3}$. Forgetting this inversion is a major pitfall.\n*   **Physical Sanity Check:** A simple check provides confidence in the result. Planet_4 has a longer period ($P_4 = 3.5$) than Planet_2 ($P_2 = 2$), which means it orbits further from the star and must be colder. Therefore, the ratio of its temperature to Planet_2's temperature ($T_4/T_2$) must be less than 1. The result `~0.83` satisfies this check.\n*   **Interpreting Agent Consensus:** It is crucial to recognize that the consensus lies in the numerical result (`~0.83`), not the letter choices. The variation in letters is an artifact of scrambled options and must be disregarded.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The fact that the planets were discovered using the \"TTV method\" and are in \"orbital resonance\" is contextual flavor text. While interesting, this information is not required to perform the calculation itself, as the period ratios are given directly.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nAn analysis of the 15 candidate answers shows a unanimous and correct consensus on the physical principles, mathematical derivation, and the final numerical result. The discrepancies in the letter choices (A, B, C, D) are a clear artifact of the multiple-choice options being presented in a different, randomized order to each agent. The scientific and mathematical reasoning is consistent and robust across all answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physical Laws**: The problem requires finding a relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) and its orbital period ($P$). This is achieved by combining two fundamental physical principles:\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature**: For planets with the same albedo orbiting the same star, their equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of their orbital distance ($a$). This is derived from the balance between absorbed stellar energy and radiated thermal energy.\n        $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law**: This law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance ($a$).\n        $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\n2.  **Derive the Temperature-Period Relationship**: To find a direct relationship between temperature and period, we must eliminate the orbital distance variable ($a$) by combining the two laws.\n    *   First, we rearrange Kepler's Law to express distance in terms of period: $a \\propto P^{2/3}$.\n    *   Next, we substitute this into the equilibrium temperature relationship: $T_{eq} \\propto (P^{2/3})^{-1/2}$.\n    *   Using the rules of exponents ($(x^m)^n = x^{m \\cdot n}$), we multiply the powers: $(2/3) \\times (-1/2) = -1/3$. This gives the crucial final relationship:\n        $T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n3.  **Formulate and Calculate the Specific Ratio**: We are asked to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet\\_4 to that of Planet\\_2 ($\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}}$).\n    *   Using the derived relationship, we can write the ratio as: $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{P_4}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3}$.\n    *   To simplify the calculation with a positive exponent, we invert the base: $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$.\n\n4.  **Substitute Given Values and Compute**: The problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as $1:2:2.5:3.5:5$. We extract the relative period values for the two planets in question:\n    *   $P_2 = 2$\n    *   $P_4 = 3.5$\n    *   Substituting these values into the formula:\n        Ratio = $(\\frac{2}{3.5})^{1/3} \\approx (0.5714)^{1/3} \\approx 0.82987$\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the final numerical result is **0.83**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Underlying Physics:** The entire solution hinges on the correct application of the Stefan-Boltzmann law for equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$) and Kepler's Third Law ($P^2 \\propto a^3$).\n*   **Exponent Algebra:** The most critical calculation step is the correct multiplication of the exponents, $(2/3) \\times (-1/2) = -1/3$. All candidate answers performed this step flawlessly.\n*   **Ratio Inversion:** Because temperature is *inversely* proportional to the cube root of the period ($T \\propto P^{-1/3}$), the temperature ratio $T_4/T_2$ corresponds to the *inverted* period ratio to a positive power, $(P_2/P_4)^{1/3}$. Forgetting to invert the base is a common error.\n*   **Physical Sanity Check:** Planet_4 has a longer period than Planet_2 ($3.5 > 2$), which means it must be farther from the star and therefore colder. This implies that the temperature ratio ($T_4/T_2$) must be less than 1. The result of `~0.83` satisfies this logical check.\n*   **Consensus Confidence:** The fact that all 15 candidate answers, operating independently, arrived at the exact same numerical result provides exceptionally high confidence in its correctness. The final letter choice discrepancies can be confidently dismissed as a testing artifact.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe thoroughly vetted and unanimously confirmed numerical value for the ratio is **~0.83**.

This is accomplished by combining two key physical laws:\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature:** For planets with the same properties (albedo) orbiting the same star, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's orbital distance ($a$). This is because the stellar energy a planet receives decreases with the square of the distance ($1/a^2$), and the planet's temperature is related to the fourth root of this energy flux. Thus:\n      $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital period to its orbital distance. For planets orbiting the same star:\n      $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\n2.  **Combine the Laws to Derive the T-P Relationship:** The goal is to create a single equation relating temperature and period by eliminating the distance variable ($a$).\n    *   First, rearrange Kepler's Law to express distance in terms of period: $a \\propto P^{2/3}$.\n    *   Next, substitute this expression for distance into the equilibrium temperature formula: $T_{eq} \\propto (P^{2/3})^{-1/2}$.\n    *   Using the rule for exponents ($(x^m)^n = x^{m \\cdot n}$), multiply the powers: $(2/3) \\times (-1/2) = -1/3$.\n    *   This gives the final, crucial relationship: $T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$. This shows that equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Specific Ratio and Substitute Values:** The question asks for the ratio of the temperature of Planet_4 to that of Planet_2 ($T_{eq4} / T_{eq2}$).\n    *   Using the derived relationship: $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{P_4}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3}$.\n    *   To simplify the calculation with a positive exponent, we invert the base: $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$.\n    *   From the given period ratio `1:2:2.5:3.5:5`, we extract the relative periods: $P_2 = 2$ and $P_4 = 3.5$.\n    *   Substitute these values into the formula: Ratio = $\\left(\\frac{2}{3.5}\\right)^{1/3}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Result:**\n    *   The calculation is $(2 / 3.5)^{1/3} \\approx (0.5714)^{1/3} \\approx 0.82987...$\n    *   Rounding this to two decimal places gives **0.83**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Analysis of Consensus:** All candidate answers unanimously agree on the derived formula ($T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$) and the final numerical result (`~0.83`). The disagreement on the letter choices (A, B, C, D) is an artifact of the agents receiving shuffled options and should be disregarded. The consensus on the number itself is the key takeaway.\n*   **Ratio Inversion:** A critical step is inverting the period ratio when making the exponent positive. Since temperature is *inversely* proportional to a power of the period, the temperature ratio $T_4/T_2$ must be related to the period ratio $P_2/P_4$.\n*   **Physical Sanity Check:** Planet 4 has a longer period ($P_4=3.5$) than Planet 2 ($P_2=2$), meaning it is farther from the star and must be colder. Therefore, the ratio of its temperature to Planet 2's temperature ($T_4/T_2$) must be less than 1. Our result of `~0.83` satisfies this check.\n*   **Exponent Algebra:** The derivation relies on the correct multiplication of exponents: $(2/3) \\times (-1/2) = -1/3$. Any error here would fundamentally change the relationship and the result.\n*   **Irrelevant Information:** The fact that the planets were discovered by the TTV method and are in orbital resonance is interesting context but is not needed for the calculation once the period ratios are given.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe universally confirmed numerical result for the temperature ratio is `~0.83`.
