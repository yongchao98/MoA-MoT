This energy represents the difference between the atom's principal energy levels.\n    *   **Paramagnetic Coupling Energy ($\\langle H \\rangle$):** The energy shift of an electron's orbital due to an external magnetic field ($B=1\\text{T}$). This perturbation is known as the Zeeman effect.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$):** The energy of a photon is given by the Planck-Einstein relation, $\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$.\n    *   For calculations in atomic physics, it is most convenient to use the product of Planck's constant and the speed of light as $hc \\approx 1240 \\, \\text{eV}\\cdot\\text{nm}$.\n    *   First, we must convert the given wavelength from micrometers ($\\mu\\text{m}$) to nanometers (nm): $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 486.1 \\, \\text{nm}$.\n    *   Now we can calculate the energy in electron-volts (eV):\n        $$ \\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\, \\text{eV}\\cdot\\text{nm}}{486.1 \\, \\text{nm}} \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV} $$\n    The transition energy is on the order of `~1 eV`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy ($\\langle H \\rangle$):** The energy shift from the orbital Zeeman effect is given by the formula $\\langle H \\rangle = m \\mu_B B$.\n    *   We are given the magnetic field strength $B = 1 \\, \\text{T}$.\n    *   The problem specifies \"small values of m\". To determine the order of magnitude for a non-zero effect, we can use the representative small integer value, $m=1$.\n    *   The Bohr magneton, $\\mu_B$, is a fundamental physical constant with a value of $\\mu_B \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}$.\n    *   Now, we calculate the energy shift in electron-volts (eV):\n        $$ \\langle H \\rangle = (1) \\times (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}) \\times (1 \\, \\text{T}) \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV} $$\n    The paramagnetic coupling energy is on the order of `~10⁻⁵ eV`.\n\n4.  **Compare the Magnitudes:** We now compare the two calculated energies:\n    *   Transition Energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}$\n    *   Paramagnetic Coupling Energy: $\\langle H \\rangle \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n    The transition energy is vastly larger than the magnetic coupling energy.

Calculate the Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)**\n\nThe energy of a photon is given by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} $$\nFor atomic physics calculations, it is most convenient to use the composite constant $hc \\approx 1240 \\, \\text{eV}\\cdot\\text{nm}$.\n*   First, we convert the wavelength to nanometers (nm) to ensure unit consistency:\n    $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 486.1 \\, \\text{nm}$.\n*   Next, we calculate the energy in electron-volts (eV):\n    $$ \\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\, \\text{eV}\\cdot\\text{nm}}{486.1 \\, \\text{nm}} \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV} $$\nThe transition energy is on the order of a few electron-volts, typical for transitions in the visible spectrum.\n\n**3.

The ratio is approximately:\n$$ \\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.79 \\times 10^{-5}}{2.55} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5} $$\nSince this ratio is extremely small, the transition energy is about five orders of magnitude larger than the paramagnetic coupling energy.

Deconstruct the Physics Problem and Identify Quantities**\n\nThe core of the question is to compare the order of magnitude of two distinct energies for a Hydrogen atom:\n*   **Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$):** This is the energy difference between two electronic states in the atom, corresponding to an emitted or absorbed photon with a specific wavelength, $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$.\n*   **Paramagnetic Coupling Energy ($\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$):** This is the energy shift of an atomic energy level when placed in an external magnetic field ($B = 1\\text{T}$). This is a perturbation known as the Zeeman effect.\n\n**2. Calculate the Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)**\n\nThe energy of a photon is given by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} $$\nFor atomic physics calculations, it is most convenient to use the composite constant $hc \\approx 1240 \\, \\text{eV}\\cdot\\text{nm}$.\n*   First, we convert the wavelength to nanometers (nm) to ensure unit consistency:\n    $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 486.1 \\, \\text{nm}$.\n*   Next, we calculate the energy in electron-volts (eV):\n    $$ \\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\, \\text{eV}\\cdot\\text{nm}}{486.1 \\, \\text{nm}} \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV} $$\nThe transition energy is on the order of a few electron-volts, typical for transitions in the visible spectrum.\n\n**3. Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy ($\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$)**\n\nThe energy shift from the Zeeman effect for an electron's orbital motion is given by:\n$$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = m \\mu_B B $$\n*   We are given the magnetic field strength, $B = 1\\text{T}$.\n*   The problem specifies \"small values of m\" (the orbital magnetic quantum number). To find a characteristic order of magnitude for a non-zero shift, we use the representative small integer value, $m=1$.\n*   The Bohr magneton ($\\mu_B$) is a fundamental constant, with a value of $\\mu_B \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}$.\n*   Now, we calculate the energy shift:\n    $$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = (1) \\times (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}) \\times (1 \\, \\text{T}) \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV} $$\nThe paramagnetic coupling energy is on the order of $10^{-5}$ electron-volts.\n\n**4.

The ratio is approximately:\n$$ \\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.79 \\times 10^{-5}}{2.55} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5} $$\nSince this ratio is extremely small, the transition energy is about five orders of magnitude larger than the paramagnetic coupling energy. The correct physical relationship is that the paramagnetic coupling energy is **much, much less than** the transition energy. This is represented mathematically as:\n$$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E $$\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Unanimous Scientific Conclusion:** A thorough analysis of the 15 candidate answers reveals that every single one performs the correct physical calculations and arrives at the identical scientific conclusion in their reasoning: the paramagnetic coupling energy is many orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy. This provides extremely high confidence in the physical result.\n2.  **Inconsistent Final Letter Choices (The \"Trap\"):** The candidates' final letter choices (A, B, C, D) are scattered.

The final step is to map this correct conclusion to the specific list of options provided in the main question.\n4.  **Justification of \"<<\"**: The vast difference between the energy scales (~$10^0$ eV for the transition vs. ~$10^{-5}$ eV for the magnetic perturbation) fully justifies the use of the \"much, much less than\" symbol ($\\ll$) rather than simply \"less than\" ($<$).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe verified physical relationship is $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll\\Delta E$.
