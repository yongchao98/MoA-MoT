This establishes a solid foundation for the analysis.\n*   **Compound A** (C₃H₆) is identified as **propene** based on its formula and its reaction with bromine.\n*   **Compound B**, the bromination product of propene, is **1,2-dibromopropane**.\n*   **Compound C**, formed by double dehydrohalogenation of B, is **propyne**.\n*   **Compound D**, formed by the cyclic trimerization of propyne, is **1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.\n*   **Compound E**, the nitration product of D, is **2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**.\n*   **Compound F**, the reduction product of E, is **2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesidine)**.\n*   **Compound G**, the diazotization product of F, is the **2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n*   **Compound H**, the hydrolysis product of G, is **2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Each Statement and Identify Careful Points\nThe next step is to evaluate each statement from the question. The provided candidate answers are consistent in their chemical reasoning, even if their final letter choice varies due to differences in the option order they were presented with. The key is to focus on the reasoning.\n\n*   **B) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   **Analysis**: Compound C is propyne. With a boiling point of -23.2 °C, it is a gas at standard room temperature. As a low-molecular-weight hydrocarbon, it is highly flammable.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   **Analysis**: Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. Due to its high symmetry, it has only two types of protons: the three protons on the aromatic ring are chemically equivalent, and the nine protons of the three methyl groups are also chemically equivalent. Neither set has adjacent, non-equivalent protons to cause splitting.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **D) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   **Analysis**: Compound F is an aromatic amine. Primary aromatic amines are fundamental precursors for producing diazonium salts, which are crucial intermediates in the synthesis of a large class of industrial colorants known as azo dyes.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **A) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   **Analysis**: This is the most nuanced point. Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test for phenols typically gives a distinct purple, blue, or green color. The key point here is **steric hindrance**. The two bulky methyl groups at the *ortho*-positions (next to the -OH group) physically block the hydroxyl group from forming the characteristic colored complex with the Fe³⁺ ion.\n    *   **Interpretation of the Test**: Because the reaction is blocked, the test is **negative**. The aqueous ferric chloride reagent is itself pale yellow. A negative test means no new color is formed, and the solution simply retains the yellow color of the unreacted reagent.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The statement that H \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading. It implies a positive reaction occurs to produce a yellow product. In reality, the observation of a yellow color signifies a *lack of reaction* (a negative test). Therefore, the statement is a chemically inaccurate description of the property of Compound H.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This statement is **incorrect**.\n\n### Final Decision\nBased on the consistent and detailed chemical reasoning from all candidate answers, statements B, C, and D are factually correct. Statement A incorrectly describes the outcome of the ferric chloride test for 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The test is negative due to steric hindrance, and the observed color is merely that of the unreacted reagent, not a product of a positive reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis is a step-by-step analysis to determine the incorrect statement among the choices.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Compounds in the Reaction Sequence (A-H)**\n\nFirst, we must correctly identify each compound formed in the multi-step reaction.\n\n1.  **Compound A (C₃H₆)** reacts with Br₂/CCl₄. This is a characteristic reaction of an alkene. Thus, **Compound A is propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂) **.\n2.  The addition of bromine across the double bond of propene yields **Compound B: 1,2-dibromopropane**.\n3.  Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, which is a strong base that promotes a double elimination of HBr (dehydrohalogenation) to form an alkyne. Therefore, **Compound C is propyne (CH₃-C≡CH)**.\n4.  Passing propyne through a red-hot iron tube induces cyclic trimerization, where three alkyne molecules form a stable aromatic ring. The product is **Compound D: 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.\n5.  Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids, which is the standard nitrating mixture (concentrated HNO₃ + concentrated H₂SO₄). This results in the nitration of the aromatic ring, forming **Compound E: 2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**.\n6.  Compound E is treated with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl), a standard method for the reduction of an aromatic nitro group (-NO₂) to an amino group (-NH₂). This forms **Compound F: 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesidine)**.\n7.  Compound F, a primary aromatic amine, reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂) in a diazotization reaction. This converts the amino group into a diazonium salt, **Compound G: the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n8.  The diazonium salt G reacts with NaOH (hydrolysis), replacing the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH). The final product is **Compound H: 2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluate Each Statement**\n\nNow, we evaluate each of the given statements based on the identity and properties of the compounds determined above. The question asks to identify the **incorrect** statement.\n\n*   **A) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a classic test for the phenol functional group, which typically produces a vibrant purple, green, or blue colored complex with Fe³⁺. The aqueous ferric chloride solution itself is pale yellow. However, in compound H, the two bulky methyl groups at the *ortho* positions (adjacent to the -OH group) cause significant steric hindrance. This physical blocking prevents the phenol from forming the characteristic colored complex. Therefore, the test is negative. A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs; the solution simply retains the yellow color of the unreacted reagent. Stating that H \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction is producing a yellow product, which is not what occurs. The chemical property demonstrated is a *lack of reactivity*. Therefore, this statement is **incorrect**.\n\n*   **B) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne. It has a boiling point of -23.2 °C, meaning it is a gas at standard room temperature (~25 °C). As a small hydrocarbon, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **C) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. As a primary aromatic amine, it is a key starting material for creating diazonium salts, which are essential intermediates in the synthesis of a large and important class of industrial dyes known as azo dyes. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **D) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene). This molecule possesses high symmetry. Consequently, there are only two sets of chemically distinct protons: the nine equivalent protons on the three identical methyl groups and the three equivalent protons on the aromatic ring. Since neither set of protons has adjacent, non-equivalent protons to cause splitting, both signals appear as singlets in the ¹H NMR spectrum. This statement is **correct**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nStatements B, C, and D are all chemically correct. The statement in option A incorrectly describes the outcome of the ferric chloride test for Compound H, making it the only incorrect statement in the list.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nA detailed analysis of the problem requires two main steps: first, to accurately determine the identity of each compound in the reaction sequence, and second, to evaluate the four statements about these compounds to find the incorrect one.\n\n### **Step 1: Identifying the Compounds (A-H)**\n\nThe reaction sequence involves several fundamental organic chemistry reactions. Let's trace the path:\n\n*   **Compound A**: The molecular formula is C₃H₆. Its reaction with Br₂ in CCl₄ is a standard test for unsaturation (a double or triple bond), indicating an electrophilic addition. This identifies **A** as an alkene: **propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂)**.\n*   **Compound B**: Bromine adds across the double bond of propene. This forms **B**: **1,2-dibromopropane (CH₃-CH(Br)-CH₂(Br))**.\n*   **Compound C**: Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, a strong base used for elimination reactions. Since B is a vicinal dihalide, it undergoes double dehydrohalogenation (loss of two molecules of HBr) to form an alkyne. This yields **C**: **propyne (CH₃-C≡CH)**.\n*   **Compound D**: Passing propyne through a red-hot iron tube is a classic cyclic trimerization reaction. Three molecules of propyne combine to form a stable aromatic ring. This yields **D**: **1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.\n*   **Compound E**: Mesitylene (D) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids, which is the nitrating mixture (concentrated HNO₃ + concentrated H₂SO₄). This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (nitration) reaction. This yields **E**: **2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**.\n*   **Compound F**: Compound E is treated with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl). This is a standard method for reducing an aromatic nitro group (-NO₂) to a primary amino group (-NH₂). This yields **F**: **2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesidine)**.\n*   **Compound G**: The primary aromatic amine (F) is treated with nitrous acid (HNO₂). This is a diazotization reaction that converts the amino group into a diazonium salt. This yields **G**: **2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n*   **Compound H**: The diazonium salt (G) reacts with NaOH. This condition promotes the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt, where the diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This yields **H**: **2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluating the Statements**\n\nNow, we will evaluate each statement based on the established identity of the compounds.\n\n*   **A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, which is a primary aromatic amine. Aromatic amines are fundamental starting materials for producing a vast class of industrial colorants known as azo dyes, which are formed via diazotization and subsequent coupling reactions.\n    *   **This statement is correct.**\n\n*   **B) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene). This molecule possesses high symmetry. Consequently, there are only two chemically distinct sets of protons: the nine protons of the three equivalent methyl groups and the three protons of the equivalent hydrogens on the aromatic ring. Since neither set of protons has adjacent, non-equivalent protons, they do not split and both appear as singlets.\n    *   **This statement is correct.**\n\n*   **C) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a classic test for the phenol functional group, which typically produces a vibrant violet, blue, or green color due to the formation of a colored iron-phenoxide complex. The ferric chloride (FeCl₃) solution itself is yellow.\n    *   However, in compound H, the two bulky methyl groups at the *ortho* positions (the carbons adjacent to the -OH group) cause significant **steric hindrance**. This physical blocking prevents the hydroxyl group from forming the characteristic colored complex with the ferric ion (Fe³⁺). As a result, the test is negative.\n    *   A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs; the solution simply remains the yellow color of the unreacted reagent. Therefore, stating that H \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction is producing a yellow product, which is not what happens. The chemical property of H is its *lack of reactivity* in this test.\n    *   **This statement is incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne. It has a boiling point of -23.2 °C, which means it exists as a gas at standard room temperature (approx. 25 °C). As a low-molecular-weight hydrocarbon, it is highly flammable.\n    *   **This statement is correct.**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, statements A, B, and D are chemically correct, while statement C is incorrect because it misrepresents the result of a standard chemical test.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify all compounds in the reaction sequence (A-H)**\n\nThis initial step is foundational and was correctly and unanimously solved by all agents.\n\n*   **Compound A (C₃H₆)** reacts with Br₂/CCl₄, indicating it is an alkene. **A is propene**.\n*   The bromine adds across the double bond to form **Compound B: 1,2-dibromopropane**.\n*   Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH in a double dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne, **Compound C: propyne**.\n*   Passing propyne through a red-hot iron tube causes cyclic trimerization, yielding **Compound D: 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.\n*   Compound D reacts with a nitrating mixture (conc. HNO₃ + conc. H₂SO₄) to form **Compound E: 2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**.\n*   The nitro group of E is reduced with Fe/HCl to an amino group, forming **Compound F: 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesidine)**.\n*   Compound F (a primary aromatic amine) undergoes diazotization with nitrous acid to form **Compound G: the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n*   The diazonium salt G is hydrolyzed to form a phenol, **Compound H: 2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluate Each Statement**\n\nWith the identity of each compound established, we can critically evaluate each statement.\n\n*   **A) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne. Its boiling point is -23.2 °C, meaning it is a gas at standard room temperature. As a small hydrocarbon, it is indeed highly flammable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **B) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. Primary aromatic amines are the foundational starting materials for producing diazonium salts, which are then used in coupling reactions to synthesize a vast class of industrial colorants known as azo dyes.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **D) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene). Due to its high molecular symmetry, there are only two chemically distinct types of protons: the three protons on the aromatic ring are equivalent, and the nine protons on the three methyl groups are also equivalent. Neither set has adjacent, non-equivalent protons, so they do not split. The ¹H NMR spectrum therefore correctly shows two singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **C) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a classic test for the phenol functional group, which typically produces a distinct violet, green, or blue color upon forming a complex with Fe³⁺. The FeCl₃ solution itself is yellow.\n    *   **Crucial Point (Steric Hindrance):** In Compound H, the two bulky methyl groups at the *ortho*-positions (adjacent to the -OH group) physically block the hydroxyl group. This **steric hindrance** prevents the phenol from forming the characteristic colored complex with the ferric ion.\n    *   As a result, the test is **negative**. A negative test means no reaction occurs, and the solution simply retains the yellow color of the unreacted reagent (FeCl₃). The statement that H \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction is producing a yellow product, which is not what happens. The chemical property demonstrated is the *lack of reactivity*.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This statement is **incorrect**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nStatements A, B, and D describe correct chemical facts about the compounds in the sequence. Statement C is incorrect because it misrepresents the result of the ferric chloride test for 2,4,6-trimethylphenol; the test is negative due to steric hindrance.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe task requires a two-step approach: first, to deduce the identity of each compound (A through H) in the described reaction sequence, and second, to evaluate the four statements about these compounds to identify the one that is factually incorrect.\n\n**1. Identification of the Compounds**\n\n*   **Compound A to B**: Compound A (C₃H₆) is an alkene, **propene**. Its bromination adds Br₂ across the double bond to form **Compound B**, which is **1,2-dibromopropane**.\n*   **Compound B to C**: Reacting 1,2-dibromopropane with alcoholic KOH (a strong base) causes double dehydrohalogenation (elimination of two HBr molecules). This produces an alkyne, **Compound C**, which is **propyne** (CH₃-C≡CH).\n*   **Compound C to D**: Passing an alkyne like propyne through a red-hot iron tube is a classic cyclic trimerization reaction. Three molecules of propyne combine to form a symmetrical aromatic compound, **Compound D**, which is **1,3,5-trimethylbenzene** (also known as mesitylene).\n*   **Compound D to E**: Mesitylene is treated with a mixture of two strong acids, which is the standard nitrating mixture (concentrated HNO₃ and H₂SO₄). This electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction yields **Compound E**, **2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**.\n*   **Compound E to F**: The nitro group is reduced to an amino group using iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl). This reaction produces **Compound F**, **2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene** (also known as mesidine).\n*   **Compound F to G**: A primary aromatic amine like Compound F reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂) in a diazotization reaction. This converts the amino group into a diazonium salt, forming **Compound G**, the **2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n*   **Compound G to H**: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed by reaction with NaOH (in a warmed aqueous solution), which replaces the diazonium group (-N₂⁺) with a hydroxyl group (-OH). The final product, **Compound H**, is **2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n**2. Evaluation of the Statements**\n\nNow, we evaluate each statement based on the established identity of the compounds.\n\n*   **A) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. This molecule has a high degree of symmetry. All three methyl groups are chemically equivalent, and so are their nine protons. These protons do not have any non-equivalent neighboring protons to split with, so they produce a single, sharp signal (a singlet). Similarly, the three protons on the aromatic ring are all chemically equivalent and will also produce a singlet. Therefore, the ¹H NMR spectrum correctly shows two singlets. **This statement is correct.**\n\n*   **B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for the phenol functional group, which typically produces a distinct purple, blue, or green colored complex. The ferric chloride reagent itself is a yellow solution.\n    *   In compound H, the hydroxyl group is flanked by two bulky methyl groups at the *ortho*-positions (positions 2 and 6). This causes significant **steric hindrance**, physically preventing the hydroxyl group from forming the characteristic colored complex with the ferric ion (Fe³⁺).\n    *   Because no complex forms, the test is considered **negative**. In a negative test, no color change occurs, and the solution simply retains the pale yellow color of the unreacted reagent. The statement that H \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction is producing a yellow product. In reality, the observation of a yellow color indicates the *absence* of a reaction. **This statement is incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne. Its boiling point is -23.2 °C, which is well below standard room temperature. Therefore, it exists as a gas. As a small hydrocarbon, it is highly flammable. **This statement is correct.**\n\n*   **D) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, a primary aromatic amine. Aromatic amines are fundamental starting materials for producing a large class of commercial colorants known as azo dyes, via diazotization and subsequent coupling reactions. **This statement is correct.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nStatements A, C, and D are all chemically correct. Statement B is incorrect because it misrepresents the result of the ferric chloride test for 2,4,6-trimethylphenol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identification of the Compounds in the Reaction Sequence (A-H)**\n    The first step is to correctly determine the structure of each compound formed in the multi-step reaction.\n\n    *   **Compound A**: The molecular formula C₃H₆ and its addition reaction with Br₂/CCl₄ identify it as an alkene. Thus, **A is propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂)**.\n    *   **Compound B**: Bromine adds across the double bond of propene to form the vicinal dihalide, **B: 1,2-dibromopropane (CH₃-CH(Br)-CH₂(Br))**.\n    *   **Compound C**: B reacts with alcoholic KOH, a strong base that causes double dehydrohalogenation (elimination of two molecules of HBr) to form an alkyne. Thus, **C is propyne (CH₃-C≡CH)**.\n    *   **Compound D**: Passing an alkyne like propyne through a red-hot iron tube results in a cyclic trimerization reaction. Three molecules of propyne combine to form the stable, symmetrical aromatic compound, **D: 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.\n    *   **Compound E**: D is treated with a mixture of two strong acids, which is the standard nitrating mixture (concentrated HNO₃ + concentrated H₂SO₄). This results in an electrophilic aromatic substitution to give **E: 2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**.\n    *   **Compound F**: The reaction of E with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl) is a standard method for the reduction of an aromatic nitro group (-NO₂) to a primary amino group (-NH₂). This forms **F: 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesidine)**.\n    *   **Compound G**: F, a primary aromatic amine, reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂, typically from NaNO₂/HCl) in a diazotization reaction to form the corresponding diazonium salt, **G: 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n    *   **Compound H**: The diazonium salt (G) is unstable and, upon reaction with NaOH (in an aqueous solution with warming), hydrolyzes to replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, forming a phenol. Thus, **H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n2.  **Evaluation of the Statements**\n    Now, with the identities of all compounds confirmed, we evaluate each of the given statements.\n\n    *   **A) C is a flammable gas.**\n        *   Compound C is propyne. It has a boiling point of -23.2 °C, meaning it is a gas at standard room temperature (~25 °C). As a small hydrocarbon, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n    *   **B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n        *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a classic test for the phenol functional group, which typically produces a vibrant purple, blue, or green colored complex with the Fe³⁺ ion.\n        *   **Careful Point**: The test can be affected by steric hindrance. In compound H, the two large methyl groups at the *ortho* positions (the carbons adjacent to the -OH group) physically block the hydroxyl group, preventing it from forming the colored complex with the ferric ion. As a result, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol gives a **negative** ferric chloride test.\n        *   Since the aqueous ferric chloride solution is itself yellow, a negative test means no characteristic color change occurs; the solution simply remains the yellow color of the unreacted reagent. Stating that H \"gives a yellow color\" is highly misleading because it implies a positive reaction is producing a yellow product, when in fact the observation signifies a *lack* of reactivity. Therefore, this statement about the chemical property of H is **incorrect**.\n\n    *   **C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n        *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. Due to its high molecular symmetry, it has only two chemically distinct sets of protons: the three protons on the aromatic ring are equivalent, and the nine protons of the three methyl groups are also equivalent. Since neither set of protons has adjacent, non-equivalent protons to cause splitting, both signals appear as singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n    *   **D) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n        *   Compound F is 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, a primary aromatic amine. Aromatic amines are fundamental precursors for synthesizing a vast class of industrial colorants known as azo dyes, which are formed via diazotization and coupling reactions. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nStatements A, C, and D are all correct descriptions of the chemical compounds and their properties. Statement B is incorrect because it inaccurately describes the outcome of the ferric chloride test on the sterically hindered phenol (H).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of a multi-stage organic chemistry reaction sequence, followed by an evaluation of statements about the products.\n\n**Part 1: Identifying the Compounds (A-H)**\n\n1.  **Compound A to B**: Compound A (C₃H₆) reacts with Br₂ in CCl₄. The molecular formula CnH2n and the reaction with bromine indicate A is an alkene. Thus, **A is propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂) **. The addition of bromine across the double bond yields **B, 1,2-dibromopropane**.\n2.  **Compound B to C**: Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, which is a strong base used for dehydrohalogenation. Since B is a vicinal dihalide, a double elimination reaction occurs, removing two molecules of HBr to form an alkyne. Thus, **C is propyne (CH₃-C≡CH)**.\n3.  **Compound C to D**: Passing propyne through a red-hot iron tube is a classic cyclic trimerization reaction. Three molecules of propyne combine to form a symmetrical aromatic compound. Thus, **D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.\n4.  **Compound D to E**: Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids (a nitrating mixture of concentrated HNO₃ and H₂SO₄). This results in electrophilic aromatic substitution (nitration). Thus, **E is 2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**.\n5.  **Compound E to F**: Compound E reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl). This is a standard method for the reduction of an aromatic nitro group (-NO₂) to an amino group (-NH₂). Thus, **F is 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesidine)**.\n6.  **Compound F to G**: Compound F, a primary aromatic amine, reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂) in a diazotization reaction. Thus, **G is the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n7.  **Compound G to H**: Compound G reacts with sodium hydroxide (implying hydrolysis in an aqueous solution). The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). Thus, **H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n**Part 2: Evaluating the Statements**\n\nNow, we assess each statement based on the identities of the compounds.\n\n*   **A) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne. It has a boiling point of -23.2 °C, meaning it is a gas at standard room temperature. As a small hydrocarbon, it is highly flammable.\n    *   This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **B) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, a primary aromatic amine. Aromatic amines are fundamental starting materials for producing a large class of colorants known as azo dyes through diazotization and coupling reactions.\n    *   This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **C) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, which typically produce a vibrant violet, blue, or green colored complex. The ferric chloride solution itself is yellow. However, in compound H, the two methyl groups at the ortho-positions (adjacent to the -OH group) cause significant steric hindrance. This physical blocking prevents the phenol from forming the colored complex with the ferric ion. As a result, the test is negative. A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs; the solution simply remains the yellow color of the unreacted reagent. The statement that H \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction produces a yellow product, when in fact the yellow color signifies a lack of reaction.\n    *   This statement is **incorrect**.\n\n*   **D) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene). Due to its high molecular symmetry, there are only two chemically distinct sets of protons: the nine protons of the three equivalent methyl groups and the three protons of the equivalent hydrogens on the aromatic ring. Since neither set of protons has adjacent, non-equivalent protons, they do not split and both appear as singlets.\n    *   This statement is **correct**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nStatements A, B, and D are all chemically correct. The question asks to identify the incorrect statement, which is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of the Problem**\n\n**1. Identification of Chemical Compounds (A-H)**\nFirst, we must trace the reaction sequence to identify each compound. The logic provided by the candidate answers is sound and based on standard organic chemistry reactions.\n*   **Compound A**: The formula C₃H₆ combined with the bromination reaction points to an alkene. **A is propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂)**.\n*   **Compound B**: Bromine adds across the double bond of propene to form **B, 1,2-dibromopropane**.\n*   **Compound C**: Double dehydrohalogenation of B with alcoholic KOH produces an alkyne. **C is propyne (CH₃-C≡CH)**.\n*   **Compound D**: Passing propyne through a red-hot iron tube causes cyclic trimerization, yielding an aromatic compound. **D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.\n*   **Compound E**: Nitration of D (an activated aromatic ring) with strong acids yields **E, 2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**.\n*   **Compound F**: The reduction of the nitro group in E with Fe/HCl gives a primary amine. **F is 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesidine)**.\n*   **Compound G**: The diazotization of the primary amine F with nitrous acid yields a diazonium salt. **G is the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n*   **Compound H**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt G replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group. **H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n**2. Evaluation of the Statements**\nNow, we must carefully evaluate each of the four statements from the original question based on the established identities of the compounds. The candidate answers show unanimous agreement on the properties of these compounds.\n\n*   **A) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a classic test for the phenol functional group, which typically produces a distinct purple, blue, or green colored complex. An aqueous solution of the ferric chloride reagent is itself pale yellow.\n    *   In compound H, the two bulky methyl groups at the *ortho*-positions (next to the -OH group) cause significant **steric hindrance**. This physical blocking prevents the phenol from forming the characteristic colored complex with the Fe³⁺ ion.\n    *   Therefore, the test is **negative**. A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs; the solution simply remains the yellow color of the unreacted reagent.\n    *   The statement that H \"gives a yellow color\" is highly misleading. It implies a positive reaction is producing a yellow product, which is not what happens. The key chemical property demonstrated is the *lack of reactivity* in this standard test. Thus, the statement is chemically **incorrect**.\n\n*   **B) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne. It has a boiling point of -23.2 °C, meaning it is a gas at standard room temperature. As a low-molecular-weight hydrocarbon, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **C) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, a primary aromatic amine. Aromatic amines are fundamental starting materials for producing a large class of industrial colorants known as azo dyes, which are synthesized via diazotization and subsequent coupling reactions. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **D) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. Due to its high molecular symmetry, there are only two chemically distinct sets of protons: the nine protons of the three equivalent methyl groups and the three equivalent protons on the aromatic ring. Neither set of protons has adjacent, non-equivalent protons, so both signals appear as unsplit singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe analysis confirms that statements B, C, and D are all chemically correct descriptions of the products. Statement A is the only one that is incorrect because it misrepresents the outcome of the ferric chloride test on the sterically hindered phenol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis analysis will proceed in two main stages: first, identifying the chemical compounds produced at each step of the reaction sequence, and second, evaluating the truthfulness of each of the four given statements.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of Compounds (A-H)\n\nThis multi-step synthesis involves a series of standard organic chemistry reactions.\n1.  **Compound A to B**: The molecular formula C₃H₆ represents an alkene or a cyclopropane. The reaction with bromine in carbon tetrachloride (Br₂/CCl₄) is a characteristic electrophilic addition to a C=C double bond, confirming that **Compound A is propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂) **. The addition of Br₂ across the double bond yields **Compound B, 1,2-dibromopropane**.\n2.  **Compound B to C**: Reacting 1,2-dibromopropane with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH), a strong base, causes the elimination of two molecules of hydrogen bromide (HBr). This double dehydrohalogenation reaction forms an alkyne. Therefore, **Compound C is propyne (CH₃-C≡CH)**.\n3.  **Compound C to D**: Passing propyne gas through a red-hot iron tube is a classic cyclic trimerization reaction. Three molecules of propyne combine to form a stable aromatic ring, resulting in **Compound D, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (also known as mesitylene)**.\n4.  **Compound D to E**: Mesitylene is treated with a mixture of two strong acids, which is the standard nitrating mixture (concentrated nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid). This performs an electrophilic aromatic substitution, adding a nitro group (-NO₂) to the ring, yielding **Compound E, 2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**.\n5.  **Compound E to F**: The reaction with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl) is a standard method for the reduction of an aromatic nitro group to a primary amino group (-NH₂). This converts E into **Compound F, 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (also known as mesidine)**.\n6.  **Compound F to G**: This primary aromatic amine is treated with nitrous acid (HNO₂), which is typically generated in situ from NaNO₂ and a strong acid like HCl. This is a diazotization reaction, which converts the amino group into a diazonium salt, **Compound G, the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n7.  **Compound G to H**: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed by reaction with NaOH (implying heating in an aqueous solution). The diazonium group (-N₂⁺) is an excellent leaving group and is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH), forming **Compound H, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluation of the Statements\n\nNow, we critically evaluate each of the four statements about these compounds.\n\n*   **A) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. This molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry. Due to this symmetry, there are only two chemically distinct types of protons: 1) the three protons on the aromatic ring, which are equivalent, and 2) the nine protons on the three methyl groups, which are also equivalent. Since neither group of protons has adjacent, non-equivalent protons, they do not split each other. Therefore, the spectrum consists of exactly two sharp, unsplit signals (singlets). This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic chemical test for the phenol functional group, which typically produces a vibrant purple, green, or blue colored complex with Fe³⁺ ions. However, in Compound H, the two large methyl groups at the *ortho* positions (positions 2 and 6, adjacent to the -OH group) cause significant **steric hindrance**. This physical blocking prevents the hydroxyl group from forming the colored complex with the ferric ion. Consequently, the test is negative. An aqueous solution of ferric chloride (FeCl₃) is itself pale yellow. A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs; the solution simply remains the yellow color of the unreacted reagent. The statement that H \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction is occurring to produce a yellow product. In reality, the observed yellow color signifies a *lack of reaction* (a negative test). Thus, the statement is chemically **incorrect**.\n\n*   **C) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne. It has a very low boiling point of -23.2 °C, meaning it is a gas at standard room temperature. Like other low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **D) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, a primary aromatic amine. Aromatic amines are fundamental starting materials for producing a vast class of industrial colorants known as azo dyes. The synthesis involves converting the amine to a diazonium salt (like Compound G), which is then coupled with another aromatic compound. This statement is **correct**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nStatements A, C, and D are all chemically correct. Statement B is the only one that is incorrect, as it misrepresents the outcome of the ferric chloride test on a sterically hindered phenol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### Step 1: Trace the Reaction Pathway\n\nThe first and most critical step is to correctly identify each compound in the multi-step reaction. There is a strong and unanimous consensus among all candidate answers regarding the identity of each compound.\n\n*   **Compound A (C₃H₆)** is **propene**, an alkene.\n*   **Compound B** is the bromination product, **1,2-dibromopropane**.\n*   **Compound C** is formed by double dehydrohalogenation of B, resulting in the alkyne **propyne**.\n*   **Compound D** is formed by the cyclic trimerization of propyne in a red-hot iron tube, yielding **1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.\n*   **Compound E** is the nitration product of D, **2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**.\n*   **Compound F** is the reduction product of E, **2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesidine)**.\n*   **Compound G** is the diazotization product of F, the **2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n*   **Compound H** is formed by the hydrolysis of G, resulting in **2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Each Statement\n\nWith the compounds correctly identified, each statement from the original question can be critically evaluated. The analysis below synthesizes the consensus reasoning from all provided answers.\n\n*   **A) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   **Compound H** is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a standard chemical test for the phenol functional group. A positive result is the formation of a distinct violet, green, or blue colored complex.\n    *   The ferric chloride reagent solution is itself yellow.\n    *   In Compound H, the two methyl groups at the *ortho*-positions (adjacent to the -OH group) cause significant **steric hindrance**. This physical bulkiness prevents the phenol from complexing with the ferric ion (Fe³⁺).\n    *   As a result, the characteristic color change does not occur, and the test is considered **negative**. When the test is negative, the solution simply retains the original yellow color of the unreacted ferric chloride reagent.\n    *   The statement is misleading because it implies a positive reaction occurs to produce a yellow color. In fact, the observation of a yellow color indicates a *lack of reaction*. Therefore, the statement is chemically **incorrect**.\n\n*   **B) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   **Compound C** is propyne. It has a boiling point of -23.2 °C, meaning it is a gas at standard room temperature. As a small hydrocarbon, it is highly flammable.\n    *   This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **C) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   **Compound F** is 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, which is a primary aromatic amine. Such amines are fundamental precursors for a large class of industrial colorants known as azo dyes, which are formed via diazotization and coupling reactions.\n    *   This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **D) D gives two singlets in the ¹H NMR spectra.**\n    *   **Compound D** is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene). Due to the molecule's high symmetry, there are only two chemically distinct sets of protons: the nine protons on the three equivalent methyl groups and the three protons on the aromatic ring. Since neither set of protons has adjacent, non-equivalent protons to cause spin-spin splitting, both signals appear as sharp singlets.\n    *   This statement is **correct**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis reveals that the statements presented in options B, C, and D are all chemically correct. The statement in option A incorrectly describes the outcome of a standard chemical test. The failure of 2,4,6-trimethylphenol to give a positive ferric chloride test is a key chemical property related to steric hindrance, and misinterpreting the result makes this statement the incorrect one.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, based on a synthesis of the provided candidate responses.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of the Compounds in the Reaction Sequence\nAll candidate answers correctly deduce the same reaction pathway. This consensus provides a strong foundation for analysis.\n\n1.  **Compound A (C₃H₆)** reacts with bromine, indicating it is an alkene. **A is propene**.\n2.  The addition of Br₂ across the double bond forms **Compound B, 1,2-dibromopropane**.\n3.  Reaction of B with alcoholic KOH causes double elimination (dehydrohalogenation) to form an alkyne. **Compound C is propyne**.\n4.  Passing propyne through a red-hot iron tube causes cyclic trimerization. **Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.\n5.  Reaction of D with two strong acids (a nitrating mixture) yields **Compound E, 2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**.\n6.  Reduction of the nitro group in E with Fe/HCl forms a primary amine. **Compound F is 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesidine)**.\n7.  Diazotization of F with nitrous acid yields **Compound G, the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n8.  Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt G replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group, forming **Compound H, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluation of Each Statement\nWith the identities of the compounds established, each statement from the original question is evaluated.\n\n*   **A) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne. Its boiling point is -23.2 °C, which is well below standard room temperature. Therefore, it is a gas. As a low-molecular-weight hydrocarbon, it is highly flammable.\n    *   This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **B) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, a primary aromatic amine. Such amines are fundamental precursors for synthesizing diazonium salts, which are then used in coupling reactions to produce a vast class of commercial colorants known as azo dyes.\n    *   This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. Due to its high molecular symmetry, there are only two chemically distinct sets of protons: the nine protons of the three equivalent methyl groups and the three protons of the equivalent hydrogens on the aromatic ring.

Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for the phenol functional group, which typically produces a vibrant violet, blue, or green colored complex. An aqueous solution of the ferric chloride reagent is itself pale yellow.\n    *   In Compound H, the two bulky methyl groups at the *ortho*-positions (adjacent to the -OH group) cause significant **steric hindrance**.

The statement that H \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction is producing a yellow product. In reality, the observation of yellow color indicates a *lack of reaction*. Therefore, the statement is chemically **incorrect**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nStatements A, B, and C are all chemically correct descriptions of the compounds. Statement D incorrectly describes the outcome of the ferric chloride test on compound H due to a misunderstanding of a negative test result caused by steric hindrance.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the reasoning provided by the other agents.\n\n### Step 1: Trace the Chemical Reaction Sequence\n\nThe first step, as correctly and unanimously identified by all agents, is to determine the structure of each compound in the reaction pathway.\n\n*   **Compound A (C₃H₆)** is **propene**. Its formula fits CₙH₂ₙ and it undergoes bromination, which is characteristic of an alkene.\n*   **Compound B** is the product of bromine adding across the double bond of propene, resulting in **1,2-dibromopropane**.\n*   **Compound C** is formed by double dehydrohalogenation of B with alcoholic KOH. This elimination reaction produces an alkyne, **propyne**.\n*   **Compound D** is formed by the cyclic trimerization of three molecules of propyne in a red-hot iron tube. This is a classic reaction that produces **1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.\n*   **Compound E** is the nitration product of D. The mixture of two strong acids is the nitrating mixture (conc. HNO₃ + conc. H₂SO₄), which yields **2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**.\n*   **Compound F** is the reduction product of E. Iron scrap and HCl reduce the nitro group (-NO₂) to an amino group (-NH₂), forming **2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesidine)**.\n*   **Compound G** is the diazotization product of F. Nitrous acid converts the primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt, **the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n*   **Compound H** is the hydrolysis product of G. The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, yielding **2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Each Statement\n\nThe next step is to analyze each of the four statements to find the one that is incorrect.\n\n*   **A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, a primary aromatic amine. Aromatic amines are fundamental precursors for producing a large class of industrial colorants known as azo dyes via diazotization and coupling reactions. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for the phenol functional group, which typically produces a distinct violet, green, or blue colored complex with Fe³⁺. The ferric chloride solution itself is yellow.\n    *   In compound H, the two bulky methyl groups at the *ortho*-positions (adjacent to the -OH group) cause significant **steric hindrance**. This physical blocking prevents the hydroxyl group from forming the colored complex with the ferric ion. As a result, the test is negative.\n    *   A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs; the solution simply remains the yellow color of the unreacted reagent. The statement that H \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction is producing a yellow product, which is not what happens. The chemical property being observed is a *lack of reactivity*. This statement is **incorrect**.\n\n*   **C) D gives two singlets in the ¹H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene). Due to its high molecular symmetry, there are only two chemically distinct sets of protons: the nine protons of the three equivalent methyl groups, and the three equivalent protons on the aromatic ring. Since neither set of protons has adjacent, non-equivalent protons, they do not split and both appear as singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **D) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne. It has a boiling point of -23.2 °C, meaning it is a gas at standard room temperature. Like other low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n1.  **Correct Identification:** The entire problem depends on correctly identifying all eight compounds in the sequence. Any error here would lead to an incorrect conclusion.\n2.  **Steric Hindrance:** The key to the incorrect statement lies in understanding the concept of steric hindrance. The bulky groups around the reactive site (-OH group in compound H) prevent the reaction (complex formation with FeCl₃) from occurring.\n3.  **Interpretation of a \"Negative Test\":** A critical point is correctly interpreting the result of a negative chemical test. The yellow color observed is not a product of a reaction involving compound H, but rather the color of the unreacted FeCl₃ reagent. Therefore, stating that H \"gives\" a yellow color is a chemically inaccurate description of the event.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the thorough analysis, statements A, C, and D are factually correct descriptions of the compounds involved. Statement B is incorrect because it misrepresents the outcome of the ferric chloride test on the sterically hindered phenol, H.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Trace the Reaction Sequence to Identify Compounds A through H\n\nThe foundation of solving this problem is to correctly identify each compound formed in the reaction sequence. All provided analyses agree on this pathway, which is based on standard organic chemistry reactions.\n\n1.  **Compound A (C₃H₆) to B**: Compound A is an alkene, **propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂) **. Its reaction with bromine (Br₂) in carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄) is an electrophilic addition, forming **Compound B: 1,2-dibromopropane**.\n2.  **Compound B to C**: Reacting 1,2-dibromopropane with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH) causes a double dehydrohalogenation (elimination of two HBr molecules), yielding **Compound C: propyne (CH₃-C≡CH)**.\n3.  **Compound C to D**: Passing propyne through a red-hot iron tube triggers cyclic trimerization, forming the symmetrical aromatic ring **Compound D: 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.\n4.  **Compound D to E**: Mesitylene reacts with a nitrating mixture (concentrated nitric acid and sulfuric acid) in an electrophilic aromatic substitution to give **Compound E: 2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**.\n5.  **Compound E to F**: The nitro group is reduced to an amino group using iron (Fe) scrap and hydrochloric acid (HCl), yielding **Compound F: 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesidine)**.\n6.  **Compound F to G**: This primary aromatic amine undergoes diazotization with nitrous acid (HNO₂) to form **Compound G: the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n7.  **Compound G to H**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt (with NaOH, indicating a warm, aqueous environment) replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, resulting in **Compound H: 2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Each Statement\n\nWith the structures of all compounds identified, we can now critically evaluate each of the four statements.\n\n*   **A) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. This molecule has a high degree of symmetry (a C₃ axis). Due to this symmetry, there are only two chemically distinct sets of protons: the nine protons on the three equivalent methyl groups and the three protons on the aromatic ring. Since neither set of protons has adjacent, non-equivalent protons, they do not undergo spin-spin splitting. Therefore, the spectrum consists of exactly two singlets.\n    *   **This statement is correct.**\n\n*   **B) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, a primary aromatic amine. Primary aromatic amines are essential precursors for a vast class of commercial colorants known as azo dyes. They are converted into diazonium salts (like Compound G), which then undergo coupling reactions to form the brightly colored azo compounds.\n    *   **This statement is correct.**\n\n*   **C) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne. It has a boiling point of -23.2 °C, which is well below standard room temperature (~25 °C). This means it exists as a gas under normal conditions. As a small hydrocarbon, it is highly flammable.\n    *   **This statement is correct.**\n\n*   **D) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride (FeCl₃) test is a characteristic chemical test for the phenol functional group, which typically produces a vibrant violet, blue, or green colored complex. An aqueous solution of FeCl₃ is itself pale yellow.\n    *   However, in Compound H, the two bulky methyl groups at the *ortho*-positions (positions 2 and 6, adjacent to the -OH group) cause significant **steric hindrance**. This physical blocking prevents the hydroxyl group from forming the colored complex with the ferric ion (Fe³⁺). As a result, the test is negative.\n    *   A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs; the solution simply remains the pale yellow color of the unreacted FeCl₃ reagent. The statement that H \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction is occurring to produce a yellow product. In reality, the observed yellow color signifies a *lack of reaction*. Therefore, from a chemical standpoint, the statement is incorrect as it misrepresents the chemical properties of compound H.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nStatements A, B, and C describe correct chemical properties of the compounds in the sequence. Statement D is incorrect because it inaccurately describes the outcome of the ferric chloride test on 2,4,6-trimethylphenol, where a negative result is obtained due to steric hindrance.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identification of the Reaction Products**\n\nThe first step is to correctly identify each compound in the reaction sequence. There is a complete consensus among all candidate answers on the identities of these compounds, which are derived from standard organic chemistry reactions.\n\n*   **Compound A**: C₃H₆ that undergoes bromination is an alkene, specifically **propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂) **.\n*   **Compound B**: The addition of bromine to propene gives **1,2-dibromopropane**.\n*   **Compound C**: Double dehydrohalogenation of B with alcoholic KOH produces an alkyne, **propyne (CH₃-C≡CH)**.\n*   **Compound D**: Cyclic trimerization of propyne in a red-hot iron tube yields the symmetrical aromatic compound **1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.\n*   **Compound E**: Nitration of mesitylene produces **2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**.\n*   **Compound F**: Reduction of the nitro group in E with Fe/HCl gives a primary aromatic amine, **2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesidine)**.\n*   **Compound G**: Diazotization of F with nitrous acid yields the **2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n*   **Compound H**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt G replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group, forming **2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n**2. Evaluation of Each Statement**\n\nThe next step is to evaluate each of the four statements based on the chemical properties of the identified compounds.\n\n*   **A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, a primary aromatic amine. Aromatic amines are fundamental starting materials for producing a vast class of industrial colorants known as azo dyes through diazotization and coupling reactions.\n    *   This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **B) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. Due to its high molecular symmetry, it has only two chemically distinct types of protons: the nine protons of the three equivalent methyl groups and the three equivalent protons on the aromatic ring. Since neither set of protons has adjacent, non-equivalent protons, they do not split and appear as two separate singlets.\n    *   This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **C) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a classic test for the phenol functional group, which typically produces a distinct purple, green, or blue colored complex with the Fe³⁺ ion. The aqueous ferric chloride reagent itself is pale yellow.\n    *   **Crucial Point (Steric Hindrance):** In Compound H, the two bulky methyl groups at the *ortho*-positions (the carbons adjacent to the -OH group) physically block the hydroxyl group, preventing it from forming the characteristic colored complex with the ferric ion. Therefore, the test is **negative**.\n    *   A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs; the solution simply retains the pale yellow color of the unreacted reagent. The statement \"H gives a yellow color\" is highly misleading because it implies a positive reaction is occurring to produce a yellow product, when in fact, the yellow color indicates a *lack* of reaction.\n    *   This statement is **incorrect**.\n\n*   **D) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne. It has a boiling point of -23.2 °C, meaning it is a gas at standard room temperature. Like other low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons, it is highly flammable.\n    *   This statement is **correct**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis confirms that statements A, B, and D are all chemically correct. The statement that is incorrect is C, as it inaccurately describes the outcome of the ferric chloride test for 2,4,6-trimethylphenol due to a misunderstanding of steric hindrance and the nature of a negative chemical test.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Trace the reaction pathway and identify all compounds (A-H).**\n    *   **Compound A (C₃H₆)** reacts with Br₂ in CCl₄. This is an addition reaction characteristic of an alkene. Therefore, **A is propene**.\n    *   **Compound B** is the addition product of bromine to propene, which is **1,2-dibromopropane**.\n    *   **Compound C** is formed by treating B with alcoholic KOH. This is a double dehydrohalogenation reaction (elimination of 2 HBr molecules) to form an alkyne. Therefore, **C is propyne**.\n    *   **Compound D** is formed by passing propyne (C) through a red-hot iron tube. This is a classic cyclic trimerization reaction. Three molecules of propyne combine to form a symmetrical aromatic compound, **1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.\n    *   **Compound E** is formed by reacting D with a mixture of two strong acids (the nitrating mixture: concentrated HNO₃ and H₂SO₄). This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (nitration). The product is **2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**.\n    *   **Compound F** is formed by the reduction of E with iron scrap and HCl. This reaction reduces the nitro group (-NO₂) to an amino group (-NH₂). The product is **2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesidine)**.\n    *   **Compound G** is formed by the reaction of the primary aromatic amine F with nitrous acid (HNO₂). This is a diazotization reaction, forming **the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n    *   **Compound H** is formed by the reaction of the diazonium salt G with sodium hydroxide. This causes hydrolysis, replacing the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The final product is **2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n2.  **Evaluate each statement based on the identity of the compounds.**\n\n    *   **A) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n        *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. This molecule is highly symmetrical. Due to this symmetry, the nine protons on the three methyl groups are chemically equivalent and produce a single signal. The three protons on the aromatic ring are also equivalent. Since neither group has adjacent, non-equivalent protons, they do not undergo splitting. The spectrum therefore consists of exactly two singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n    *   **B) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n        *   Compound F is 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, a primary aromatic amine. Primary aromatic amines are essential precursors for the synthesis of diazonium salts (like compound G), which are key intermediates in the production of a large and important class of industrial dyes known as azo dyes. This statement is **correct**.\n\n    *   **C) C is a flammable gas.**\n        *   Compound C is propyne. It has a very low boiling point of -23.2 °C, meaning it is a gas at standard room temperature and pressure. Like other small hydrocarbons, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n    *   **D) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n        *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic chemical test for the phenol functional group. A positive result is the formation of a distinct violet, green, or blue colored complex with the Fe³⁺ ion. The test reagent itself, an aqueous solution of ferric chloride, is pale yellow.\n        *   In Compound H, the two methyl groups at the *ortho* positions (positions 2 and 6, adjacent to the -OH group) are bulky and cause significant **steric hindrance**. This physical blockage prevents the hydroxyl group from forming the characteristic colored complex with the iron ion.\n        *   Therefore, the test is negative. When a test is negative, no new color is produced, and the solution simply retains the pale yellow color of the unreacted reagent. The statement that H \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction is occurring to produce a yellow product. In reality, the observed yellow color signifies a *lack of reaction*. Thus, the statement is chemically **incorrect**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nStatements A, B, and C are all correct. The only incorrect statement is D because 2,4,6-trimethylphenol gives a negative ferric chloride test due to steric hindrance.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

The ferric chloride (FeCl₃) test is a characteristic test for the phenol functional group, which typically produces a distinct violet, blue, or green colored complex. The aqueous FeCl₃ reagent itself is pale yellow.\n    *   A crucial factor here is **steric hindrance**. The two bulky methyl groups at the *ortho*-positions (adjacent to the -OH group) physically block the hydroxyl group, preventing it from forming the characteristic colored complex with the ferric ion (Fe³⁺).\n    *   As a result, the test is negative.

Statement A incorrectly describes the outcome of the ferric chloride test for 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The test is negative due to steric hindrance, and the observed color is merely that of the unreacted reagent, not a product of a positive reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis is a step-by-step analysis to determine the incorrect statement among the choices.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Compounds in the Reaction Sequence (A-H)**\n\nFirst, we must correctly identify each compound formed in the multi-step reaction.\n\n1.  **Compound A (C₃H₆)** reacts with Br₂/CCl₄. This is a characteristic reaction of an alkene. Thus, **Compound A is propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂) **.\n2.  The addition of bromine across the double bond of propene yields **Compound B: 1,2-dibromopropane**.\n3.  Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, which is a strong base that promotes a double elimination of HBr (dehydrohalogenation) to form an alkyne. Therefore, **Compound C is propyne (CH₃-C≡CH)**.\n4.  Passing propyne through a red-hot iron tube induces cyclic trimerization, where three alkyne molecules form a stable aromatic ring. The product is **Compound D: 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.\n5.  Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids, which is the standard nitrating mixture (concentrated HNO₃ + concentrated H₂SO₄). This results in the nitration of the aromatic ring, forming **Compound E: 2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**.\n6.  Compound E is treated with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl), a standard method for the reduction of an aromatic nitro group (-NO₂) to an amino group (-NH₂). This forms **Compound F: 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesidine)**.\n7.  Compound F, a primary aromatic amine, reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂) in a diazotization reaction. This converts the amino group into a diazonium salt, **Compound G: the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n8.  The diazonium salt G reacts with NaOH (hydrolysis), replacing the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH). The final product is **Compound H: 2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluate Each Statement**\n\nNow, we evaluate each of the given statements based on the identity and properties of the compounds determined above. The question asks to identify the **incorrect** statement.\n\n*   **A) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a classic test for the phenol functional group, which typically produces a vibrant purple, green, or blue colored complex with Fe³⁺. The aqueous ferric chloride solution itself is pale yellow. However, in compound H, the two bulky methyl groups at the *ortho* positions (adjacent to the -OH group) cause significant steric hindrance. This physical blocking prevents the phenol from forming the characteristic colored complex. Therefore, the test is negative. A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs; the solution simply retains the yellow color of the unreacted reagent. Stating that H \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction is producing a yellow product, which is not what occurs. The chemical property demonstrated is a *lack of reactivity*. Therefore, this statement is **incorrect**.\n\n*   **B) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne. It has a boiling point of -23.2 °C, meaning it is a gas at standard room temperature (~25 °C). As a small hydrocarbon, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **C) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. As a primary aromatic amine, it is a key starting material for creating diazonium salts, which are essential intermediates in the synthesis of a large and important class of industrial dyes known as azo dyes. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **D) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene). This molecule possesses high symmetry. Consequently, there are only two sets of chemically distinct protons: the nine equivalent protons on the three identical methyl groups and the three equivalent protons on the aromatic ring. Since neither set of protons has adjacent, non-equivalent protons to cause splitting, both signals appear as singlets in the ¹H NMR spectrum. This statement is **correct**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nStatements B, C, and D are all chemically correct. The statement in option A incorrectly describes the outcome of the ferric chloride test for Compound H, making it the only incorrect statement in the list.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nA detailed analysis of the problem requires two main steps: first, to accurately determine the identity of each compound in the reaction sequence, and second, to evaluate the four statements about these compounds to find the incorrect one.\n\n### **Step 1: Identifying the Compounds (A-H)**\n\nThe reaction sequence involves several fundamental organic chemistry reactions. Let's trace the path:\n\n*   **Compound A**: The molecular formula is C₃H₆. Its reaction with Br₂ in CCl₄ is a standard test for unsaturation (a double or triple bond), indicating an electrophilic addition. This identifies **A** as an alkene: **propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂)**.\n*   **Compound B**: Bromine adds across the double bond of propene. This forms **B**: **1,2-dibromopropane (CH₃-CH(Br)-CH₂(Br))**.\n*   **Compound C**: Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, a strong base used for elimination reactions. Since B is a vicinal dihalide, it undergoes double dehydrohalogenation (loss of two molecules of HBr) to form an alkyne. This yields **C**: **propyne (CH₃-C≡CH)**.\n*   **Compound D**: Passing propyne through a red-hot iron tube is a classic cyclic trimerization reaction. Three molecules of propyne combine to form a stable aromatic ring. This yields **D**: **1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.\n*   **Compound E**: Mesitylene (D) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids, which is the nitrating mixture (concentrated HNO₃ + concentrated H₂SO₄). This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (nitration) reaction. This yields **E**: **2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**.\n*   **Compound F**: Compound E is treated with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl). This is a standard method for reducing an aromatic nitro group (-NO₂) to a primary amino group (-NH₂). This yields **F**: **2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesidine)**.\n*   **Compound G**: The primary aromatic amine (F) is treated with nitrous acid (HNO₂). This is a diazotization reaction that converts the amino group into a diazonium salt. This yields **G**: **2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n*   **Compound H**: The diazonium salt (G) reacts with NaOH. This condition promotes the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt, where the diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This yields **H**: **2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluating the Statements**\n\nNow, we will evaluate each statement based on the established identity of the compounds.\n\n*   **A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, which is a primary aromatic amine. Aromatic amines are fundamental starting materials for producing a vast class of industrial colorants known as azo dyes, which are formed via diazotization and subsequent coupling reactions.\n    *   **This statement is correct.**\n\n*   **B) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene). This molecule possesses high symmetry. Consequently, there are only two chemically distinct sets of protons: the nine protons of the three equivalent methyl groups and the three protons of the equivalent hydrogens on the aromatic ring. Since neither set of protons has adjacent, non-equivalent protons, they do not split and both appear as singlets.\n    *   **This statement is correct.**\n\n*   **C) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a classic test for the phenol functional group, which typically produces a vibrant violet, blue, or green color due to the formation of a colored iron-phenoxide complex. The ferric chloride (FeCl₃) solution itself is yellow.\n    *   However, in compound H, the two bulky methyl groups at the *ortho* positions (the carbons adjacent to the -OH group) cause significant **steric hindrance**. This physical blocking prevents the hydroxyl group from forming the characteristic colored complex with the ferric ion (Fe³⁺). As a result, the test is negative.\n    *   A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs; the solution simply remains the yellow color of the unreacted reagent. Therefore, stating that H \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction is producing a yellow product, which is not what happens. The chemical property of H is its *lack of reactivity* in this test.\n    *   **This statement is incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne. It has a boiling point of -23.2 °C, which means it exists as a gas at standard room temperature (approx. 25 °C).

Statement C is incorrect because it misrepresents the result of the ferric chloride test for 2,4,6-trimethylphenol; the test is negative due to steric hindrance.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe task requires a two-step approach: first, to deduce the identity of each compound (A through H) in the described reaction sequence, and second, to evaluate the four statements about these compounds to identify the one that is factually incorrect.\n\n**1. Identification of the Compounds**\n\n*   **Compound A to B**: Compound A (C₃H₆) is an alkene, **propene**. Its bromination adds Br₂ across the double bond to form **Compound B**, which is **1,2-dibromopropane**.\n*   **Compound B to C**: Reacting 1,2-dibromopropane with alcoholic KOH (a strong base) causes double dehydrohalogenation (elimination of two HBr molecules). This produces an alkyne, **Compound C**, which is **propyne** (CH₃-C≡CH).\n*   **Compound C to D**: Passing an alkyne like propyne through a red-hot iron tube is a classic cyclic trimerization reaction. Three molecules of propyne combine to form a symmetrical aromatic compound, **Compound D**, which is **1,3,5-trimethylbenzene** (also known as mesitylene).\n*   **Compound D to E**: Mesitylene is treated with a mixture of two strong acids, which is the standard nitrating mixture (concentrated HNO₃ and H₂SO₄). This electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction yields **Compound E**, **2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**.\n*   **Compound E to F**: The nitro group is reduced to an amino group using iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl). This reaction produces **Compound F**, **2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene** (also known as mesidine).\n*   **Compound F to G**: A primary aromatic amine like Compound F reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂) in a diazotization reaction. This converts the amino group into a diazonium salt, forming **Compound G**, the **2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n*   **Compound G to H**: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed by reaction with NaOH (in a warmed aqueous solution), which replaces the diazonium group (-N₂⁺) with a hydroxyl group (-OH). The final product, **Compound H**, is **2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n**2. Evaluation of the Statements**\n\nNow, we evaluate each statement based on the established identity of the compounds.\n\n*   **A) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. This molecule has a high degree of symmetry. All three methyl groups are chemically equivalent, and so are their nine protons. These protons do not have any non-equivalent neighboring protons to split with, so they produce a single, sharp signal (a singlet). Similarly, the three protons on the aromatic ring are all chemically equivalent and will also produce a singlet. Therefore, the ¹H NMR spectrum correctly shows two singlets. **This statement is correct.**\n\n*   **B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for the phenol functional group, which typically produces a distinct purple, blue, or green colored complex. The ferric chloride reagent itself is a yellow solution.\n    *   In compound H, the hydroxyl group is flanked by two bulky methyl groups at the *ortho*-positions (positions 2 and 6). This causes significant **steric hindrance**, physically preventing the hydroxyl group from forming the characteristic colored complex with the ferric ion (Fe³⁺).\n    *   Because no complex forms, the test is considered **negative**. In a negative test, no color change occurs, and the solution simply retains the pale yellow color of the unreacted reagent. The statement that H \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction is producing a yellow product. In reality, the observation of a yellow color indicates the *absence* of a reaction. **This statement is incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne. Its boiling point is -23.2 °C, which is well below standard room temperature. Therefore, it exists as a gas. As a small hydrocarbon, it is highly flammable. **This statement is correct.**\n\n*   **D) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, a primary aromatic amine. Aromatic amines are fundamental starting materials for producing a large class of commercial colorants known as azo dyes, via diazotization and subsequent coupling reactions. **This statement is correct.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nStatements A, C, and D are all chemically correct. Statement B is incorrect because it misrepresents the result of the ferric chloride test for 2,4,6-trimethylphenol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identification of the Compounds in the Reaction Sequence (A-H)**\n    The first step is to correctly determine the structure of each compound formed in the multi-step reaction.\n\n    *   **Compound A**: The molecular formula C₃H₆ and its addition reaction with Br₂/CCl₄ identify it as an alkene. Thus, **A is propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂)**.\n    *   **Compound B**: Bromine adds across the double bond of propene to form the vicinal dihalide, **B: 1,2-dibromopropane (CH₃-CH(Br)-CH₂(Br))**.\n    *   **Compound C**: B reacts with alcoholic KOH, a strong base that causes double dehydrohalogenation (elimination of two molecules of HBr) to form an alkyne. Thus, **C is propyne (CH₃-C≡CH)**.\n    *   **Compound D**: Passing an alkyne like propyne through a red-hot iron tube results in a cyclic trimerization reaction. Three molecules of propyne combine to form the stable, symmetrical aromatic compound, **D: 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.\n    *   **Compound E**: D is treated with a mixture of two strong acids, which is the standard nitrating mixture (concentrated HNO₃ + concentrated H₂SO₄). This results in an electrophilic aromatic substitution to give **E: 2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**.\n    *   **Compound F**: The reaction of E with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl) is a standard method for the reduction of an aromatic nitro group (-NO₂) to a primary amino group (-NH₂). This forms **F: 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesidine)**.\n    *   **Compound G**: F, a primary aromatic amine, reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂, typically from NaNO₂/HCl) in a diazotization reaction to form the corresponding diazonium salt, **G: 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n    *   **Compound H**: The diazonium salt (G) is unstable and, upon reaction with NaOH (in an aqueous solution with warming), hydrolyzes to replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, forming a phenol. Thus, **H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n2.  **Evaluation of the Statements**\n    Now, with the identities of all compounds confirmed, we evaluate each of the given statements.\n\n    *   **A) C is a flammable gas.**\n        *   Compound C is propyne. It has a boiling point of -23.2 °C, meaning it is a gas at standard room temperature (~25 °C). As a small hydrocarbon, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n    *   **B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n        *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a classic test for the phenol functional group, which typically produces a vibrant purple, blue, or green colored complex with the Fe³⁺ ion.\n        *   **Careful Point**: The test can be affected by steric hindrance. In compound H, the two large methyl groups at the *ortho* positions (the carbons adjacent to the -OH group) physically block the hydroxyl group, preventing it from forming the colored complex with the ferric ion. As a result, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol gives a **negative** ferric chloride test.\n        *   Since the aqueous ferric chloride solution is itself yellow, a negative test means no characteristic color change occurs; the solution simply remains the yellow color of the unreacted reagent. Stating that H \"gives a yellow color\" is highly misleading because it implies a positive reaction is producing a yellow product, when in fact the observation signifies a *lack* of reactivity. Therefore, this statement about the chemical property of H is **incorrect**.\n\n    *   **C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n        *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. Due to its high molecular symmetry, it has only two chemically distinct sets of protons: the three protons on the aromatic ring are equivalent, and the nine protons of the three methyl groups are also equivalent. Since neither set of protons has adjacent, non-equivalent protons to cause splitting, both signals appear as singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n    *   **D) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n        *   Compound F is 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, a primary aromatic amine. Aromatic amines are fundamental precursors for synthesizing a vast class of industrial colorants known as azo dyes, which are formed via diazotization and coupling reactions. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nStatements A, C, and D are all correct descriptions of the chemical compounds and their properties. Statement B is incorrect because it inaccurately describes the outcome of the ferric chloride test on the sterically hindered phenol (H).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of a multi-stage organic chemistry reaction sequence, followed by an evaluation of statements about the products.\n\n**Part 1: Identifying the Compounds (A-H)**\n\n1.  **Compound A to B**: Compound A (C₃H₆) reacts with Br₂ in CCl₄. The molecular formula CnH2n and the reaction with bromine indicate A is an alkene. Thus, **A is propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂) **. The addition of bromine across the double bond yields **B, 1,2-dibromopropane**.\n2.  **Compound B to C**: Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, which is a strong base used for dehydrohalogenation. Since B is a vicinal dihalide, a double elimination reaction occurs, removing two molecules of HBr to form an alkyne. Thus, **C is propyne (CH₃-C≡CH)**.\n3.  **Compound C to D**: Passing propyne through a red-hot iron tube is a classic cyclic trimerization reaction. Three molecules of propyne combine to form a symmetrical aromatic compound. Thus, **D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.\n4.  **Compound D to E**: Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids (a nitrating mixture of concentrated HNO₃ and H₂SO₄). This results in electrophilic aromatic substitution (nitration). Thus, **E is 2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**.\n5.  **Compound E to F**: Compound E reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl). This is a standard method for the reduction of an aromatic nitro group (-NO₂) to an amino group (-NH₂). Thus, **F is 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesidine)**.\n6.  **Compound F to G**: Compound F, a primary aromatic amine, reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂) in a diazotization reaction. Thus, **G is the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n7.  **Compound G to H**: Compound G reacts with sodium hydroxide (implying hydrolysis in an aqueous solution). The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). Thus, **H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n**Part 2: Evaluating the Statements**\n\nNow, we assess each statement based on the identities of the compounds.\n\n*   **A) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne. It has a boiling point of -23.2 °C, meaning it is a gas at standard room temperature. As a small hydrocarbon, it is highly flammable.\n    *   This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **B) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, a primary aromatic amine. Aromatic amines are fundamental starting materials for producing a large class of colorants known as azo dyes through diazotization and coupling reactions.\n    *   This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **C) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, which typically produce a vibrant violet, blue, or green colored complex. The ferric chloride solution itself is yellow. However, in compound H, the two methyl groups at the ortho-positions (adjacent to the -OH group) cause significant steric hindrance. This physical blocking prevents the phenol from forming the colored complex with the ferric ion. As a result, the test is negative. A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs; the solution simply remains the yellow color of the unreacted reagent. The statement that H \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction produces a yellow product, when in fact the yellow color signifies a lack of reaction.\n    *   This statement is **incorrect**.\n\n*   **D) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene). Due to its high molecular symmetry, there are only two chemically distinct sets of protons: the nine protons of the three equivalent methyl groups and the three protons of the equivalent hydrogens on the aromatic ring. Since neither set of protons has adjacent, non-equivalent protons, they do not split and both appear as singlets.\n    *   This statement is **correct**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nStatements A, B, and D are all chemically correct. The question asks to identify the incorrect statement, which is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of the Problem**\n\n**1. Identification of Chemical Compounds (A-H)**\nFirst, we must trace the reaction sequence to identify each compound. The logic provided by the candidate answers is sound and based on standard organic chemistry reactions.\n*   **Compound A**: The formula C₃H₆ combined with the bromination reaction points to an alkene. **A is propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂)**.\n*   **Compound B**: Bromine adds across the double bond of propene to form **B, 1,2-dibromopropane**.\n*   **Compound C**: Double dehydrohalogenation of B with alcoholic KOH produces an alkyne. **C is propyne (CH₃-C≡CH)**.\n*   **Compound D**: Passing propyne through a red-hot iron tube causes cyclic trimerization, yielding an aromatic compound. **D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.\n*   **Compound E**: Nitration of D (an activated aromatic ring) with strong acids yields **E, 2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**.\n*   **Compound F**: The reduction of the nitro group in E with Fe/HCl gives a primary amine. **F is 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesidine)**.\n*   **Compound G**: The diazotization of the primary amine F with nitrous acid yields a diazonium salt. **G is the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n*   **Compound H**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt G replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group. **H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n**2. Evaluation of the Statements**\nNow, we must carefully evaluate each of the four statements from the original question based on the established identities of the compounds. The candidate answers show unanimous agreement on the properties of these compounds.\n\n*   **A) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a classic test for the phenol functional group, which typically produces a distinct purple, blue, or green colored complex. An aqueous solution of the ferric chloride reagent is itself pale yellow.\n    *   In compound H, the two bulky methyl groups at the *ortho*-positions (next to the -OH group) cause significant **steric hindrance**. This physical blocking prevents the phenol from forming the characteristic colored complex with the Fe³⁺ ion.\n    *   Therefore, the test is **negative**. A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs; the solution simply remains the yellow color of the unreacted reagent.\n    *   The statement that H \"gives a yellow color\" is highly misleading. It implies a positive reaction is producing a yellow product, which is not what happens. The key chemical property demonstrated is the *lack of reactivity* in this standard test. Thus, the statement is chemically **incorrect**.\n\n*   **B) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne. It has a boiling point of -23.2 °C, meaning it is a gas at standard room temperature. As a low-molecular-weight hydrocarbon, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **C) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, a primary aromatic amine. Aromatic amines are fundamental starting materials for producing a large class of industrial colorants known as azo dyes, which are synthesized via diazotization and subsequent coupling reactions. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **D) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. Due to its high molecular symmetry, there are only two chemically distinct sets of protons: the nine protons of the three equivalent methyl groups and the three equivalent protons on the aromatic ring. Neither set of protons has adjacent, non-equivalent protons, so both signals appear as unsplit singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe analysis confirms that statements B, C, and D are all chemically correct descriptions of the products. Statement A is the only one that is incorrect because it misrepresents the outcome of the ferric chloride test on the sterically hindered phenol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis analysis will proceed in two main stages: first, identifying the chemical compounds produced at each step of the reaction sequence, and second, evaluating the truthfulness of each of the four given statements.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of Compounds (A-H)\n\nThis multi-step synthesis involves a series of standard organic chemistry reactions.\n1.  **Compound A to B**: The molecular formula C₃H₆ represents an alkene or a cyclopropane. The reaction with bromine in carbon tetrachloride (Br₂/CCl₄) is a characteristic electrophilic addition to a C=C double bond, confirming that **Compound A is propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂) **. The addition of Br₂ across the double bond yields **Compound B, 1,2-dibromopropane**.\n2.  **Compound B to C**: Reacting 1,2-dibromopropane with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH), a strong base, causes the elimination of two molecules of hydrogen bromide (HBr). This double dehydrohalogenation reaction forms an alkyne. Therefore, **Compound C is propyne (CH₃-C≡CH)**.\n3.  **Compound C to D**: Passing propyne gas through a red-hot iron tube is a classic cyclic trimerization reaction. Three molecules of propyne combine to form a stable aromatic ring, resulting in **Compound D, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (also known as mesitylene)**.\n4.  **Compound D to E**: Mesitylene is treated with a mixture of two strong acids, which is the standard nitrating mixture (concentrated nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid). This performs an electrophilic aromatic substitution, adding a nitro group (-NO₂) to the ring, yielding **Compound E, 2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**.\n5.  **Compound E to F**: The reaction with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl) is a standard method for the reduction of an aromatic nitro group to a primary amino group (-NH₂). This converts E into **Compound F, 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (also known as mesidine)**.\n6.  **Compound F to G**: This primary aromatic amine is treated with nitrous acid (HNO₂), which is typically generated in situ from NaNO₂ and a strong acid like HCl. This is a diazotization reaction, which converts the amino group into a diazonium salt, **Compound G, the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n7.  **Compound G to H**: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed by reaction with NaOH (implying heating in an aqueous solution). The diazonium group (-N₂⁺) is an excellent leaving group and is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH), forming **Compound H, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluation of the Statements\n\nNow, we critically evaluate each of the four statements about these compounds.\n\n*   **A) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. This molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry. Due to this symmetry, there are only two chemically distinct types of protons: 1) the three protons on the aromatic ring, which are equivalent, and 2) the nine protons on the three methyl groups, which are also equivalent. Since neither group of protons has adjacent, non-equivalent protons, they do not split each other. Therefore, the spectrum consists of exactly two sharp, unsplit signals (singlets). This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic chemical test for the phenol functional group, which typically produces a vibrant purple, green, or blue colored complex with Fe³⁺ ions. However, in Compound H, the two large methyl groups at the *ortho* positions (positions 2 and 6, adjacent to the -OH group) cause significant **steric hindrance**. This physical blocking prevents the hydroxyl group from forming the colored complex with the ferric ion. Consequently, the test is negative. An aqueous solution of ferric chloride (FeCl₃) is itself pale yellow. A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs; the solution simply remains the yellow color of the unreacted reagent. The statement that H \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction is occurring to produce a yellow product. In reality, the observed yellow color signifies a *lack of reaction* (a negative test). Thus, the statement is chemically **incorrect**.\n\n*   **C) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne. It has a very low boiling point of -23.2 °C, meaning it is a gas at standard room temperature. Like other low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **D) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, a primary aromatic amine. Aromatic amines are fundamental starting materials for producing a vast class of industrial colorants known as azo dyes. The synthesis involves converting the amine to a diazonium salt (like Compound G), which is then coupled with another aromatic compound. This statement is **correct**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nStatements A, C, and D are all chemically correct. Statement B is the only one that is incorrect, as it misrepresents the outcome of the ferric chloride test on a sterically hindered phenol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### Step 1: Trace the Reaction Pathway\n\nThe first and most critical step is to correctly identify each compound in the multi-step reaction. There is a strong and unanimous consensus among all candidate answers regarding the identity of each compound.\n\n*   **Compound A (C₃H₆)** is **propene**, an alkene.\n*   **Compound B** is the bromination product, **1,2-dibromopropane**.\n*   **Compound C** is formed by double dehydrohalogenation of B, resulting in the alkyne **propyne**.\n*   **Compound D** is formed by the cyclic trimerization of propyne in a red-hot iron tube, yielding **1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.\n*   **Compound E** is the nitration product of D, **2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**.\n*   **Compound F** is the reduction product of E, **2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesidine)**.\n*   **Compound G** is the diazotization product of F, the **2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n*   **Compound H** is formed by the hydrolysis of G, resulting in **2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Each Statement\n\nWith the compounds correctly identified, each statement from the original question can be critically evaluated. The analysis below synthesizes the consensus reasoning from all provided answers.\n\n*   **A) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   **Compound H** is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a standard chemical test for the phenol functional group. A positive result is the formation of a distinct violet, green, or blue colored complex.\n    *   The ferric chloride reagent solution is itself yellow.\n    *   In Compound H, the two methyl groups at the *ortho*-positions (adjacent to the -OH group) cause significant **steric hindrance**. This physical bulkiness prevents the phenol from complexing with the ferric ion (Fe³⁺).\n    *   As a result, the characteristic color change does not occur, and the test is considered **negative**. When the test is negative, the solution simply retains the original yellow color of the unreacted ferric chloride reagent.\n    *   The statement is misleading because it implies a positive reaction occurs to produce a yellow color. In fact, the observation of a yellow color indicates a *lack of reaction*. Therefore, the statement is chemically **incorrect**.\n\n*   **B) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   **Compound C** is propyne. It has a boiling point of -23.2 °C, meaning it is a gas at standard room temperature. As a small hydrocarbon, it is highly flammable.\n    *   This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **C) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   **Compound F** is 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, which is a primary aromatic amine. Such amines are fundamental precursors for a large class of industrial colorants known as azo dyes, which are formed via diazotization and coupling reactions.\n    *   This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **D) D gives two singlets in the ¹H NMR spectra.**\n    *   **Compound D** is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene). Due to the molecule's high symmetry, there are only two chemically distinct sets of protons: the nine protons on the three equivalent methyl groups and the three protons on the aromatic ring.

The statement in option A incorrectly describes the outcome of a standard chemical test. The failure of 2,4,6-trimethylphenol to give a positive ferric chloride test is a key chemical property related to steric hindrance, and misinterpreting the result makes this statement the incorrect one.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, based on a synthesis of the provided candidate responses.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of the Compounds in the Reaction Sequence\nAll candidate answers correctly deduce the same reaction pathway. This consensus provides a strong foundation for analysis.\n\n1.  **Compound A (C₃H₆)** reacts with bromine, indicating it is an alkene. **A is propene**.\n2.  The addition of Br₂ across the double bond forms **Compound B, 1,2-dibromopropane**.\n3.  Reaction of B with alcoholic KOH causes double elimination (dehydrohalogenation) to form an alkyne. **Compound C is propyne**.\n4.  Passing propyne through a red-hot iron tube causes cyclic trimerization. **Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.\n5.  Reaction of D with two strong acids (a nitrating mixture) yields **Compound E, 2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**.\n6.  Reduction of the nitro group in E with Fe/HCl forms a primary amine. **Compound F is 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesidine)**.\n7.  Diazotization of F with nitrous acid yields **Compound G, the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n8.  Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt G replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group, forming **Compound H, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluation of Each Statement\nWith the identities of the compounds established, each statement from the original question is evaluated.\n\n*   **A) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne. Its boiling point is -23.2 °C, which is well below standard room temperature. Therefore, it is a gas. As a low-molecular-weight hydrocarbon, it is highly flammable.\n    *   This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **B) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, a primary aromatic amine. Such amines are fundamental precursors for synthesizing diazonium salts, which are then used in coupling reactions to produce a vast class of commercial colorants known as azo dyes.\n    *   This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. Due to its high molecular symmetry, there are only two chemically distinct sets of protons: the nine protons of the three equivalent methyl groups and the three protons of the equivalent hydrogens on the aromatic ring. Since neither set of protons has adjacent, non-equivalent protons to cause spin-spin splitting, both signals appear as sharp singlets.\n    *   This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **D) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   **Careful Point**: This statement requires careful interpretation of a chemical test result. Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for the phenol functional group, which typically produces a vibrant violet, blue, or green colored complex. An aqueous solution of the ferric chloride reagent is itself pale yellow.\n    *   In Compound H, the two bulky methyl groups at the *ortho*-positions (adjacent to the -OH group) cause significant **steric hindrance**. This physical blocking prevents the hydroxyl group from forming the colored complex with the Fe³⁺ ion. Consequently, the test is **negative**.\n    *   A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs; the solution simply retains the original yellow color of the unreacted reagent. The statement that H \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction is producing a yellow product. In reality, the observation of yellow color indicates a *lack of reaction*. Therefore, the statement is chemically **incorrect**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nStatements A, B, and C are all chemically correct descriptions of the compounds. Statement D incorrectly describes the outcome of the ferric chloride test on compound H due to a misunderstanding of a negative test result caused by steric hindrance.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the reasoning provided by the other agents.\n\n### Step 1: Trace the Chemical Reaction Sequence\n\nThe first step, as correctly and unanimously identified by all agents, is to determine the structure of each compound in the reaction pathway.\n\n*   **Compound A (C₃H₆)** is **propene**. Its formula fits CₙH₂ₙ and it undergoes bromination, which is characteristic of an alkene.\n*   **Compound B** is the product of bromine adding across the double bond of propene, resulting in **1,2-dibromopropane**.\n*   **Compound C** is formed by double dehydrohalogenation of B with alcoholic KOH. This elimination reaction produces an alkyne, **propyne**.\n*   **Compound D** is formed by the cyclic trimerization of three molecules of propyne in a red-hot iron tube. This is a classic reaction that produces **1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.\n*   **Compound E** is the nitration product of D. The mixture of two strong acids is the nitrating mixture (conc. HNO₃ + conc. H₂SO₄), which yields **2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**.\n*   **Compound F** is the reduction product of E. Iron scrap and HCl reduce the nitro group (-NO₂) to an amino group (-NH₂), forming **2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesidine)**.\n*   **Compound G** is the diazotization product of F. Nitrous acid converts the primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt, **the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n*   **Compound H** is the hydrolysis product of G. The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, yielding **2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Each Statement\n\nThe next step is to analyze each of the four statements to find the one that is incorrect.\n\n*   **A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, a primary aromatic amine. Aromatic amines are fundamental precursors for producing a large class of industrial colorants known as azo dyes via diazotization and coupling reactions. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for the phenol functional group, which typically produces a distinct violet, green, or blue colored complex with Fe³⁺. The ferric chloride solution itself is yellow.\n    *   In compound H, the two bulky methyl groups at the *ortho*-positions (adjacent to the -OH group) cause significant **steric hindrance**. This physical blocking prevents the hydroxyl group from forming the colored complex with the ferric ion. As a result, the test is negative.\n    *   A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs; the solution simply remains the yellow color of the unreacted reagent. The statement that H \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction is producing a yellow product, which is not what happens. The chemical property being observed is a *lack of reactivity*. This statement is **incorrect**.\n\n*   **C) D gives two singlets in the ¹H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene). Due to its high molecular symmetry, there are only two chemically distinct sets of protons: the nine protons of the three equivalent methyl groups, and the three equivalent protons on the aromatic ring. Since neither set of protons has adjacent, non-equivalent protons, they do not split and both appear as singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **D) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne. It has a boiling point of -23.2 °C, meaning it is a gas at standard room temperature. Like other low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n1.  **Correct Identification:** The entire problem depends on correctly identifying all eight compounds in the sequence. Any error here would lead to an incorrect conclusion.\n2.  **Steric Hindrance:** The key to the incorrect statement lies in understanding the concept of steric hindrance. The bulky groups around the reactive site (-OH group in compound H) prevent the reaction (complex formation with FeCl₃) from occurring.\n3.  **Interpretation of a \"Negative Test\":** A critical point is correctly interpreting the result of a negative chemical test. The yellow color observed is not a product of a reaction involving compound H, but rather the color of the unreacted FeCl₃ reagent. Therefore, stating that H \"gives\" a yellow color is a chemically inaccurate description of the event.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the thorough analysis, statements A, C, and D are factually correct descriptions of the compounds involved. Statement B is incorrect because it misrepresents the outcome of the ferric chloride test on the sterically hindered phenol, H.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Trace the Reaction Sequence to Identify Compounds A through H\n\nThe foundation of solving this problem is to correctly identify each compound formed in the reaction sequence. All provided analyses agree on this pathway, which is based on standard organic chemistry reactions.\n\n1.  **Compound A (C₃H₆) to B**: Compound A is an alkene, **propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂) **. Its reaction with bromine (Br₂) in carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄) is an electrophilic addition, forming **Compound B: 1,2-dibromopropane**.\n2.  **Compound B to C**: Reacting 1,2-dibromopropane with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH) causes a double dehydrohalogenation (elimination of two HBr molecules), yielding **Compound C: propyne (CH₃-C≡CH)**.\n3.  **Compound C to D**: Passing propyne through a red-hot iron tube triggers cyclic trimerization, forming the symmetrical aromatic ring **Compound D: 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.\n4.  **Compound D to E**: Mesitylene reacts with a nitrating mixture (concentrated nitric acid and sulfuric acid) in an electrophilic aromatic substitution to give **Compound E: 2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**.\n5.  **Compound E to F**: The nitro group is reduced to an amino group using iron (Fe) scrap and hydrochloric acid (HCl), yielding **Compound F: 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesidine)**.\n6.  **Compound F to G**: This primary aromatic amine undergoes diazotization with nitrous acid (HNO₂) to form **Compound G: the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n7.  **Compound G to H**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt (with NaOH, indicating a warm, aqueous environment) replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, resulting in **Compound H: 2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Each Statement\n\nWith the structures of all compounds identified, we can now critically evaluate each of the four statements.\n\n*   **A) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. This molecule has a high degree of symmetry (a C₃ axis). Due to this symmetry, there are only two chemically distinct sets of protons: the nine protons on the three equivalent methyl groups and the three protons on the aromatic ring. Since neither set of protons has adjacent, non-equivalent protons, they do not undergo spin-spin splitting. Therefore, the spectrum consists of exactly two singlets.\n    *   **This statement is correct.**\n\n*   **B) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, a primary aromatic amine. Primary aromatic amines are essential precursors for a vast class of commercial colorants known as azo dyes. They are converted into diazonium salts (like Compound G), which then undergo coupling reactions to form the brightly colored azo compounds.\n    *   **This statement is correct.**\n\n*   **C) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne. It has a boiling point of -23.2 °C, which is well below standard room temperature (~25 °C). This means it exists as a gas under normal conditions. As a small hydrocarbon, it is highly flammable.\n    *   **This statement is correct.**\n\n*   **D) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride (FeCl₃) test is a characteristic chemical test for the phenol functional group, which typically produces a vibrant violet, blue, or green colored complex. An aqueous solution of FeCl₃ is itself pale yellow.\n    *   However, in Compound H, the two bulky methyl groups at the *ortho*-positions (positions 2 and 6, adjacent to the -OH group) cause significant **steric hindrance**. This physical blocking prevents the hydroxyl group from forming the colored complex with the ferric ion (Fe³⁺). As a result, the test is negative.\n    *   A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs; the solution simply remains the pale yellow color of the unreacted FeCl₃ reagent. The statement that H \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction is occurring to produce a yellow product. In reality, the observed yellow color signifies a *lack of reaction*. Therefore, from a chemical standpoint, the statement is incorrect as it misrepresents the chemical properties of compound H.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nStatements A, B, and C describe correct chemical properties of the compounds in the sequence. Statement D is incorrect because it inaccurately describes the outcome of the ferric chloride test on 2,4,6-trimethylphenol, where a negative result is obtained due to steric hindrance.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identification of the Reaction Products**\n\nThe first step is to correctly identify each compound in the reaction sequence. There is a complete consensus among all candidate answers on the identities of these compounds, which are derived from standard organic chemistry reactions.\n\n*   **Compound A**: C₃H₆ that undergoes bromination is an alkene, specifically **propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂) **.\n*   **Compound B**: The addition of bromine to propene gives **1,2-dibromopropane**.\n*   **Compound C**: Double dehydrohalogenation of B with alcoholic KOH produces an alkyne, **propyne (CH₃-C≡CH)**.\n*   **Compound D**: Cyclic trimerization of propyne in a red-hot iron tube yields the symmetrical aromatic compound **1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.\n*   **Compound E**: Nitration of mesitylene produces **2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**.\n*   **Compound F**: Reduction of the nitro group in E with Fe/HCl gives a primary aromatic amine, **2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesidine)**.\n*   **Compound G**: Diazotization of F with nitrous acid yields the **2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n*   **Compound H**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt G replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group, forming **2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n**2. Evaluation of Each Statement**\n\nThe next step is to evaluate each of the four statements based on the chemical properties of the identified compounds.\n\n*   **A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, a primary aromatic amine. Aromatic amines are fundamental starting materials for producing a vast class of industrial colorants known as azo dyes through diazotization and coupling reactions.\n    *   This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **B) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. Due to its high molecular symmetry, it has only two chemically distinct types of protons: the nine protons of the three equivalent methyl groups and the three equivalent protons on the aromatic ring. Since neither set of protons has adjacent, non-equivalent protons, they do not split and appear as two separate singlets.\n    *   This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **C) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a classic test for the phenol functional group, which typically produces a distinct purple, green, or blue colored complex with the Fe³⁺ ion. The aqueous ferric chloride reagent itself is pale yellow.\n    *   **Crucial Point (Steric Hindrance):** In Compound H, the two bulky methyl groups at the *ortho*-positions (the carbons adjacent to the -OH group) physically block the hydroxyl group, preventing it from forming the characteristic colored complex with the ferric ion. Therefore, the test is **negative**.\n    *   A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs; the solution simply retains the pale yellow color of the unreacted reagent. The statement \"H gives a yellow color\" is highly misleading because it implies a positive reaction is occurring to produce a yellow product, when in fact, the yellow color indicates a *lack* of reaction.\n    *   This statement is **incorrect**.\n\n*   **D) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne. It has a boiling point of -23.2 °C, meaning it is a gas at standard room temperature. Like other low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons, it is highly flammable.\n    *   This statement is **correct**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis confirms that statements A, B, and D are all chemically correct. The statement that is incorrect is C, as it inaccurately describes the outcome of the ferric chloride test for 2,4,6-trimethylphenol due to a misunderstanding of steric hindrance and the nature of a negative chemical test.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Trace the reaction pathway and identify all compounds (A-H).**\n    *   **Compound A (C₃H₆)** reacts with Br₂ in CCl₄. This is an addition reaction characteristic of an alkene. Therefore, **A is propene**.\n    *   **Compound B** is the addition product of bromine to propene, which is **1,2-dibromopropane**.\n    *   **Compound C** is formed by treating B with alcoholic KOH. This is a double dehydrohalogenation reaction (elimination of 2 HBr molecules) to form an alkyne. Therefore, **C is propyne**.\n    *   **Compound D** is formed by passing propyne (C) through a red-hot iron tube. This is a classic cyclic trimerization reaction. Three molecules of propyne combine to form a symmetrical aromatic compound, **1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.\n    *   **Compound E** is formed by reacting D with a mixture of two strong acids (the nitrating mixture: concentrated HNO₃ and H₂SO₄). This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (nitration). The product is **2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**.\n    *   **Compound F** is formed by the reduction of E with iron scrap and HCl. This reaction reduces the nitro group (-NO₂) to an amino group (-NH₂). The product is **2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesidine)**.\n    *   **Compound G** is formed by the reaction of the primary aromatic amine F with nitrous acid (HNO₂). This is a diazotization reaction, forming **the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n    *   **Compound H** is formed by the reaction of the diazonium salt G with sodium hydroxide. This causes hydrolysis, replacing the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The final product is **2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n2.  **Evaluate each statement based on the identity of the compounds.**\n\n    *   **A) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n        *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. This molecule is highly symmetrical. Due to this symmetry, the nine protons on the three methyl groups are chemically equivalent and produce a single signal. The three protons on the aromatic ring are also equivalent. Since neither group has adjacent, non-equivalent protons, they do not undergo splitting. The spectrum therefore consists of exactly two singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n    *   **B) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n        *   Compound F is 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, a primary aromatic amine. Primary aromatic amines are essential precursors for the synthesis of diazonium salts (like compound G), which are key intermediates in the production of a large and important class of industrial dyes known as azo dyes. This statement is **correct**.\n\n    *   **C) C is a flammable gas.**\n        *   Compound C is propyne. It has a very low boiling point of -23.2 °C, meaning it is a gas at standard room temperature and pressure. Like other small hydrocarbons, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n    *   **D) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n        *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic chemical test for the phenol functional group. A positive result is the formation of a distinct violet, green, or blue colored complex with the Fe³⁺ ion. The test reagent itself, an aqueous solution of ferric chloride, is pale yellow.\n        *   In Compound H, the two methyl groups at the *ortho* positions (positions 2 and 6, adjacent to the -OH group) are bulky and cause significant **steric hindrance**. This physical blockage prevents the hydroxyl group from forming the characteristic colored complex with the iron ion.\n        *   Therefore, the test is negative. When a test is negative, no new color is produced, and the solution simply retains the pale yellow color of the unreacted reagent. The statement that H \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction is occurring to produce a yellow product. In reality, the observed yellow color signifies a *lack of reaction*. Thus, the statement is chemically **incorrect**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nStatements A, B, and C are all correct. The only incorrect statement is D because 2,4,6-trimethylphenol gives a negative ferric chloride test due to steric hindrance.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
