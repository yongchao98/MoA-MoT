Understand the System and Governing Principles**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Particle Statistics.** The system consists of four identical **spin-1/2 particles**. A fundamental concept in quantum mechanics is that particles with half-integer spin are **fermions**.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Pauli Exclusion Principle.** As identical fermions, these particles must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Defining a Quantum State.** For a particle in this system, its complete quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number, `n` (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), which determines the particle's energy level.\n    2.  The spin magnetic quantum number, `m_s`, which can be `+1/2` (spin-up) or `-1/2` (spin-down).\n*   **Careful Point 4: Energy Level Occupancy.** This is the most critical application of the principles above. Since a state includes both energy (`n`) and spin (`m_s`), the Pauli Exclusion Principle allows two particles to share the same energy level `n` as long as their spins are opposite (e.g., one with `m_s = +1/2` and one with `m_s = -1/2`). Therefore, each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of **two** particles.\n\n**2. Define the Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy of a single particle in the *n*-th level of a 1D infinite potential well is given as $E_n = n^2 E$. The first few levels are:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**3. Calculate the Ground State Energy (Lowest Energy State)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the energy levels from the lowest energy upwards, placing two fermions in each level until all four are placed.\n*   Place two particles in the **n=1** level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   Place the remaining two particles in the **n=2** level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum:\n    $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**4. Calculate the First Excited State Energy (Next-Lowest Energy State)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by making the least \"expensive\" energy promotion for a single particle.\n*   Starting from the ground state configuration {2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2}, the cheapest promotion is to move one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: {2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n*   The total energy for this state is:\n    $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**5. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (Third-Lowest Energy State)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 5: Systematic Search for Excitations.** The second excited state is the configuration with the third-lowest total energy for the system. We must systematically check possibilities and order them by total energy.\n*   The ground state energy is 10E. The first excited state is 15E. Let's find the next lowest energy configuration.\n*   Consider other promotions from the ground state:\n    *   **Promotion A:** Move one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. The new configuration is {1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n        Total Energy: $(1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n    *   **Promotion B:** Move one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`. The configuration is {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4}.\n        Total Energy: $(2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = **22E**$.\n*   Comparing the possible total energies {10E, 15E, 18E, 22E, ...}, we can see that the third-lowest energy corresponds to the second excited state.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe calculated energies for the three lowest states of the system, based on the unanimous analysis, are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThe resulting sequence of energies is (10E, 15E, 18E). Comparing this with the provided options:\nA) 4E, 10E, 50E\nB) 10E, 15E, 18E\nC) 4E, 10E, 15E\nD) 30E, 39E, 50E\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the problem and the unanimous reasoning presented in the candidate answers, here is a definitive step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Foundational Principles: Identifying the Particles and Rules**\n\nThe problem concerns four identical spin-1/2 particles. This identification is the key to the entire problem and leads to several crucial points.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Particle Statistics.** Particles with half-integer spin (like spin-1/2) are **fermions**. As identical fermions, they must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This is the most common point of error; treating the particles as bosons would lead to an incorrect ground state.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Defining a Quantum State.** A quantum state in this system is not just the energy level. It is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (n=1, 2, 3...) and the spin quantum number `m_s` (+1/2 or -1/2).\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Energy Level Occupancy.** The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state (`n` and `m_s`). This means that for any given energy level `n`, we can place one particle with spin-up and one with spin-down. Therefore, each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of **two** particles. Forgetting about spin would lead one to incorrectly believe only one particle could fit per level.\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy of a single particle in the n-th level of a 1D infinite potential well is $E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. Using the problem's definition of the base energy unit, $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$, the energy levels simplify to:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**3. Ground State Energy Calculation**\n\nThe ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. We find this by filling the energy levels from the bottom up (the Aufbau principle), respecting the two-particle limit per level.\n*   Two particles fill the `n=1` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   The remaining two particles fill the `n=2` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy Calculation**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy *above* the ground state.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: The \"Cheapest\" Excitation.** This is achieved by the lowest-energy promotion possible for a single particle, which is moving it from the highest occupied energy level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: {two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, one in `n=3`}.\n*   The total energy for this state is:\n    $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy Calculation**\n\nThe second excited state has the third-lowest total energy for the system.\n\n*   **Careful Point 5: Systematic Search.** We must find the next lowest-energy configuration, which requires comparing the total energy of different possible excitations from the ground state.\n    *   The first excited state (from `n=2 → n=3`) has a total energy of **15E**.\n    *   Let's check the next-cheapest promotion: moving a particle from a lower level, `n=1`, to the lowest available level, `n=3`.\n        *   Configuration: {one particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, one in `n=3`}.\n        *   Total Energy: $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n    *   Other promotions, like moving a particle from `n=2` to `n=4`, give a higher total energy ($2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$).\n*   By ordering the possible total energies {10E, 15E, 18E, 22E...}, we find the second excited state has an energy of **18E**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated energies for the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nComparing this sequence to the multiple-choice options:\nA) 30E, 39E, 50E\nB) 10E, 15E, 18E\nC) 4E, 10E, 15E\nD) 4E, 10E, 50E\n\nThe calculated energies perfectly match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, with careful points noted.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the System and Governing Principles**\n\nThe problem involves four identical spin-1/2 particles. This initial statement dictates the entire approach.\n\n*   **Particle Type:** In quantum mechanics, particles with half-integer spin (like 1/2) are classified as **fermions**.\n*   **Governing Rule:** A system of identical fermions must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n*   **Defining a Quantum State:** For a particle in this 1D potential well, a complete quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number, `n` (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), which determines the energy level.\n    2.  The spin magnetic quantum number, `m_s`, which can be `+1/2` (spin-up) or `-1/2` (spin-down).\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy of a single particle in the *n*-th state of a 1D infinite potential well is given as $E_n = n^2 E$, where $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\nThe energies of the first few levels are:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**3. Ground State Energy Calculation (E_ground)**\n\nThe ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy for the system. We find this by filling the energy levels from the bottom up, following the rules.\n\n*   **Careful Point #1: Occupancy Rule.** Because a state is defined by both `n` and `m_s`, the Pauli Exclusion Principle allows each energy level `n` to accommodate a maximum of **two** particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n*   **Filling the levels:**\n    *   Place the first two particles in the `n=1` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n    *   Place the remaining two particles in the `n=2` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   **Total Ground State Energy:** Sum the energies: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy Calculation (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy *above* the ground state. This is achieved by making the \"cheapest\" possible energy promotion.\n\n*   **Careful Point #2: The Lowest-Cost Promotion.** The smallest energy jump involves moving a single particle from the highest occupied energy level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (`n=3`).\n*   **New Configuration:** {2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n*   **Total Energy:** $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy Calculation (E_2nd)**\n\nThis state has the next-lowest total energy after the first excited state. We must systematically compare the energies of different possible configurations to find the correct one.\n\n*   **Careful Point #3: Systematic Search.** The second excited state is the one with the third-lowest *total system energy*. It's not necessarily the next-simplest jump (e.g., n=2 to n=4).\n*   Let's check the total energies of different promotions from the ground state:\n    *   **Promotion A (to get 1st excited state):** Move a particle from `n=2` to `n=3`. Total Energy = **15E**.\n    *   **Promotion B:** Move a particle from the lower `n=1` level to `n=3`.\n        *   Configuration: {1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}.\n        *   Total Energy: $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n    *   **Promotion C:** Move a particle from `n=2` to `n=4`.\n        *   Configuration: {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4}.\n        *   Total Energy: $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = 2E + 4E + 16E = **22E**$.\n\n*   Ordering the possible total energies for the system gives: {10E (ground), 15E (1st excited), 18E (2nd excited), ...}.\n*   Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is **18E**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states for this system of four fermions are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 10E, 15E, 18E\nB) 4E, 10E, 15E\nC) 4E, 10E, 50E\nD) 30E, 39E, 50E\n\nThe calculated sequence matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nAn analysis of the problem based on the provided candidate answers shows a unanimous consensus on the underlying physics and the resulting calculations. The correct approach is to apply the principles of quantum statistics for fermions to the energy levels of a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. System Identification and Governing Principles:**\n*   The problem involves four identical **spin-1/2 particles**. In quantum mechanics, particles with half-integer spin are classified as **fermions**.\n*   As identical fermions, they must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**, which states that no two particles can occupy the same quantum state.\n*   A quantum state in this system is defined by two numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (`+1/2` for spin-up or `-1/2` for spin-down).\n*   The crucial consequence of these rules is that each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of **two** particles: one spin-up and one spin-down.\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels:**\nThe energy for a single particle in the n-th state is given by $E_n = n^2 E$. The first few energy levels are:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**3. Ground State Energy Calculation (E_ground):**\nThe ground state is the lowest possible total energy for the four-particle system. We achieve this by filling the energy levels from the bottom up.\n*   Place two particles in the **n=1** level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   Place the remaining two particles in the **n=2** level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy Calculation (E_1st):**\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy above the ground state. This is achieved by making the \"cheapest\" possible promotion for a single particle, which is from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: {2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n*   The total energy for this state is: $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy Calculation (E_2nd):**\nThe second excited state has the third-lowest total energy. We must systematically check other possible promotions from the ground state to find the next-lowest total energy.\n*   **Promotion A (First Excited State):** Move one particle from `n=2` to `n=3`. The total system energy is **15E**.\n*   **Promotion B:** Move one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. The new configuration is {1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}. The total system energy is $(1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n*   **Promotion C:** Move one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`. The new configuration is {2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4}. The total system energy is $(2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = \\mathbf{22E}$.\n\nBy ranking the possible total energies {10E, 15E, 18E, 22E, ...}, we find that the second excited state has an energy of **18E**.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Particle Statistics:** The most critical step is identifying the spin-1/2 particles as **fermions** that obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. Treating them as bosons would incorrectly place all four particles in the n=1 state, giving a ground state energy of 4E.\n2.  **Spin Degeneracy:** The Pauli Principle applies to the full quantum state, including spin (`n`, `m_s`). The spin degeneracy is what allows **two** particles per energy level `n`. Forgetting this and allowing only one particle per level (as if they were spinless fermions) would incorrectly lead to a ground state where the n=1, 2, 3, and 4 levels are occupied, giving an energy of 1E + 4E + 9E + 16E = 30E.\n3.  **Systematic Excitation:** When finding excited states, one must find the configuration with the next-lowest *total system energy*, not simply the next-lowest energy jump for a single particle. A systematic search reveals that promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 (total E=18E) costs less overall system energy than promoting from n=2 to n=4 (total E=22E), making 18E the energy of the second excited state.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculated energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are **10E**, **15E**, and **18E**, respectively.

The following principles are crucial:\n\n*   **Particle Type:** Spin-1/2 particles are **fermions**.\n*   **Governing Rule:** As identical fermions, they must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**, which states that no two particles can occupy the exact same quantum state.\n*   **State Definition:** A quantum state is defined by both its principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and its spin quantum number `m_s` (+1/2 or -1/2).\n\n**Careful Point 1: Energy Level Occupancy**\nBecause a particle's state includes both `n` and `m_s`, the Pauli Exclusion Principle allows each energy level `n` to hold a maximum of **two** particles—one with spin-up (`m_s` = +1/2) and one with spin-down (`m_s` = -1/2). Treating the particles as bosons (which have no such restriction) or spinless fermions (one particle per level) are common errors.\n\n**Step 2: Single-Particle Energy Levels**\nThe energy for a single particle in the n-th state is given by $E_n = n^2 E$. The energies of the first few levels are:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**Step 3: Ground State Energy Calculation**\nThe ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. We find this by filling the energy levels from the bottom up (the \"Aufbau principle\").\n*   Two particles fill the `n=1` level. Their energy contribution is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   The remaining two particles fill the `n=2` level. Their energy contribution is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum:\n    $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Identifying Incorrect Ground States**\n*   If the particles were treated as bosons, all four would occupy the n=1 state, yielding $E_{ground} = 4 \\times E_1 = 4E$. This is why options C and D are incorrect.\n*   If the spin degeneracy were ignored (i.e., treating them as spinless fermions), each particle would need a different `n`, yielding $E_{ground} = E_1 + E_2 + E_3 + E_4 = 1E + 4E + 9E + 16E = 30E$. This is why option B is incorrect.\n\n**Step 4: First Excited State Energy Calculation**\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy above the ground state. This is achieved by the single \"cheapest\" promotion of a particle.\n*   The lowest-energy jump is to move one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: {2 particles in `n=1`, 1 particle in `n=2`, 1 particle in `n=3`}.\n*   The total energy for this state is:\n    $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**Step 5: Second Excited State Energy Calculation**\nThe second excited state has the next-lowest total energy.

Foundational Principles and Key Identifications**\n\n*   **Particle Type:** The system contains four identical **spin-1/2 particles**. The spin-statistics theorem classifies particles with half-integer spin as **fermions**. This is the most critical starting point.\n*   **Governing Rule:** As identical fermions, these particles must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   **Quantum State Definition:** For this system, a particle's complete quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number, `n` (n=1, 2, 3...), which determines the energy level.\n    2.  The spin magnetic quantum number, `m_s` (either `+1/2` for \"spin-up\" or `-1/2` for \"spin-down\").\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\n*   The energy of a single particle in the n-th level of a 1D infinite potential well is given as $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n*   With the problem's definition of $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$, the energy levels for a single particle simplify to $E_n = n^2 E$.\n*   The lowest single-particle energy levels are:\n    *   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n    *   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n    *   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n    *   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**3. Ground State Energy Calculation (E_ground)**\n\nThe ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. To find this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up, adhering to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   Two particles fill the **n=1** level (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   The remaining two particles fill the **n=2** level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy Calculation (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the next-lowest total energy. This is achieved by making the least \"expensive\" energy promotion from the ground state.\n\n*   The lowest-energy promotion involves moving one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n*   The total energy for this state is: $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy Calculation (E_2nd)**\n\nThis is the state with the third-lowest total energy. We must systematically check other possible low-energy promotions to find the correct configuration.\n\n*   The ground state energy is 10E and the first excited state is 15E. Let's explore other low-energy excitations from the ground state.\n*   **Possibility A (n=1 → n=3):** Promote a particle from the n=1 level to the n=3 level.\n    *   Configuration: {1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}.\n    *   Total Energy: $(1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n*   **Possibility B (n=2 → n=4):** Promote a particle from the n=2 level to the n=4 level.\n    *   Configuration: {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4}.\n    *   Total Energy: $(2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = \\mathbf{22E}$.\n\nComparing the energies of all possible states (10E, 15E, 18E, 22E, ...), we find that the second lowest energy above the ground state is 18E.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   **Particle Statistics:** It is crucial to identify the spin-1/2 particles as **fermions** and apply the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. Treating them as bosons would incorrectly give a ground state energy of 4E.\n*   **State Occupancy:** One must correctly understand that a \"state\" includes spin. This allows each energy level `n` to hold **two** particles, not one. Forgetting this leads to an incorrect ground state energy of 30E.\n*   **Systematic Search for Excited States:** To find the correct excited states, one must find the configurations with the lowest total energies above the ground state. This requires comparing the total energy of different promotion possibilities, not just assuming the simplest jumps.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe calculated energies are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nComparing this sequence with the given options:\nA) 10E, 15E, 18E\nB) 4E, 10E, 15E\nC) 4E, 10E, 50E\nD) 30E, 39E, 50E\n\nThe calculated result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, with careful points noted based on a synthesis of the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Particle Type and Governing Principles**\n    *   The problem specifies four identical **spin-1/2 particles**.

This is what allows **two** fermions per energy level `n`. Forgetting this and assuming one fermion per level would lead to a ground state of $1E+4E+9E+16E = 30E$.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Systematic Search for Excited States.** The second excited state is not just the \"next jump\" in levels, but the state with the third-lowest *total system energy*. A systematic search shows that promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 results in a lower total energy (18E) than promoting a particle from n=2 to n=4 (22E).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe calculated energies for the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis sequence of (10E, 15E, 18E) corresponds to option B in the provided list.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nAn analysis of the provided candidate answers shows a unanimous consensus on the physical principles and calculations required to solve the problem. The discrepancies in the final letter choices stem from the agents being presented with differently labeled multiple-choice options, not from any disagreement in the scientific conclusion. The following is a definitive step-by-step solution based on this consensus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify Particle Type and Governing Principles**\nThe system consists of four identical **spin-1/2 particles**. In quantum mechanics, particles with half-integer spin are classified as **fermions**. Identical fermions must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**, which states that no two particles can occupy the exact same quantum state simultaneously. A particle's quantum state is defined by both its energy level quantum number (`n`) and its spin quantum number (`m_s`).\n\n**Step 2: Determine Single-Particle Energy Levels**\nThe energy for a single particle in the n-th state is given by the formula $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. Using the problem's definition of the base energy unit, $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$, the energy levels are simplified to:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\nThe ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. We find this by filling the energy levels from the bottom up.\n*   Place two particles in the `n=1` level (one with spin-up, one with spin-down). Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   Place the remaining two particles in the `n=2` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy above the ground state. This is achieved by making the \"cheapest\" possible energy promotion for one particle: moving it from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: {2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n*   The total energy for this state is: $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\nThe second excited state has the next-lowest total energy. We must systematically check the possible low-energy promotions from the ground state to find the one with the third-lowest total energy.\n*   **Promotion A (First Excited State):** Move a particle from `n=2` to `n=3`. The total system energy is **15E**.\n*   **Promotion B:** Move a particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. The configuration becomes {1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}. The total energy is $(1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n*   **Other Promotions:** Promotions like `n=2` to `n=4` or exciting two particles result in higher total energies (22E, 20E, etc.).\n\nBy ordering the possible total energies {10E, 15E, 18E, 20E, ...}, we find that the second excited state has an energy of **18E**.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Fermions vs. Bosons:** It is crucial to identify the particles as fermions. If they were bosons, all four would occupy the n=1 level, giving a ground state energy of $4 \\times 1E = 4E$. This highlights why options starting with 4E are incorrect.\n2.  **Spin Occupancy:** The Pauli Exclusion Principle applies to the full quantum state (`n`, `m_s`). This means each energy level `n` can hold **two** particles (one spin-up, one spin-down). Forgetting this and allowing only one fermion per energy level `n` would result in a ground state configuration of {1 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3, 1 in n=4}, giving a total energy of $1E+4E+9E+16E = 30E$. This highlights why the option starting with 30E is incorrect.\n3.  **Systematic Excitation:** To find the second excited state, one must find the configuration with the third-lowest *total system energy*. Simply looking at the next jump for a single particle (e.g., from n=2 to n=4) is not sufficient. One must compare the total energy of different configurations. The jump from `n=1` to `n=3` (Total E = 18E) results in a lower total system energy than the jump from `n=2` to `n=4` (Total E = 22E).\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe unanimously calculated energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are **10E**, **15E**, and **18E**, respectively.

Foundational Principles: Particles and Rules**\n\nThe problem involves four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite potential well.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Particle Statistics.** The most crucial piece of information is that spin-1/2 particles are **fermions**. As identical fermions, they must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle forbids any two particles from occupying the same quantum state. Mistaking them for bosons would lead to an incorrect ground state where all particles occupy the n=1 level.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: State Definition and Occupancy.** A quantum state in this system is defined by both the energy quantum number `n` (n=1, 2, 3...) and the spin quantum number `m_s` (+1/2 or -1/2). Consequently, each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of **two** particles (one spin-up and one spin-down). Forgetting about spin would incorrectly limit occupancy to one particle per level.\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy of a single particle in the n-th level is given as $E_n = n^2 E$.

Foundational Principles**\n\n*   **Particle Identification:** The problem specifies four identical spin-1/2 particles. In quantum mechanics, particles with half-integer spin (like 1/2) are classified as **fermions**.\n*   **Governing Rule:** As identical fermions, they must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**, which states that no two such particles can occupy the exact same quantum state.\n*   **State Definition:** A quantum state for a particle in this system is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be `+1/2` for spin-up or `-1/2` for spin-down).\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy for a single particle in the n-th state of a 1D infinite potential well is given by $E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. With the given base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$, the energy levels are simplified to:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**3. Ground State Energy Calculation (Lowest Energy)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the energy levels from the lowest energy upwards, placing the four fermions according to the rules.\n*   **Level n=1:** Can hold two particles (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   **Level n=2:** Can hold the remaining two particles. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   **Total Ground State Energy:** The total energy is the sum: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy Calculation (Next-Lowest Energy)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by performing the lowest-cost (\"cheapest\") promotion of a single particle.\n*   The lowest energy promotion is to move one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: {2 particles in `n=1`, 1 particle in `n=2`, 1 particle in `n=3`}.\n*   **Total First Excited State Energy:** The energy is the sum for this configuration:\n    $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy Calculation (Third-Lowest Energy)**\n\nThe second excited state corresponds to the configuration with the third-lowest total energy. We must systematically check the possible promotions from the ground state to find the next-lowest energy value.\n*   **Ground State Total Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Total Energy:** 15E (from `n=2` -> `n=3` promotion)\n*   **Consider other promotions:**\n    *   Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. The new configuration is {1 particle in `n=1`, 2 particles in `n=2`, 1 particle in `n=3`}. The total energy is $(1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n    *   Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`. The new configuration is {2 particles in `n=1`, 1 particle in `n=2`, 1 particle in `n=4`}. The total energy is $(2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = \\mathbf{22E}$.\n*   Comparing the possible total energies {10E, 15E, 18E, 22E, ...}, the third-lowest value is 18E.\n*   **Total Second Excited State Energy:** **18E**.\n\n### Careful Points in the Analysis\n1.  **Particle Statistics (Fermions vs. Bosons):** The most common mistake is to treat the particles as bosons. If they were bosons, all four would occupy the n=1 state, giving a ground state energy of 4E. This immediately rules out options A and B.\n2.  **State Occupancy (Spin):** Another critical point is the inclusion of spin. Forgetting spin and treating the particles as \"spinless fermions\" would allow only one particle per energy level (`n`). This would result in a ground state with particles in n=1, 2, 3, and 4, giving a total energy of $1E + 4E + 9E + 16E = 30E$. This rules out option C.\n3.  **Systematic Search for Excited States:** To find the first and second excited states, one must find the configurations with the lowest and second-lowest *total energy* above the ground state. It is not sufficient to simply consider the next energy level for promotion. The total energy of all possible low-energy configurations must be calculated and ranked.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are **10E**, **15E**, and **18E**, respectively. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) 4E, 10E, 50E\nB) 4E, 10E, 15E\nC) 30E, 39E, 50E\nD) 10E, 15E, 18E\n\nThe calculated sequence matches option D exactly.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, with careful attention to the key principles of quantum mechanics.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Foundational Principles: Particle Type and Statistics**\nThe problem involves four identical **spin-1/2 particles**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Particle Statistics.** In quantum mechanics, particles with half-integer spin (like 1/2) are classified as **fermions**. This is the most critical piece of information, as it dictates the statistical rules the particles must follow.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Pauli Exclusion Principle.** Identical fermions are subject to the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Defining a Quantum State and Occupancy.** For a particle in this system, a complete quantum state is defined by two numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy) and the spin quantum number `m_s` (+1/2 or -1/2). Therefore, each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of **two** particles—one with spin-up (`m_s` = +1/2) and one with spin-down (`m_s` = -1/2)—without violating the Pauli Exclusion Principle. A common error is to assume only one particle can go into each energy level, or to treat them as bosons which have no such restriction.\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\nThe energy of a single particle in the *n*-th state of a 1D infinite well is $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. With the given base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$, the levels are:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**3. Ground State Energy Calculation (Lowest Total Energy)**\nTo find the ground state, we fill the energy levels from the lowest energy upwards, placing two particles in each level until all four are accounted for.\n*   Two particles go into the `n=1` level. Their energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   The remaining two particles go into the `n=2` level. Their energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy Calculation (Next-Lowest Total Energy)**\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Systematic Excitation.** This is achieved by performing the lowest-energy (\"cheapest\") single-particle promotion from the ground state configuration. This means moving one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, and one in `n=3`.\n*   The total energy for this state is:\n    $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy Calculation (Third-Lowest Total Energy)**\nThis state corresponds to the configuration with the next-lowest total energy. We must systematically compare the energies of different possible promotions from the ground state.\n*   The ground state energy is 10E.\n*   The first excited state energy is 15E.\n*   Let's check other low-energy promotions:\n    *   **Option A:** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`. Total energy would be $2E_1 + 1E_2 + 1E_4 = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n    *   **Option B:** Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. The new configuration is: one particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, one in `n=3`. Total energy is $1E_1 + 2E_2 + 1E_3 = 1E + 2(4E) + 9E = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n*   Comparing the possible total energies {10E, 15E, 18E, 22E,...}, the third-lowest energy value belongs to the second excited state.\n*   The second excited state energy is **18E**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe calculated energies for the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis sequence of energies, (10E, 15E, 18E), corresponds to option B in the provided question list.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, with careful points noted based on a comprehensive review of the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the total energy of the three lowest-energy configurations of a system of four identical fermions in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n**1. Determine Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy for a single particle in the *n*-th quantum state of a 1D infinite potential well of length L is given by the formula:\n$E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\nThe problem conveniently defines the base unit of energy as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\nTherefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed simply as:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n...and so on for higher `n`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Ground State Energy (Lowest Energy)**\n\nWe follow the \"Aufbau principle,\" filling the energy levels from the lowest upwards, while adhering to the rules dictated by the particles' nature.\n\n*   The ground state is the configuration with the absolute lowest possible total energy.\n*   We place two particles in the `n=1` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   We place the remaining two particles in the next available level, `n=2`. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**3. Calculate the First Excited State Energy (Next-Lowest Energy)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy *above* the ground state. This is achieved by making the \"cheapest\" possible promotion of a single particle.\n\n*   Starting from the ground state {2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2}, the lowest energy promotion is to move one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is {2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n*   The total energy for this state is: $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**4. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (Third-Lowest Energy)**\n\nThe second excited state has the next-lowest total energy after the first excited state. We must systematically compare the total energies of different possible configurations to find the correct one.\n\n*   We found the ground state is **10E** and the first excited state is **15E**.\n*   Let's explore other low-energy promotions from the ground state:\n    *   **Possibility A (First Excited State):** Promote a particle from `n=2 → n=3`. Total energy = 15E.\n    *   **Possibility B:** Promote a particle from a lower level, `n=1`, to the lowest available level, `n=3`. The new configuration is {1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}. The total energy is $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n    *   **Possibility C:** Promote a particle from `n=2 → n=4`. The total energy is $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n*   By ordering the possible total system energies (10E, 15E, 18E, 22E, ...), we find that the third-lowest unique energy value is 18E. This corresponds to the second excited state.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Particle Statistics (Fermions vs. Bosons):** The most critical piece of information is that spin-1/2 particles are **fermions**. They must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. A common mistake is to treat them as bosons, which would put all four particles in the n=1 state, yielding an incorrect ground state energy of $4 \\times E_1 = 4E$. This would correspond to options A and D.\n\n2.  **Spin and State Occupancy:** A \"quantum state\" is defined by both its energy level (`n`) and its spin (`m_s`). The Pauli Principle applies to this complete state definition. Because there are two spin states available (+1/2 and -1/2), each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of **two** particles (one spin-up, one spin-down). Forgetting about spin and assuming only one particle per energy level is another common error, leading to a ground state of $E_1+E_2+E_3+E_4 = 1E+4E+9E+16E = 30E$. This would correspond to option B.\n\n3.  **Systematic Excitation Search:** To find the first and second excited states, one must find the configurations with the lowest and second-lowest *total energy* above the ground state. It is crucial to compare the costs of different possible promotions. As shown above, the second excited state (18E) corresponds to a particle being promoted from `n=1` to `n=3`, which is a lower total energy configuration than promoting a particle from `n=2` to `n=4` (22E).\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe calculated energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are **10E, 15E, and 18E**, respectively.\n\nComparing this result to the provided options:\nA) 4E, 10E, 50E\nB) 30E, 39E, 50E\nC) 10E, 15E, 18E\nD) 4E, 10E, 15E\n\nThe calculated energies match option C exactly.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on the provided candidate answers and a systematic analysis of the physics problem, there is a clear and unanimous consensus on the calculation method and the resulting energy values. The variation in the final letter choices among the agents is due to them being presented with differently ordered multiple-choice options.\n\nHere is a consolidated, step-by-step analysis that includes all the crucial \"careful points\" identified across the candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. System Identification and Governing Principles**\n\nThe system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Particle Statistics.** Spin-1/2 particles are **fermions**. This is the most crucial identification, as it dictates they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. Treating them as bosons (which do not have this restriction) is a common error that would lead to an incorrect ground state where all four particles occupy the n=1 level, giving a total energy of 4E.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Pauli Exclusion Principle & State Definition.** The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. For this system, a state is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal energy quantum number `n` (1, 2, 3...) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (+1/2 or -1/2). The inclusion of spin is vital.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Energy Level Occupancy.** Because each energy level `n` has two distinct spin states (`m_s`=+1/2 and `m_s`=-1/2), each level can accommodate a maximum of **two** particles (one spin-up, one spin-down) without violating the exclusion principle. A common mistake is to ignore spin and assume only one particle per energy level `n`, which would lead to an incorrect ground state energy of $E_1+E_2+E_3+E_4 = 1E+4E+9E+16E = 30E$.\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy of a single particle in the n-th level is given by $E_n = n^2 E$. The energies for the lowest levels are:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**3. Ground State Energy Calculation**\n\nTo find the ground state (lowest total energy), we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions, respecting the two-particle limit per level.\n*   Place two particles in the **n=1** level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   Place the remaining two particles in the **n=2** level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy Calculation**\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: The \"Cheapest\" Excitation.** The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy *above* the ground state. This is achieved by making the least \"expensive\" jump for a single particle, which is to move one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new particle configuration is: {2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n*   The total energy for this state is: $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy Calculation**\n\n*   **Careful Point 5: Systematic Search.** The second excited state has the third-lowest total energy for the system. It is not necessarily the next-simplest jump; we must compare the total energies of different possible excited configurations to find the correct one.\n    *   **Configuration A (First Excited State):** Ground state {2,2,0,0...} -> {2,1,1,0...}. Total Energy = **15E**.\n    *   **Configuration B:** Promote a particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. Ground state {2,2,0,0...} -> {1,2,1,0...}. Total Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n    *   **Configuration C:** Promote a particle from `n=2` to `n=4`. Ground state {2,2,0,0...} -> {2,1,0,1...}. Total Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = 2E + 4E + 16E = \\mathbf{22E}$.\n*   Comparing the possible total energies (10E, 15E, 18E, 22E...), we find the three lowest unique values are 10E, 15E, and 18E.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe final calculated energies are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis sequence of energies must be compared to the provided options:\nA) 4E, 10E, 50E\nB) 4E, 10E, 15E\nC) 30E, 39E, 50E\nD) 10E, 15E, 18E\n\nThe calculated result `10E, 15E, 18E` matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a complete analysis of the problem and a review of the candidate answers, there is a clear consensus on the correct physical calculation. The discrepancy between the letter choices in the candidate answers is due to them being presented with different multiple-choice lists. The correct solution for the specific question provided is as follows.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the System and Governing Principles**\n\n*   **Particle Type**: The system has four identical spin-1/2 particles. In quantum mechanics, particles with half-integer spin are **fermions**.\n*   **Governing Rule**: As identical fermions, they must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle states that no two fermions can occupy the exact same quantum state.\n*   **Quantum State Definition**: For a particle in this 1D potential well, its state is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be +1/2 for spin-up or -1/2 for spin-down).\n\n**Step 2: Determine Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy for a single particle in the n-th level is given by $E_n = n^2 E$, where $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n*   Energy of the n=1 level: $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   Energy of the n=2 level: $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   Energy of the n=3 level: $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   Energy of the n=4 level: $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\n\nThe ground state is the lowest possible total energy for the system. We fill the energy levels from the bottom up, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   Two particles are placed in the **n=1** level (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2E$.\n*   The remaining two particles are placed in the **n=2** level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy above the ground state. This is achieved by the \"cheapest\" possible promotion of one particle.\n*   Promote one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: {2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n*   The total energy for this state is: $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nThe second excited state has the next lowest total energy. We must systematically check other possible low-energy promotions.\n*   **Possibility 1 (First Excited State):** Promoting `n=2 → n=3`. Total energy = 15E.\n*   **Possibility 2:** Promoting `n=1 → n=3`. The configuration becomes {1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}. The total energy is $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n*   **Possibility 3:** Promoting `n=2 → n=4`. The total energy is $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\nBy comparing the total energies of possible states {10E, 15E, 18E, 22E, ...}, we find the third-lowest energy for the system is 18E.\n\n### Careful Points in this Problem\n1.  **Particle Statistics:** The most important point is recognizing that spin-1/2 particles are **fermions** and obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. A common mistake is to treat them as bosons, which would incorrectly place all four particles in the n=1 state for a ground state energy of 4E (as seen in option A and B).\n2.  **State Occupancy:** The Pauli Principle applies to the full quantum state (`n` and `m_s`). This means each energy level `n` can accommodate **two** particles (one spin-up, one spin-down). Forgetting this and allowing only one particle per level would lead to an incorrect ground state configuration in levels n=1, 2, 3, and 4, for an energy of $1E+4E+9E+16E = 30E$ (as seen in option C).\n3.  **Systematic Excitation:** To find the second excited state, one must find the configuration with the third-lowest *total system energy*. This requires comparing the energies of different promotions, not just assuming the next simplest jump. The promotion `n=1 → n=3` results in a total system energy of 18E, which is lower than promoting `n=2 → n=4` (total energy 22E).\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe calculated energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are **10E**, **15E**, and **18E**, respectively.\n\nComparing this result to the provided options:\nA) 4E, 10E, 15E\nB) 4E, 10E, 50E\nC) 30E, 39E, 50E\nD) 10E, 15E, 18E\n\nThe calculated sequence exactly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, with careful points noted.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the System and Governing Principles**\nThe problem involves four identical spin-1/2 particles confined to a 1D infinite potential well.\n\n*   **Particle Type**: Particles with half-integer spin (like spin-1/2) are classified as **fermions**.\n*   **Governing Rule**: As identical fermions, this system must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n*   **Defining a Quantum State**: For a particle in this potential well, a complete quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number, `n` (where n = 1, 2, 3, ...), which determines the energy level.\n    2.  The spin magnetic quantum number, `m_s`, which can be `+1/2` (spin-up) or `-1/2` (spin-down).\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\nThe energy of a single particle in the *n*-th state is given as $E_n = n^2 E$.\nThe energies of the first few levels are:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**3. Ground State Energy Calculation (Lowest Energy)**\nTo find the ground state, we fill the energy levels from the lowest energy upwards, placing the four fermions according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   The ground state is the configuration with the absolute lowest possible total energy.\n*   **Level n=1**: We can place two particles here, one with spin-up and one with spin-down. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   **Level n=2**: We place the remaining two particles here. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   **Total Ground State Energy**: Sum the energies: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy Calculation (Next-Lowest Energy)**\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy *above* the ground state. This is achieved by making the \"cheapest\" possible promotion of a single particle.\n\n*   The lowest energy promotion is to move one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: {2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n*   **Total First Excited State Energy**: $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy Calculation (Third-Lowest Energy)**\nThe second excited state has the next-lowest total energy after the first excited state. We must systematically compare the total energies of different possible configurations.\n\n*   Ground State Energy = **10E**\n*   First Excited State Energy = **15E**\n*   Now we consider other low-energy promotions from the ground state:\n    *   **Possibility A**: Promote a particle from the lower `n=1` level to `n=3`. The new configuration is {1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}. Total Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n    *   **Possibility B**: Promote a particle from `n=2` to `n=4`. Total Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = 2E + 4E + 16E = \\mathbf{22E}$.\n*   Comparing the possible total energies (10E, 15E, 18E, 22E, ...), we find the third-lowest energy is 18E. This is the energy of the second excited state.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Particle Statistics (Fermions vs. Bosons):** It is critical to identify the particles as fermions. If they were treated as bosons, all four would occupy the n=1 state, leading to an incorrect ground state energy of 4E. This would point to options B or D.\n2.  **Spin and State Occupancy:** A \"quantum state\" includes both energy level `n` and spin `m_s`. Because of the two spin states, each energy level `n` can hold two fermions. A common mistake is to assume only one particle per energy level (as if they were spinless), which would lead to a ground state of $E_1+E_2+E_3+E_4 = 30E$. This would point to option A.\n3.  **Systematic Search for Excitations:** To find the second excited state, one must find the configuration with the third-lowest *total system energy*. A systematic search shows that promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 results in a total energy of 18E, which is lower than promoting from n=2 to n=4 (22E).\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe calculated energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are **10E**, **15E**, and **18E**, respectively.\n\nComparing this result with the provided options:\nA) 30E, 39E, 50E\nB) 4E, 10E, 15E\nC) 10E, 15E, 18E\nD) 4E, 10E, 50E\n\nThe calculated sequence matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"

Understand the System and Governing Principles**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Particle Statistics.** The system consists of four identical **spin-1/2 particles**. A fundamental concept in quantum mechanics is that particles with half-integer spin are **fermions**.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Pauli Exclusion Principle.** As identical fermions, these particles must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Defining a Quantum State.** For a particle in this system, its complete quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number, `n` (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), which determines the particle's energy level.\n    2.  The spin magnetic quantum number, `m_s`, which can be `+1/2` (spin-up) or `-1/2` (spin-down).\n*   **Careful Point 4: Energy Level Occupancy.** This is the most critical application of the principles above. Since a state includes both energy (`n`) and spin (`m_s`), the Pauli Exclusion Principle allows two particles to share the same energy level `n` as long as their spins are opposite (e.g., one with `m_s = +1/2` and one with `m_s = -1/2`). Therefore, each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of **two** particles.\n\n**2. Define the Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy of a single particle in the *n*-th level of a 1D infinite potential well is given as $E_n = n^2 E$. The first few levels are:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**3. Calculate the Ground State Energy (Lowest Energy State)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the energy levels from the lowest energy upwards, placing two fermions in each level until all four are placed.\n*   Place two particles in the **n=1** level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   Place the remaining two particles in the **n=2** level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum:\n    $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**4. Calculate the First Excited State Energy (Next-Lowest Energy State)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by making the least \"expensive\" energy promotion for a single particle.\n*   Starting from the ground state configuration {2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2}, the cheapest promotion is to move one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: {2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n*   The total energy for this state is:\n    $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**5. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (Third-Lowest Energy State)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 5: Systematic Search for Excitations.** The second excited state is the configuration with the third-lowest total energy for the system. We must systematically check possibilities and order them by total energy.\n*   The ground state energy is 10E. The first excited state is 15E. Let's find the next lowest energy configuration.\n*   Consider other promotions from the ground state:\n    *   **Promotion A:** Move one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. The new configuration is {1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n        Total Energy: $(1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n    *   **Promotion B:** Move one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`. The configuration is {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4}.\n        Total Energy: $(2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = **22E**$.\n*   Comparing the possible total energies {10E, 15E, 18E, 22E, ...}, we can see that the third-lowest energy corresponds to the second excited state.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe calculated energies for the three lowest states of the system, based on the unanimous analysis, are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThe resulting sequence of energies is (10E, 15E, 18E). Comparing this with the provided options:\nA) 4E, 10E, 50E\nB) 10E, 15E, 18E\nC) 4E, 10E, 15E\nD) 30E, 39E, 50E\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the problem and the unanimous reasoning presented in the candidate answers, here is a definitive step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Foundational Principles: Identifying the Particles and Rules**\n\nThe problem concerns four identical spin-1/2 particles. This identification is the key to the entire problem and leads to several crucial points.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Particle Statistics.** Particles with half-integer spin (like spin-1/2) are **fermions**. As identical fermions, they must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This is the most common point of error; treating the particles as bosons would lead to an incorrect ground state.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Defining a Quantum State.** A quantum state in this system is not just the energy level. It is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (n=1, 2, 3...) and the spin quantum number `m_s` (+1/2 or -1/2).\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Energy Level Occupancy.** The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state (`n` and `m_s`). This means that for any given energy level `n`, we can place one particle with spin-up and one with spin-down. Therefore, each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of **two** particles. Forgetting about spin would lead one to incorrectly believe only one particle could fit per level.\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy of a single particle in the n-th level of a 1D infinite potential well is $E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. Using the problem's definition of the base energy unit, $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$, the energy levels simplify to:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**3. Ground State Energy Calculation**\n\nThe ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. We find this by filling the energy levels from the bottom up (the Aufbau principle), respecting the two-particle limit per level.\n*   Two particles fill the `n=1` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   The remaining two particles fill the `n=2` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy Calculation**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy *above* the ground state.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: The \"Cheapest\" Excitation.** This is achieved by the lowest-energy promotion possible for a single particle, which is moving it from the highest occupied energy level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: {two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, one in `n=3`}.\n*   The total energy for this state is:\n    $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy Calculation**\n\nThe second excited state has the third-lowest total energy for the system.\n\n*   **Careful Point 5: Systematic Search.** We must find the next lowest-energy configuration, which requires comparing the total energy of different possible excitations from the ground state.\n    *   The first excited state (from `n=2 → n=3`) has a total energy of **15E**.\n    *   Let's check the next-cheapest promotion: moving a particle from a lower level, `n=1`, to the lowest available level, `n=3`.\n        *   Configuration: {one particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, one in `n=3`}.\n        *   Total Energy: $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n    *   Other promotions, like moving a particle from `n=2` to `n=4`, give a higher total energy ($2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$).\n*   By ordering the possible total energies {10E, 15E, 18E, 22E...}, we find the second excited state has an energy of **18E**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated energies for the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nComparing this sequence to the multiple-choice options:\nA) 30E, 39E, 50E\nB) 10E, 15E, 18E\nC) 4E, 10E, 15E\nD) 4E, 10E, 50E\n\nThe calculated energies perfectly match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, with careful points noted.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the System and Governing Principles**\n\nThe problem involves four identical spin-1/2 particles. This initial statement dictates the entire approach.\n\n*   **Particle Type:** In quantum mechanics, particles with half-integer spin (like 1/2) are classified as **fermions**.\n*   **Governing Rule:** A system of identical fermions must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n*   **Defining a Quantum State:** For a particle in this 1D potential well, a complete quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number, `n` (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), which determines the energy level.\n    2.  The spin magnetic quantum number, `m_s`, which can be `+1/2` (spin-up) or `-1/2` (spin-down).\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy of a single particle in the *n*-th state of a 1D infinite potential well is given as $E_n = n^2 E$, where $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\nThe energies of the first few levels are:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**3. Ground State Energy Calculation (E_ground)**\n\nThe ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy for the system. We find this by filling the energy levels from the bottom up, following the rules.\n\n*   **Careful Point #1: Occupancy Rule.** Because a state is defined by both `n` and `m_s`, the Pauli Exclusion Principle allows each energy level `n` to accommodate a maximum of **two** particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n*   **Filling the levels:**\n    *   Place the first two particles in the `n=1` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n    *   Place the remaining two particles in the `n=2` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   **Total Ground State Energy:** Sum the energies: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**4.

This is achieved by making the \"cheapest\" possible energy promotion.\n\n*   **Careful Point #2: The Lowest-Cost Promotion.** The smallest energy jump involves moving a single particle from the highest occupied energy level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (`n=3`).\n*   **New Configuration:** {2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n*   **Total Energy:** $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy Calculation (E_2nd)**\n\nThis state has the next-lowest total energy after the first excited state. We must systematically compare the energies of different possible configurations to find the correct one.\n\n*   **Careful Point #3: Systematic Search.** The second excited state is the one with the third-lowest *total system energy*. It's not necessarily the next-simplest jump (e.g., n=2 to n=4).\n*   Let's check the total energies of different promotions from the ground state:\n    *   **Promotion A (to get 1st excited state):** Move a particle from `n=2` to `n=3`.

The total system energy is $(2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = \\mathbf{22E}$.\n\nBy ranking the possible total energies {10E, 15E, 18E, 22E, ...}, we find that the second excited state has an energy of **18E**.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Particle Statistics:** The most critical step is identifying the spin-1/2 particles as **fermions** that obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. Treating them as bosons would incorrectly place all four particles in the n=1 state, giving a ground state energy of 4E.\n2.  **Spin Degeneracy:** The Pauli Principle applies to the full quantum state, including spin (`n`, `m_s`). The spin degeneracy is what allows **two** particles per energy level `n`. Forgetting this and allowing only one particle per level (as if they were spinless fermions) would incorrectly lead to a ground state where the n=1, 2, 3, and 4 levels are occupied, giving an energy of 1E + 4E + 9E + 16E = 30E.\n3.  **Systematic Excitation:** When finding excited states, one must find the configuration with the next-lowest *total system energy*, not simply the next-lowest energy jump for a single particle. A systematic search reveals that promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 (total E=18E) costs less overall system energy than promoting from n=2 to n=4 (total E=22E), making 18E the energy of the second excited state.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculated energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are **10E**, **15E**, and **18E**, respectively. Comparing this result to the provided options:\n\nA) 4E, 10E, 50E\nB) 30E, 39E, 50E\nC) 10E, 15E, 18E\nD) 4E, 10E, 15E\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the consensus reasoning of the candidate answers.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Foundational Principles**\nThe problem involves determining the energy states of four identical spin-1/2 particles. The following principles are crucial:\n\n*   **Particle Type:** Spin-1/2 particles are **fermions**.\n*   **Governing Rule:** As identical fermions, they must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**, which states that no two particles can occupy the exact same quantum state.\n*   **State Definition:** A quantum state is defined by both its principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and its spin quantum number `m_s` (+1/2 or -1/2).\n\n**Careful Point 1: Energy Level Occupancy**\nBecause a particle's state includes both `n` and `m_s`, the Pauli Exclusion Principle allows each energy level `n` to hold a maximum of **two** particles—one with spin-up (`m_s` = +1/2) and one with spin-down (`m_s` = -1/2). Treating the particles as bosons (which have no such restriction) or spinless fermions (one particle per level) are common errors.\n\n**Step 2: Single-Particle Energy Levels**\nThe energy for a single particle in the n-th state is given by $E_n = n^2 E$. The energies of the first few levels are:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**Step 3: Ground State Energy Calculation**\nThe ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. We find this by filling the energy levels from the bottom up (the \"Aufbau principle\").\n*   Two particles fill the `n=1` level. Their energy contribution is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   The remaining two particles fill the `n=2` level. Their energy contribution is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum:\n    $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Identifying Incorrect Ground States**\n*   If the particles were treated as bosons, all four would occupy the n=1 state, yielding $E_{ground} = 4 \\times E_1 = 4E$. This is why options C and D are incorrect.\n*   If the spin degeneracy were ignored (i.e., treating them as spinless fermions), each particle would need a different `n`, yielding $E_{ground} = E_1 + E_2 + E_3 + E_4 = 1E + 4E + 9E + 16E = 30E$. This is why option B is incorrect.\n\n**Step 4: First Excited State Energy Calculation**\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy above the ground state. This is achieved by the single \"cheapest\" promotion of a particle.\n*   The lowest-energy jump is to move one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: {2 particles in `n=1`, 1 particle in `n=2`, 1 particle in `n=3`}.\n*   The total energy for this state is:\n    $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**Step 5: Second Excited State Energy Calculation**\nThe second excited state has the next-lowest total energy. We must systematically compare the total energy of different possible promotions from the ground state.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Systematic Search for Excited States**\nThe second excited state is the one with the third-lowest *total system energy*. We must check different configurations to find it.\n*   Ground state total energy = **10E**.\n*   First excited state total energy (promoting `n=2 → n=3`) = **15E**.\n*   **Next possibility:** Promote a particle from `n=1 → n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: {1 particle in `n=1`, 2 particles in `n=2`, 1 particle in `n=3`}.\n    *   Total Energy: $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n*   **Another possibility:** Promote a particle from `n=2 → n=4`.\n    *   Configuration: {2 particles in `n=1`, 1 particle in `n=2`, 1 particle in `n=4`}.\n    *   Total Energy: $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\nSince 18E is the next lowest total energy after 15E, this is the energy of the second excited state.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated energies for the three lowest states of the system are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nComparing this result with the provided options:\nA) 10E, 15E, 18E\nB) 30E, 39E, 50E\nC) 4E, 10E, 15E\nD) 4E, 10E, 50E\n\nThe calculated sequence matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers, all of which arrive at the same numerical result through correct physical reasoning, here is a definitive step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Foundational Principles and Key Identifications**\n\n*   **Particle Type:** The system contains four identical **spin-1/2 particles**. The spin-statistics theorem classifies particles with half-integer spin as **fermions**. This is the most critical starting point.\n*   **Governing Rule:** As identical fermions, these particles must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   **Quantum State Definition:** For this system, a particle's complete quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number, `n` (n=1, 2, 3...), which determines the energy level.\n    2.  The spin magnetic quantum number, `m_s` (either `+1/2` for \"spin-up\" or `-1/2` for \"spin-down\").\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\n*   The energy of a single particle in the n-th level of a 1D infinite potential well is given as $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n*   With the problem's definition of $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$, the energy levels for a single particle simplify to $E_n = n^2 E$.\n*   The lowest single-particle energy levels are:\n    *   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n    *   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n    *   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n    *   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**3. Ground State Energy Calculation (E_ground)**\n\nThe ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. To find this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up, adhering to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   Two particles fill the **n=1** level (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   The remaining two particles fill the **n=2** level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy Calculation (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the next-lowest total energy. This is achieved by making the least \"expensive\" energy promotion from the ground state.\n\n*   The lowest-energy promotion involves moving one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n*   The total energy for this state is: $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy Calculation (E_2nd)**\n\nThis is the state with the third-lowest total energy. We must systematically check other possible low-energy promotions to find the correct configuration.\n\n*   The ground state energy is 10E and the first excited state is 15E. Let's explore other low-energy excitations from the ground state.\n*   **Possibility A (n=1 → n=3):** Promote a particle from the n=1 level to the n=3 level.\n    *   Configuration: {1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}.\n    *   Total Energy: $(1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n*   **Possibility B (n=2 → n=4):** Promote a particle from the n=2 level to the n=4 level.\n    *   Configuration: {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4}.\n    *   Total Energy: $(2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = \\mathbf{22E}$.\n\nComparing the energies of all possible states (10E, 15E, 18E, 22E, ...), we find that the second lowest energy above the ground state is 18E.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   **Particle Statistics:** It is crucial to identify the spin-1/2 particles as **fermions** and apply the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. Treating them as bosons would incorrectly give a ground state energy of 4E.\n*   **State Occupancy:** One must correctly understand that a \"state\" includes spin. This allows each energy level `n` to hold **two** particles, not one. Forgetting this leads to an incorrect ground state energy of 30E.\n*   **Systematic Search for Excited States:** To find the correct excited states, one must find the configurations with the lowest total energies above the ground state. This requires comparing the total energy of different promotion possibilities, not just assuming the simplest jumps.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe calculated energies are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nComparing this sequence with the given options:\nA) 10E, 15E, 18E\nB) 4E, 10E, 15E\nC) 4E, 10E, 50E\nD) 30E, 39E, 50E\n\nThe calculated result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, with careful points noted based on a synthesis of the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Particle Type and Governing Principles**\n    *   The problem specifies four identical **spin-1/2 particles**.

This is what allows **two** fermions per energy level `n`. Forgetting this and assuming one fermion per level would lead to a ground state of $1E+4E+9E+16E = 30E$.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Systematic Search for Excited States.** The second excited state is not just the \"next jump\" in levels, but the state with the third-lowest *total system energy*. A systematic search shows that promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 results in a lower total energy (18E) than promoting a particle from n=2 to n=4 (22E).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe calculated energies for the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis sequence of (10E, 15E, 18E) corresponds to option B in the provided list.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nAn analysis of the provided candidate answers shows a unanimous consensus on the physical principles and calculations required to solve the problem. The discrepancies in the final letter choices stem from the agents being presented with differently labeled multiple-choice options, not from any disagreement in the scientific conclusion. The following is a definitive step-by-step solution based on this consensus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify Particle Type and Governing Principles**\nThe system consists of four identical **spin-1/2 particles**. In quantum mechanics, particles with half-integer spin are classified as **fermions**. Identical fermions must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**, which states that no two particles can occupy the exact same quantum state simultaneously. A particle's quantum state is defined by both its energy level quantum number (`n`) and its spin quantum number (`m_s`).\n\n**Step 2: Determine Single-Particle Energy Levels**\nThe energy for a single particle in the n-th state is given by the formula $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. Using the problem's definition of the base energy unit, $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$, the energy levels are simplified to:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\nThe ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. We find this by filling the energy levels from the bottom up.\n*   Place two particles in the `n=1` level (one with spin-up, one with spin-down). Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   Place the remaining two particles in the `n=2` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy above the ground state. This is achieved by making the \"cheapest\" possible energy promotion for one particle: moving it from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: {2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n*   The total energy for this state is: $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\nThe second excited state has the next-lowest total energy. We must systematically check the possible low-energy promotions from the ground state to find the one with the third-lowest total energy.\n*   **Promotion A (First Excited State):** Move a particle from `n=2` to `n=3`. The total system energy is **15E**.\n*   **Promotion B:** Move a particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. The configuration becomes {1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}. The total energy is $(1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n*   **Other Promotions:** Promotions like `n=2` to `n=4` or exciting two particles result in higher total energies (22E, 20E, etc.).\n\nBy ordering the possible total energies {10E, 15E, 18E, 20E, ...}, we find that the second excited state has an energy of **18E**.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Fermions vs. Bosons:** It is crucial to identify the particles as fermions. If they were bosons, all four would occupy the n=1 level, giving a ground state energy of $4 \\times 1E = 4E$. This highlights why options starting with 4E are incorrect.\n2.  **Spin Occupancy:** The Pauli Exclusion Principle applies to the full quantum state (`n`, `m_s`). This means each energy level `n` can hold **two** particles (one spin-up, one spin-down). Forgetting this and allowing only one fermion per energy level `n` would result in a ground state configuration of {1 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3, 1 in n=4}, giving a total energy of $1E+4E+9E+16E = 30E$. This highlights why the option starting with 30E is incorrect.\n3.  **Systematic Excitation:** To find the second excited state, one must find the configuration with the third-lowest *total system energy*. Simply looking at the next jump for a single particle (e.g., from n=2 to n=4) is not sufficient. One must compare the total energy of different configurations. The jump from `n=1` to `n=3` (Total E = 18E) results in a lower total system energy than the jump from `n=2` to `n=4` (Total E = 22E).\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe unanimously calculated energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are **10E**, **15E**, and **18E**, respectively.

The following consolidated analysis leads to the correct answer for the options provided in the prompt.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Foundational Principles: Particles and Rules**\n\nThe problem involves four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite potential well.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Particle Statistics.** The most crucial piece of information is that spin-1/2 particles are **fermions**. As identical fermions, they must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle forbids any two particles from occupying the same quantum state. Mistaking them for bosons would lead to an incorrect ground state where all particles occupy the n=1 level.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: State Definition and Occupancy.** A quantum state in this system is defined by both the energy quantum number `n` (n=1, 2, 3...) and the spin quantum number `m_s` (+1/2 or -1/2). Consequently, each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of **two** particles (one spin-up and one spin-down). Forgetting about spin would incorrectly limit occupancy to one particle per level.\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy of a single particle in the n-th level is given as $E_n = n^2 E$. The energies for the lowest levels are:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**3. Ground State Energy Calculation**\n\nTo find the ground state (lowest total energy), we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions, respecting the two-particle limit.\n*   Two particles occupy the `n=1` level. Their energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   The remaining two particles occupy the `n=2` level. Their energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy Calculation**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved with the \"cheapest\" promotion of a single particle.\n*   We move one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: {2 particles in `n=1`, 1 particle in `n=2`, 1 particle in `n=3`}.\n*   The total energy for the first excited state is:\n    $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy Calculation**\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Systematic Search.** This is the configuration with the third-lowest total energy. We must systematically consider the energies of different possible excitations from the ground state to find the correct one.\n    *   **Excitation A (already found):** Promote a particle from `n=2 → n=3`. Total energy = 15E. This is the first excited state.\n    *   **Excitation B:** Promote a particle from `n=1 → n=3`. The configuration becomes {one particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3}. The total energy is $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n    *   **Excitation C:** Promote both particles from `n=2 → n=3`. The total energy is $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n    *   **Excitation D:** Promote one particle from `n=2 → n=4`. The total energy is $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n*   Comparing the possible total energies in increasing order {10E, 15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...}, we find that the second excited state corresponds to the energy **18E**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe calculated energies for the three lowest states of the system are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nMatching this sequence to the provided options:\nA) 10E, 15E, 18E\nB) 4E, 10E, 50E\nC) 4E, 10E, 15E\nD) 30E, 39E, 50E\n\nThe calculated energies correspond exactly to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nHere is a systematic breakdown of the physics problem to determine the energies of the three lowest states for the system.\n\n**1. Foundational Principles**\n\n*   **Particle Identification:** The problem specifies four identical spin-1/2 particles. In quantum mechanics, particles with half-integer spin (like 1/2) are classified as **fermions**.\n*   **Governing Rule:** As identical fermions, they must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**, which states that no two such particles can occupy the exact same quantum state.\n*   **State Definition:** A quantum state for a particle in this system is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be `+1/2` for spin-up or `-1/2` for spin-down).\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy for a single particle in the n-th state of a 1D infinite potential well is given by $E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. With the given base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$, the energy levels are simplified to:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**3. Ground State Energy Calculation (Lowest Energy)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the energy levels from the lowest energy upwards, placing the four fermions according to the rules.\n*   **Level n=1:** Can hold two particles (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   **Level n=2:** Can hold the remaining two particles. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   **Total Ground State Energy:** The total energy is the sum: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy Calculation (Next-Lowest Energy)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by performing the lowest-cost (\"cheapest\") promotion of a single particle.\n*   The lowest energy promotion is to move one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: {2 particles in `n=1`, 1 particle in `n=2`, 1 particle in `n=3`}.\n*   **Total First Excited State Energy:** The energy is the sum for this configuration:\n    $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy Calculation (Third-Lowest Energy)**\n\nThe second excited state corresponds to the configuration with the third-lowest total energy. We must systematically check the possible promotions from the ground state to find the next-lowest energy value.\n*   **Ground State Total Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Total Energy:** 15E (from `n=2` -> `n=3` promotion)\n*   **Consider other promotions:**\n    *   Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. The new configuration is {1 particle in `n=1`, 2 particles in `n=2`, 1 particle in `n=3`}. The total energy is $(1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n    *   Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`. The new configuration is {2 particles in `n=1`, 1 particle in `n=2`, 1 particle in `n=4`}. The total energy is $(2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = \\mathbf{22E}$.\n*   Comparing the possible total energies {10E, 15E, 18E, 22E, ...}, the third-lowest value is 18E.\n*   **Total Second Excited State Energy:** **18E**.\n\n### Careful Points in the Analysis\n1.  **Particle Statistics (Fermions vs. Bosons):** The most common mistake is to treat the particles as bosons. If they were bosons, all four would occupy the n=1 state, giving a ground state energy of 4E. This immediately rules out options A and B.\n2.  **State Occupancy (Spin):** Another critical point is the inclusion of spin. Forgetting spin and treating the particles as \"spinless fermions\" would allow only one particle per energy level (`n`). This would result in a ground state with particles in n=1, 2, 3, and 4, giving a total energy of $1E + 4E + 9E + 16E = 30E$. This rules out option C.\n3.  **Systematic Search for Excited States:** To find the first and second excited states, one must find the configurations with the lowest and second-lowest *total energy* above the ground state. It is not sufficient to simply consider the next energy level for promotion. The total energy of all possible low-energy configurations must be calculated and ranked.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are **10E**, **15E**, and **18E**, respectively.

Foundational Principles: Particle Type and Statistics**\nThe problem involves four identical **spin-1/2 particles**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Particle Statistics.** In quantum mechanics, particles with half-integer spin (like 1/2) are classified as **fermions**. This is the most critical piece of information, as it dictates the statistical rules the particles must follow.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Pauli Exclusion Principle.** Identical fermions are subject to the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Defining a Quantum State and Occupancy.** For a particle in this system, a complete quantum state is defined by two numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy) and the spin quantum number `m_s` (+1/2 or -1/2). Therefore, each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of **two** particles—one with spin-up (`m_s` = +1/2) and one with spin-down (`m_s` = -1/2)—without violating the Pauli Exclusion Principle. A common error is to assume only one particle can go into each energy level, or to treat them as bosons which have no such restriction.\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\nThe energy of a single particle in the *n*-th state of a 1D infinite well is $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.

Ground State Energy Calculation (Lowest Total Energy)**\nTo find the ground state, we fill the energy levels from the lowest energy upwards, placing two particles in each level until all four are accounted for.\n*   Two particles go into the `n=1` level. Their energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   The remaining two particles go into the `n=2` level. Their energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy Calculation (Next-Lowest Total Energy)**\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Systematic Excitation.** This is achieved by performing the lowest-energy (\"cheapest\") single-particle promotion from the ground state configuration. This means moving one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, and one in `n=3`.\n*   The total energy for this state is:\n    $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy Calculation (Third-Lowest Total Energy)**\nThis state corresponds to the configuration with the next-lowest total energy. We must systematically compare the energies of different possible promotions from the ground state.\n*   The ground state energy is 10E.\n*   The first excited state energy is 15E.\n*   Let's check other low-energy promotions:\n    *   **Option A:** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`. Total energy would be $2E_1 + 1E_2 + 1E_4 = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n    *   **Option B:** Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. The new configuration is: one particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, one in `n=3`. Total energy is $1E_1 + 2E_2 + 1E_3 = 1E + 2(4E) + 9E = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n*   Comparing the possible total energies {10E, 15E, 18E, 22E,...}, the third-lowest energy value belongs to the second excited state.\n*   The second excited state energy is **18E**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe calculated energies for the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis sequence of energies, (10E, 15E, 18E), corresponds to option B in the provided question list.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, with careful points noted based on a comprehensive review of the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the total energy of the three lowest-energy configurations of a system of four identical fermions in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n**1. Determine Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy for a single particle in the *n*-th quantum state of a 1D infinite potential well of length L is given by the formula:\n$E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\nThe problem conveniently defines the base unit of energy as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\nTherefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed simply as:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n...and so on for higher `n`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Ground State Energy (Lowest Energy)**\n\nWe follow the \"Aufbau principle,\" filling the energy levels from the lowest upwards, while adhering to the rules dictated by the particles' nature.\n\n*   The ground state is the configuration with the absolute lowest possible total energy.\n*   We place two particles in the `n=1` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   We place the remaining two particles in the next available level, `n=2`. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**3. Calculate the First Excited State Energy (Next-Lowest Energy)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy *above* the ground state. This is achieved by making the \"cheapest\" possible promotion of a single particle.\n\n*   Starting from the ground state {2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2}, the lowest energy promotion is to move one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is {2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n*   The total energy for this state is: $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**4. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (Third-Lowest Energy)**\n\nThe second excited state has the next-lowest total energy after the first excited state. We must systematically compare the total energies of different possible configurations to find the correct one.\n\n*   We found the ground state is **10E** and the first excited state is **15E**.\n*   Let's explore other low-energy promotions from the ground state:\n    *   **Possibility A (First Excited State):** Promote a particle from `n=2 → n=3`. Total energy = 15E.\n    *   **Possibility B:** Promote a particle from a lower level, `n=1`, to the lowest available level, `n=3`. The new configuration is {1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}. The total energy is $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n    *   **Possibility C:** Promote a particle from `n=2 → n=4`. The total energy is $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n*   By ordering the possible total system energies (10E, 15E, 18E, 22E, ...), we find that the third-lowest unique energy value is 18E. This corresponds to the second excited state.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Particle Statistics (Fermions vs. Bosons):** The most critical piece of information is that spin-1/2 particles are **fermions**. They must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. A common mistake is to treat them as bosons, which would put all four particles in the n=1 state, yielding an incorrect ground state energy of $4 \\times E_1 = 4E$. This would correspond to options A and D.\n\n2.  **Spin and State Occupancy:** A \"quantum state\" is defined by both its energy level (`n`) and its spin (`m_s`). The Pauli Principle applies to this complete state definition. Because there are two spin states available (+1/2 and -1/2), each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of **two** particles (one spin-up, one spin-down). Forgetting about spin and assuming only one particle per energy level is another common error, leading to a ground state of $E_1+E_2+E_3+E_4 = 1E+4E+9E+16E = 30E$. This would correspond to option B.\n\n3.  **Systematic Excitation Search:** To find the first and second excited states, one must find the configurations with the lowest and second-lowest *total energy* above the ground state. It is crucial to compare the costs of different possible promotions. As shown above, the second excited state (18E) corresponds to a particle being promoted from `n=1` to `n=3`, which is a lower total energy configuration than promoting a particle from `n=2` to `n=4` (22E).\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe calculated energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are **10E, 15E, and 18E**, respectively.\n\nComparing this result to the provided options:\nA) 4E, 10E, 50E\nB) 30E, 39E, 50E\nC) 10E, 15E, 18E\nD) 4E, 10E, 15E\n\nThe calculated energies match option C exactly.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on the provided candidate answers and a systematic analysis of the physics problem, there is a clear and unanimous consensus on the calculation method and the resulting energy values.

System Identification and Governing Principles**\n\nThe system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Particle Statistics.** Spin-1/2 particles are **fermions**. This is the most crucial identification, as it dictates they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. Treating them as bosons (which do not have this restriction) is a common error that would lead to an incorrect ground state where all four particles occupy the n=1 level, giving a total energy of 4E.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Pauli Exclusion Principle & State Definition.** The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. For this system, a state is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal energy quantum number `n` (1, 2, 3...) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (+1/2 or -1/2). The inclusion of spin is vital.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Energy Level Occupancy.** Because each energy level `n` has two distinct spin states (`m_s`=+1/2 and `m_s`=-1/2), each level can accommodate a maximum of **two** particles (one spin-up, one spin-down) without violating the exclusion principle. A common mistake is to ignore spin and assume only one particle per energy level `n`, which would lead to an incorrect ground state energy of $E_1+E_2+E_3+E_4 = 1E+4E+9E+16E = 30E$.\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy of a single particle in the n-th level is given by $E_n = n^2 E$. The energies for the lowest levels are:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**3. Ground State Energy Calculation**\n\nTo find the ground state (lowest total energy), we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions, respecting the two-particle limit per level.\n*   Place two particles in the **n=1** level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   Place the remaining two particles in the **n=2** level.

First Excited State Energy Calculation**\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: The \"Cheapest\" Excitation.** The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy *above* the ground state. This is achieved by making the least \"expensive\" jump for a single particle, which is to move one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new particle configuration is: {2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n*   The total energy for this state is: $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy Calculation**\n\n*   **Careful Point 5: Systematic Search.** The second excited state has the third-lowest total energy for the system.

The discrepancy between the letter choices in the candidate answers is due to them being presented with different multiple-choice lists. The correct solution for the specific question provided is as follows.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the System and Governing Principles**\n\n*   **Particle Type**: The system has four identical spin-1/2 particles. In quantum mechanics, particles with half-integer spin are **fermions**.\n*   **Governing Rule**: As identical fermions, they must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle states that no two fermions can occupy the exact same quantum state.\n*   **Quantum State Definition**: For a particle in this 1D potential well, its state is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be +1/2 for spin-up or -1/2 for spin-down).\n\n**Step 2: Determine Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy for a single particle in the n-th level is given by $E_n = n^2 E$, where $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n*   Energy of the n=1 level: $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   Energy of the n=2 level: $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   Energy of the n=3 level: $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   Energy of the n=4 level: $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\n\nThe ground state is the lowest possible total energy for the system. We fill the energy levels from the bottom up, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   Two particles are placed in the **n=1** level (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2E$.\n*   The remaining two particles are placed in the **n=2** level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy above the ground state. This is achieved by the \"cheapest\" possible promotion of one particle.\n*   Promote one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: {2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n*   The total energy for this state is: $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nThe second excited state has the next lowest total energy. We must systematically check other possible low-energy promotions.\n*   **Possibility 1 (First Excited State):** Promoting `n=2 → n=3`. Total energy = 15E.\n*   **Possibility 2:** Promoting `n=1 → n=3`. The configuration becomes {1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}. The total energy is $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n*   **Possibility 3:** Promoting `n=2 → n=4`. The total energy is $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\nBy comparing the total energies of possible states {10E, 15E, 18E, 22E, ...}, we find the third-lowest energy for the system is 18E.\n\n### Careful Points in this Problem\n1.  **Particle Statistics:** The most important point is recognizing that spin-1/2 particles are **fermions** and obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. A common mistake is to treat them as bosons, which would incorrectly place all four particles in the n=1 state for a ground state energy of 4E (as seen in option A and B).\n2.  **State Occupancy:** The Pauli Principle applies to the full quantum state (`n` and `m_s`). This means each energy level `n` can accommodate **two** particles (one spin-up, one spin-down). Forgetting this and allowing only one particle per level would lead to an incorrect ground state configuration in levels n=1, 2, 3, and 4, for an energy of $1E+4E+9E+16E = 30E$ (as seen in option C).\n3.  **Systematic Excitation:** To find the second excited state, one must find the configuration with the third-lowest *total system energy*. This requires comparing the energies of different promotions, not just assuming the next simplest jump. The promotion `n=1 → n=3` results in a total system energy of 18E, which is lower than promoting `n=2 → n=4` (total energy 22E).\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe calculated energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are **10E**, **15E**, and **18E**, respectively.\n\nComparing this result to the provided options:\nA) 4E, 10E, 15E\nB) 4E, 10E, 50E\nC) 30E, 39E, 50E\nD) 10E, 15E, 18E\n\nThe calculated sequence exactly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
