All four candidate molecules fit this requirement.\n*   **Mixture Ratio**: The compounds are present in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm)**: There are two signals, both are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **1:1**.\n    *   This implies the mixture contains two compounds with different aromatic proton environments. Since it's a 1:1 mixture with a 1:1 signal ratio, the number of protons contributing to each signal must be identical. For tetramethylbenzenes, this means each signal arises from 2 protons (2H).\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm)**: There are three signals, all are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Alkyl signals are singlets.** This is a critical piece of evidence. The absence of spin-spin splitting (e.g., quartets, triplets) in the alkyl region definitively rules out structures containing ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃), as the adjacent CH₂ and CH₃ protons would couple.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Alkyl signal integration.** In a 1:1 mixture of two tetramethylbenzene isomers (C10H14), each compound has 12 methyl protons. The total number of methyl protons in the mixture is therefore 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 integration ratio represents a total of 4 parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the absolute number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Total parts = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4\n        *   Protons per part = 24 total protons / 4 parts = 6 protons\n        *   The three signals must therefore correspond to integrations of:\n            *   2 parts * 6 protons/part = **12H**\n            *   1 part * 6 protons/part = **6H**\n            *   1 part * 6 protons/part = **6H**\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nNext, we analyze the structure and symmetry of each candidate to predict its individual ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**:\n    *   As established in Careful Point 1, the ethyl groups in this molecule would produce a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region due to spin-spin coupling. This contradicts the experimental data.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound can be **immediately eliminated**. This rules out **Option B**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons at positions C-3 and C-6 are chemically equivalent and produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons at positions C-5 and C-6 are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C-1/C-4 are equivalent, and the pair at C-2/C-3 are also equivalent. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons at positions C-4 and C-6 are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C-1/C-3 (6H), the unique methyl at C-2 (3H), and the unique methyl at C-5 (3H). This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Mixtures**\n\nWe must now find which pair of compounds, when combined in a 1:1 ratio, produces the required spectral pattern: three alkyl singlets integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   `1,2,3,4-TMB` contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   `1,2,3,5-TMB` contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined spectrum: This mixture does not produce a 12H signal and contains unwanted 3H signals. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   This option was already eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give singlets in the alkyl region. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   `1,2,4,5-TMB` contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   `1,2,3,5-TMB` contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined spectrum: This mixture would produce four alkyl signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which contradicts the experimental data showing only three signals. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Alkyl Region Check**:\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes **one singlet integrating to 12H**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes **two singlets, each integrating to 6H**.\n    *   **Combined Result**: The mixture's spectrum contains exactly **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Aromatic Region Check**: Each compound produces one 2H singlet. Since they are different compounds, their signals will have different chemical shifts, resulting in two singlets with a 1:1 integration. This also matches the data perfectly.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is the 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem by evaluating the provided information and candidate compounds.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Spectral Data**\n\nFirst, let's translate the experimental data for the 1:1 mixture into a clear set of structural requirements.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄. All four listed candidates satisfy this condition.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are **three signals**, and critically, all are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: The \"singlet\" constraint is decisive.** The absence of spin-spin splitting (like quartets or triplets) in the alkyl region immediately rules out structures with coupled alkyl protons, such as ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Calculate the absolute integration.** Each candidate isomer is a tetramethylbenzene, meaning each has 12 alkyl protons (4 x CH₃) and 2 aromatic protons. In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 (from compound 1) + 12 (from compound 2) = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). To find the number of protons represented by each signal, we calculate:\n        *   Protons per part = 24 / 4 = 6H.\n        *   Signal 1 (2 parts): 2 × 6H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (1 part): 1 × 6H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (1 part): 1 × 6H = **6H**\n    Therefore, the alkyl region of the spectrum must consist of three singlets integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two signals**, both are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **1:1**.\n    *   **Careful Point 3: The aromatic signal meaning.** Since the compounds are mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio and the signal ratio is 1:1, this implies that the number of protons contributing to each of the two aromatic signals is identical. For the tetramethylbenzene isomers, this means each compound contributes a distinct 2H singlet.\n\n### **2. Predict the Spectra of the Individual Candidate Compounds**\n\nThe core of the problem is to accurately predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each isomer based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Analysis:** This compound has two ethyl groups. As identified in Careful Point 1, the adjacent -CH₂- and -CH₃ protons will split each other, producing a characteristic **quartet** and **triplet** in the alkyl region.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This directly contradicts the \"all singlets\" requirement. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be definitively eliminated**. This rules out option **C**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical (two perpendicular planes of symmetry).\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent and produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** One plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the pair at C2/C3 are also equivalent. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** One plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique methyl at C2 (3H), and the unique methyl at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Candidate Mixtures**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that generates an alkyl spectrum with three singlets corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Durene contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   **Combined Result:** Four total signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match the observed three signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Combined Result:** Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give singlets in the alkyl region. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Prehnitene contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   **Combined Result:** This mixture would not produce the required 12H signal and contains 3H signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals from 1,2,4,5-TMB (Durene):** **one singlet (12H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals from 1,2,3,4-TMB (Prehnitene):** **two singlets (6H each)**.\n    *   **Combined Result (Alkyl):** The mixture produces exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Combined Result (Aromatic):** Each compound gives one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture correctly creates two distinct signals, each integrating to 2H, perfectly matching the 1:1 ratio requirement. This is also a perfect match.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\nThe only pair of compounds whose 1:1 mixture precisely accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct mixture of compounds.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Spectral Data and Identify Key Constraints**\n\nThe problem provides crucial information about a 1:1 molar mixture of two isomers with the formula C₁₀H₁₄. Let's break down the spectral data into a set of concrete requirements for the mixture.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows **two signals**, both of which are **singlets**, with a **1:1 integration ratio**.\n    *   **Careful Point 1**: A 1:1 molar mixture giving two signals with a 1:1 integration ratio implies that each compound contributes one distinct aromatic signal, and those signals must arise from an equal number of protons. Given the tetramethylbenzene structures, each has two aromatic protons, so we are looking for a mixture that produces two different 2H singlets.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows **three signals**, all of which are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (The \"Singlets\" Constraint)**: This is a powerful clue. The absence of splitting patterns like quartets or triplets in the alkyl region means the alkyl protons are not coupled to adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This strongly argues against structures containing ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃), which would exhibit such splitting.\n    *   **Careful Point 3 (Absolute Integration)**: We must calculate the absolute number of protons for the 2:1:1 ratio. In a 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ tetramethylbenzene isomers, there are a total of 12 alkyl protons from the first compound + 12 from the second, for a total of **24 alkyl protons**. A 2:1:1 ratio represents 4 total parts (2+1+1). Therefore, the number of protons per signal is:\n        *   (2/4) × 24H = **12H**\n        *   (1/4) × 24H = **6H**\n        *   (1/4) × 24H = **6H**\n    The correct mixture *must* produce three alkyl singlets with these exact integrations.\n\n### **2. Predict the Spectra of the Individual Candidate Compounds**\n\nNext, we analyze the structure and symmetry of each candidate to predict its individual ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** As identified in Careful Point 2, the ethyl groups in this molecule would produce a characteristic **quartet** and **triplet** in the alkyl region due to proton-proton coupling. This contradicts the \"all singlets\" data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be **immediately eliminated**. This rules out any option containing it. In this case, option **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene** is incorrect.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule also has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups (the C1/C3 pair, the unique C2, and the unique C5), producing **three singlets (one 6H and two 3H)**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Candidate Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for the pair of compounds whose individual spectra combine to match the experimental data from Careful Point 3: **three alkyl singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.**\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Combined alkyl signals: One 12H singlet (from durene) + one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets (from isodurene).\n    *   Result: This combination would result in four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Combined alkyl signals: Two 6H singlets (from prehnitene) + one 6H and two 3H singlets (from isodurene).\n    *   Result: This combination does not have a 12H signal and contains 3H signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene:** Provides **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:** Provides **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   **Combined Result:** The mixture has exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies perfectly to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Aromatic Check**: Each compound provides one 2H aromatic singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this creates two distinct singlets, each integrating to 2H, matching the required 1:1 ratio. This also matches perfectly.\n\nThe only pair of compounds whose 1:1 mixture precisely accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct mixture of compounds based on the provided ¹H NMR data.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data and Define Constraints\nFirst, we must deconstruct the provided spectral information for the 1:1 molar mixture and turn it into a set of strict chemical requirements.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C₁₀H₁₄. All candidates fit this.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):**\n    *   There are **three signals**.\n    *   **All signals are singlets.** This is a critical point. The absence of splitting (like quartets and triplets) means the alkyl protons are not coupled to adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This effectively rules out any compound containing an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃), which would exhibit splitting.\n    *   **Integration ratio is 2:1:1.** In a 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers (each being a tetramethylbenzene), there are a total of 12 alkyl protons from the first compound and 12 from the second, for a total of 24 alkyl protons. The ratio 2:1:1 has 4 total parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the absolute number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Protons per part = 24 / 4 = 6 protons.\n        *   Signal 1 (2 parts): 2 × 6H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (1 part): 1 × 6H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (1 part): 1 × 6H = **6H**\n    *   **Conclusion for Alkyl Region:** The mixture must contain compounds that, when combined, produce exactly three singlet signals integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H respectively.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):**\n    *   There are **two signals**.\n    *   **Both signals are singlets.**\n    *   **Integration ratio is 1:1.**\n    *   **Conclusion for Aromatic Region:** Since the mixture and signal ratio are both 1:1, each compound must contribute a distinct aromatic signal, and those signals must arise from an equal number of protons. For tetramethylbenzenes, this means each compound contributes a 2H singlet.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the NMR Spectra of the Individual Candidate Compounds\nNext, we analyze the structure and symmetry of each candidate to predict its individual ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule has ethyl groups. As identified in Step 1, this is incompatible with the \"all singlets\" data for the alkyl region.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is **immediately eliminated**. Any option containing it is incorrect. This rules out option **A**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** It has two equivalent protons, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** It has four equivalent methyl groups, producing **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** It has two equivalent protons, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** It has two distinct sets of equivalent methyl groups (C1/C4 and C2/C3), producing **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule also has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** It has two equivalent protons, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** It has three distinct sets of methyl groups (the C1/C3 pair, C2, and C5), producing **three singlets (one 6H, two 3H)**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Mixtures\nWe are looking for a pair of compounds whose spectra, when combined in a 1:1 ratio, match the required signal pattern: three alkyl singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out due to 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB provides: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined Result: This would produce four alkyl signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which does not match the observed three signals. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB provides: two 6H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB provides: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined Result: This mixture would be missing the required 12H signal and would contain 3H signals. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum Check:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes **one singlet of 12H**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes **two singlets of 6H each**.\n    *   **Combined Result:** The mixture produces exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum Check:** Each compound provides one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture creates two distinct signals, each integrating to 2H, perfectly matching the **two singlets, 1:1 ratio** requirement. **This is also a perfect match.**\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is the 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct mixture of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data and Identify Key Constraints**\n\nFirst, we deconstruct the information provided for the 1:1 molar mixture:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄. All four options are consistent with this.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two signals**, both are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **1:1**.\n    *   **Implication:** This means the two compounds in the mixture have different chemical environments for their aromatic protons. Since the mixture and signal ratio are both 1:1, the number of protons giving rise to each signal must be identical (e.g., each signal corresponds to 2 protons).\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are **three signals**, all are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: All Signals are Singlets.** This is a critical constraint. It means that none of the alkyl protons are subject to spin-spin splitting from adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This effectively rules out any structure containing groups like ethyl (-CH₂CH₃), which would produce a characteristic quartet and triplet.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Absolute Proton Count.** In a 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers (each with 12 methyl protons), the total number of alkyl protons is 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 integration ratio represents a total of 4 parts (2+1+1=4). We can calculate the absolute number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Protons per \"part\" = 24 protons / 4 parts = 6 protons.\n        *   Signal 1 (2 parts) corresponds to 2 * 6H = **12H**.\n        *   Signal 2 (1 part) corresponds to 1 * 6H = **6H**.\n        *   Signal 3 (1 part) corresponds to 1 * 6H = **6H**.\n    Therefore, our target mixture must produce one 12H singlet and two 6H singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nNext, we predict the individual spectrum for each candidate based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** As identified in Careful Point 1, the ethyl groups would produce a quartet and a triplet due to coupling.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This contradicts the \"all singlets\" data. This compound can be **immediately eliminated**. This rules out option **B**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C-3 and C-6) are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C-5 and C-6) are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C-1/C-4 are equivalent, and the pair at C-2/C-3 are also equivalent. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule also has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C-4 and C-6 are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C-1/C-3 (6H), the unique one at C-2 (3H), and the unique one at C-5 (3H). This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Possible Mixture Combinations**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that results in an alkyl spectrum containing three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   *Alkyl Signals:* Two 6H singlets (from 1,2,3,4-TMB) + one 6H and two 3H singlets (from 1,2,3,5-TMB).\n    *   *Result:* This mixture is missing the required 12H signal and contains unwanted 3H signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   *Result:* Ruled out because of 1,4-diethylbenzene. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   *Alkyl Signals:* One 12H singlet (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) + one 6H and two 3H singlets (from 1,2,3,5-TMB).\n    *   *Result:* This mixture would produce four total signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which does not match the observed three signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   *Alkyl Signals:*\n        *   From 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene): **one singlet (12H)**.\n        *   From 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene): **two singlets (6H each)**.\n    *   *Result:* This combination produces exactly **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match for the alkyl region data. The aromatic region also matches perfectly (one 2H singlet from Durene and one 2H singlet from Prehnitene give two signals in a 1:1 ratio). **Correct.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct mixture of compounds.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Spectral Information\n\nFirst, we must translate the provided ¹H NMR data into a clear set of requirements for the 1:1 molar mixture:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula**: Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄. All four candidate molecules match this.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm)**: The spectrum shows three signals, all are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Careful Point 1 (Singlet Multiplicity)**: The fact that all signals in the alkyl region are singlets is a critical clue. It means the protons giving rise to these signals are not split by adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This immediately allows us to rule out structures containing ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃), which would exhibit characteristic splitting patterns (a quartet and a triplet).\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Absolute Integration)**: The sample is a 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers. Assuming they are tetramethylbenzenes, each molecule has 12 alkyl protons (4 x CH₃), making a total of 24 alkyl protons in the sample. A 2:1:1 integration ratio represents 4 total parts (2+1+1=4). We can calculate the absolute number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (2 parts): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (1 part): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (1 part): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    Therefore, our target mixture must produce exactly three alkyl singlets with these specific integrations.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm)**: The spectrum shows two signals, both are **singlets**, with a **1:1** integration ratio.\n    *   **Careful Point 3 (Aromatic Signals)**: Since the mixture is 1:1 molar and the signal ratio is 1:1, the number of protons contributing to each of the two aromatic singlets must be identical. For a tetramethylbenzene, there are two aromatic protons, so this observation corresponds to two distinct 2H signals, one from each compound.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds\n\nNext, we must predict the individual ¹H NMR spectrum for each candidate based on its molecular structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**:\n    *   This compound contains two ethyl groups. As identified in Careful Point 1, this structure is incompatible with the \"all singlets\" data for the alkyl region because the ethyl groups would produce a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound can be **immediately ruled out**. Therefore, **Option D** is incorrect.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent and produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent and produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the pair at C2/C3 are also equivalent. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule also has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons at C4 and C6 are chemically equivalent and produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique methyl at C2 (3H), and the unique methyl at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Mixture Options\n\nFinally, we test which remaining 1:1 mixture satisfies the spectral data. The alkyl region is the most decisive, as we must find the pair that produces three singlets integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,3,4-TMB: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   **Result**: This mixture would contain 3H signals and lacks the required 12H signal. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,4,5-TMB: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   **Result**: This mixture would produce four alkyl signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which contradicts the observation of only three signals. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Check**: 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this creates two distinct signals with a 1:1 ratio. This matches.\n    *   **Alkyl Check**:\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) provides: **one singlet (12H)**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) provides: **two singlets (6H each)**.\n    *   **Result**: The mixture contains exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is the 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the ¹H NMR data to identify the correct pair of isomers from the given options. The reasoning process involves deconstructing the spectral data, predicting the spectra of individual candidate compounds, and then evaluating which 1:1 mixture matches the data.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectral Information\nFirst, we establish a clear set of structural requirements based on the experimental data provided for the 1:1 molar mixture.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula**: Both compounds have the formula C10H14. All four candidates meet this criterion.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm)**: There are two signals, both are singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   This implies the mixture contains two compounds with different aromatic proton environments.\n    *   Because it's a 1:1 molar mixture with a 1:1 signal ratio, the number of protons that create each of the two singlets must be identical (e.g., each signal comes from 2 protons).\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm)**: There are three signals, all are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Singlet Multiplicity**: The most critical clue is that all alkyl signals are singlets. This indicates that the protons creating these signals are not split by adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This immediately allows us to rule out structures with ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃), which would exhibit characteristic splitting patterns (a quartet and a triplet).\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Absolute Integration**: The sample is a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 isomers. For tetramethylbenzenes, each isomer has 12 alkyl protons (4 x CH₃), so the total number of alkyl protons is 24. A 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). Therefore, the number of protons per \"part\" is 24 protons / 4 parts = 6 protons. The three signals correspond to absolute integrations of:\n        *   Signal 1 (2 parts): 2 * 6H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (1 part): 1 * 6H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (1 part): 1 * 6H = **6H**\n    Our target mixture must produce exactly three alkyl singlets integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Candidate Compounds Individually\nNext, we must predict the individual ¹H NMR spectrum for each candidate based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene**: As identified in Careful Point 1, this compound has ethyl groups that would produce a quartet and a triplet, not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound can be **immediately ruled out**. This eliminates **Option B**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**: This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent and produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent and produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent and produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons at C4 and C6 are chemically equivalent and produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the C1/C3 pair (6H), the C2 methyl (3H), and the C5 methyl (3H). This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Mixture Options\nNow we test which of the remaining options (A, C, D) creates the required combined spectrum. The alkyl region (12H, 6H, 6H singlets) is the deciding factor.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   The combined spectrum does not contain a 12H signal and introduces 3H signals. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   The combined spectrum would have four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which contradicts the experimental data of three signals. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Alkyl Check**:\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   The combined spectrum has exactly three alkyl singlets integrating to **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies perfectly to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Aromatic Check**: Each compound gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this creates two distinct signals, each from 2 protons, matching the \"two singlets, 1:1 ratio\" requirement. This also matches perfectly.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe only pair of compounds whose 1:1 mixture perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the ¹H NMR Data**\nFirst, we establish a clear set of requirements based on the experimental data for the 1:1 molar mixture:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula**: C₁₀H₁₄. All four listed compounds meet this criterion.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm)**: There are two signals, both are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **1:1**. This implies the mixture contains two different compounds, and since they are mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio, each compound must contribute an aromatic signal representing an identical number of protons (in this case, 2 protons each).\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm)**: There are three signals, all are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**. This is the most crucial piece of information.\n\n### **2. Careful Analysis of Key Constraints**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The \"All Singlets\" Rule.** The most decisive piece of data is that all alkyl signals are singlets. In ¹H NMR, signals are split into multiplets (doublets, triplets, quartets, etc.) by adjacent, non-equivalent protons. The presence of only singlets rules out any structure where alkyl protons are coupled to other non-equivalent protons.\n    *   The ethyl groups in **1,4-diethylbenzene** contain adjacent -CH₂- and -CH₃ protons, which would split each other into a characteristic quartet and triplet, respectively. This contradicts the data.\n    *   **Conclusion**: 1,4-diethylbenzene can be immediately eliminated. This rules out **Option D**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Alkyl Integration Ratio.** We have a 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers. Assuming they are tetramethylbenzenes, each has 12 protons in its four methyl groups. The total number of alkyl protons in the mixture is 12 + 12 = 24.\n    *   The given ratio is 2:1:1, which has 4 total parts (2+1+1).\n    *   To find the absolute number of protons for each signal, we calculate:\n        *   Signal 1 (2 parts): (2/4) × 24 protons = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (1 part): (1/4) × 24 protons = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (1 part): (1/4) × 24 protons = **6H**\n    *   Therefore, our mixture must produce exactly three alkyl singlets with integrations corresponding to 12 protons, 6 protons, and 6 protons.\n\n### **3. Predicting Spectra of the Remaining Candidates**\nWe now predict the individual spectra for the three tetramethylbenzene isomers based on their symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**: Highly symmetrical.\n    *   Aromatic: One singlet (2H).\n    *   Alkyl: All four methyl groups are equivalent, giving **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**: Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Aromatic: One singlet (2H).\n    *   Alkyl: Two sets of equivalent methyl groups (C1/C4 and C2/C3), giving **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**: Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Aromatic: One singlet (2H).\n    *   Alkyl: Three sets of methyl groups (C1/C3 pair, C2, and C5), giving **three singlets (one 6H and two 3H)**.\n\n### **4. Evaluating the Mixture Options**\nWe now test which 1:1 mixture of the remaining isomers produces the required alkyl spectrum: {one 12H singlet, one 6H singlet, one 6H singlet}.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   `1,2,3,4-TMB`: two 6H singlets.\n    *   `1,2,3,5-TMB`: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Result: This combination would have signals corresponding to 6H and 3H, but no 12H signal. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   `1,2,4,5-TMB`: one 12H singlet.\n    *   `1,2,3,5-TMB`: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Result: This mixture would produce four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), contradicting the observation of only three signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   `1,2,4,5-TMB` contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   `1,2,3,4-TMB` contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   Result: The combination produces exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies perfectly to 2:1:1. The aromatic region also fits, as each compound gives a 2H singlet, leading to two distinct signals with a 1:1 ratio in the mixture. **This is a perfect match.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is the 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the ¹H NMR data to identify the correct pair of aromatic compounds from the given options.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectral Information and Identify Key Constraints**\n\nThe provided data about the 1:1 molar mixture gives us several critical clues:\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula**: C₁₀H₁₄. All four listed compounds satisfy this.\n2.  **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm): All Signals are Singlets.** This is a powerful constraint. The absence of spin-spin splitting (like quartets and triplets) means the alkyl protons are not coupled to adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This immediately rules out any compound containing an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃), as it would produce a characteristic quartet-triplet splitting pattern.\n3.  **Alkyl Region Integration:** There are **three singlets** in a **2:1:1 ratio**.\n    *   Since this is a 1:1 mixture of two tetramethylbenzene isomers, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 (from the first compound) + 12 (from the second) = 24.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio represents a total of 4 parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the absolute number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Protons per part = 24 total protons / 4 parts = 6 protons.\n        *   Signal 1 (2 parts): 2 × 6H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (1 part): 1 × 6H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (1 part): 1 × 6H = **6H**\n    *   Therefore, our mixture must produce three alkyl singlets integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n4.  **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two singlets** in a **1:1 ratio**.\n    *   This implies that the two compounds have distinct aromatic environments. Since it is a 1:1 mixture and the signal integration is 1:1, the number of protons contributing to each of the two aromatic signals must be identical. Each of the tetramethylbenzene isomers has two aromatic protons, which would give a single 2H singlet. A mixture of two different isomers would therefore give two distinct 2H singlets, matching the 1:1 ratio.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Candidate Compounds Individually**\n\nNow, we predict the individual ¹H NMR spectrum for each compound based on its symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**: As established in Step 1, the ethyl groups would produce a **quartet and a triplet** in the alkyl region. This contradicts the \"all singlets\" data.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound can be **eliminated**. Option (A) is therefore incorrect.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**: This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the pair at C2/C3 are also equivalent. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique methyl at C2 (3H), and the unique methyl at C5 (3H). This produces **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe now test which pair of compounds, when mixed 1:1, generates the required spectrum, focusing on the definitive alkyl region data (three singlets integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**: Eliminated due to 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**:\n    *   Signals: Durene (one 12H singlet) + Isodurene (one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets).\n    *   Result: This mixture would show four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**:\n    *   Signals: Prehnitene (two 6H singlets) + Isodurene (one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets).\n    *   Result: This mixture would show signals corresponding to 6H and 3H integrations but would lack the required 12H signal.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**:\n    *   **Signals from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene**: One singlet integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Signals from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**: Two singlets, each integrating to **6H**.\n    *   **Combined Result**: The mixture's spectrum will show exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match for all spectral data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the ¹H NMR data to identify the correct pair of aromatic compounds from the given options.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectral Information\nFirst, we must establish a clear set of requirements based on the experimental data provided for the 1:1 molar mixture.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄. All four candidate molecules match this.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows **three signals**, all of which are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Careful Point 1 (Signal Multiplicity):** The most critical piece of information is that all alkyl signals are **singlets**. This means the protons giving rise to these signals are not subject to spin-spin splitting by adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This fact immediately allows us to rule out any structure with ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃), as these would produce a characteristic quartet and a triplet due to splitting.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Absolute Integration):** The two compounds are C₁₀H₁₄ isomers, specifically tetramethylbenzenes, which means each has 12 alkyl protons (4 x CH₃). In a 1:1 molar mixture, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 integration ratio corresponds to a total of 4 parts (2+1+1). Therefore, the number of protons contributing to each signal is:\n        *   Signal 1 (2 parts): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (1 part): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (1 part): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    Our target mixture must produce three alkyl singlets integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows **two signals**, both of which are **singlets**, with a **1:1** integration ratio.\n    *   **Careful Point 3 (Aromatic Signals):** The presence of two distinct signals confirms it is a mixture of at least two different compounds. Since the mixture is 1:1 molar and the signal integration is 1:1, the number of protons that create each of the two aromatic singlets must be identical.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Candidate Compounds\nNext, we must predict the individual ¹H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds based on its molecular structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** As established in Careful Point 1, this structure contains ethyl groups and would produce quartets and triplets in the alkyl region, not just singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is **eliminated**. This immediately rules out **Option A**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at positions 3 and 6) are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at positions 5 and 6) are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the pair at C2/C3 are also equivalent. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique methyl at C2 (3H), and the unique methyl at C5 (3H). This produces **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options\nNow, we must find which pair of compounds combines to produce the required spectrum: three alkyl singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out due to 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   `1,2,4,5-TMB` contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   `1,2,3,5-TMB` contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   **Combined Result:** This mixture would show four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which does not match the observed three signals. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   `1,2,3,4-TMB` contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   `1,2,3,5-TMB` contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   **Combined Result:** This mixture would not produce the required 12H signal and contains 3H signals. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals Check:**\n        *   `1,2,4,5-TMB` (Durene) provides **one singlet of 12H**.\n        *   `1,2,3,4-TMB` (Prehnitene) provides **two singlets of 6H each**.\n    *   **Combined Result:** The mixture has exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match for the alkyl region data.\n    *   **Aromatic Signals Check:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives another 2H singlet at a different chemical shift. The 1:1 mixture therefore correctly produces two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This is a perfect match for the aromatic region data.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is the 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a systematic analysis of the provided ¹H NMR data to identify which pair of compounds is present in the 1:1 mixture.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Spectral Information and Key Constraints**\n\nFirst, let's translate the ¹H NMR data into a clear set of requirements for the unknown compounds.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄ isomers. All four candidates match this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio**.\n    *   **Implication:** In a 1:1 molar mixture, this means that each compound contributes a set of aromatic protons in a different chemical environment. The 1:1 ratio signifies that the number of protons creating each signal is identical. For the given structures, this corresponds to two distinct signals, each arising from 2 protons (2H).\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are **three singlets** with a **2:1:1 integration ratio**.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: All Signals are Singlets.** This is a critical constraint. It rules out any structure that would exhibit spin-spin splitting in the alkyl region, such as an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃), which would produce a characteristic quartet and a triplet.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Absolute Integration.** The mixture contains two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers. Assuming they are tetramethylbenzenes, each has 12 alkyl protons (4 x CH₃), making the total number of alkyl protons 24. A 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). The number of protons corresponding to each signal is:\n        *   (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    Therefore, our target mixture must produce three alkyl singlets integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H, respectively.\n\n### **2. Prediction of the Individual ¹H NMR Spectra**\n\nWe must now predict the spectrum for each candidate compound to see what signals it would contribute to the mixture.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   As established in Careful Point 1, this compound's ethyl groups would produce a quartet and a triplet, not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is definitively **ruled out**. This immediately eliminates **Option C**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical (two planes of symmetry).\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** All four methyl groups are equivalent, producing **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 bond.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the C1/C4 pair and the C2/C3 pair. This results in **two singlets, each integrating to 6H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the C1/C3 pair (6H), the unique C2 methyl (3H), and the unique C5 methyl (3H). This results in **three singlets integrating to 6H, 3H, and 3H**.\n\n### **3. Evaluation of the Mixture Options**\n\nThe decisive step is to find the pair of compounds whose individual spectra combine to match the experimental data, specifically the three alkyl singlets integrating to **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Prehnitene contributes two 6H singlets. Isodurene contributes one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets. This combination lacks the required 12H signal and introduces 3H signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Already ruled out due to the presence of 1,4-diethylbenzene. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Durene contributes a 12H singlet. Isodurene contributes a 6H singlet and two 3H singlets. The mixture would show four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), contradicting the observation of three signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** Each compound provides one distinct 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this correctly produces two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Alkyl Check:**\n        *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** provides **one 12H singlet**.\n        *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** provides **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   **Combined Result:** The mixture has exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies perfectly to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match for all the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is the 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem by synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and verifying the chemical principles.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectral Information\nFirst, we establish a clear set of structural requirements based on the ¹H NMR data provided for the 1:1 molar mixture.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula**: Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄. All four candidates fit this.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm)**:\n    *   There are **three signals**.\n    *   All signals are **singlets**. This is a crucial constraint. It indicates that none of the alkyl protons are subject to spin-spin splitting from adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This immediately rules out structures with coupled protons, such as ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃), which would produce a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   The integration ratio is **2:1:1**. For a 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers that are tetramethylbenzenes, each has 12 alkyl protons (4 x CH₃), for a total of 24 alkyl protons. A 2:1:1 ratio (4 total parts) for 24 protons corresponds to absolute integrations of:\n        *   Signal 1 (2 parts): (2/4) × 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (1 part): (1/4) × 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (1 part): (1/4) × 24H = **6H**\n    Therefore, the alkyl region of the mixture must contain three singlets integrating to 12 protons, 6 protons, and 6 protons, respectively.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm)**:\n    *   There are **two signals**.\n    *   Both signals are **singlets**.\n    *   The integration ratio is **1:1**. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, this means the number of protons contributing to each of the two aromatic signals is identical.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound\nWe must analyze the structure and symmetry of each candidate to predict its individual spectrum. This is a point of universal agreement among all provided agent analyses.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**:\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule contains two ethyl groups. Due to proton-proton coupling, these groups would produce a characteristic **quartet** and a **triplet** in the alkyl region.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This directly contradicts the experimental data. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is eliminated**. This immediately rules out **Option C**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons (at positions 3 and 6) are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: One plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons (at positions 5 and 6) are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the pair at C2/C3 are also equivalent. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: One plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This produces **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Mixtures\nWe are looking for the 1:1 mixture that generates the target spectrum, especially in the alkyl region which requires three singlets with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\n*   **Mixture B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl Signals: One 12H singlet (from Durene) + one 6H and two 3H singlets (from Isodurene).\n    *   Combined Result: **Four** total signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **Mixture D: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl Signals: Two 6H singlets (from Prehnitene) + one 6H and two 3H singlets (from Isodurene).\n    *   Combined Result: This mixture lacks the required 12H signal and introduces 3H signals. This does not match.\n\n*   **Mixture A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Check**: 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives a different 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this creates **two distinct singlets**, each from 2 protons, matching the **1:1 ratio** requirement.\n    *   **Alkyl Check**:\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes: **one singlet (12H)**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes: **two singlets (6H each)**.\n    *   **Combined Result**: The mixture produces exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match for all experimental data.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, precisely accounts for all the features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This combination corresponds to Option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis problem requires a detailed analysis of the provided ¹H NMR spectral data to identify the two compounds in a 1:1 mixture.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectral Information**\n\nFirst, let's establish a clear set of structural requirements based on the experimental data provided for the 1:1 molar mixture.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄. All four candidate compounds meet this requirement.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, with a key characteristic that they are all **singlets**, and they have an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Careful Point 1 (Signal Multiplicity):** The fact that all signals are singlets is a critical clue. Protons that are part of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) would show spin-spin coupling, resulting in a triplet and a quartet. Since only singlets are observed, we can rule out any compound containing an ethyl group.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Integration Calculation):** Each candidate compound has a C₁₀H₁₄ formula. For the tetramethylbenzene isomers, there are 4 methyl groups, meaning 4 x 3 = 12 alkyl protons per molecule. In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 integration ratio represents 4 total parts (2+1+1=4). The absolute number of protons for each signal is therefore:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) × 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) × 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) × 24H = **6H**\n    The correct mixture must therefore produce three alkyl singlets with integrations corresponding to 12 protons, 6 protons, and 6 protons.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two singlets** with a **1:1** integration ratio.\n    *   **Careful Point 3 (Aromatic Signals):** For a 1:1 mixture to give two signals in a 1:1 ratio, it means that each compound contributes a set of aromatic protons in a unique chemical environment, and the number of protons in each set is identical. For tetramethylbenzene isomers, each has 2 aromatic protons, so this observation is consistent with a mixture of any two of them, as each will give a 2H singlet at a slightly different chemical shift.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Candidate Compounds**\n\nBased on the careful points above, let's evaluate each candidate.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** As established in Careful Point 1, this compound contains ethyl groups and would produce triplets and quartets in the alkyl region. This contradicts the \"all singlets\" data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be immediately **eliminated**. This rules out option **A**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** Due to symmetry, all four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. It will produce **one alkyl singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two ring protons are also equivalent, producing one 2H singlet.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** The methyl groups at C1/C4 are equivalent to each other, and the methyl groups at C2/C3 are equivalent to each other. These two sets are not equivalent to each other. This results in **two alkyl singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two ring protons are equivalent, producing one 2H singlet.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule also has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are three distinct types of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the single one at C2 (3H), and the single one at C5 (3H). It will produce **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **6H, 3H, and 3H**.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two ring protons are equivalent, producing one 2H singlet.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow, we must find the 1:1 mixture that combines to give three alkyl singlets integrating to **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out.\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Prehnitene contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined, this mixture does not produce a 12H signal and contains 3H signals, which is inconsistent with the required {12H, 6H, 6H} pattern. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Durene contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined, this mixture would have four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which does not match the observed three signals. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   `1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene` contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   `1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene` contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   **Combined Result:** The mixture produces exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the alkyl region data. The aromatic region also matches perfectly, as each compound gives a distinct 2H singlet.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds whose 1:1 mixture perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the provided ¹H NMR data to identify the correct pair of compounds from the given options. We will systematically analyze the spectral data and predict the spectra for each candidate compound to find the correct match.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Spectral Data**\n\nFirst, let's establish the key constraints imposed by the experimental data on the 1:1 molar mixture:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄. All four candidate molecules satisfy this.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are **three signals**, all are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: All Signals are Singlets.** This is a critical piece of information. The absence of splitting (like quartets and triplets) means the alkyl protons are not coupled to any adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This immediately allows us to assess the structures. Structures containing ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) would exhibit splitting and can therefore be eliminated.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Absolute Integration.** The mixture is a 1:1 ratio of C₁₀H₁₄ isomers. The candidate isomers are all tetramethylbenzenes, meaning each has 12 alkyl protons (4 x CH₃). The total number of alkyl protons in the sample is therefore 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 integration ratio represents 4 total \"parts\" (2+1+1). The number of protons corresponding to each signal is:\n        *   Signal 1 (2 parts): (2/4) × 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (1 part): (1/4) × 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (1 part): (1/4) × 24H = **6H**\n        Therefore, we are looking for a mixture that produces exactly three singlets integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two signals**, both are **singlets**, with a **1:1** integration ratio.\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Aromatic Signals.** Since the molar ratio of the compounds is 1:1 and the signal integration is 1:1, the number of protons contributing to each of the two aromatic singlets must be identical. All tetramethylbenzene isomers have two aromatic protons, so this observation is consistent with a mixture of any two of them, as long as their aromatic protons have different chemical shifts.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Individual Candidate Compounds**\n\nNext, we predict the individual ¹H NMR spectrum for each candidate based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has two ethyl groups. As identified in Careful Point 1, the adjacent -CH₂- and -CH₃- protons will split each other, producing a quartet and a triplet, not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is definitively eliminated. This rules out **Option B**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule also has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique methyl at C2 (3H), and the unique methyl at C5 (3H). This produces **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Mixtures**\n\nWe must now test the remaining options to find the pair that produces the required alkyl spectrum: three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Signals contributed: (one 12H singlet) + (one 6H and two 3H singlets).\n    *   Result: This mixture would show four alkyl signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which does not match the observed three signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Signals contributed: (two 6H singlets) + (one 6H and two 3H singlets).\n    *   Result: This mixture lacks the required 12H signal and contains 3H signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** Each compound provides one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture creates two distinct signals, each integrating to 2H, which correctly matches the \"two singlets, 1:1 ratio\" requirement.\n    *   **Alkyl Check:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides: **one 12H singlet**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   **Result:** The combination yields exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is the 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer by synthesizing and verifying the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the ¹H NMR Spectral Data**\n\nFirst, let's establish a clear set of requirements based on the experimental data for the 1:1 molar mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula**: Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄ isomers. All four candidates fit this.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm)**: There are **two signals**, both are **singlets**, with a **1:1 integration ratio**.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm)**: There are **three signals**, all are **singlets**, with a **2:1:1 integration ratio**.\n\n### **2. Identification of Careful Points & Key Constraints**\n\nSeveral points are crucial for the analysis.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Alkyl signals are all singlets.** This is a critical piece of information. The absence of splitting patterns like quartets and triplets means the alkyl protons are not coupled to any adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This strongly suggests the alkyl groups are isolated methyls attached to the benzene ring and allows for the immediate elimination of any candidate with an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃), which would exhibit splitting.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Interpretation of the alkyl integration ratio.** This is the decisive factor. In a 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers (each being a tetramethylbenzene with 12 alkyl protons), the total number of alkyl protons is 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio represents a total of 4 parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the absolute number of protons for each signal:\n    *   Protons per \"part\" = 24 total protons / 4 parts = 6 protons.\n    *   The three signals must therefore correspond to integrations of **12H** (2 parts), **6H** (1 part), and **6H** (1 part).\n    The goal is to find the pair of compounds whose individual spectra combine to produce exactly three singlets with these integrations.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Interpretation of the aromatic signals.** A 1:1 molar mixture producing two singlets in a 1:1 integration ratio implies that each compound gives one distinct aromatic signal, and those signals arise from an equal number of protons. For tetramethylbenzene isomers, each has 2 aromatic protons, so a mixture of any two will give two 2H signals, satisfying this condition. This means the alkyl region data is required to make the final choice.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Individual Candidate Compounds**\n\nNext, we must predict the individual ¹H NMR spectrum for each candidate based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**: Based on Careful Point 1, this compound is incompatible with the \"all singlets\" data due to its ethyl groups.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound can be **immediately ruled out**. This eliminates **Option D**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**: This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are two distinct sets of equivalent methyl groups (the C1/C4 pair and the C2/C3 pair), producing **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups (the C1/C3 pair, the unique C2, and the unique C5), producing **three singlets (one 6H and two 3H)**.\n\n### **4. Evaluation of the Mixture Options**\n\nWe now test which 1:1 mixture of the remaining compounds (A, B, or C) can produce the target alkyl spectrum: three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Prehnitene contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined result: This mixture introduces 3H signals and does not create the required {12H, 6H, 6H} pattern. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Durene contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined result: This would produce four alkyl signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   **Combined result:** This mixture produces exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies perfectly to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is the 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct mixture of compounds based on the provided ¹H NMR data.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Spectral Information and Identify Key Constraints**\n\nThe problem provides several critical pieces of information about a 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds with the molecular formula C₁₀H₁₄.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both are singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   In a 1:1 molar mixture, a 1:1 signal ratio implies that both compounds contribute a signal from an equal number of protons. All the candidate tetramethylbenzene isomers have two aromatic protons (2H), so any mixture of two different ones would correctly produce two distinct 2H singlets, resulting in a 1:1 ratio. This information confirms we have a mixture but doesn't differentiate between the tetramethylbenzene options.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. This is the most diagnostic information.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 1: The \"All Singlets\" Rule.** This is a powerful constraint. The absence of spin-spin splitting (e.g., quartets, triplets) in the alkyl region means the alkyl protons are not coupled to adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This immediately rules out any compound containing an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃), as the CH₂ and CH₃ protons would split each other. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Absolute Integration.** With 1,4-diethylbenzene eliminated, the mixture must consist of two tetramethylbenzene isomers. Each tetramethylbenzene (C₁₀H₁₄) has 12 protons on its four methyl groups. In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 + 12 = **24 protons**. The integration ratio is 2:1:1, which represents a total of 4 parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the absolute number of protons corresponding to each signal:\n        *   Protons per \"part\" = 24 protons / 4 parts = 6 protons.\n        *   Signal 1 (2 parts): 2 × 6H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (1 part): 1 × 6H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (1 part): 1 × 6H = **6H**\n    The correct mixture must, therefore, produce three alkyl singlets with these exact integrations: one 12H signal and two 6H signals.\n\n### **2. Predict the Spectra of the Individual Candidate Compounds**\n\nNext, we analyze the structure and symmetry of each candidate to predict its individual ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out based on Careful Point 1.\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. It produces **one singlet (12H)**.\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are two distinct sets of equivalent methyl groups (the C1/C4 pair and the C2/C3 pair). It produces **two singlets (6H each)**.\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule also has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups (the C1/C3 pair, the unique C2, and the unique C5). It produces **three singlets (one 6H and two 3H)**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Candidate Mixture Options**\n\nWe now test which pair of compounds, when mixed 1:1, generates the required alkyl spectrum: {one 12H singlet, two 6H singlets}.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out because it contains 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   `1,2,3,4-TMB` contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   `1,2,3,5-TMB` contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   **Result:** This combination does not produce a 12H signal and incorrectly introduces 3H signals. Incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   `1,2,4,5-TMB` contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   `1,2,3,5-TMB` contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   **Result:** This combination would produce four alkyl signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which contradicts the experimental data showing only three signals. Incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   `1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene` contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   `1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene` contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   **Combined Result:** The mixture produces exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies perfectly to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match for all spectral data.\n\n<<<D>>>"

All four candidate molecules fit this requirement.\n*   **Mixture Ratio**: The compounds are present in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm)**: There are two signals, both are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **1:1**.\n    *   This implies the mixture contains two compounds with different aromatic proton environments. Since it's a 1:1 mixture with a 1:1 signal ratio, the number of protons contributing to each signal must be identical. For tetramethylbenzenes, this means each signal arises from 2 protons (2H).\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm)**: There are three signals, all are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Alkyl signals are singlets.** This is a critical piece of evidence. The absence of spin-spin splitting (e.g., quartets, triplets) in the alkyl region definitively rules out structures containing ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃), as the adjacent CH₂ and CH₃ protons would couple.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Alkyl signal integration.** In a 1:1 mixture of two tetramethylbenzene isomers (C10H14), each compound has 12 methyl protons. The total number of methyl protons in the mixture is therefore 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 integration ratio represents a total of 4 parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the absolute number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Total parts = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4\n        *   Protons per part = 24 total protons / 4 parts = 6 protons\n        *   The three signals must therefore correspond to integrations of:\n            *   2 parts * 6 protons/part = **12H**\n            *   1 part * 6 protons/part = **6H**\n            *   1 part * 6 protons/part = **6H**\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nNext, we analyze the structure and symmetry of each candidate to predict its individual ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**:\n    *   As established in Careful Point 1, the ethyl groups in this molecule would produce a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region due to spin-spin coupling.

This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons at positions C-4 and C-6 are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C-1/C-3 (6H), the unique methyl at C-2 (3H), and the unique methyl at C-5 (3H).

Since they are different compounds, their signals will have different chemical shifts, resulting in two singlets with a 1:1 integration. This also matches the data perfectly.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is the 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem by evaluating the provided information and candidate compounds.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Spectral Data**\n\nFirst, let's translate the experimental data for the 1:1 mixture into a clear set of structural requirements.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄. All four listed candidates satisfy this condition.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are **three signals**, and critically, all are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: The \"singlet\" constraint is decisive.** The absence of spin-spin splitting (like quartets or triplets) in the alkyl region immediately rules out structures with coupled alkyl protons, such as ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Calculate the absolute integration.** Each candidate isomer is a tetramethylbenzene, meaning each has 12 alkyl protons (4 x CH₃) and 2 aromatic protons. In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 (from compound 1) + 12 (from compound 2) = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). To find the number of protons represented by each signal, we calculate:\n        *   Protons per part = 24 / 4 = 6H.\n        *   Signal 1 (2 parts): 2 × 6H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (1 part): 1 × 6H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (1 part): 1 × 6H = **6H**\n    Therefore, the alkyl region of the spectrum must consist of three singlets integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two signals**, both are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **1:1**.\n    *   **Careful Point 3: The aromatic signal meaning.** Since the compounds are mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio and the signal ratio is 1:1, this implies that the number of protons contributing to each of the two aromatic signals is identical. For the tetramethylbenzene isomers, this means each compound contributes a distinct 2H singlet.\n\n### **2. Predict the Spectra of the Individual Candidate Compounds**\n\nThe core of the problem is to accurately predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each isomer based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Analysis:** This compound has two ethyl groups. As identified in Careful Point 1, the adjacent -CH₂- and -CH₃ protons will split each other, producing a characteristic **quartet** and **triplet** in the alkyl region.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This directly contradicts the \"all singlets\" requirement. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be definitively eliminated**. This rules out option **C**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical (two perpendicular planes of symmetry).\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent and produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** One plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the pair at C2/C3 are also equivalent. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** One plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique methyl at C2 (3H), and the unique methyl at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Candidate Mixtures**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that generates an alkyl spectrum with three singlets corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Durene contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   **Combined Result:** Four total signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match the observed three signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Combined Result:** Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give singlets in the alkyl region. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Prehnitene contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   **Combined Result:** This mixture would not produce the required 12H signal and contains 3H signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals from 1,2,4,5-TMB (Durene):** **one singlet (12H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals from 1,2,3,4-TMB (Prehnitene):** **two singlets (6H each)**.\n    *   **Combined Result (Alkyl):** The mixture produces exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Combined Result (Aromatic):** Each compound gives one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture correctly creates two distinct signals, each integrating to 2H, perfectly matching the 1:1 ratio requirement. This is also a perfect match.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\nThe only pair of compounds whose 1:1 mixture precisely accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct mixture of compounds.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Spectral Data and Identify Key Constraints**\n\nThe problem provides crucial information about a 1:1 molar mixture of two isomers with the formula C₁₀H₁₄. Let's break down the spectral data into a set of concrete requirements for the mixture.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows **two signals**, both of which are **singlets**, with a **1:1 integration ratio**.\n    *   **Careful Point 1**: A 1:1 molar mixture giving two signals with a 1:1 integration ratio implies that each compound contributes one distinct aromatic signal, and those signals must arise from an equal number of protons. Given the tetramethylbenzene structures, each has two aromatic protons, so we are looking for a mixture that produces two different 2H singlets.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows **three signals**, all of which are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (The \"Singlets\" Constraint)**: This is a powerful clue. The absence of splitting patterns like quartets or triplets in the alkyl region means the alkyl protons are not coupled to adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This strongly argues against structures containing ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃), which would exhibit such splitting.\n    *   **Careful Point 3 (Absolute Integration)**: We must calculate the absolute number of protons for the 2:1:1 ratio. In a 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ tetramethylbenzene isomers, there are a total of 12 alkyl protons from the first compound + 12 from the second, for a total of **24 alkyl protons**. A 2:1:1 ratio represents 4 total parts (2+1+1). Therefore, the number of protons per signal is:\n        *   (2/4) × 24H = **12H**\n        *   (1/4) × 24H = **6H**\n        *   (1/4) × 24H = **6H**\n    The correct mixture *must* produce three alkyl singlets with these exact integrations.\n\n### **2. Predict the Spectra of the Individual Candidate Compounds**\n\nNext, we analyze the structure and symmetry of each candidate to predict its individual ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** As identified in Careful Point 2, the ethyl groups in this molecule would produce a characteristic **quartet** and **triplet** in the alkyl region due to proton-proton coupling. This contradicts the \"all singlets\" data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be **immediately eliminated**. This rules out any option containing it. In this case, option **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene** is incorrect.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule also has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups (the C1/C3 pair, the unique C2, and the unique C5), producing **three singlets (one 6H and two 3H)**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Candidate Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for the pair of compounds whose individual spectra combine to match the experimental data from Careful Point 3: **three alkyl singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.**\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Combined alkyl signals: One 12H singlet (from durene) + one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets (from isodurene).\n    *   Result: This combination would result in four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Combined alkyl signals: Two 6H singlets (from prehnitene) + one 6H and two 3H singlets (from isodurene).\n    *   Result: This combination does not have a 12H signal and contains 3H signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene:** Provides **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:** Provides **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   **Combined Result:** The mixture has exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies perfectly to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Aromatic Check**: Each compound provides one 2H aromatic singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this creates two distinct singlets, each integrating to 2H, matching the required 1:1 ratio. This also matches perfectly.\n\nThe only pair of compounds whose 1:1 mixture precisely accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct mixture of compounds based on the provided ¹H NMR data.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data and Define Constraints\nFirst, we must deconstruct the provided spectral information for the 1:1 molar mixture and turn it into a set of strict chemical requirements.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C₁₀H₁₄. All candidates fit this.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):**\n    *   There are **three signals**.\n    *   **All signals are singlets.** This is a critical point. The absence of splitting (like quartets and triplets) means the alkyl protons are not coupled to adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This effectively rules out any compound containing an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃), which would exhibit splitting.\n    *   **Integration ratio is 2:1:1.** In a 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers (each being a tetramethylbenzene), there are a total of 12 alkyl protons from the first compound and 12 from the second, for a total of 24 alkyl protons. The ratio 2:1:1 has 4 total parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the absolute number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Protons per part = 24 / 4 = 6 protons.\n        *   Signal 1 (2 parts): 2 × 6H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (1 part): 1 × 6H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (1 part): 1 × 6H = **6H**\n    *   **Conclusion for Alkyl Region:** The mixture must contain compounds that, when combined, produce exactly three singlet signals integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H respectively.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):**\n    *   There are **two signals**.\n    *   **Both signals are singlets.**\n    *   **Integration ratio is 1:1.**\n    *   **Conclusion for Aromatic Region:** Since the mixture and signal ratio are both 1:1, each compound must contribute a distinct aromatic signal, and those signals must arise from an equal number of protons. For tetramethylbenzenes, this means each compound contributes a 2H singlet.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the NMR Spectra of the Individual Candidate Compounds\nNext, we analyze the structure and symmetry of each candidate to predict its individual ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule has ethyl groups. As identified in Step 1, this is incompatible with the \"all singlets\" data for the alkyl region.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is **immediately eliminated**. Any option containing it is incorrect. This rules out option **A**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** It has two equivalent protons, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** It has four equivalent methyl groups, producing **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** It has two equivalent protons, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** It has two distinct sets of equivalent methyl groups (C1/C4 and C2/C3), producing **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule also has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** It has two equivalent protons, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** It has three distinct sets of methyl groups (the C1/C3 pair, C2, and C5), producing **three singlets (one 6H, two 3H)**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Mixtures\nWe are looking for a pair of compounds whose spectra, when combined in a 1:1 ratio, match the required signal pattern: three alkyl singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out due to 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB provides: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined Result: This would produce four alkyl signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which does not match the observed three signals. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB provides: two 6H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB provides: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined Result: This mixture would be missing the required 12H signal and would contain 3H signals. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum Check:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes **one singlet of 12H**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes **two singlets of 6H each**.\n    *   **Combined Result:** The mixture produces exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum Check:** Each compound provides one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture creates two distinct signals, each integrating to 2H, perfectly matching the **two singlets, 1:1 ratio** requirement. **This is also a perfect match.**\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is the 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct mixture of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data and Identify Key Constraints**\n\nFirst, we deconstruct the information provided for the 1:1 molar mixture:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄. All four options are consistent with this.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two signals**, both are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **1:1**.\n    *   **Implication:** This means the two compounds in the mixture have different chemical environments for their aromatic protons. Since the mixture and signal ratio are both 1:1, the number of protons giving rise to each signal must be identical (e.g., each signal corresponds to 2 protons).\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are **three signals**, all are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: All Signals are Singlets.** This is a critical constraint. It means that none of the alkyl protons are subject to spin-spin splitting from adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This effectively rules out any structure containing groups like ethyl (-CH₂CH₃), which would produce a characteristic quartet and triplet.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Absolute Proton Count.** In a 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers (each with 12 methyl protons), the total number of alkyl protons is 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 integration ratio represents a total of 4 parts (2+1+1=4). We can calculate the absolute number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Protons per \"part\" = 24 protons / 4 parts = 6 protons.\n        *   Signal 1 (2 parts) corresponds to 2 * 6H = **12H**.\n        *   Signal 2 (1 part) corresponds to 1 * 6H = **6H**.\n        *   Signal 3 (1 part) corresponds to 1 * 6H = **6H**.\n    Therefore, our target mixture must produce one 12H singlet and two 6H singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nNext, we predict the individual spectrum for each candidate based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** As identified in Careful Point 1, the ethyl groups would produce a quartet and a triplet due to coupling.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This contradicts the \"all singlets\" data. This compound can be **immediately eliminated**. This rules out option **B**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C-3 and C-6) are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C-5 and C-6) are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C-1/C-4 are equivalent, and the pair at C-2/C-3 are also equivalent. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule also has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C-4 and C-6 are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C-1/C-3 (6H), the unique one at C-2 (3H), and the unique one at C-5 (3H). This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Possible Mixture Combinations**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that results in an alkyl spectrum containing three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   *Alkyl Signals:* Two 6H singlets (from 1,2,3,4-TMB) + one 6H and two 3H singlets (from 1,2,3,5-TMB).\n    *   *Result:* This mixture is missing the required 12H signal and contains unwanted 3H signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   *Result:* Ruled out because of 1,4-diethylbenzene. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   *Alkyl Signals:* One 12H singlet (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) + one 6H and two 3H singlets (from 1,2,3,5-TMB).\n    *   *Result:* This mixture would produce four total signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which does not match the observed three signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   *Alkyl Signals:*\n        *   From 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene): **one singlet (12H)**.\n        *   From 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene): **two singlets (6H each)**.\n    *   *Result:* This combination produces exactly **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match for the alkyl region data. The aromatic region also matches perfectly (one 2H singlet from Durene and one 2H singlet from Prehnitene give two signals in a 1:1 ratio). **Correct.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct mixture of compounds.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Spectral Information\n\nFirst, we must translate the provided ¹H NMR data into a clear set of requirements for the 1:1 molar mixture:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula**: Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄. All four candidate molecules match this.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm)**: The spectrum shows three signals, all are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Careful Point 1 (Singlet Multiplicity)**: The fact that all signals in the alkyl region are singlets is a critical clue. It means the protons giving rise to these signals are not split by adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This immediately allows us to rule out structures containing ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃), which would exhibit characteristic splitting patterns (a quartet and a triplet).\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Absolute Integration)**: The sample is a 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers. Assuming they are tetramethylbenzenes, each molecule has 12 alkyl protons (4 x CH₃), making a total of 24 alkyl protons in the sample. A 2:1:1 integration ratio represents 4 total parts (2+1+1=4). We can calculate the absolute number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (2 parts): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (1 part): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (1 part): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    Therefore, our target mixture must produce exactly three alkyl singlets with these specific integrations.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm)**: The spectrum shows two signals, both are **singlets**, with a **1:1** integration ratio.\n    *   **Careful Point 3 (Aromatic Signals)**: Since the mixture is 1:1 molar and the signal ratio is 1:1, the number of protons contributing to each of the two aromatic singlets must be identical. For a tetramethylbenzene, there are two aromatic protons, so this observation corresponds to two distinct 2H signals, one from each compound.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds\n\nNext, we must predict the individual ¹H NMR spectrum for each candidate based on its molecular structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**:\n    *   This compound contains two ethyl groups. As identified in Careful Point 1, this structure is incompatible with the \"all singlets\" data for the alkyl region because the ethyl groups would produce a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound can be **immediately ruled out**. Therefore, **Option D** is incorrect.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent and produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent and produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the pair at C2/C3 are also equivalent. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule also has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons at C4 and C6 are chemically equivalent and produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique methyl at C2 (3H), and the unique methyl at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Mixture Options\n\nFinally, we test which remaining 1:1 mixture satisfies the spectral data. The alkyl region is the most decisive, as we must find the pair that produces three singlets integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,3,4-TMB: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   **Result**: This mixture would contain 3H signals and lacks the required 12H signal. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,4,5-TMB: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   **Result**: This mixture would produce four alkyl signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which contradicts the observation of only three signals. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Check**: 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this creates two distinct signals with a 1:1 ratio. This matches.\n    *   **Alkyl Check**:\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) provides: **one singlet (12H)**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) provides: **two singlets (6H each)**.\n    *   **Result**: The mixture contains exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is the 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the ¹H NMR data to identify the correct pair of isomers from the given options. The reasoning process involves deconstructing the spectral data, predicting the spectra of individual candidate compounds, and then evaluating which 1:1 mixture matches the data.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectral Information\nFirst, we establish a clear set of structural requirements based on the experimental data provided for the 1:1 molar mixture.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula**: Both compounds have the formula C10H14. All four candidates meet this criterion.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm)**: There are two signals, both are singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   This implies the mixture contains two compounds with different aromatic proton environments.\n    *   Because it's a 1:1 molar mixture with a 1:1 signal ratio, the number of protons that create each of the two singlets must be identical (e.g., each signal comes from 2 protons).\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm)**: There are three signals, all are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Singlet Multiplicity**: The most critical clue is that all alkyl signals are singlets. This indicates that the protons creating these signals are not split by adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This immediately allows us to rule out structures with ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃), which would exhibit characteristic splitting patterns (a quartet and a triplet).\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Absolute Integration**: The sample is a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 isomers. For tetramethylbenzenes, each isomer has 12 alkyl protons (4 x CH₃), so the total number of alkyl protons is 24. A 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). Therefore, the number of protons per \"part\" is 24 protons / 4 parts = 6 protons. The three signals correspond to absolute integrations of:\n        *   Signal 1 (2 parts): 2 * 6H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (1 part): 1 * 6H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (1 part): 1 * 6H = **6H**\n    Our target mixture must produce exactly three alkyl singlets integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Candidate Compounds Individually\nNext, we must predict the individual ¹H NMR spectrum for each candidate based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene**: As identified in Careful Point 1, this compound has ethyl groups that would produce a quartet and a triplet, not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound can be **immediately ruled out**. This eliminates **Option B**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**: This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent and produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent and produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent and produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons at C4 and C6 are chemically equivalent and produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the C1/C3 pair (6H), the C2 methyl (3H), and the C5 methyl (3H). This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Mixture Options\nNow we test which of the remaining options (A, C, D) creates the required combined spectrum. The alkyl region (12H, 6H, 6H singlets) is the deciding factor.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   The combined spectrum does not contain a 12H signal and introduces 3H signals. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   The combined spectrum would have four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which contradicts the experimental data of three signals. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Alkyl Check**:\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   The combined spectrum has exactly three alkyl singlets integrating to **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies perfectly to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Aromatic Check**: Each compound gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this creates two distinct signals, each from 2 protons, matching the \"two singlets, 1:1 ratio\" requirement. This also matches perfectly.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe only pair of compounds whose 1:1 mixture perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the ¹H NMR Data**\nFirst, we establish a clear set of requirements based on the experimental data for the 1:1 molar mixture:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula**: C₁₀H₁₄. All four listed compounds meet this criterion.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm)**: There are two signals, both are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **1:1**. This implies the mixture contains two different compounds, and since they are mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio, each compound must contribute an aromatic signal representing an identical number of protons (in this case, 2 protons each).\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm)**: There are three signals, all are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**. This is the most crucial piece of information.\n\n### **2. Careful Analysis of Key Constraints**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The \"All Singlets\" Rule.** The most decisive piece of data is that all alkyl signals are singlets. In ¹H NMR, signals are split into multiplets (doublets, triplets, quartets, etc.) by adjacent, non-equivalent protons. The presence of only singlets rules out any structure where alkyl protons are coupled to other non-equivalent protons.\n    *   The ethyl groups in **1,4-diethylbenzene** contain adjacent -CH₂- and -CH₃ protons, which would split each other into a characteristic quartet and triplet, respectively. This contradicts the data.\n    *   **Conclusion**: 1,4-diethylbenzene can be immediately eliminated. This rules out **Option D**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Alkyl Integration Ratio.** We have a 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers. Assuming they are tetramethylbenzenes, each has 12 protons in its four methyl groups. The total number of alkyl protons in the mixture is 12 + 12 = 24.\n    *   The given ratio is 2:1:1, which has 4 total parts (2+1+1).\n    *   To find the absolute number of protons for each signal, we calculate:\n        *   Signal 1 (2 parts): (2/4) × 24 protons = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (1 part): (1/4) × 24 protons = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (1 part): (1/4) × 24 protons = **6H**\n    *   Therefore, our mixture must produce exactly three alkyl singlets with integrations corresponding to 12 protons, 6 protons, and 6 protons.\n\n### **3. Predicting Spectra of the Remaining Candidates**\nWe now predict the individual spectra for the three tetramethylbenzene isomers based on their symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**: Highly symmetrical.\n    *   Aromatic: One singlet (2H).\n    *   Alkyl: All four methyl groups are equivalent, giving **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**: Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Aromatic: One singlet (2H).\n    *   Alkyl: Two sets of equivalent methyl groups (C1/C4 and C2/C3), giving **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**: Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Aromatic: One singlet (2H).\n    *   Alkyl: Three sets of methyl groups (C1/C3 pair, C2, and C5), giving **three singlets (one 6H and two 3H)**.\n\n### **4. Evaluating the Mixture Options**\nWe now test which 1:1 mixture of the remaining isomers produces the required alkyl spectrum: {one 12H singlet, one 6H singlet, one 6H singlet}.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   `1,2,3,4-TMB`: two 6H singlets.\n    *   `1,2,3,5-TMB`: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Result: This combination would have signals corresponding to 6H and 3H, but no 12H signal. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   `1,2,4,5-TMB`: one 12H singlet.\n    *   `1,2,3,5-TMB`: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Result: This mixture would produce four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), contradicting the observation of only three signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   `1,2,4,5-TMB` contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   `1,2,3,4-TMB` contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   Result: The combination produces exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies perfectly to 2:1:1. The aromatic region also fits, as each compound gives a 2H singlet, leading to two distinct signals with a 1:1 ratio in the mixture. **This is a perfect match.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is the 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the ¹H NMR data to identify the correct pair of aromatic compounds from the given options.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectral Information and Identify Key Constraints**\n\nThe provided data about the 1:1 molar mixture gives us several critical clues:\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula**: C₁₀H₁₄. All four listed compounds satisfy this.\n2.  **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm): All Signals are Singlets.** This is a powerful constraint. The absence of spin-spin splitting (like quartets and triplets) means the alkyl protons are not coupled to adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This immediately rules out any compound containing an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃), as it would produce a characteristic quartet-triplet splitting pattern.\n3.  **Alkyl Region Integration:** There are **three singlets** in a **2:1:1 ratio**.\n    *   Since this is a 1:1 mixture of two tetramethylbenzene isomers, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 (from the first compound) + 12 (from the second) = 24.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio represents a total of 4 parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the absolute number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Protons per part = 24 total protons / 4 parts = 6 protons.\n        *   Signal 1 (2 parts): 2 × 6H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (1 part): 1 × 6H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (1 part): 1 × 6H = **6H**\n    *   Therefore, our mixture must produce three alkyl singlets integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n4.  **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two singlets** in a **1:1 ratio**.\n    *   This implies that the two compounds have distinct aromatic environments. Since it is a 1:1 mixture and the signal integration is 1:1, the number of protons contributing to each of the two aromatic signals must be identical. Each of the tetramethylbenzene isomers has two aromatic protons, which would give a single 2H singlet. A mixture of two different isomers would therefore give two distinct 2H singlets, matching the 1:1 ratio.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Candidate Compounds Individually**\n\nNow, we predict the individual ¹H NMR spectrum for each compound based on its symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**: As established in Step 1, the ethyl groups would produce a **quartet and a triplet** in the alkyl region. This contradicts the \"all singlets\" data.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound can be **eliminated**. Option (A) is therefore incorrect.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**: This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the pair at C2/C3 are also equivalent. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique methyl at C2 (3H), and the unique methyl at C5 (3H). This produces **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe now test which pair of compounds, when mixed 1:1, generates the required spectrum, focusing on the definitive alkyl region data (three singlets integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**: Eliminated due to 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**:\n    *   Signals: Durene (one 12H singlet) + Isodurene (one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets).\n    *   Result: This mixture would show four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**:\n    *   Signals: Prehnitene (two 6H singlets) + Isodurene (one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets).\n    *   Result: This mixture would show signals corresponding to 6H and 3H integrations but would lack the required 12H signal.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**:\n    *   **Signals from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene**: One singlet integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Signals from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**: Two singlets, each integrating to **6H**.\n    *   **Combined Result**: The mixture's spectrum will show exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match for all spectral data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the ¹H NMR data to identify the correct pair of aromatic compounds from the given options.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectral Information\nFirst, we must establish a clear set of requirements based on the experimental data provided for the 1:1 molar mixture.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄. All four candidate molecules match this.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows **three signals**, all of which are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Careful Point 1 (Signal Multiplicity):** The most critical piece of information is that all alkyl signals are **singlets**. This means the protons giving rise to these signals are not subject to spin-spin splitting by adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This fact immediately allows us to rule out any structure with ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃), as these would produce a characteristic quartet and a triplet due to splitting.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Absolute Integration):** The two compounds are C₁₀H₁₄ isomers, specifically tetramethylbenzenes, which means each has 12 alkyl protons (4 x CH₃). In a 1:1 molar mixture, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 integration ratio corresponds to a total of 4 parts (2+1+1). Therefore, the number of protons contributing to each signal is:\n        *   Signal 1 (2 parts): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (1 part): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (1 part): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    Our target mixture must produce three alkyl singlets integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows **two signals**, both of which are **singlets**, with a **1:1** integration ratio.\n    *   **Careful Point 3 (Aromatic Signals):** The presence of two distinct signals confirms it is a mixture of at least two different compounds. Since the mixture is 1:1 molar and the signal integration is 1:1, the number of protons that create each of the two aromatic singlets must be identical.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Candidate Compounds\nNext, we must predict the individual ¹H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds based on its molecular structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** As established in Careful Point 1, this structure contains ethyl groups and would produce quartets and triplets in the alkyl region, not just singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is **eliminated**. This immediately rules out **Option A**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at positions 3 and 6) are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at positions 5 and 6) are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the pair at C2/C3 are also equivalent. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique methyl at C2 (3H), and the unique methyl at C5 (3H). This produces **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options\nNow, we must find which pair of compounds combines to produce the required spectrum: three alkyl singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out due to 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   `1,2,4,5-TMB` contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   `1,2,3,5-TMB` contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   **Combined Result:** This mixture would show four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which does not match the observed three signals. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   `1,2,3,4-TMB` contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   `1,2,3,5-TMB` contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   **Combined Result:** This mixture would not produce the required 12H signal and contains 3H signals. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals Check:**\n        *   `1,2,4,5-TMB` (Durene) provides **one singlet of 12H**.\n        *   `1,2,3,4-TMB` (Prehnitene) provides **two singlets of 6H each**.\n    *   **Combined Result:** The mixture has exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match for the alkyl region data.\n    *   **Aromatic Signals Check:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives another 2H singlet at a different chemical shift. The 1:1 mixture therefore correctly produces two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This is a perfect match for the aromatic region data.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is the 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a systematic analysis of the provided ¹H NMR data to identify which pair of compounds is present in the 1:1 mixture.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Spectral Information and Key Constraints**\n\nFirst, let's translate the ¹H NMR data into a clear set of requirements for the unknown compounds.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄ isomers. All four candidates match this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio**.\n    *   **Implication:** In a 1:1 molar mixture, this means that each compound contributes a set of aromatic protons in a different chemical environment. The 1:1 ratio signifies that the number of protons creating each signal is identical. For the given structures, this corresponds to two distinct signals, each arising from 2 protons (2H).\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are **three singlets** with a **2:1:1 integration ratio**.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: All Signals are Singlets.** This is a critical constraint. It rules out any structure that would exhibit spin-spin splitting in the alkyl region, such as an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃), which would produce a characteristic quartet and a triplet.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Absolute Integration.** The mixture contains two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers. Assuming they are tetramethylbenzenes, each has 12 alkyl protons (4 x CH₃), making the total number of alkyl protons 24. A 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). The number of protons corresponding to each signal is:\n        *   (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    Therefore, our target mixture must produce three alkyl singlets integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H, respectively.\n\n### **2. Prediction of the Individual ¹H NMR Spectra**\n\nWe must now predict the spectrum for each candidate compound to see what signals it would contribute to the mixture.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   As established in Careful Point 1, this compound's ethyl groups would produce a quartet and a triplet, not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is definitively **ruled out**. This immediately eliminates **Option C**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical (two planes of symmetry).\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** All four methyl groups are equivalent, producing **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 bond.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the C1/C4 pair and the C2/C3 pair. This results in **two singlets, each integrating to 6H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the C1/C3 pair (6H), the unique C2 methyl (3H), and the unique C5 methyl (3H). This results in **three singlets integrating to 6H, 3H, and 3H**.\n\n### **3. Evaluation of the Mixture Options**\n\nThe decisive step is to find the pair of compounds whose individual spectra combine to match the experimental data, specifically the three alkyl singlets integrating to **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Prehnitene contributes two 6H singlets. Isodurene contributes one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets. This combination lacks the required 12H signal and introduces 3H signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Already ruled out due to the presence of 1,4-diethylbenzene. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Durene contributes a 12H singlet. Isodurene contributes a 6H singlet and two 3H singlets. The mixture would show four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), contradicting the observation of three signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** Each compound provides one distinct 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this correctly produces two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Alkyl Check:**\n        *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** provides **one 12H singlet**.\n        *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** provides **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   **Combined Result:** The mixture has exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies perfectly to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match for all the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is the 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem by synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and verifying the chemical principles.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectral Information\nFirst, we establish a clear set of structural requirements based on the ¹H NMR data provided for the 1:1 molar mixture.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula**: Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄. All four candidates fit this.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm)**:\n    *   There are **three signals**.\n    *   All signals are **singlets**. This is a crucial constraint. It indicates that none of the alkyl protons are subject to spin-spin splitting from adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This immediately rules out structures with coupled protons, such as ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃), which would produce a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   The integration ratio is **2:1:1**. For a 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers that are tetramethylbenzenes, each has 12 alkyl protons (4 x CH₃), for a total of 24 alkyl protons. A 2:1:1 ratio (4 total parts) for 24 protons corresponds to absolute integrations of:\n        *   Signal 1 (2 parts): (2/4) × 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (1 part): (1/4) × 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (1 part): (1/4) × 24H = **6H**\n    Therefore, the alkyl region of the mixture must contain three singlets integrating to 12 protons, 6 protons, and 6 protons, respectively.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm)**:\n    *   There are **two signals**.\n    *   Both signals are **singlets**.\n    *   The integration ratio is **1:1**. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, this means the number of protons contributing to each of the two aromatic signals is identical.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound\nWe must analyze the structure and symmetry of each candidate to predict its individual spectrum. This is a point of universal agreement among all provided agent analyses.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**:\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule contains two ethyl groups. Due to proton-proton coupling, these groups would produce a characteristic **quartet** and a **triplet** in the alkyl region.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This directly contradicts the experimental data. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is eliminated**. This immediately rules out **Option C**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons (at positions 3 and 6) are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: One plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons (at positions 5 and 6) are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the pair at C2/C3 are also equivalent. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: One plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This produces **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Mixtures\nWe are looking for the 1:1 mixture that generates the target spectrum, especially in the alkyl region which requires three singlets with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\n*   **Mixture B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl Signals: One 12H singlet (from Durene) + one 6H and two 3H singlets (from Isodurene).\n    *   Combined Result: **Four** total signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **Mixture D: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl Signals: Two 6H singlets (from Prehnitene) + one 6H and two 3H singlets (from Isodurene).\n    *   Combined Result: This mixture lacks the required 12H signal and introduces 3H signals. This does not match.\n\n*   **Mixture A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Check**: 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives a different 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this creates **two distinct singlets**, each from 2 protons, matching the **1:1 ratio** requirement.\n    *   **Alkyl Check**:\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes: **one singlet (12H)**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes: **two singlets (6H each)**.\n    *   **Combined Result**: The mixture produces exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match for all experimental data.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, precisely accounts for all the features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This combination corresponds to Option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis problem requires a detailed analysis of the provided ¹H NMR spectral data to identify the two compounds in a 1:1 mixture.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectral Information**\n\nFirst, let's establish a clear set of structural requirements based on the experimental data provided for the 1:1 molar mixture.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄. All four candidate compounds meet this requirement.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, with a key characteristic that they are all **singlets**, and they have an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Careful Point 1 (Signal Multiplicity):** The fact that all signals are singlets is a critical clue. Protons that are part of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) would show spin-spin coupling, resulting in a triplet and a quartet. Since only singlets are observed, we can rule out any compound containing an ethyl group.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Integration Calculation):** Each candidate compound has a C₁₀H₁₄ formula. For the tetramethylbenzene isomers, there are 4 methyl groups, meaning 4 x 3 = 12 alkyl protons per molecule. In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 integration ratio represents 4 total parts (2+1+1=4). The absolute number of protons for each signal is therefore:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) × 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) × 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) × 24H = **6H**\n    The correct mixture must therefore produce three alkyl singlets with integrations corresponding to 12 protons, 6 protons, and 6 protons.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two singlets** with a **1:1** integration ratio.\n    *   **Careful Point 3 (Aromatic Signals):** For a 1:1 mixture to give two signals in a 1:1 ratio, it means that each compound contributes a set of aromatic protons in a unique chemical environment, and the number of protons in each set is identical. For tetramethylbenzene isomers, each has 2 aromatic protons, so this observation is consistent with a mixture of any two of them, as each will give a 2H singlet at a slightly different chemical shift.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Candidate Compounds**\n\nBased on the careful points above, let's evaluate each candidate.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** As established in Careful Point 1, this compound contains ethyl groups and would produce triplets and quartets in the alkyl region. This contradicts the \"all singlets\" data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be immediately **eliminated**. This rules out option **A**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** Due to symmetry, all four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. It will produce **one alkyl singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two ring protons are also equivalent, producing one 2H singlet.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** The methyl groups at C1/C4 are equivalent to each other, and the methyl groups at C2/C3 are equivalent to each other. These two sets are not equivalent to each other. This results in **two alkyl singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two ring protons are equivalent, producing one 2H singlet.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule also has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are three distinct types of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the single one at C2 (3H), and the single one at C5 (3H). It will produce **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **6H, 3H, and 3H**.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two ring protons are equivalent, producing one 2H singlet.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow, we must find the 1:1 mixture that combines to give three alkyl singlets integrating to **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out.\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Prehnitene contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined, this mixture does not produce a 12H signal and contains 3H signals, which is inconsistent with the required {12H, 6H, 6H} pattern. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Durene contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined, this mixture would have four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which does not match the observed three signals. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   `1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene` contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   `1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene` contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   **Combined Result:** The mixture produces exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the alkyl region data. The aromatic region also matches perfectly, as each compound gives a distinct 2H singlet.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds whose 1:1 mixture perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the provided ¹H NMR data to identify the correct pair of compounds from the given options. We will systematically analyze the spectral data and predict the spectra for each candidate compound to find the correct match.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Spectral Data**\n\nFirst, let's establish the key constraints imposed by the experimental data on the 1:1 molar mixture:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄. All four candidate molecules satisfy this.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are **three signals**, all are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: All Signals are Singlets.** This is a critical piece of information. The absence of splitting (like quartets and triplets) means the alkyl protons are not coupled to any adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This immediately allows us to assess the structures. Structures containing ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) would exhibit splitting and can therefore be eliminated.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Absolute Integration.** The mixture is a 1:1 ratio of C₁₀H₁₄ isomers. The candidate isomers are all tetramethylbenzenes, meaning each has 12 alkyl protons (4 x CH₃). The total number of alkyl protons in the sample is therefore 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 integration ratio represents 4 total \"parts\" (2+1+1). The number of protons corresponding to each signal is:\n        *   Signal 1 (2 parts): (2/4) × 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (1 part): (1/4) × 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (1 part): (1/4) × 24H = **6H**\n        Therefore, we are looking for a mixture that produces exactly three singlets integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two signals**, both are **singlets**, with a **1:1** integration ratio.\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Aromatic Signals.** Since the molar ratio of the compounds is 1:1 and the signal integration is 1:1, the number of protons contributing to each of the two aromatic singlets must be identical. All tetramethylbenzene isomers have two aromatic protons, so this observation is consistent with a mixture of any two of them, as long as their aromatic protons have different chemical shifts.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Individual Candidate Compounds**\n\nNext, we predict the individual ¹H NMR spectrum for each candidate based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has two ethyl groups. As identified in Careful Point 1, the adjacent -CH₂- and -CH₃- protons will split each other, producing a quartet and a triplet, not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is definitively eliminated. This rules out **Option B**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule also has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique methyl at C2 (3H), and the unique methyl at C5 (3H). This produces **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Mixtures**\n\nWe must now test the remaining options to find the pair that produces the required alkyl spectrum: three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Signals contributed: (one 12H singlet) + (one 6H and two 3H singlets).\n    *   Result: This mixture would show four alkyl signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which does not match the observed three signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Signals contributed: (two 6H singlets) + (one 6H and two 3H singlets).\n    *   Result: This mixture lacks the required 12H signal and contains 3H signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** Each compound provides one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture creates two distinct signals, each integrating to 2H, which correctly matches the \"two singlets, 1:1 ratio\" requirement.\n    *   **Alkyl Check:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides: **one 12H singlet**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   **Result:** The combination yields exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is the 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer by synthesizing and verifying the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the ¹H NMR Spectral Data**\n\nFirst, let's establish a clear set of requirements based on the experimental data for the 1:1 molar mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula**: Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄ isomers. All four candidates fit this.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm)**: There are **two signals**, both are **singlets**, with a **1:1 integration ratio**.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm)**: There are **three signals**, all are **singlets**, with a **2:1:1 integration ratio**.\n\n### **2. Identification of Careful Points & Key Constraints**\n\nSeveral points are crucial for the analysis.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Alkyl signals are all singlets.** This is a critical piece of information. The absence of splitting patterns like quartets and triplets means the alkyl protons are not coupled to any adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This strongly suggests the alkyl groups are isolated methyls attached to the benzene ring and allows for the immediate elimination of any candidate with an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃), which would exhibit splitting.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Interpretation of the alkyl integration ratio.** This is the decisive factor. In a 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers (each being a tetramethylbenzene with 12 alkyl protons), the total number of alkyl protons is 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio represents a total of 4 parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the absolute number of protons for each signal:\n    *   Protons per \"part\" = 24 total protons / 4 parts = 6 protons.\n    *   The three signals must therefore correspond to integrations of **12H** (2 parts), **6H** (1 part), and **6H** (1 part).\n    The goal is to find the pair of compounds whose individual spectra combine to produce exactly three singlets with these integrations.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Interpretation of the aromatic signals.** A 1:1 molar mixture producing two singlets in a 1:1 integration ratio implies that each compound gives one distinct aromatic signal, and those signals arise from an equal number of protons. For tetramethylbenzene isomers, each has 2 aromatic protons, so a mixture of any two will give two 2H signals, satisfying this condition. This means the alkyl region data is required to make the final choice.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Individual Candidate Compounds**\n\nNext, we must predict the individual ¹H NMR spectrum for each candidate based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**: Based on Careful Point 1, this compound is incompatible with the \"all singlets\" data due to its ethyl groups.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound can be **immediately ruled out**. This eliminates **Option D**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**: This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are two distinct sets of equivalent methyl groups (the C1/C4 pair and the C2/C3 pair), producing **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups (the C1/C3 pair, the unique C2, and the unique C5), producing **three singlets (one 6H and two 3H)**.\n\n### **4. Evaluation of the Mixture Options**\n\nWe now test which 1:1 mixture of the remaining compounds (A, B, or C) can produce the target alkyl spectrum: three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Prehnitene contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined result: This mixture introduces 3H signals and does not create the required {12H, 6H, 6H} pattern. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Durene contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined result: This would produce four alkyl signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   **Combined result:** This mixture produces exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies perfectly to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is the 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
