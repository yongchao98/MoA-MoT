All candidate answers have correctly identified the same logical pathway to solve the problem. The final numerical result is consistent across all solutions; any discrepancies in the final letter choices are due to variations in the multiple-choice lists provided to the agents.\n\nHere is a consolidated, step-by-step breakdown highlighting the key logical points.\n\n### **Analysis of Experimental Data and Quantifying Products**\n\nThe first step is to interpret the data from the sequential gas analysis to determine the amount of each product.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The role of each chemical trap.**\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂)**: This is a powerful drying agent (desiccant). The mass increase of 3.60 g is due solely to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution)**: This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. The fact that its mass did not change is crucial **negative evidence**: no acidic gases were produced, ruling out elements like carbon in the original salts.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper)**: The tube's mass increased by 0.80 g from forming copper oxide (CuO). This mass gain is from the **oxygen atoms** of an oxidizing gas that reacted with the copper.\n        *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   **Gas C (Remaining gas)**: After all reactions, 2.24 L of an inert gas remained, measured at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### **Determining the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture**\n\nBy applying the Law of Conservation of Mass, we can determine the elemental makeup of the initial 7.20 g salt mixture.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Reconstructing the initial composition from all products.**\n    *   **Total Hydrogen (H)**: All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n        *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Total Oxygen (O)**: Oxygen atoms are found in both the water and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O in CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n    *   **Identity and Total Nitrogen (N)**: The remaining mass of the original sample must belong to the element that forms the inert Gas C.\n        *   Mass of H ≈ 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g\n        *   Mass of O ≈ 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g\n        *   Mass of third element = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n        *   The molar mass of Gas C is this mass divided by its moles: 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**. An inert gas with this molar mass, formed from decomposing salts containing H and O, is definitively **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n        *   Total moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n### **Identifying Salts A and B**\n\nThe key to finding the individual formulas is the \"equimolar\" condition.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Applying the equimolar condition.**\n    *   The initial mixture was equimolar. Therefore, the total molar ratio of elements (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) represents the atomic ratio in *one formula unit of A combined with one formula unit of B*.\n    *   To find the simplest whole-number ratio, we multiply by 20: N:H:O = **4:8:5**.\n    *   The combined chemical formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Logical deduction of salt formulas.**\n    *   We must partition N₄H₈O₅ into two plausible salt structures. Since the salts contain N, H, and O, the cation is almost certainly the **ammonium ion (NH₄⁺)**. The 8 hydrogen atoms are a perfect match for two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈), implying each salt has one NH₄⁺ cation.\n    *   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total formula gives the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n    *   The only logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common, stable nitrogen-oxygen anions is into the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)** and the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)**.\n    *   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n### **Final Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one of salt B.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂)**: 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃)**: 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis final number, 17, is the unanimous result of all correct analyses. Comparing this to the provided options:\n\nA) 13\nB) 17\nC) 19\nD) 15\n\nThe calculated value of 17 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers and the problem statement, it is evident that all candidates follow the same correct chemical reasoning to arrive at the same numerical result. The discrepancies in their final letter choice are due to differently ordered option lists. The following is a definitive, step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**1. Analysis of Experimental Data to Quantify Products**\n\nThe first step is to carefully interpret the results from each chemical trap to determine the nature and amount of the gaseous products from the decomposition.\n\n*   **Point 1: Water (H₂O) Calculation.** Tube №1 contains anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂, a powerful drying agent. Its mass increase of 3.60 g is entirely due to the absorption of water.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Point 2: Absence of Acidic Gases.** Tube №2 contains a Ca(OH)₂ solution (limewater). The fact that its weight did not change is a crucial piece of negative evidence. It proves that **no acidic gases**, such as CO₂, were produced, ruling out salts containing elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Point 3: Oxygen Atom (O) Calculation.** Tube №3 contains red-hot copper, which reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass gain corresponds directly to the mass of oxygen atoms supplied by the gas mixture.\n    *   Atomic Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Point 4: Inert Gas (Gas C) Calculation.** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   The molar volume of any ideal gas at STP is 22.4 L/mol.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Salt Mixture**\n\nBy applying the Law of Conservation of Mass, all atoms found in the products must have originated from the initial 7.20 g salt mixture.\n\n*   **Total Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen atoms from the salts formed water.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × (Moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Oxygen (O):** Oxygen atoms were distributed between the water and the gas that reacted with the copper. This is a crucial point; oxygen comes from two sources.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (Moles O in H₂O) + (Moles O from Cu reaction) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Identity and Amount of Nitrogen (N):** The only remaining element must be what constitutes Gas C. A mass balance check will confirm its identity.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of the remaining element = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   This mass corresponds to the 0.10 mol of Gas C. Its molar mass is therefore 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol. A common, inert gas from salt decomposition with this molar mass is **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the initial sample was an **equimolar mixture**. This is the key to solving the final structure. It means the calculated molar ratio of the elements (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) represents the atomic ratio in one formula unit of A combined with one formula unit of B.\n\n*   To find the simplest integer ratio for the combined formula (A+B), we can multiply the mole values by 20:\n    *   N: 0.20 × 20 = 4\n    *   H: 0.40 × 20 = 8\n    *   O: 0.25 × 20 = 5\n*   The combined empirical formula is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   We must now partition this formula into two chemically plausible salts. Given the elements N, H, and O, the most common cation is the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by **two ammonium ions** (one for each salt), which have a combined formula of N₂H₈.\n*   Subtracting the cations from the total formula gives the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The only logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions is into the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (the sum of the atoms in their individual formulas).\n\n*   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂ or N₂H₄O₂):\n    *   2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**\n*   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃ or N₂H₄O₃):\n    *   2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**\n*   **Total Number of Atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis final numerical result is consistently and correctly derived in all the provided candidate solutions.\n\n**Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe calculated total number of atoms is 17. Matching this result with the options provided in the question:\nA) 19\nB) 17\nC) 13\nD) 15\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n### Analysis of the Problem and Synthesis of Candidate Answers\n\nAll 15 provided candidate answers, despite arriving at different final letter choices, demonstrate a unanimous and correct application of chemical principles. The variation in the final letters (A, B, C, D) is clearly due to the agents being presented with different ordering of the multiple-choice options. The core chemical reasoning and the resulting numerical answer are identical and robust across all analyses.\n\nThe solution can be definitively established through the following logical steps:\n\n**Step 1: Quantify the Products of Decomposition**\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of a salt mixture, with the resulting gases being analyzed sequentially. The mass changes in the analytical tubes allow for the quantification of the products.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a desiccant that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. The fact that its weight did not change is crucial evidence proving that **no acidic gases were produced**. This effectively rules out salts containing carbon, such as carbonates or oxalates.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass of the tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase is entirely due to the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of an Oxygen atom (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining gas):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salt Mixture**\n\nBy applying the Law of Conservation of Mass, all atoms in the products must have originated from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts. We can now calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen atoms are found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen atoms are found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O that reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Identity and Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The only logical element that forms salts with H and O and produces an inert diatomic gas (Gas C) upon decomposition is nitrogen. We can verify this with a mass balance check.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Remaining mass (must be Nitrogen) = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   The molar mass of Gas C is its mass (2.80 g) divided by its moles (0.10 mol), which is 28.0 g/mol. This confirms that Gas C is indeed **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**, which is consistent with 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Formulas of Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states that the initial mixture was **equimolar**. This crucial fact means that the total molar ratio of elements we found (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) represents the atomic ratio in one formula unit of Salt A combined with one formula unit of Salt B.\n\n*   To convert this molar ratio into a simple whole-number atomic ratio, we can multiply all values by 20:\n    *   N : H : O = (0.20 × 20) : (0.40 × 20) : (0.25 × 20) = **4 : 8 : 5**.\n*   The combined chemical formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   We must now partition this formula into two plausible salt structures. Given the elements N, H, and O, the cation is almost certainly the **ammonium ion (NH₄⁺)**.\n*   The 8 hydrogen atoms in the combined formula are perfectly accounted for by **two ammonium ions** (one for each salt), which have a combined formula of **N₂H₈**.\n*   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total formula gives the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ − N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The only chemically logical partition of N₂O₅ into two common, stable nitrogen-oxygen anions is into the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to answer the question asked: \"Indicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\" This means summing the atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe unanimous result from the correct chemical reasoning is that the total number of atoms is 17. Based on the options provided in the question:\n\nA) 17\nB) 19\nC) 15\nD) 13\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers, there is a clear and unanimous consensus on the chemical reasoning required to solve the problem. The discrepancies in the final letter choices among the candidates stem from variations in the provided multiple-choice options, not from any error in the scientific method. The core numerical result is consistently and correctly calculated by all.\n\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step breakdown of the solution.\n\n### **Analysis and Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Quantify the Products from Experimental Data:** The first step is to accurately interpret the results from each chemical trap to determine the moles of the products.\n    *   **Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂)**: This desiccant absorbs water. The 3.60 g mass increase corresponds to 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol of H₂O**.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂)**: This limewater tests for acidic gases. The fact that its weight did not change is a crucial piece of negative evidence: **no acidic gases** like CO₂ were produced. This rules out salts containing elements like carbon.\n    *   **Tube №3 (Red-hot Copper)**: This tube reacts with oxidizing gases. The 0.80 g mass increase is due *only* to the oxygen atoms that formed copper oxide (CuO). This corresponds to 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol of oxygen atoms (O)**.\n    *   **Remaining Gas C**: 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at STP, which is 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol of Gas C**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture:** By the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have originated from the initial 7.20 g salt mixture.\n    *   **Total Hydrogen (H)**: All hydrogen is found in the water produced. Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Total Oxygen (O)**: Oxygen is present in both the water and the gas that reacted with copper. Total moles of O = 0.20 mol (from H₂O) + 0.05 mol (from Tube 3) = **0.25 mol**.\n    *   **Total Nitrogen (N)**: The mass of the third element can be found by subtracting the masses of hydrogen (0.40 g) and oxygen (4.00 g) from the total mass (7.20 g).\n        *   Mass of third element = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = **2.80 g**.\n        *   This 2.80 g mass corresponds to the 0.10 mol of inert Gas C. The molar mass of Gas C is therefore 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol. This uniquely identifies Gas C as **Nitrogen (N₂) **.\n        *   Total moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Formulas of Salts A and B:** The key information is that the mixture was **equimolar**. This means the combined formula of one unit of A and one unit of B must have the atomic ratio we found: N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25.\n    *   Multiplying by 20 gives the simplest whole-number ratio: **N₄H₈O₅**.\n    *   We must partition this formula into two chemically plausible salts. Given the elements, the cation is the **ammonium ion (NH₄⁺)**. The 8 H atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (one for each salt), which have a combined formula of **N₂H₈**.\n    *   Subtracting the cations from the total formula (N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈) leaves **N₂O₅** for the two anions.\n    *   The only logical way to split N₂O₅ into two common, stable nitrogen-oxygen anions is into the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n    *   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:** The question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one of salt B.\n    *   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂)**: Written as N₂H₄O₂, it has 2(N) + 4(H) + 2(O) = **8 atoms**.\n    *   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃)**: Written as N₂H₄O₃, it has 2(N) + 4(H) + 3(O) = **9 atoms**.\n    *   **Total number of atoms** = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThe unanimous numerical result derived from the correct chemical analysis is 17. Matching this to the provided options:\nA) 15\nB) 13\nC) 19\nD) 17\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a remarkable consensus on the scientific reasoning and the final numerical result. The discrepancies in the letter choices (A, B, C, or D) are due to variations in the multiple-choice lists provided to each agent, not errors in the chemical analysis. The following is a definitive, step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**1. Analysis of Experimental Data and Quantification of Products**\n\nThe first step is to interpret the data from each tube in the experimental setup to identify and quantify the products of the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This chemical is a desiccant, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of the water produced.\n    *   The molar mass of H₂O is ~18.0 g/mol (H=1, O=16).\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which detects acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, it provides crucial negative evidence: **no acidic gases were produced**. This effectively rules out salts containing elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper acts as a reducing agent, and it reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds to the mass of the oxygen atoms (O) that reacted.\n    *   The atomic mass of oxygen is ~16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** The 2.24 L of gas that remained is inert to all previous reagents. The volume is measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   The molar volume of an ideal gas at STP is 22.4 L/mol.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Salt Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts. We can now calculate the total moles of each element in the original sample.\n\n*   **Total Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the water produced.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the water and in the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O from Cu reaction) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Total Nitrogen (N):** The only remaining common element that forms salts with H and O and produces an inert gas is nitrogen. We can verify the identity of Gas C by a mass balance.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of remaining element = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   The molar mass of Gas C is this mass (2.80 g) divided by its moles (0.10 mol), which equals 28.0 g/mol. This molar mass confirms Gas C is **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states that the initial sample was an **equimolar mixture**. This means that the molar ratio of the elements we found (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) corresponds to the atomic ratio in one formula unit of A combined with one formula unit of B.\n\n*   To find the simplest whole-number ratio, we can multiply all values by 20, which yields an atomic ratio of **N₄ : H₈ : O₅**.\n*   The combined chemical formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   We must now partition this into two plausible salt structures. Given the elements N, H, and O, the cation is almost certainly the **ammonium ion (NH₄⁺)**. The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (one for each salt), which have a combined formula of N₂H₈.\n*   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total formula gives the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The only logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common, stable nitrogen-oxygen anions is into the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt).\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):** Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):** Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThe unanimously calculated answer is 17. Matching this with the provided options:\nA) 17\nB) 15\nC) 13\nD) 19\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nAn analysis of the 15 candidate answers shows a remarkable consensus in the chemical reasoning. All of them follow the same correct, multi-step deduction to arrive at the identical numerical result. The only discrepancies are in the final letter choice, which is attributable to the multiple-choice options being presented in a different order for each instance.\n\nThe following is a consolidated, step-by-step solution that highlights the key logical points.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**1. Quantify the Products from the Experimental Data**\n\nThe first step is to carefully interpret what each measurement tells us about the gaseous products formed when the salts were heated.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a desiccant, which means it absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of the water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which turns cloudy in the presence of acidic gases like CO₂. The fact that its mass did not change is crucial negative evidence that **no acidic gases were produced**. This rules out salts containing elements like carbon or sulfur.\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g because an oxidizing gas in the mixture reacted with the copper to form copper oxide (CuO). The mass gain is entirely from the oxygen atoms (O) that bonded to the copper.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all the reactions, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas was left, measured at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture**\n\nBy the Law of Conservation of Mass, all atoms in the products came from the initial 7.20 g salt mixture.\n\n*   **Total Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Total moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in two places: the water and the gas that reacted with the copper. It's essential to add both sources.\n    *   Total moles of O atoms = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Total Nitrogen (N):** The elements so far are H and O. The initial salts must contain the element that forms the inert Gas C. A mass balance confirms its identity.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Remaining mass in the sample = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = **2.80 g**.\n    *   This mass of 2.80 g belongs to the 0.10 mol of Gas C. Its molar mass is therefore 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol. An inert gas from salt decomposition with this molar mass is unequivocally **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the initial sample was an **equimolar mixture**. This is the key to solving the final part. It means the molar ratio of elements we found (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) represents the atomic ratio in one formula unit of A *combined* with one formula unit of B.\n\n*   To get a simple whole-number ratio, we can multiply all mole values by 20, which gives an atomic ratio of **N₄ : H₈ : O₅**.\n*   The combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   We must now partition this into two chemically plausible salt formulas. Since the salts contain N, H, and O, the cation is almost certainly the **ammonium ion (NH₄⁺)**. The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by **two** ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈), implying each salt has one NH₄⁺ cation.\n*   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total formula gives the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The two anions must have a combined formula of N₂O₅. The only chemically logical partition into two common, stable nitrogen-oxygen anions is the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one of salt B.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Re-written as N₂H₄O₂, it has 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Re-written as N₂H₄O₃, it has 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Total Number of Atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis numerical result of 17 is correct and was derived consistently by all candidate agents.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe calculated total number of atoms in salts A and B is 17. This corresponds to option D in the provided list.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n### Analysis of the Problem and Solution\n\nAll provided candidate answers, despite differing final letter choices, follow an identical and chemically sound logical path. The discrepancy arises from inconsistencies in the provided option lists, not from errors in the scientific reasoning. The core calculation is robust and confirmed by every analysis. Here is a definitive, step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n#### **Step 1: Quantify the Decomposition Products**\n\nThe first step is to analyze the data from each part of the experimental setup to determine the chemical nature and quantity of the products.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂)**: This tube is a desiccant, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution)**: This is limewater, which is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. The fact that its weight did not change is crucial evidence that **no acidic gases were produced**. This rules out salts containing elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper)**: The tube's mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted with the copper. The oxygen must have come from an oxidizing gas.\n    *   Atomic Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining gas)**: After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of an inert gas remained, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 2.24 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n#### **Step 2: Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Salt Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have originated from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts. We can now determine the total amount of each element in the original sample.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H)**: All hydrogen atoms are found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O)**: Oxygen atoms are found in both the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O that reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N)**: Given that no acidic gases were formed, the only logical identity for the inert Gas C is Nitrogen (N₂). We can verify this with a mass balance calculation:\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of the remaining element (Nitrogen) = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   We can check the molar mass of Gas C: Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**, which confirms it is N₂.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = Mass / Atomic Mass = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n#### **Step 3: Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states that the initial sample was an **equimolar mixture** of salts A and B. Therefore, the combined chemical formula of one unit of A plus one unit of B must have an atomic ratio identical to the molar ratio we calculated: N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n\n*   To find the simplest whole-number ratio, we can multiply all values by 20, which gives an atomic ratio of **N₄ : H₈ : O₅**.\n*   The combined formula of (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   Since A and B are salts made of N, H, and O, the cation is almost certainly the **ammonium ion (NH₄⁺)**. The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (one for each salt), which have a combined formula of **N₂H₈**.\n*   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total formula gives the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The only logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common, stable nitrogen-oxygen anions is into the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\n#### **Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question asks for the \"total number of all atoms in salts A and B\", meaning the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 2 (Oxygen) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 3 (Oxygen) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n#### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe unanimous result from the correct chemical analysis is 17. Matching this result to the provided options:\nA) 13\nB) 19\nC) 17\nD) 15\n\nThe calculated value of 17 corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nAn analysis of the problem reveals a multi-step chemical puzzle that can be solved with careful deduction. All provided candidate answers, despite differences in the final letter choice due to variations in their respective option lists, follow a unanimous and chemically sound line of reasoning. This consensus strongly supports the validity of the underlying calculations.\n\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step solution based on a synthesis of these methods.\n\n### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Experimental Data to Quantify the Products**\n    The core of the problem lies in interpreting the results of the sequential gas analysis to determine the identities and amounts of the decomposition products.\n\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂)**: This substance is a strong desiccant, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of the water produced.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution)**: This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂. The fact that its weight did not change is a crucial piece of **negative evidence**: no acidic gases were produced. This rules out salts containing elements like carbon or sulfur.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper)**: Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass gain is due solely to the oxygen atoms (O) that reacted with the copper.\n        *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) = Mass / Atomic Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   **Remaining Gas (Gas C)**: The 2.24 L of gas that remained after all reactions is chemically inert to the previous reagents. The volume is at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salt Mixture**\n    Using the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts. The elements present can only be Hydrogen, Oxygen, and the element(s) in the inert Gas C.\n\n    *   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H)**: All hydrogen is found in the water produced.\n        *   Moles H = 2 × (Moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O)**: Oxygen is found in both the water and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n        *   Moles O = (Moles O in H₂O) + (Moles O from tube #3) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n    *   **Identity and Moles of Nitrogen (N)**: The remaining element must be what constitutes Gas C. We can identify it by mass balance.\n        *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n        *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n        *   Mass of the remaining element = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n        *   This 2.80 g mass corresponds to the 0.10 mol of Gas C. Therefore, the molar mass of Gas C is 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol. An inert gas from salt decomposition with this molar mass is unambiguously **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n        *   Total Moles of Nitrogen atoms (N) = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**. (This is also consistent with 0.10 mol of N₂ gas, which contains 0.20 mol of N atoms).\n\n3.  **Identify the Formulas of Salts A and B**\n    A crucial piece of information is that the initial mixture was **equimolar**. This means the combined chemical formula of one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B must have an atomic ratio identical to the molar ratio of the elements found: N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25.\n\n    *   To get the simplest whole-number ratio, we can multiply all values by 20, yielding an atomic ratio of **N₄ : H₈ : O₅**.\n    *   This combined formula, **N₄H₈O₅**, must be partitioned into two plausible salt structures.\n    *   Given the elements present (N, H, O), the cation is almost certainly the **ammonium ion (NH₄⁺)**. The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈), implying each salt has one NH₄⁺ cation.\n    *   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total formula gives the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n    *   The only logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common, stable nitrogen-oxygen anions is into the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n    *   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n    The final question asks for the \"total number of all atoms in salts A and B\", meaning the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each.\n\n    *   Atoms in Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂ or N₂H₄O₂):\n        *   2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 2 (Oxygen) = **8 atoms**.\n    *   Atoms in Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃ or N₂H₄O₃):\n        *   2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 3 (Oxygen) = **9 atoms**.\n    *   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nMatching this final calculated value to the options provided in the question:\nA) 13\nB) 19\nC) 17\nD) 15\n\nThe correct answer is 17.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires a careful, step-by-step chemical analysis to deduce the identity of two salts from their decomposition products. A review of all candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the logical procedure and the final numerical result, with any discrepancies stemming only from differently ordered multiple-choice options. The following is a definitive solution based on the unanimous reasoning.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Identify and Quantify the Decomposition Products**\n\nThe first step is to translate the experimental results into the identities and molar quantities of the products formed.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful desiccant. The mass increase of 3.60 g is due to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which detects acidic gases like CO₂. The fact that its mass did not change is crucial: it proves **no acidic gases were produced**. This rules out salts containing elements like carbon or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass increased by 0.80 g from the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass gain is entirely due to the **oxygen atoms** that reacted.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) = Mass / Atomic Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining gas):** The remaining 2.24 L of gas at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP) is chemically inert to the previous reagents.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salt Mixture**\n\nBy the Law of Conservation of Mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts. We can now find the total moles of each element in that original sample.\n\n*   **Total Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen atoms are in the water.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × (Moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the water and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (Moles O in H₂O) + (Moles O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Total Nitrogen (N):** The only logical identity for the inert Gas C, given the elements are H, O, and a third from a salt, is Nitrogen (N₂). We can confirm this with a mass balance calculation:\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Remaining mass (must be Nitrogen) = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = **2.80 g**.\n    *   This confirms Gas C is N₂, as its molar mass is 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states that the initial mixture was **equimolar**. This is the key to determining the individual formulas. It means that the molar ratio of the elements we found (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) represents the atomic ratio in one formula unit of A combined with one formula unit of B.\n\n*   To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply all mole values by 20, which gives an atomic ratio of **N₄ : H₈ : O₅**.\n*   This combined formula, **N₄H₈O₅**, must be partitioned into two plausible salt structures.\n*   Given the elements present, the cation is almost certainly the **ammonium ion (NH₄⁺)**. The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈), which implies each salt contains one NH₄⁺ cation.\n*   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total formula gives the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The only chemically logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions is into the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B, added together.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n### **Careful Points to Note**\n\n*   **Negative Evidence:** The fact that the weight of the Ca(OH)₂ solution did not change is crucial for ruling out other elements like carbon.\n*   **The Equimolar Constraint:** Without this piece of information, it would be impossible to separate the total elemental composition into two distinct salts. It allows us to determine the combined formula of (A+B).\n*   **Plausible Ions:** The deduction requires knowledge of common chemical ions. Partitioning N₄H₈O₅ into NH₄⁺, NO₂⁻, and NO₃⁻ is the only chemically sound interpretation.\n*   **Question Interpretation:** The question asks for the \"total number of all atoms in salts A and B,\" which means summing the atoms in one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe calculation consistently yields a total of **17** atoms. Matching this result to the provided options:\nA) 19\nB) 13\nC) 17\nD) 15\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step deduction using principles of stoichiometry and chemical analysis. The candidate answers provided are unanimous in their chemical reasoning, and this synthesis confirms their shared logic is correct. The final answer is determined by following this logic precisely.\n\n### **Careful Points & Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Interpret the Role of Each Chemical Trap and Quantify the Products.** This is the first and most critical step. Each tube's result provides a specific piece of information.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂)**: This is a desiccant that absorbs water. The mass gain of 3.60 g is the mass of **water (H₂O)** produced.\n        *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution)**: This is limewater, which detects acidic gases (e.g., CO₂). A lack of weight change is a crucial piece of **negative evidence**: no acidic gases were produced, ruling out salts with carbonate, oxalate, or sulfite anions.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper)**: Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The 0.80 g mass increase is due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). Therefore, this mass is from **oxygen atoms (O)** that were captured from a gas in the mixture.\n        *   Atomic Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   **Remaining Gas C**: 2.24 L of an inert gas is left over at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture.** Using the Law of Conservation of Mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g of salts.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H)**: All hydrogen is in the water. Moles H = 2 × (Moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Oxygen (O)**: Oxygen comes from two sources: the water and the gas that reacted with copper. This is a common point of error if not handled carefully.\n        *   Moles O = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O from tube #3) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n    *   **Nitrogen (N)**: The salts must contain N, H, and O. The mass of Nitrogen can be found by subtracting the known masses of H and O from the total.\n        *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n        *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n        *   Mass of N = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n        *   This mass corresponds to the 0.10 mol of Gas C. Its molar mass is therefore 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol, which definitively identifies Gas C as **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n        *   Total moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B using the \"Equimolar\" Condition.** The problem states the initial mixture of A and B was equimolar. Therefore, the combined formula of one unit of A and one unit of B has an atomic ratio identical to the molar ratio we calculated: N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n    *   To get a simple integer ratio, multiply by 20: **N₄H₈O₅**.\n    *   This combined formula must be partitioned into two chemically plausible salts. Given the elements, the cation is the **ammonium ion (NH₄⁺)**. The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (one for each salt), which have a combined formula of N₂H₈.\n    *   Subtracting the cations' atoms from the total formula (N₄H₈O₅ − N₂H₈) leaves **N₂O₅** for the two anions.\n    *   The only logical partition of N₂O₅ into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions is into **nitrite (NO₂⁻)** and **nitrate (NO₃⁻)**.\n    *   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n4.  **Answer the Specific Question.** The question asks for the \"total number of all atoms in salts A and B\", meaning the sum of the atoms in one formula unit of each.\n    *   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂)**, which is N₂H₄O₂: 2(N) + 4(H) + 2(O) = **8 atoms**.\n    *   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃)**, which is N₂H₄O₃: 2(N) + 4(H) + 3(O) = **9 atoms**.\n    *   **Total Number of Atoms** = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Selection.** The calculated numerical answer is 17. Matching this to the options provided in the question:\n    A) 13\n    B) 17\n    C) 19\n    D) 15\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n**Analysis of the Problem and Solution**\n\nThe problem is a classic analytical chemistry puzzle requiring a step-by-step deduction from experimental results back to the identity of the initial substances. All provided candidate answers follow an identical and chemically sound logical path, indicating a high degree of confidence in the method. The numerical result is consistent across all analyses; the only discrepancies are in the lettered choices, which implies the options were presented in a different order to each agent.\n\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step solution, highlighting the careful points required for accuracy.\n\n### **Step 1: Quantify the Decomposition Products**\n\nThe first step is to interpret the results of the sequential gas analysis to determine the quantities of the products.\n\n*   **Product 1: Water (H₂O)**\n    *   Tube №1 contains anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂, a desiccant, and its mass increased by **3.60 g**. This mass is entirely due to the absorbed water.\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Product 2: Absence of Acidic Gas**\n    *   Tube №2 contains Ca(OH)₂ solution (limewater). Its weight did not change.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is critical negative evidence. It proves that **no acidic gases** like CO₂ or SO₂ were produced, which rules out salts containing carbonate, oxalate, or sulfite anions.\n\n*   **Product 3: An Oxidizing Gas (supplying Oxygen)**\n    *   Tube №3 contains red-hot copper. Its mass increased by **0.80 g** due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass gain is from the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        *   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Product 4: An Inert Gas (Gas C)**\n    *   The remaining volume of gas at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP) is **2.24 L**.\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        *   Molar volume of a gas at STP = 22.4 L/mol.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have originated from the initial 7.20 g salt mixture.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the water.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the water and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   **Careful Point:** It is essential to sum the oxygen from both sources.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O from tube #3) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Identity and Total Moles of the Final Element (Nitrogen):** We find the mass of the final element by subtracting the masses of H and O from the total.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of final element = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = **2.80 g**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** We can now identify Gas C. We have 2.80 g of it and 0.10 mol. Its molar mass is 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**. Given its inertness and the context of salt decomposition, this gas is **Nitrogen (N₂) **.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe know the original sample was an **equimolar mixture**.\n*   **Careful Point:** This means the molar ratio of elements we calculated (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) represents the ratio in one formula unit of A combined with one formula unit of B.\n*   To get a simple integer ratio, we multiply all values by 20, which gives an empirical formula for the combined (A+B) entity: **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   We must now partition N₄H₈O₅ into two plausible salt structures. Given the elements, the cation is almost certainly the **ammonium ion (NH₄⁺)**. The 8 H atoms are a perfect match for two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈).\n*   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total gives the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The only chemically logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions is into the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)** and **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one of salt B.\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂ or N₂H₄O₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃ or N₂H₄O₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Total number of atoms =** 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis calculated numerical result of 17 is correct and consistently derived. Matching this to the provided options:\n\nA) 17\nB) 19\nC) 15\nD) 13\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the problem and a synthesis of the logic presented in the candidate answers, a definitive solution can be reached. There is a strong consensus among all candidate answers regarding the chemical reasoning and step-by-step calculations, which indicates a high degree of confidence in the methodology. The minor discrepancies in the final letter choices appear to be caused by different ordering of the options in the original prompts given to each agent.\n\nThe correct solution can be derived by following a series of logical deductions. Here is a step-by-step analysis with careful points highlighted.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Quantify the Products from the Experimental Data**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Interpret the role of each tube correctly.**\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent (a desiccant). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n        *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases (like CO₂). The fact that its mass did not change is crucial negative evidence: **no acidic gases were produced**. This rules out salts containing carbon.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the formation of CuO, which means the mass gain corresponds directly to the mass of oxygen **atoms** captured by the copper.\n        *   Atomic Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** 2.24 L of an inert gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n        *   Molar volume of a gas at STP = 22.4 L/mol.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salt Mixture**\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Apply the Law of Conservation of Mass.** All atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g of salts. We can now calculate the total moles of each element in the original sample.\n    *   **Total Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen atoms are in the H₂O.\n        *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Total Oxygen (O):** Oxygen atoms are in both the H₂O and the gas that reacted with the copper. These must be summed.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n    *   **Identity of the Third Element (Nitrogen):** We can find the mass of the remaining element and use the moles of Gas C to identify it.\n        *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n        *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n        *   Remaining mass = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n        *   The molar mass of Gas C is this remaining mass divided by its moles: 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**. The only common, stable, inert gas from salt decomposition with this molar mass is Nitrogen (**N₂**).\n        *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: The \"equimolar\" condition is the key to solving the formulas.** This means that the total calculated mole ratio of the elements (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) is the same as the atomic ratio in a combined unit of (Salt A + Salt B).\n    *   To find the simplest whole-number ratio, multiply the molar amounts by 20, yielding a combined atomic formula of **N₄H₈O₅**.\n    *   Since A and B are salts made of N, H, and O, they are almost certainly ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts. The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium cations (**2 × NH₄⁺**), which have a combined formula of N₂H₈. This implies one cation per salt.\n    *   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the combined formula leaves the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n    *   The only chemically logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common, stable anions is into the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n    *   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Answer the specific question asked.** The question is for the *total number of all atoms in salts A and B* (i.e., the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each).\n    *   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₂. Total atoms = 2(N) + 4(H) + 2(O) = **8 atoms**.\n    *   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₃. Total atoms = 2(N) + 4(H) + 3(O) = **9 atoms**.\n    *   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculation robustly and consistently yields a total of 17 atoms. Matching this result to the options provided in the prompt:\n\nA) 13\nB) 19\nC) 17\nD) 15\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on the detailed analysis of the provided candidate answers and the problem statement, all solutions converge on the same chemical reasoning and numerical result, despite inconsistencies in the final letter choices due to differing option lists. The following is a definitive step-by-step solution.\n\n### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Quantify the Gaseous Decomposition Products**\n\nThe first step is to carefully interpret the results from each analytical tube to determine the composition and molar quantities of the products.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Each tube is designed for a specific purpose. Understanding their roles is key.\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent (desiccant). The mass increase of 3.60 g is exclusively from the absorption of water (H₂O).\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which detects acidic gases like CO₂.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The fact that its mass did not change is critical negative evidence. It proves that **no acidic gases** were produced, ruling out salts containing carbon (e.g., carbonates, oxalates).\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds purely to the mass of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n*   **Gas C (Remaining gas):** 2.24 L of a gas remained, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to all the previous reagents.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salt Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g sample.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Total moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):**\n    *   **Careful Point:** Oxygen is found in *two* products: the water and the gas that reacted with the copper. Both must be included.\n    *   Total moles of O = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Identity and Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The salts are composed of N, H, and O. The mass of Nitrogen can be found by subtracting the masses of H and O from the total.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of the remaining element = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** We can verify the identity of Gas C using this mass. The molar mass of Gas C is its mass (2.80 g) divided by its moles (0.10 mol), which equals 28.0 g/mol. This molar mass, along with its inert nature, confirms Gas C is **Nitrogen (N₂) **.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms in the original mixture = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The most crucial clue here is that the initial mixture was **equimolar**. This means that the total molar ratio of elements we found (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) represents the atomic ratio in one formula unit of A combined with one formula unit of B.\n*   To get a simple whole-number ratio, we can multiply all mole values by 20: N : H : O = **4 : 8 : 5**.\n*   The combined formula of (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   Since A and B are salts of N, H, and O, the cation is almost certainly the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (one for each salt): 2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈.\n*   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total formula gives us the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The only chemically logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common, stable nitrogen-oxygen anions is into the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of salt A plus one formula unit of salt B.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis numerical answer is consistently and correctly derived in every candidate solution. Matching this to the provided options:\nA) 15\nB) 13\nC) 17\nD) 19\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a comprehensive review of the candidate answers, there is a unanimous agreement on the chemical reasoning and the numerical result. The discrepancies in the final letter choices stem from differently ordered multiple-choice options provided to each agent, not from any error in the scientific analysis. The following is a definitive, step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nThe problem is a classic chemical analysis puzzle that requires working backward from experimental results to identify unknown initial substances.\n\n**1. Analysis of Experimental Data and Product Identification**\n\nThe first step is to interpret what each part of the experimental setup tells us about the products of the decomposition.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Understand the role of each chemical trap.**\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent. Its mass increase of **3.60 g** is the mass of **water (H₂O)** produced.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which detects acidic gases like CO₂. The mass did not change, which is crucial **negative evidence** proving that **no acidic gases** were formed. This eliminates elements like Carbon from the original salts.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. Its mass increase of **0.80 g** is purely from the mass of **oxygen atoms (O)** that formed copper oxide (CuO).\n    *   **Gas C:** The remaining **2.24 L** of gas (at STP) is inert to all previous traps.\n\n*   **Calculate Molar Quantities of Products**\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**\n    *   Moles of O atoms transferred to copper = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**\n    *   Moles of inert gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**\n\n**2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture**\n\nBy the Law of Conservation of Mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g of salts.\n\n*   **Calculate Moles of Each Element in the Initial Mixture**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the water. Moles H = 2 × (Moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** **Careful Point 2: Correctly sum all sources of oxygen.** Oxygen atoms are in both the water and the gas that reacted with the copper. Total Moles O = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O from tube #3) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n    *   **Nitrogen (N):** The salts are composed of N, H, and O. We find the mass of Nitrogen by subtracting the masses of H and O from the total.\n        *   Mass H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g\n        *   Mass O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g\n        *   Mass N = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**\n        *   We can use this to identify Gas C. The molar mass of Gas C is 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**. This molar mass confirms Gas C is **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n        *   The total moles of nitrogen atoms in the sample is 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**, which is consistent with 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: The \"equimolar\" condition is the key.** The problem states the initial mixture of salts A and B was equimolar. Therefore, the combined formula of *one unit of A plus one unit of B* must have an atomic ratio identical to the molar ratio we calculated: N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n    *   To find the simplest whole number ratio, we multiply by 20, yielding a combined empirical formula of **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   **Deduce the Chemical Formulas:** We need to partition N₄H₈O₅ into two plausible salt formulas.\n    *   Given the elements (N, H, O), the cation is almost certainly the ammonium ion (**NH₄⁺**). The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (one for each salt): 2 × NH₄⁺ gives the N₂H₈ part of the formula.\n    *   Subtracting the cations from the total formula (N₄H₈O₅ − N₂H₈) leaves **N₂O₅** for the two anions.\n    *   The only chemically logical partition of N₂O₅ into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions is into **nitrite (NO₂⁻)** and **nitrate (NO₃⁻)**.\n    *   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Answer the specific question asked.** The question is for the \"total number of all atoms in salts A and B\", meaning the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each.\n    *   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂ or N₂H₄O₂): 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n    *   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃ or N₂H₄O₃): 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Total Number of Atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis final numerical result of 17 is confirmed by every candidate analysis.

A careful, quantitative analysis of each step is crucial.\n\n**1. Analysis of Experimental Data and Product Identification**\n\nThe gaseous mixture produced is analyzed in a sequence of chemical traps. We can calculate the molar quantities of each product identified.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a desiccant, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which detects acidic gases like CO₂. The mass did not change, which is a crucial piece of evidence: **no acidic gases were formed**. This effectively rules out salts containing carbon (e.g., carbonates, oxalates) or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass gain is solely from oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining gas):** The remaining gas (2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure - STP) is inert to all previous reagents.\n    *   Molar volume of any ideal gas at STP is 22.4 L/mol.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Salt Mixture**\n\nBy the Law of Conservation of Mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g of salts.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of water produced.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (Moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the water and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (Moles O in H₂O) + (Moles O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Identity and Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The only remaining element in the salts must be the one that formed the inert Gas C. Based on the elements (H, O) and the fact they are salts, this is overwhelmingly likely to be nitrogen. We confirm this with a mass balance:\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of remaining element = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   This 2.80 g is the mass of the 0.10 mol of Gas C. The molar mass of Gas C is therefore 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**. This molar mass confirms Gas C is **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was **equimolar**. This is a critical clue. It means the combined chemical formula of one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B must have an atomic ratio identical to the molar ratio we calculated: N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n\n*   To find the simplest whole-number ratio, we can multiply all values by 20: N : H : O = **4 : 8 : 5**.\n*   The combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   We must now partition this into two plausible salt structures. Since the salts contain only N, H, and O, the cation is almost certainly the **ammonium ion (NH₄⁺)**. The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (one for each salt): 2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈.\n*   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total formula gives the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ − N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The only chemically logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions is into the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Final Calculation of Total Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the \"total number of all atoms in salts A and B,\" which implies the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂)**: Can be written as N₂H₄O₂. Total atoms = 2(N) + 4(H) + 2(O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃)**: Can be written as N₂H₄O₃. Total atoms = 2(N) + 4(H) + 3(O) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis final number, 17, is the unanimous result of a correct chemical analysis. Matching this result to the specific options provided in the question:\nA) 19\nB) 17\nC) 13\nD) 15\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

The discrepancies in their final letter choice are due to differently ordered option lists. The following is a definitive, step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**1. Analysis of Experimental Data to Quantify Products**\n\nThe first step is to carefully interpret the results from each chemical trap to determine the nature and amount of the gaseous products from the decomposition.\n\n*   **Point 1: Water (H₂O) Calculation.** Tube №1 contains anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂, a powerful drying agent. Its mass increase of 3.60 g is entirely due to the absorption of water.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Point 2: Absence of Acidic Gases.** Tube №2 contains a Ca(OH)₂ solution (limewater). The fact that its weight did not change is a crucial piece of negative evidence. It proves that **no acidic gases**, such as CO₂, were produced, ruling out salts containing elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Point 3: Oxygen Atom (O) Calculation.** Tube №3 contains red-hot copper, which reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass gain corresponds directly to the mass of oxygen atoms supplied by the gas mixture.\n    *   Atomic Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Point 4: Inert Gas (Gas C) Calculation.** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   The molar volume of any ideal gas at STP is 22.4 L/mol.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Salt Mixture**\n\nBy applying the Law of Conservation of Mass, all atoms found in the products must have originated from the initial 7.20 g salt mixture.\n\n*   **Total Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen atoms from the salts formed water.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × (Moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Oxygen (O):** Oxygen atoms were distributed between the water and the gas that reacted with the copper. This is a crucial point; oxygen comes from two sources.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (Moles O in H₂O) + (Moles O from Cu reaction) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Identity and Amount of Nitrogen (N):** The only remaining element must be what constitutes Gas C. A mass balance check will confirm its identity.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of the remaining element = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   This mass corresponds to the 0.10 mol of Gas C. Its molar mass is therefore 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol. A common, inert gas from salt decomposition with this molar mass is **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the initial sample was an **equimolar mixture**. This is the key to solving the final structure. It means the calculated molar ratio of the elements (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) represents the atomic ratio in one formula unit of A combined with one formula unit of B.\n\n*   To find the simplest integer ratio for the combined formula (A+B), we can multiply the mole values by 20:\n    *   N: 0.20 × 20 = 4\n    *   H: 0.40 × 20 = 8\n    *   O: 0.25 × 20 = 5\n*   The combined empirical formula is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   We must now partition this formula into two chemically plausible salts. Given the elements N, H, and O, the most common cation is the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by **two ammonium ions** (one for each salt), which have a combined formula of N₂H₈.\n*   Subtracting the cations from the total formula gives the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The only logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions is into the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (the sum of the atoms in their individual formulas).\n\n*   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂ or N₂H₄O₂):\n    *   2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**\n*   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃ or N₂H₄O₃):\n    *   2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**\n*   **Total Number of Atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis final numerical result is consistently and correctly derived in all the provided candidate solutions.\n\n**Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe calculated total number of atoms is 17. Matching this result with the options provided in the question:\nA) 19\nB) 17\nC) 13\nD) 15\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n### Analysis of the Problem and Synthesis of Candidate Answers\n\nAll 15 provided candidate answers, despite arriving at different final letter choices, demonstrate a unanimous and correct application of chemical principles. The variation in the final letters (A, B, C, D) is clearly due to the agents being presented with different ordering of the multiple-choice options. The core chemical reasoning and the resulting numerical answer are identical and robust across all analyses.\n\nThe solution can be definitively established through the following logical steps:\n\n**Step 1: Quantify the Products of Decomposition**\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of a salt mixture, with the resulting gases being analyzed sequentially. The mass changes in the analytical tubes allow for the quantification of the products.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a desiccant that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. The fact that its weight did not change is crucial evidence proving that **no acidic gases were produced**. This effectively rules out salts containing carbon, such as carbonates or oxalates.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass of the tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase is entirely due to the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of an Oxygen atom (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining gas):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salt Mixture**\n\nBy applying the Law of Conservation of Mass, all atoms in the products must have originated from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts. We can now calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen atoms are found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen atoms are found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O that reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Identity and Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The only logical element that forms salts with H and O and produces an inert diatomic gas (Gas C) upon decomposition is nitrogen. We can verify this with a mass balance check.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Remaining mass (must be Nitrogen) = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   The molar mass of Gas C is its mass (2.80 g) divided by its moles (0.10 mol), which is 28.0 g/mol. This confirms that Gas C is indeed **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**, which is consistent with 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Formulas of Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states that the initial mixture was **equimolar**. This crucial fact means that the total molar ratio of elements we found (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) represents the atomic ratio in one formula unit of Salt A combined with one formula unit of Salt B.\n\n*   To convert this molar ratio into a simple whole-number atomic ratio, we can multiply all values by 20:\n    *   N : H : O = (0.20 × 20) : (0.40 × 20) : (0.25 × 20) = **4 : 8 : 5**.\n*   The combined chemical formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   We must now partition this formula into two plausible salt structures. Given the elements N, H, and O, the cation is almost certainly the **ammonium ion (NH₄⁺)**.\n*   The 8 hydrogen atoms in the combined formula are perfectly accounted for by **two ammonium ions** (one for each salt), which have a combined formula of **N₂H₈**.\n*   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total formula gives the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ − N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The only chemically logical partition of N₂O₅ into two common, stable nitrogen-oxygen anions is into the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to answer the question asked: \"Indicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\" This means summing the atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe unanimous result from the correct chemical reasoning is that the total number of atoms is 17. Based on the options provided in the question:\n\nA) 17\nB) 19\nC) 15\nD) 13\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers, there is a clear and unanimous consensus on the chemical reasoning required to solve the problem. The discrepancies in the final letter choices among the candidates stem from variations in the provided multiple-choice options, not from any error in the scientific method. The core numerical result is consistently and correctly calculated by all.\n\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step breakdown of the solution.\n\n### **Analysis and Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Quantify the Products from Experimental Data:** The first step is to accurately interpret the results from each chemical trap to determine the moles of the products.\n    *   **Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂)**: This desiccant absorbs water. The 3.60 g mass increase corresponds to 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol of H₂O**.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂)**: This limewater tests for acidic gases. The fact that its weight did not change is a crucial piece of negative evidence: **no acidic gases** like CO₂ were produced. This rules out salts containing elements like carbon.\n    *   **Tube №3 (Red-hot Copper)**: This tube reacts with oxidizing gases. The 0.80 g mass increase is due *only* to the oxygen atoms that formed copper oxide (CuO). This corresponds to 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol of oxygen atoms (O)**.\n    *   **Remaining Gas C**: 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at STP, which is 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol of Gas C**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture:** By the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have originated from the initial 7.20 g salt mixture.\n    *   **Total Hydrogen (H)**: All hydrogen is found in the water produced. Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Total Oxygen (O)**: Oxygen is present in both the water and the gas that reacted with copper. Total moles of O = 0.20 mol (from H₂O) + 0.05 mol (from Tube 3) = **0.25 mol**.\n    *   **Total Nitrogen (N)**: The mass of the third element can be found by subtracting the masses of hydrogen (0.40 g) and oxygen (4.00 g) from the total mass (7.20 g).\n        *   Mass of third element = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = **2.80 g**.\n        *   This 2.80 g mass corresponds to the 0.10 mol of inert Gas C. The molar mass of Gas C is therefore 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol. This uniquely identifies Gas C as **Nitrogen (N₂) **.\n        *   Total moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Formulas of Salts A and B:** The key information is that the mixture was **equimolar**. This means the combined formula of one unit of A and one unit of B must have the atomic ratio we found: N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25.\n    *   Multiplying by 20 gives the simplest whole-number ratio: **N₄H₈O₅**.\n    *   We must partition this formula into two chemically plausible salts. Given the elements, the cation is the **ammonium ion (NH₄⁺)**. The 8 H atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (one for each salt), which have a combined formula of **N₂H₈**.\n    *   Subtracting the cations from the total formula (N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈) leaves **N₂O₅** for the two anions.\n    *   The only logical way to split N₂O₅ into two common, stable nitrogen-oxygen anions is into the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n    *   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:** The question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one of salt B.\n    *   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂)**: Written as N₂H₄O₂, it has 2(N) + 4(H) + 2(O) = **8 atoms**.\n    *   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃)**: Written as N₂H₄O₃, it has 2(N) + 4(H) + 3(O) = **9 atoms**.\n    *   **Total number of atoms** = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThe unanimous numerical result derived from the correct chemical analysis is 17. Matching this to the provided options:\nA) 15\nB) 13\nC) 19\nD) 17\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a remarkable consensus on the scientific reasoning and the final numerical result. The discrepancies in the letter choices (A, B, C, or D) are due to variations in the multiple-choice lists provided to each agent, not errors in the chemical analysis. The following is a definitive, step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**1. Analysis of Experimental Data and Quantification of Products**\n\nThe first step is to interpret the data from each tube in the experimental setup to identify and quantify the products of the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This chemical is a desiccant, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of the water produced.\n    *   The molar mass of H₂O is ~18.0 g/mol (H=1, O=16).\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which detects acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, it provides crucial negative evidence: **no acidic gases were produced**. This effectively rules out salts containing elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper acts as a reducing agent, and it reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds to the mass of the oxygen atoms (O) that reacted.\n    *   The atomic mass of oxygen is ~16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** The 2.24 L of gas that remained is inert to all previous reagents. The volume is measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   The molar volume of an ideal gas at STP is 22.4 L/mol.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Salt Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts. We can now calculate the total moles of each element in the original sample.\n\n*   **Total Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the water produced.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the water and in the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O from Cu reaction) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Total Nitrogen (N):** The only remaining common element that forms salts with H and O and produces an inert gas is nitrogen. We can verify the identity of Gas C by a mass balance.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of remaining element = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   The molar mass of Gas C is this mass (2.80 g) divided by its moles (0.10 mol), which equals 28.0 g/mol. This molar mass confirms Gas C is **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states that the initial sample was an **equimolar mixture**. This means that the molar ratio of the elements we found (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) corresponds to the atomic ratio in one formula unit of A combined with one formula unit of B.\n\n*   To find the simplest whole-number ratio, we can multiply all values by 20, which yields an atomic ratio of **N₄ : H₈ : O₅**.\n*   The combined chemical formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   We must now partition this into two plausible salt structures. Given the elements N, H, and O, the cation is almost certainly the **ammonium ion (NH₄⁺)**. The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (one for each salt), which have a combined formula of N₂H₈.\n*   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total formula gives the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The only logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common, stable nitrogen-oxygen anions is into the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt).\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):** Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):** Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThe unanimously calculated answer is 17. Matching this with the provided options:\nA) 17\nB) 15\nC) 13\nD) 19\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nAn analysis of the 15 candidate answers shows a remarkable consensus in the chemical reasoning. All of them follow the same correct, multi-step deduction to arrive at the identical numerical result. The only discrepancies are in the final letter choice, which is attributable to the multiple-choice options being presented in a different order for each instance.\n\nThe following is a consolidated, step-by-step solution that highlights the key logical points.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**1. Quantify the Products from the Experimental Data**\n\nThe first step is to carefully interpret what each measurement tells us about the gaseous products formed when the salts were heated.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a desiccant, which means it absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of the water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which turns cloudy in the presence of acidic gases like CO₂. The fact that its mass did not change is crucial negative evidence that **no acidic gases were produced**. This rules out salts containing elements like carbon or sulfur.\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g because an oxidizing gas in the mixture reacted with the copper to form copper oxide (CuO). The mass gain is entirely from the oxygen atoms (O) that bonded to the copper.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all the reactions, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas was left, measured at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture**\n\nBy the Law of Conservation of Mass, all atoms in the products came from the initial 7.20 g salt mixture.\n\n*   **Total Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Total moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in two places: the water and the gas that reacted with the copper. It's essential to add both sources.\n    *   Total moles of O atoms = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Total Nitrogen (N):** The elements so far are H and O. The initial salts must contain the element that forms the inert Gas C. A mass balance confirms its identity.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Remaining mass in the sample = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = **2.80 g**.\n    *   This mass of 2.80 g belongs to the 0.10 mol of Gas C. Its molar mass is therefore 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol. An inert gas from salt decomposition with this molar mass is unequivocally **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the initial sample was an **equimolar mixture**. This is the key to solving the final part. It means the molar ratio of elements we found (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) represents the atomic ratio in one formula unit of A *combined* with one formula unit of B.\n\n*   To get a simple whole-number ratio, we can multiply all mole values by 20, which gives an atomic ratio of **N₄ : H₈ : O₅**.\n*   The combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   We must now partition this into two chemically plausible salt formulas. Since the salts contain N, H, and O, the cation is almost certainly the **ammonium ion (NH₄⁺)**. The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by **two** ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈), implying each salt has one NH₄⁺ cation.\n*   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total formula gives the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The two anions must have a combined formula of N₂O₅. The only chemically logical partition into two common, stable nitrogen-oxygen anions is the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one of salt B.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Re-written as N₂H₄O₂, it has 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Re-written as N₂H₄O₃, it has 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Total Number of Atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis numerical result of 17 is correct and was derived consistently by all candidate agents.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe calculated total number of atoms in salts A and B is 17. This corresponds to option D in the provided list.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n### Analysis of the Problem and Solution\n\nAll provided candidate answers, despite differing final letter choices, follow an identical and chemically sound logical path. The discrepancy arises from inconsistencies in the provided option lists, not from errors in the scientific reasoning. The core calculation is robust and confirmed by every analysis. Here is a definitive, step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n#### **Step 1: Quantify the Decomposition Products**\n\nThe first step is to analyze the data from each part of the experimental setup to determine the chemical nature and quantity of the products.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂)**: This tube is a desiccant, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution)**: This is limewater, which is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. The fact that its weight did not change is crucial evidence that **no acidic gases were produced**. This rules out salts containing elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper)**: The tube's mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted with the copper. The oxygen must have come from an oxidizing gas.\n    *   Atomic Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining gas)**: After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of an inert gas remained, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 2.24 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n#### **Step 2: Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Salt Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have originated from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts. We can now determine the total amount of each element in the original sample.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H)**: All hydrogen atoms are found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O)**: Oxygen atoms are found in both the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O that reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N)**: Given that no acidic gases were formed, the only logical identity for the inert Gas C is Nitrogen (N₂). We can verify this with a mass balance calculation:\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of the remaining element (Nitrogen) = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   We can check the molar mass of Gas C: Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**, which confirms it is N₂.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = Mass / Atomic Mass = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n#### **Step 3: Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states that the initial sample was an **equimolar mixture** of salts A and B. Therefore, the combined chemical formula of one unit of A plus one unit of B must have an atomic ratio identical to the molar ratio we calculated: N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n\n*   To find the simplest whole-number ratio, we can multiply all values by 20, which gives an atomic ratio of **N₄ : H₈ : O₅**.\n*   The combined formula of (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   Since A and B are salts made of N, H, and O, the cation is almost certainly the **ammonium ion (NH₄⁺)**. The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (one for each salt), which have a combined formula of **N₂H₈**.\n*   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total formula gives the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The only logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common, stable nitrogen-oxygen anions is into the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\n#### **Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question asks for the \"total number of all atoms in salts A and B\", meaning the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 2 (Oxygen) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 3 (Oxygen) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n#### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe unanimous result from the correct chemical analysis is 17.

All provided candidate answers, despite differences in the final letter choice due to variations in their respective option lists, follow a unanimous and chemically sound line of reasoning. This consensus strongly supports the validity of the underlying calculations.\n\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step solution based on a synthesis of these methods.\n\n### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Experimental Data to Quantify the Products**\n    The core of the problem lies in interpreting the results of the sequential gas analysis to determine the identities and amounts of the decomposition products.\n\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂)**: This substance is a strong desiccant, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of the water produced.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution)**: This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂. The fact that its weight did not change is a crucial piece of **negative evidence**: no acidic gases were produced. This rules out salts containing elements like carbon or sulfur.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper)**: Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass gain is due solely to the oxygen atoms (O) that reacted with the copper.\n        *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) = Mass / Atomic Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   **Remaining Gas (Gas C)**: The 2.24 L of gas that remained after all reactions is chemically inert to the previous reagents. The volume is at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salt Mixture**\n    Using the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts. The elements present can only be Hydrogen, Oxygen, and the element(s) in the inert Gas C.\n\n    *   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H)**: All hydrogen is found in the water produced.\n        *   Moles H = 2 × (Moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O)**: Oxygen is found in both the water and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n        *   Moles O = (Moles O in H₂O) + (Moles O from tube #3) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n    *   **Identity and Moles of Nitrogen (N)**: The remaining element must be what constitutes Gas C. We can identify it by mass balance.\n        *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n        *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n        *   Mass of the remaining element = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n        *   This 2.80 g mass corresponds to the 0.10 mol of Gas C. Therefore, the molar mass of Gas C is 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol. An inert gas from salt decomposition with this molar mass is unambiguously **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n        *   Total Moles of Nitrogen atoms (N) = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**. (This is also consistent with 0.10 mol of N₂ gas, which contains 0.20 mol of N atoms).\n\n3.  **Identify the Formulas of Salts A and B**\n    A crucial piece of information is that the initial mixture was **equimolar**. This means the combined chemical formula of one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B must have an atomic ratio identical to the molar ratio of the elements found: N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25.\n\n    *   To get the simplest whole-number ratio, we can multiply all values by 20, yielding an atomic ratio of **N₄ : H₈ : O₅**.\n    *   This combined formula, **N₄H₈O₅**, must be partitioned into two plausible salt structures.\n    *   Given the elements present (N, H, O), the cation is almost certainly the **ammonium ion (NH₄⁺)**. The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈), implying each salt has one NH₄⁺ cation.\n    *   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total formula gives the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n    *   The only logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common, stable nitrogen-oxygen anions is into the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n    *   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n    The final question asks for the \"total number of all atoms in salts A and B\", meaning the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each.\n\n    *   Atoms in Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂ or N₂H₄O₂):\n        *   2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 2 (Oxygen) = **8 atoms**.\n    *   Atoms in Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃ or N₂H₄O₃):\n        *   2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 3 (Oxygen) = **9 atoms**.\n    *   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nMatching this final calculated value to the options provided in the question:\nA) 13\nB) 19\nC) 17\nD) 15\n\nThe correct answer is 17.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires a careful, step-by-step chemical analysis to deduce the identity of two salts from their decomposition products. A review of all candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the logical procedure and the final numerical result, with any discrepancies stemming only from differently ordered multiple-choice options. The following is a definitive solution based on the unanimous reasoning.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Identify and Quantify the Decomposition Products**\n\nThe first step is to translate the experimental results into the identities and molar quantities of the products formed.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful desiccant. The mass increase of 3.60 g is due to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which detects acidic gases like CO₂. The fact that its mass did not change is crucial: it proves **no acidic gases were produced**. This rules out salts containing elements like carbon or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass increased by 0.80 g from the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass gain is entirely due to the **oxygen atoms** that reacted.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) = Mass / Atomic Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining gas):** The remaining 2.24 L of gas at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP) is chemically inert to the previous reagents.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salt Mixture**\n\nBy the Law of Conservation of Mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts. We can now find the total moles of each element in that original sample.\n\n*   **Total Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen atoms are in the water.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × (Moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the water and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (Moles O in H₂O) + (Moles O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Total Nitrogen (N):** The only logical identity for the inert Gas C, given the elements are H, O, and a third from a salt, is Nitrogen (N₂). We can confirm this with a mass balance calculation:\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Remaining mass (must be Nitrogen) = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = **2.80 g**.\n    *   This confirms Gas C is N₂, as its molar mass is 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states that the initial mixture was **equimolar**. This is the key to determining the individual formulas. It means that the molar ratio of the elements we found (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) represents the atomic ratio in one formula unit of A combined with one formula unit of B.\n\n*   To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply all mole values by 20, which gives an atomic ratio of **N₄ : H₈ : O₅**.\n*   This combined formula, **N₄H₈O₅**, must be partitioned into two plausible salt structures.\n*   Given the elements present, the cation is almost certainly the **ammonium ion (NH₄⁺)**. The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈), which implies each salt contains one NH₄⁺ cation.\n*   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total formula gives the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The only chemically logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions is into the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B, added together.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n### **Careful Points to Note**\n\n*   **Negative Evidence:** The fact that the weight of the Ca(OH)₂ solution did not change is crucial for ruling out other elements like carbon.\n*   **The Equimolar Constraint:** Without this piece of information, it would be impossible to separate the total elemental composition into two distinct salts. It allows us to determine the combined formula of (A+B).\n*   **Plausible Ions:** The deduction requires knowledge of common chemical ions. Partitioning N₄H₈O₅ into NH₄⁺, NO₂⁻, and NO₃⁻ is the only chemically sound interpretation.\n*   **Question Interpretation:** The question asks for the \"total number of all atoms in salts A and B,\" which means summing the atoms in one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe calculation consistently yields a total of **17** atoms. Matching this result to the provided options:\nA) 19\nB) 13\nC) 17\nD) 15\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step deduction using principles of stoichiometry and chemical analysis. The candidate answers provided are unanimous in their chemical reasoning, and this synthesis confirms their shared logic is correct. The final answer is determined by following this logic precisely.\n\n### **Careful Points & Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Interpret the Role of Each Chemical Trap and Quantify the Products.** This is the first and most critical step. Each tube's result provides a specific piece of information.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂)**: This is a desiccant that absorbs water. The mass gain of 3.60 g is the mass of **water (H₂O)** produced.\n        *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution)**: This is limewater, which detects acidic gases (e.g., CO₂). A lack of weight change is a crucial piece of **negative evidence**: no acidic gases were produced, ruling out salts with carbonate, oxalate, or sulfite anions.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper)**: Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The 0.80 g mass increase is due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). Therefore, this mass is from **oxygen atoms (O)** that were captured from a gas in the mixture.\n        *   Atomic Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   **Remaining Gas C**: 2.24 L of an inert gas is left over at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture.** Using the Law of Conservation of Mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g of salts.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H)**: All hydrogen is in the water. Moles H = 2 × (Moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Oxygen (O)**: Oxygen comes from two sources: the water and the gas that reacted with copper. This is a common point of error if not handled carefully.\n        *   Moles O = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O from tube #3) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n    *   **Nitrogen (N)**: The salts must contain N, H, and O. The mass of Nitrogen can be found by subtracting the known masses of H and O from the total.\n        *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n        *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n        *   Mass of N = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n        *   This mass corresponds to the 0.10 mol of Gas C. Its molar mass is therefore 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol, which definitively identifies Gas C as **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n        *   Total moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B using the \"Equimolar\" Condition.** The problem states the initial mixture of A and B was equimolar. Therefore, the combined formula of one unit of A and one unit of B has an atomic ratio identical to the molar ratio we calculated: N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n    *   To get a simple integer ratio, multiply by 20: **N₄H₈O₅**.\n    *   This combined formula must be partitioned into two chemically plausible salts. Given the elements, the cation is the **ammonium ion (NH₄⁺)**. The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (one for each salt), which have a combined formula of N₂H₈.\n    *   Subtracting the cations' atoms from the total formula (N₄H₈O₅ − N₂H₈) leaves **N₂O₅** for the two anions.\n    *   The only logical partition of N₂O₅ into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions is into **nitrite (NO₂⁻)** and **nitrate (NO₃⁻)**.\n    *   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n4.  **Answer the Specific Question.** The question asks for the \"total number of all atoms in salts A and B\", meaning the sum of the atoms in one formula unit of each.\n    *   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂)**, which is N₂H₄O₂: 2(N) + 4(H) + 2(O) = **8 atoms**.\n    *   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃)**, which is N₂H₄O₃: 2(N) + 4(H) + 3(O) = **9 atoms**.\n    *   **Total Number of Atoms** = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Selection.** The calculated numerical answer is 17. Matching this to the options provided in the question:\n    A) 13\n    B) 17\n    C) 19\n    D) 15\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n**Analysis of the Problem and Solution**\n\nThe problem is a classic analytical chemistry puzzle requiring a step-by-step deduction from experimental results back to the identity of the initial substances. All provided candidate answers follow an identical and chemically sound logical path, indicating a high degree of confidence in the method. The numerical result is consistent across all analyses; the only discrepancies are in the lettered choices, which implies the options were presented in a different order to each agent.\n\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step solution, highlighting the careful points required for accuracy.\n\n### **Step 1: Quantify the Decomposition Products**\n\nThe first step is to interpret the results of the sequential gas analysis to determine the quantities of the products.\n\n*   **Product 1: Water (H₂O)**\n    *   Tube №1 contains anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂, a desiccant, and its mass increased by **3.60 g**. This mass is entirely due to the absorbed water.\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Product 2: Absence of Acidic Gas**\n    *   Tube №2 contains Ca(OH)₂ solution (limewater). Its weight did not change.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is critical negative evidence. It proves that **no acidic gases** like CO₂ or SO₂ were produced, which rules out salts containing carbonate, oxalate, or sulfite anions.\n\n*   **Product 3: An Oxidizing Gas (supplying Oxygen)**\n    *   Tube №3 contains red-hot copper. Its mass increased by **0.80 g** due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass gain is from the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        *   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Product 4: An Inert Gas (Gas C)**\n    *   The remaining volume of gas at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP) is **2.24 L**.\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        *   Molar volume of a gas at STP = 22.4 L/mol.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have originated from the initial 7.20 g salt mixture.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the water.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the water and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   **Careful Point:** It is essential to sum the oxygen from both sources.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O from tube #3) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Identity and Total Moles of the Final Element (Nitrogen):** We find the mass of the final element by subtracting the masses of H and O from the total.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of final element = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = **2.80 g**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** We can now identify Gas C. We have 2.80 g of it and 0.10 mol. Its molar mass is 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**. Given its inertness and the context of salt decomposition, this gas is **Nitrogen (N₂) **.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe know the original sample was an **equimolar mixture**.\n*   **Careful Point:** This means the molar ratio of elements we calculated (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) represents the ratio in one formula unit of A combined with one formula unit of B.\n*   To get a simple integer ratio, we multiply all values by 20, which gives an empirical formula for the combined (A+B) entity: **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   We must now partition N₄H₈O₅ into two plausible salt structures. Given the elements, the cation is almost certainly the **ammonium ion (NH₄⁺)**. The 8 H atoms are a perfect match for two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈).\n*   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total gives the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The only chemically logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions is into the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)** and **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one of salt B.\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂ or N₂H₄O₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃ or N₂H₄O₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Total number of atoms =** 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis calculated numerical result of 17 is correct and consistently derived. Matching this to the provided options:\n\nA) 17\nB) 19\nC) 15\nD) 13\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the problem and a synthesis of the logic presented in the candidate answers, a definitive solution can be reached. There is a strong consensus among all candidate answers regarding the chemical reasoning and step-by-step calculations, which indicates a high degree of confidence in the methodology. The minor discrepancies in the final letter choices appear to be caused by different ordering of the options in the original prompts given to each agent.\n\nThe correct solution can be derived by following a series of logical deductions. Here is a step-by-step analysis with careful points highlighted.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Quantify the Products from the Experimental Data**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Interpret the role of each tube correctly.**\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent (a desiccant). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n        *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases (like CO₂). The fact that its mass did not change is crucial negative evidence: **no acidic gases were produced**. This rules out salts containing carbon.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the formation of CuO, which means the mass gain corresponds directly to the mass of oxygen **atoms** captured by the copper.\n        *   Atomic Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** 2.24 L of an inert gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n        *   Molar volume of a gas at STP = 22.4 L/mol.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salt Mixture**\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Apply the Law of Conservation of Mass.** All atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g of salts. We can now calculate the total moles of each element in the original sample.\n    *   **Total Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen atoms are in the H₂O.\n        *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Total Oxygen (O):** Oxygen atoms are in both the H₂O and the gas that reacted with the copper. These must be summed.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n    *   **Identity of the Third Element (Nitrogen):** We can find the mass of the remaining element and use the moles of Gas C to identify it.\n        *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n        *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n        *   Remaining mass = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n        *   The molar mass of Gas C is this remaining mass divided by its moles: 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**. The only common, stable, inert gas from salt decomposition with this molar mass is Nitrogen (**N₂**).\n        *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: The \"equimolar\" condition is the key to solving the formulas.** This means that the total calculated mole ratio of the elements (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) is the same as the atomic ratio in a combined unit of (Salt A + Salt B).\n    *   To find the simplest whole-number ratio, multiply the molar amounts by 20, yielding a combined atomic formula of **N₄H₈O₅**.\n    *   Since A and B are salts made of N, H, and O, they are almost certainly ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts. The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium cations (**2 × NH₄⁺**), which have a combined formula of N₂H₈. This implies one cation per salt.\n    *   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the combined formula leaves the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n    *   The only chemically logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common, stable anions is into the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n    *   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Answer the specific question asked.** The question is for the *total number of all atoms in salts A and B* (i.e., the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each).\n    *   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₂. Total atoms = 2(N) + 4(H) + 2(O) = **8 atoms**.\n    *   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₃. Total atoms = 2(N) + 4(H) + 3(O) = **9 atoms**.\n    *   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculation robustly and consistently yields a total of 17 atoms. Matching this result to the options provided in the prompt:\n\nA) 13\nB) 19\nC) 17\nD) 15\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on the detailed analysis of the provided candidate answers and the problem statement, all solutions converge on the same chemical reasoning and numerical result, despite inconsistencies in the final letter choices due to differing option lists. The following is a definitive step-by-step solution.\n\n### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Quantify the Gaseous Decomposition Products**\n\nThe first step is to carefully interpret the results from each analytical tube to determine the composition and molar quantities of the products.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Each tube is designed for a specific purpose. Understanding their roles is key.\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent (desiccant). The mass increase of 3.60 g is exclusively from the absorption of water (H₂O).\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which detects acidic gases like CO₂.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The fact that its mass did not change is critical negative evidence. It proves that **no acidic gases** were produced, ruling out salts containing carbon (e.g., carbonates, oxalates).\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds purely to the mass of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n*   **Gas C (Remaining gas):** 2.24 L of a gas remained, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to all the previous reagents.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salt Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g sample.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Total moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):**\n    *   **Careful Point:** Oxygen is found in *two* products: the water and the gas that reacted with the copper. Both must be included.\n    *   Total moles of O = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Identity and Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The salts are composed of N, H, and O. The mass of Nitrogen can be found by subtracting the masses of H and O from the total.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of the remaining element = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** We can verify the identity of Gas C using this mass. The molar mass of Gas C is its mass (2.80 g) divided by its moles (0.10 mol), which equals 28.0 g/mol. This molar mass, along with its inert nature, confirms Gas C is **Nitrogen (N₂) **.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms in the original mixture = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The most crucial clue here is that the initial mixture was **equimolar**. This means that the total molar ratio of elements we found (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) represents the atomic ratio in one formula unit of A combined with one formula unit of B.\n*   To get a simple whole-number ratio, we can multiply all mole values by 20: N : H : O = **4 : 8 : 5**.\n*   The combined formula of (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   Since A and B are salts of N, H, and O, the cation is almost certainly the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (one for each salt): 2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈.\n*   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total formula gives us the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The only chemically logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common, stable nitrogen-oxygen anions is into the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of salt A plus one formula unit of salt B.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis numerical answer is consistently and correctly derived in every candidate solution. Matching this to the provided options:\nA) 15\nB) 13\nC) 17\nD) 19\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a comprehensive review of the candidate answers, there is a unanimous agreement on the chemical reasoning and the numerical result. The discrepancies in the final letter choices stem from differently ordered multiple-choice options provided to each agent, not from any error in the scientific analysis. The following is a definitive, step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nThe problem is a classic chemical analysis puzzle that requires working backward from experimental results to identify unknown initial substances.\n\n**1. Analysis of Experimental Data and Product Identification**\n\nThe first step is to interpret what each part of the experimental setup tells us about the products of the decomposition.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Understand the role of each chemical trap.**\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent. Its mass increase of **3.60 g** is the mass of **water (H₂O)** produced.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which detects acidic gases like CO₂. The mass did not change, which is crucial **negative evidence** proving that **no acidic gases** were formed. This eliminates elements like Carbon from the original salts.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. Its mass increase of **0.80 g** is purely from the mass of **oxygen atoms (O)** that formed copper oxide (CuO).\n    *   **Gas C:** The remaining **2.24 L** of gas (at STP) is inert to all previous traps.\n\n*   **Calculate Molar Quantities of Products**\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**\n    *   Moles of O atoms transferred to copper = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**\n    *   Moles of inert gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**\n\n**2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture**\n\nBy the Law of Conservation of Mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g of salts.\n\n*   **Calculate Moles of Each Element in the Initial Mixture**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the water. Moles H = 2 × (Moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** **Careful Point 2: Correctly sum all sources of oxygen.** Oxygen atoms are in both the water and the gas that reacted with the copper. Total Moles O = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O from tube #3) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n    *   **Nitrogen (N):** The salts are composed of N, H, and O. We find the mass of Nitrogen by subtracting the masses of H and O from the total.\n        *   Mass H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g\n        *   Mass O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g\n        *   Mass N = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**\n        *   We can use this to identify Gas C. The molar mass of Gas C is 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**. This molar mass confirms Gas C is **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n        *   The total moles of nitrogen atoms in the sample is 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**, which is consistent with 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: The \"equimolar\" condition is the key.** The problem states the initial mixture of salts A and B was equimolar. Therefore, the combined formula of *one unit of A plus one unit of B* must have an atomic ratio identical to the molar ratio we calculated: N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n    *   To find the simplest whole number ratio, we multiply by 20, yielding a combined empirical formula of **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   **Deduce the Chemical Formulas:** We need to partition N₄H₈O₅ into two plausible salt formulas.\n    *   Given the elements (N, H, O), the cation is almost certainly the ammonium ion (**NH₄⁺**). The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (one for each salt): 2 × NH₄⁺ gives the N₂H₈ part of the formula.\n    *   Subtracting the cations from the total formula (N₄H₈O₅ − N₂H₈) leaves **N₂O₅** for the two anions.\n    *   The only chemically logical partition of N₂O₅ into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions is into **nitrite (NO₂⁻)** and **nitrate (NO₃⁻)**.\n    *   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Answer the specific question asked.** The question is for the \"total number of all atoms in salts A and B\", meaning the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each.\n    *   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂ or N₂H₄O₂): 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n    *   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃ or N₂H₄O₃): 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Total Number of Atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis final numerical result of 17 is confirmed by every candidate analysis. Based on the options provided in the question prompt:\nA) 17\nB) 19\nC) 15\nD) 13\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a systematic, step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct and unanimous chemical reasoning presented in the candidate answers.\n\n### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nThe problem requires deducing the identity of two salts from the results of their thermal decomposition. A careful, quantitative analysis of each step is crucial.\n\n**1. Analysis of Experimental Data and Product Identification**\n\nThe gaseous mixture produced is analyzed in a sequence of chemical traps. We can calculate the molar quantities of each product identified.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a desiccant, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which detects acidic gases like CO₂. The mass did not change, which is a crucial piece of evidence: **no acidic gases were formed**. This effectively rules out salts containing carbon (e.g., carbonates, oxalates) or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass gain is solely from oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining gas):** The remaining gas (2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure - STP) is inert to all previous reagents.\n    *   Molar volume of any ideal gas at STP is 22.4 L/mol.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Salt Mixture**\n\nBy the Law of Conservation of Mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g of salts.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of water produced.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (Moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the water and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (Moles O in H₂O) + (Moles O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Identity and Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The only remaining element in the salts must be the one that formed the inert Gas C. Based on the elements (H, O) and the fact they are salts, this is overwhelmingly likely to be nitrogen. We confirm this with a mass balance:\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of remaining element = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   This 2.80 g is the mass of the 0.10 mol of Gas C. The molar mass of Gas C is therefore 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**. This molar mass confirms Gas C is **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was **equimolar**. This is a critical clue. It means the combined chemical formula of one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B must have an atomic ratio identical to the molar ratio we calculated: N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n\n*   To find the simplest whole-number ratio, we can multiply all values by 20: N : H : O = **4 : 8 : 5**.\n*   The combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   We must now partition this into two plausible salt structures. Since the salts contain only N, H, and O, the cation is almost certainly the **ammonium ion (NH₄⁺)**. The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (one for each salt): 2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈.\n*   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total formula gives the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ − N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The only chemically logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions is into the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Final Calculation of Total Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the \"total number of all atoms in salts A and B,\" which implies the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂)**: Can be written as N₂H₄O₂. Total atoms = 2(N) + 4(H) + 2(O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃)**: Can be written as N₂H₄O₃. Total atoms = 2(N) + 4(H) + 3(O) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis final number, 17, is the unanimous result of a correct chemical analysis. Matching this result to the specific options provided in the question:\nA) 19\nB) 17\nC) 13\nD) 15\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
