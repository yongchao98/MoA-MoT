    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent is acetophenone (a benzene ring attached to an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   The benzene ring has three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   This is a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene ring. All substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), existing substituents on a benzene ring direct new substituents to specific positions.\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl group):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo group):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro group):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Ideal Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe 1,3,5-substitution pattern strongly suggests a specific strategy. To achieve this pattern with high yield, we should perform substitutions under the influence of *meta*-directing groups. The presence of an *ortho, para*-director (-Br) complicates things, so its introduction needs careful timing.\n\nA highly logical and efficient pathway would be:\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation** of benzene to form acetophenone. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director.\n    *   Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone\n2.  **Nitration** of acetophenone. The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to the *meta* position.\n    *   Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone\n3.  **Bromination** of 3-nitroacetophenone. Now, the ring has two substituents: -COCH3 (at C1) and -NO2 (at C3). Both are strong *meta*-directors. They both direct the incoming bromo group to position C5. This reaction should be highly regioselective, giving the desired product.\n    *   3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one (Target Molecule)\n\nThis ideal sequence of key reactions is: **Acylation → Nitration → Bromination**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow, let's examine the options provided to see which one matches or most closely resembles this ideal strategy. We'll focus on the order of introduction of the acetyl, bromo, and nitro groups. We will also consider the additional steps.\n\n*   **Option A:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n    *   This sequence is Bromination → Nitration → Acylation.\n    *   Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on bromonitrobenzene. The ring is strongly deactivated by both the bromo and especially the nitro group, making this reaction extremely difficult and low-yield. This option is not viable for a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\n*   **Option B:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...\n    *   This sequence is **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n    *   i) Benzene → Acetophenone. This is a good first step.\n    *   ii) Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone. The meta-directing -COCH3 group correctly places the bromine at C3.\n    *   iii) Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. Here we have two directors: -COCH3 (meta) and -Br (ortho, para).\n        *   The -COCH3 group directs to C5.\n        *   The -Br group directs to C2, C4, and C6.\n        *   The o,p-directing effect of the halogen typically overrides the meta-director. The positions activated by the halogen (C2, C4, C6) are kinetically favored over the highly deactivated C5 position (which is meta to both groups). This step would produce a mixture of isomers, with the desired 1,3,5 product being a very minor product. Therefore, this is not a \"high-yield\" route under standard kinetic control.\n    *   However, compared to other options, this sequence starts plausibly. Friedel-Crafts on nitro-compounds (Options A, C) is generally considered to fail. While step (iii) in B has regioselectivity issues, the reaction itself is feasible. The question's reference to \"high yield\" might imply thermodynamic control where the more stable 1,3,5-isomer could be favored, or it might be that this is the \"best\" flawed option.\n    *   The subsequent steps (iv-vii) involving reduction and diazotization seem superfluous if the target is made at step (iii), suggesting they may be distractors or part of an convoluted and incorrect pathway.\n\n*   **Option C:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) ... ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ...\n    *   This sequence attempts Acylation after Nitration and other steps. After steps (i) Nitration and (ii) Bromination, the intermediate would be 3-bromonitrobenzene.\n    *   Step (iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation of 3-bromonitrobenzene fails for the same reason as in Option A: the ring is strongly deactivated.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence begins with nitration, reduction to aniline, then deamination back to benzene, which is nonsensical.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the options:\n*   Options A and C fail because they schedule a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a heavily deactivated, nitro-substituted ring.\n*   Option D is a logically flawed sequence.\n*   Option B follows a sequence of reactions where each step is chemically possible, although the nitration step (iii) suffers from poor regioselectivity for the desired product under normal conditions.\n\nDespite the low yield of the specific isomer in step (iii), Option B represents the most plausible sequence among the given choices, as the other options contain steps that are generally considered to be non-viable. The ideal pathway (Acylation → Nitration → Bromination) is a small permutation of Option B (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration). It's possible the question considers this route viable, perhaps assuming conditions that favor the thermodynamic 1,3,5 product.\n\n<<<B>>>"
