    "This problem requires us to determine the energies of the ground state and the first two excited states for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n**1. Understand the System's Properties:**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Being identical and having half-integer spin means they are **fermions**.\n*   **Governing Principle:** Fermions obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   **Quantum States:** For a particle in a 1D potential well, a quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers:\n    *   The principal quantum number, `n` (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), which determines the energy level.\n    *   The spin magnetic quantum number, `ms`, which can be +1/2 (spin-up, ↑) or -1/2 (spin-down, ↓).\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy of a single particle in a state with quantum number `n` is given by `En = n^2 * E`, where `E = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2)`.\n*   **State Occupancy:** According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n**2. Calculating the Ground State Energy (E_ground):**\n\nThe ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. To achieve this, we must fill the single-particle energy levels from the bottom up. We have four fermions to place.\n\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy = 1²E = E):** We can place two fermions here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   **Level n=2 (Energy = 2²E = 4E):** We place the remaining two fermions here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n\nNow, all four particles are in the lowest possible energy states. The total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n\n`E_ground = (2 particles * E) + (2 particles * 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E`\n\n**3. Calculating the First Excited State Energy (E_1st):**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the next lowest possible total energy. This is achieved by the lowest-energy excitation from the ground state, which involves moving one particle from the highest occupied level to the lowest unoccupied level.\n\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2.\n*   **Lowest Energy Excitation:** Move one particle from level `n=2` (energy 4E) to the next available level, `n=3` (energy 3²E = 9E).\n*   **New Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n\n`E_1st = (2 * E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`\n\n**4. Calculating the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd):**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy after the first excited state. We need to consider different possible excitations from the ground state.\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E (from promoting a particle from n=2 to n=3).\n*   **Other possibilities for excitation from the ground state:**\n    *   **Possibility A: Promote a particle from n=1 to n=3.** The configuration becomes: one particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, one particle in n=3.\n        `E_A = (1 * E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E`\n    *   **Possibility B: Promote a particle from n=2 to n=4.** The configuration becomes: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, one particle in n=4.\n        `E_B = (2 * E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`\n    *   **Possibility C: Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3.** The configuration becomes: two particles in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3.\n        `E_C = (2 * E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`\n\nComparing the energies of these states (10E < 15E < 18E < 20E < 22E), the second lowest energy *above the ground state* is 18E.\n\n`E_2nd = 18E`\n\n**Summary of Energies:**\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Second Excited State: 18E\n\nThis sequence matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
