    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of the Radial Velocity (RV) Method**\n\nThe Radial Velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift of light from their host star. The gravity of an orbiting planet causes the star to \"wobble\" back and forth relative to us.\n\n*   This wobble causes a change in the star's radial velocity (its speed towards or away from us).\n*   The change in radial velocity results in a Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines. The observed wavelength (λ) shifts periodically compared to the rest wavelength (λ₀).\n*   The relationship is given by the Doppler formula:  `Δλ / λ₀ = v_star / c`, where `Δλ` is the wavelength shift, `v_star` is the star's radial velocity, and `c` is the speed of light.\n*   The problem gives the *amplitude* of the periodic wavelength shift (e.g., \"up to 5 miliangstrom\"). This amplitude (`Δλ_max`) is directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, which is denoted by `K`.\n*   Therefore, we have `K ∝ Δλ_max`.\n\n**2. Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P)**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the amplitude of the star's radial velocity (`K`) is related to the masses of the star (`M_star`) and planet (`M_planet`), and the orbital period (`P`). The standard formula, assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (`M_planet << M_star`), is:\n\n`K = ( (2πG)^(1/3) / P^(1/3) ) * ( M_planet / M_star^(2/3) )`\n\nwhere `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n**3. Analyze the Given Information**\n\nWe are given that:\n*   The masses of the two stars are the same: `M_star1 = M_star2`.\n*   The masses of the two planets are the same: `M_planet1 = M_planet2`.\n*   Wavelength shift for planet #1 system: `Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ`.\n*   Wavelength shift for planet #2 system: `Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ`.\n\nSince `M_star`, `M_planet`, `G`, and `2π` are all constants for both systems, we can simplify the relationship between `K` and `P`. The formula `K = (constant) * 1/P^(1/3)` holds.\n\nThis shows that the radial velocity amplitude `K` is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period `P`:\n\n`K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)`\n\n**4. Set up the Ratio**\n\nWe want to find the ratio `P₂ / P₁`.\n\nFrom the proportionality `K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)`, we can write:\n`K₁ / K₂ = (1 / P₁^(1/3)) / (1 / P₂^(1/3)) = P₂^(1/3) / P₁^(1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\nNow, we need to solve for `P₂ / P₁`:\n`P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3`\n\n**5. Substitute the Observational Data**\n\nWe established that `K ∝ Δλ`. Therefore, the ratio of the K-amplitudes is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts:\n\n`K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 mÅ / 7 mÅ = 5 / 7`\n\nNow, substitute this ratio back into our equation for the period ratio:\n\n`P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)^3`\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Value**\n\nNow, we compute the value of the ratio.\n`P₂ / P₁ = (5*5*5) / (7*7*7) = 125 / 343`\n\nTo find the decimal value, we perform the division.\n```python\nprint(125 / 343)\n```\n```output\n0.3644314868804665\n```\nThe result is approximately 0.36.\n\nThis means the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. This makes physical sense: planet #2 causes a larger stellar wobble (larger `Δλ`), which implies it is in a closer, shorter-period orbit.\n\nComparing our result to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.85\nB) ~ 1.96\nC) ~ 1.40\nD) ~ 0.36\n\nOur calculated value of ~0.36 matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 (`P₂`) to that of planet #1 (`P₁`).\n\n**1. Radial Velocity (RV) Method Basics:**\n\nThe RV method detects the periodic wobble of a star caused by an orbiting planet. This wobble causes a periodic Doppler shift in the star's light.\nThe amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as `K`, is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift (`Δλ_max`) observed.\nSo, `K ∝ Δλ`.\n\n**2. The Radial Velocity Amplitude Formula:**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV amplitude (`K`) is given by the formula:\n\n`K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_p / M_s^(2/3))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `M_p` is the planet's mass.\n*   `M_s` is the star's mass.\n\n**3. Setting up the Proportionality:**\n\nIn this problem, we are told that the stars have the same mass (`M_s1 = M_s2`) and the planets have the same mass (`M_p1 = M_p2`). Therefore, `M_p`, `M_s`, and the term `(2πG)` are all constants when comparing the two systems.\n\nThis simplifies the relationship to:\n\n`K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)`\n\nThis means the RV amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n**4. Forming the Ratio:**\n\nWe can write a ratio for the two systems:\n\n`K₂ / K₁ = (1 / P₂^(1/3)) / (1 / P₁^(1/3))`\n`K₂ / K₁ = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)`\n\nWe want to find `P₂ / P₁`. Let's rearrange the equation to solve for that ratio. First, invert both sides:\n\n`K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\nNow, cube both sides to isolate the period ratio:\n\n`P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3`\n\n**5. Substituting the Observational Data:**\n\nWe know that `K ∝ Δλ`, so `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`.\nThe problem gives us:\n*   `Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ`\n*   `Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ`\n\nTherefore, `K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\nNow substitute this into our equation for the period ratio:\n\n`P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)^3`\n\n**6. Calculation:**\n\n`P₂ / P₁ = (5 * 5 * 5) / (7 * 7 * 7) = 125 / 343`\n\n`P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\nComparing this to the options:\nA) ~ 0.85\nB) ~ 1.96\nC) ~ 1.40\nD) ~ 0.36\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
