    "This problem involves the physics of radioactive decay, which follows an exponential probability distribution. A key characteristic of this process is that it is \"memoryless.\" This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Define the survival probability:** The probability that an atom survives (does not decay) for a time `t` is given by the formula:\n    `P_survive(t) = e^(-λt)`\n    where `λ` is the decay constant, a value specific to the type of atom.\n\n2.  **Define the decay probability:** The probability that an atom decays within a time `t` is:\n    `P_decay(t) = 1 - P_survive(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n3.  **Use the given information to find a relationship for λ:** We are told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    `P_decay(100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n    From this, we can find the survival probability for 100 minutes:\n    `e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    We don't need to solve for `λ` explicitly; we can use this relationship directly.\n\n4.  **Apply the \"memoryless\" property:** The question asks for the probability that the atom will decay in the *next* 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes. Because the process is memoryless, the past 50 minutes of survival do not affect the future probability. Therefore, the problem simplifies to finding the probability that a *new* atom of the same type would decay within a 150-minute interval.\n\n5.  **Calculate the required probability:** We need to calculate `P_decay(150)`.\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n    We can rewrite `e^(-λ * 150)` using the relationship we found in step 3:\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    Substituting the value `0.68` for `e^(-λ * 100)`:\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n    Now, we can find the decay probability:\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\n6.  **Compute the final value:** We will use Python to calculate the numerical value of `1 - (0.68)^1.5`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# From the reasoning, the required probability is 1 - (0.68)^1.5\nprobability = 1 - (0.68 ** 1.5)\n\n# We convert the probability to a percentage\npercentage_probability = probability * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage_probability:.2f}%\")\n```\n\nThe computed probability is approximately 43.93%.\n\n7.  **Compare with the options:**\n    A) 48%\n    B) 44%\n    C) 52%\n    D) 40%\n\nThe calculated value of 43.93% is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem is about the probability of radioactive decay. The key concept to understand is that radioactive decay is a **memoryless process**. This means the probability of an atom decaying in any given time interval is independent of how long the atom has already existed. The past does not influence the future.\n\nTherefore, the information that \"50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed\" is irrelevant to the future probability. We just need to calculate the probability that the atom will decay in a 150-minute interval.\n\n**Step 1: Define the decay probability formula.**\nThe probability of an atom decaying within a time `t` is given by:\n`P_decay(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\nwhere `λ` is the decay constant.\n\n**Step 2: Use the given information to find the value of `e^(-λ*100)`.**\nWe are told that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n`P_decay(100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n\nFrom this equation, we can determine the survival probability for 100 minutes:\n`e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes.**\nBecause the process is memoryless, this is the same as calculating `P_decay(150)`.\n`P_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\nWe can rewrite the exponential term using the value we found in Step 2:\n`e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n\nNow, substitute the value `0.68` into the equation:\n`e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n**Step 4: Compute the final probability.**\n`P_decay(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\nThe calculation performed by the code gives:\n`1 - (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n\nConverting this to a percentage, we get 43.93%.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the result to the given options.**\nA) 48%\nB) 44%\nC) 52%\nD) 40%\n\nThe calculated probability of 43.93% is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>"
