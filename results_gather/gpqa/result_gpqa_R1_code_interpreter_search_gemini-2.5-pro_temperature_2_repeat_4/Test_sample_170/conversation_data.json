    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction and Substituent Effects**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination). The substituent already on the benzene ring (`C6H5-X`) determines the position of the incoming bromine. We need to order the substances based on the yield of the para-product.\n\nSubstituents are classified as:\n*   **Activating groups (o,p-directors):** They donate electrons to the ring, making it more reactive. They direct incoming electrophiles to the *ortho* and *para* positions. Examples in our list: `-CH3` (1), `-C2H5` (5).\n*   **Deactivating groups (o,p-directors):** Halogens are an exception. They withdraw electrons via induction (deactivating) but donate via resonance (o,p-directing). Example: `-Cl` (3).\n*   **Deactivating groups (m-directors):** They withdraw electrons from the ring, making it less reactive. They direct incoming electrophiles to the *meta* position. Examples: `-NO2` (4), `-COOH` (6), `-COOC2H5` (2).\n\n**2. Analyze Meta-Directing Groups**\n\nSubstances with meta-directing groups will have the lowest yield of the para-isomer. The three m-directors are:\n*   4) `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n*   6) `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n*   2) `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n\nTo rank these three, we consider their deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group leads to higher selectivity for the meta position, and consequently, a lower yield of the para (and ortho) isomers.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is generally: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOR` (ester).\n*   However, electrophilic bromination typically requires a Lewis acid catalyst (like FeBr3). Esters (`-COOC2H5`) can act as Lewis bases and coordinate with the catalyst through the lone pairs on the oxygen atoms. This coordination makes the ester substituent significantly more electron-withdrawing and thus more deactivating. It's plausible that the complexed ester becomes a stronger deactivating group than the carboxylic acid.\n*   Let's assume this interaction occurs. The deactivating strength order becomes: `-NO2` > `-COOC2H5` (complexed) > `-COOH`.\n*   Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be the reverse of the deactivating strength: `-NO2` < `-COOC2H5` < `-COOH`.\n*   This translates to the numerical order: `4 < 2 < 6`.\n\n**3. Analyze Ortho, Para-Directing Groups**\n\nSubstances with o,p-directing groups will have high yields of the para-isomer. The three o,p-directors are:\n*   3) `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n*   1) `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene)\n*   5) `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n\nFor these groups, the distribution between the ortho and para positions is mainly determined by **steric hindrance**. A larger, bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of substitution at the less hindered para position.\n\n*   Let's rank the substituents by their steric bulk: `-Cl` < `-CH3` < `-C2H5`.\n    *   Chlorine is a single atom.\n    *   Methyl (`-CH3`) is bulkier than a chlorine atom.\n    *   Ethyl (`-C2H5`) is bulkier than methyl.\n*   A higher steric bulk leads to a higher yield of the para-isomer. Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: `C6H5-Cl` < `C6H5-CH3` < `C6H5-C2H5`.\n*   This translates to the numerical order: `3 < 1 < 5`.\n\n**4. Combine the Rankings**\n\nNow, we combine the two ranked lists. The meta-directors have the lowest para-yields, followed by the ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Meta-director order: `4 < 2 < 6`\n*   Ortho, para-director order: `3 < 1 < 5`\n\nCombining them gives the final order of increasing para-isomer yield:\n`4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5`\n\nThis sequence matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
