    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\nThis is a six-membered ring containing three functional groups:\n1.  A ketone (C=O) at position 1.\n2.  A primary alcohol (as a hydroxymethyl group, -CH2OH) at position 3.\n3.  An alkene (as an isopropenyl group, -C(CH3)=CH2) at position 5.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction with NaH followed by BnBr**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. Benzyl bromide (BnBr) is an alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** NaH will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol proton (-OH) has a pKa of about 16-18, while the protons alpha to the ketone have a pKa of about 19-21. Therefore, NaH will selectively deprotonate the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n*   The resulting alkoxide is a nucleophile and will attack the benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction (Williamson ether synthesis), displacing the bromide ion.\n*   **Result:** The hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) is converted into a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH2OBn). The other functional groups (ketone and alkene) remain unchanged.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and cat. HCl**\n\n*   **Reagents:** p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (tosylhydrazide) and an acid catalyst (HCl).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard reaction for the formation of a tosylhydrazone from a ketone. The hydrazine nitrogen attacks the carbonyl carbon, and a molecule of water is eliminated.\n*   **Result:** The ketone group (C=O) at position 1 is converted to a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs).\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous NH4Cl**\n\n*   **Reagents:** n-Butyllithium (a very strong base) followed by a proton source (NH4Cl).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the Shapiro reaction. It converts a tosylhydrazone into an alkene by removing the original carbonyl oxygen.\n    1.  n-BuLi acts as a base, not a nucleophile. Two equivalents are typically used. The first deprotonates the N-H of the hydrazone. The second deprotonates the less sterically hindered carbon alpha to the C=N bond.\n    2.  The alpha-carbons are C2 (next to the bulky benzyloxymethyl group) and C6 (unsubstituted). Deprotonation will occur at C6 because it is less sterically hindered.\n    3.  The resulting dianion intermediate collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N2) and the p-toluenesulfinate anion (Ts-) to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The double bond is formed between C1 and C6.\n    4.  The reaction is quenched with aqueous ammonium chloride, which protonates the vinyllithium species.\n*   **Result:** The tosylhydrazone group at C1 is replaced with a C=C double bond between C1 and C6.\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Hydrogen gas and palladium on carbon catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, which causes several transformations:\n    1.  **Alkene reduction:** Both C=C double bonds in Product 3 will be hydrogenated to C-C single bonds. The double bond in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced, making it a cyclohexane ring. The double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will be reduced, converting it to an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** The benzyl ether group (-OBn) is a common protecting group for alcohols that is cleaved under these conditions (H2, Pd/C). The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen is broken, regenerating the alcohol and producing toluene as a byproduct.\n*   **Result:** All double bonds are saturated, and the benzyl ether protecting group is removed. The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The relative 1,3-positioning of the substituents from the start of the synthesis is maintained.\n*   **Product 4:** The structure is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The name is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** This perfectly matches our derived structure for Product 4.\n*   **B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** This structure retains the tosylhydrazone moiety, which would have been eliminated in the Shapiro reaction. It is incorrect.\n*   **C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This structure results from the incorrect assumption that n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile in Step 3. It is incorrect.\n*   **D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** This structure still has the benzyl ether protecting group. While it is an intermediate in the final step (after hydrogenation of the alkenes but before deprotection), the conditions (H2, Pd/C) are standard for cleaving benzyl ethers, so the reaction would proceed to the deprotected alcohol. Therefore, this is not the final product.\n\nThe correct sequence of transformations leads to (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>"
