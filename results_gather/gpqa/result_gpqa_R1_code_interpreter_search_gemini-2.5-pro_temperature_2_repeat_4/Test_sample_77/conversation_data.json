    "This problem asks for the scalar and vector potentials, V and A, for a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. They are derived from the general expressions for retarded potentials by applying them to the specific case of a point charge.\n\n1.  **General Retarded Potentials:**\n    The scalar potential V and vector potential A at a position $\\vec{r}$ and time t due to a charge distribution $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current distribution $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$ are given by:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} dV'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} dV'$\n    where $t_r = t - \\dfrac{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|}{c}$ is the retarded time. The potentials at time t are determined by the state of the sources at the earlier time $t_r$, which is the time it took for the information (the field) to travel from the source position $\\vec{r}'$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at the speed of light c.\n\n2.  **Applying to a Point Charge:**\n    For a single point charge q moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities can be expressed using the Dirac delta function:\n    $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = \\dfrac{d\\vec{s}}{dt'}$ is the velocity of the charge.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Integrals:**\n    Substituting these densities into the potential integrals and evaluating them is a non-trivial task because the retarded time $t_r$ in the argument of the delta function depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. The standard evaluation of these integrals (found in most advanced electromagnetism textbooks like Griffiths' \"Introduction to Electrodynamics\", Chapter 10) yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n4.  **Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:**\n    The result of the integration gives the potentials at the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ in terms of the charge's properties at the retarded time $t_r$. Let's match this with the problem's notation:\n    *   The position of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$ is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point is $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$. Its magnitude is $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n    *   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$.\n    *   The retardation condition is $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n    The resulting potentials are:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n5.  **Matching with the Options:**\n    The expressions derived above need to be manipulated to match one of the given options. Let's multiply the numerator and denominator of the expressions by c:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    These expressions match exactly with the formulas given in option D.\n\n6.  **Alternative Check on A vs V:**\n    We can also note the relationship between V and $\\vec{A}$:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v}}{1} \\left( \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right) = (\\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v}) V(\\vec{r}, t)$\n    Since $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o \\epsilon_o)$, we have $\\mu_o \\epsilon_o = 1/c^2$.\n    Therefore, $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r}, t)$.\n    Let's check if this holds for option D.\n    $\\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left( \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi \\epsilon_o c^2 (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    Using $\\epsilon_o c^2 = 1/\\mu_o$:\n    $\\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (1/\\mu_o) (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$, which is indeed the expression for $\\vec{A}$ in option D.\n\n    Let's examine the other options:\n    *   A) and B) use the simple Coulomb potential form, which is only valid for static or quasi-static cases and ignores retardation effects in the denominator. Incorrect.\n    *   C) has a `+` sign in the denominator. This would correspond to advanced potentials (evaluating at $t_a = t + d/c$), which are generally discarded as unphysical because they violate causality. Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, option D correctly represents the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<D>>>"
