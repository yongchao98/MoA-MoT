    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Goal:** The primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its host star. For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula is:\n    T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A_p)^(1/4)\n    Where:\n    -   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n    -   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n    -   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    -   `A_p` is the planet's bond albedo.\n\n3.  **Forming the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2. Let's write out the expressions for both planets:\n    T_eq1 = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1)) * (1 - A_p1)^(1/4)\n    T_eq2 = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2)) * (1 - A_p2)^(1/4)\n\n    When we divide T_eq1 by T_eq2, the terms `T_star` and `R_star` cancel out because both planets orbit the same star. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (`A_p1 = A_p2`), so the `(1 - A_p)^(1/4)` term also cancels out.\n\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [sqrt(1 / a_1)] / [sqrt(1 / a_2)] = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\n    This simplifies the problem significantly: to find the temperature ratio, we only need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n4.  **Relating Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters:** The problem provides radial velocity (RV) data in the form of Doppler shifts (Δλ). The maximum radial velocity of the star (the RV amplitude, `K`) is related to the orbital parameters. For a circular orbit (eccentricity e=0) and assuming the planet's mass (`M_p`) is much smaller than the star's mass (`M_star`), the RV amplitude is given by:\n    K ≈ M_p / sqrt(M_star) * sqrt(G / a)\n\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   The use of both transit and RV methods implies the orbital inclination `i` is close to 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1, which is assumed in this formula.\n    *   The circular orbit condition simplifies the general formula.\n\n5.  **Solving for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We need to find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`. Let's rearrange the formula for `K` to solve for `a`:\n    K^2 ≈ (M_p^2 / M_star) * (G / a)\n    a ≈ G * M_p^2 / (M_star * K^2)\n\n6.  **Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Now we can find the ratio `a_2 / a_1` by dividing the expression for `a_2` by the expression for `a_1`:\n    a_2 / a_1 = [G * M_p2^2 / (M_star * K_2^2)] / [G * M_p1^2 / (M_star * K_1^2)]\n\n    The terms `G` and `M_star` cancel out, leaving:\n    a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_2^2) * (K_1^2 / M_p1^2)\n    a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2\n\n7.  **Substituting into the Temperature Ratio:** Now we substitute this back into our simplified temperature ratio equation from step 3:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2 )\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K_1 / K_2)\n\n8.  **Plugging in the Values:** We have the following information from the problem:\n    -   Masses: `M_p1 = 7 M_earth`, `M_p2 = 5 M_earth`.\n    -   Doppler shifts: `Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å`, `Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å`.\n\n    The ratio of RV amplitudes `K_1 / K_2` is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts `Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`.\n\n    -   Mass ratio: `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7`.\n    -   RV amplitude ratio: `K_1 / K_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4`.\n\n9.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute these ratios into the equation from step 7:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\nTo get the final numerical answer, we perform the division.\n```python\n# M_p1 = 7, M_p2 = 5\n# d_lambda1 = 0.03, d_lambda2 = 0.04\n# Ratio M_p2/M_p1\nmass_ratio = 5 / 7\n# Ratio K1/K2 which is d_lambda1/d_lambda2\nrv_ratio = 0.03 / 0.04\n# The temperature ratio is the product of these two ratios.\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K_1 / K_2)\ntemp_ratio = mass_ratio * rv_ratio\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n\n15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357. This value is approximately 0.53, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
