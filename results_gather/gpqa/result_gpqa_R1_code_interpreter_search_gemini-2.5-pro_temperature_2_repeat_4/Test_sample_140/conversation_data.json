    "This problem involves an elimination-addition reaction via a benzyne intermediate. Let's break down the process step-by-step.\n\n**1. Identification of Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule with a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, denoted by 'd' or 'D') at the adjacent position C2.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base (the pKa of its conjugate acid, NH3, is ~38).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The conditions (aryl halide with no activating groups, very strong base) are characteristic of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Formation of Benzyne Intermediate (Elimination Step)**\n\nThe first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr) to form a benzyne intermediate. The amide ion (NH2⁻) acts as the base, abstracting an acidic proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the bromine leaving group.\n\nIn 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two distinct ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThe amide base can abstract either the H from C6 or the D from C2.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the proton from C6, forming a carbanion at C6.\n    2.  This carbanion is unstable and rapidly loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  This creates a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains in the molecule. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the deuteron from C2, forming a carbanion at C2.\n    2.  This carbanion loses the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  This creates a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is lost in this process. The resulting intermediate is **unlabeled benzyne**.\n\n**Kinetic Isotope Effect (KIE):** The C-H bond is weaker and is cleaved more readily than the C-D bond. This phenomenon is known as the kinetic isotope effect. Consequently, Pathway A (H abstraction) will be significantly faster and thus the major pathway, while Pathway B (D abstraction) will be slower and the minor pathway. However, since the question asks for the number of *possible* products, we must consider all chemically feasible pathways, even the minor ones.\n\nTherefore, **two different benzyne intermediates** are formed in the reaction: 3-deuterobenzyne (major) and unlabeled benzyne (minor).\n\n**3. Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates (Addition Step)**\n\nThe second step is the addition of a nucleophile to the newly formed benzyne. The amide ion (NH2⁻) can also act as the nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. This is followed by protonation by the solvent, ammonia (NH3).\n\n*   **Attack on 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    *   This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6 and a deuterium at C2. It is not symmetrical.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** If NH2⁻ attacks C1, a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of this carbanion by NH3 yields a product with an -NH2 group at C1 and a deuterium at C2. This is **1-amino-2-deuterobenzene** (or o-deuteroaniline).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** If NH2⁻ attacks C6, a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation yields a product with an -NH2 group at C6 and a deuterium at C2. To name this compound, we renumber the ring starting from the -NH2 group, so C6 becomes C1'. In this new numbering, the deuterium is at C3'. The product is **1-amino-3-deuterobenzene** (or m-deuteroaniline).\n    *   Thus, the major intermediate (3-deuterobenzyne) gives **two distinct products**.\n\n*   **Attack on unlabeled benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    *   This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C2 and no deuterium label. It is symmetrical.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Attack of NH2⁻ at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, will lead to the same product: **1-aminobenzene** (or aniline).\n    *   Thus, the minor intermediate (benzyne) gives only **one product**.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nCombining the products from all possible pathways, we get three unique organic molecules:\n1.  1-amino-2-deuterobenzene\n2.  1-amino-3-deuterobenzene\n3.  1-aminobenzene (aniline)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
