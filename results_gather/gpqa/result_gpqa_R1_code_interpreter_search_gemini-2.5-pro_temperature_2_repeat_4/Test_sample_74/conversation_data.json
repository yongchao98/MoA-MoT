    "You're working on a fascinating project connecting immunology and virology! It's definitely frustrating when a meticulously planned experiment hits a snag like this. Let's look at the DNA sequence you've provided to find the culprit.\n\n**Reasoning and Analysis**\n\nThe goal is to express a fusion protein consisting of an N-terminal HA tag followed by the GADD45G protein. The ribosome will start translation at the first `ATG` (start codon) and proceed, reading the genetic code in triplets (codons) until it encounters a stop codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`).\n\nThe provided DNA sequence is:\n`5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'`\n\nLet's translate this sequence from the beginning:\n\n1.  **Start Codon and HA Tag:** The sequence begins `ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC...`.\n    *   `ATG` is the start codon (Methionine, M).\n    *   The next 9 codons `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC` correctly code for the amino acid sequence of the HA tag: `YPYDVPDYA`.\n    *   So far, everything seems correct. The protein synthesis starts and the antigenic tag is being produced.\n\n2.  **Downstream Sequence:** Let's continue reading the sequence in the same reading frame.\n    *   The codons immediately following the HA tag sequence are `AAA` and `TGA`.\n    *   `AAA` codes for the amino acid Lysine (K).\n    *   `TGA` is a stop codon.\n\nThe full translated peptide is therefore: M-YPYDVPDYA-K.\n\nWhen the ribosome encounters the `TGA` codon, it terminates translation. Instead of producing the full-length HA-GADD45G protein, it only produces a tiny, 11-amino-acid peptide. This peptide is too small to be detected by standard methods like Western blotting and is certainly not the functional protein you intended to study. This premature termination of translation is the definitive reason why you are unable to detect overexpression of your protein.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** This is incorrect. As shown above, the sequence correctly codes for the YPYDVPDYA HA tag.\n*   **B) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** While it's true that stop codons don't have corresponding tRNAs, the stop codon here is `TGA`, and this fact is the *mechanism* of termination, not the *error* in the construct. The error is the presence of the stop codon itself.\n*   **C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** The absence of a linker can sometimes cause issues, but the sequence reveals a much more fundamental problem. The full protein is never even synthesized, so post-translational proteolysis isn't the primary issue.\n*   **D) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** This is precisely what happens. A premature stop codon (`TGA`) was inadvertently included in your construct right after the HA tag, causing the ribosome to fall off the mRNA and release a truncated, non-functional peptide.\n\nThe likely molecular cloning error was either a mistake in primer design or the accidental ligation of a small DNA fragment containing a stop codon between your tag and the GADD45G gene.\n\n<<<D>>>"
