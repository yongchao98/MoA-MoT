    "Here is the reasoning process to determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax, assuming a uniform distribution of stars in space.\n\n1.  **Define the relationship between the number of stars and distance.**\n    *   Let's assume stars are distributed uniformly throughout space. This means the number density of stars, ρ (number of stars per unit volume), is constant.\n    *   Consider a thin spherical shell of space with radius `d` and thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this shell (`dV`) is approximately the surface area of the sphere (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`).\n    So, `dV = 4πd² dd`.\n    *   The number of stars (`dN`) within this thin shell is the number density (`ρ`) times the volume of the shell (`dV`).\n    So, `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² dd`.\n\n2.  **Define the relationship between distance and parallax.**\n    *   Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. The standard formula is `plx = 1/d`, where `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds.\n    *   From this, we can express distance in terms of parallax: `d = 1/plx`.\n\n3.  **Convert the number of stars relationship from distance to parallax.**\n    *   Our goal is to find how the number of stars per unit parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) depends on `plx`.\n    *   First, we need to express the differential `dd` in terms of `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating the equation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n    `dd/d(plx) = d(1/plx)/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   Rearranging this gives `dd = -d(plx)/plx²`. When counting stars, we are concerned with the magnitude of the interval, so we can ignore the negative sign (which just signifies that as distance increases, parallax decreases). So we'll use `dd = d(plx)/plx²`.\n\n4.  **Substitute the parallax expressions back into the number of stars equation.**\n    *   We start with `dN = 4πρd² dd`.\n    *   Now, we substitute `d = 1/plx` and `dd = d(plx)/plx²` into this equation:\n    `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx)² * (d(plx)/plx²) `\n    *   Combining the terms involving `plx`, we get:\n    `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n5.  **Determine the final relationship.**\n    *   The quantity we want is the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   By rearranging the last equation, we get:\n    `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we can see that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n`dN/d(plx) ~ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
