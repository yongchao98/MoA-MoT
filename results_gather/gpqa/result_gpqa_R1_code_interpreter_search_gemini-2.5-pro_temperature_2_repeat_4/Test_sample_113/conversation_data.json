    "*   **Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n    1.  **Analysis:** This reaction is a **cyanohydrin formation**. It starts with a ketone (butan-2-one) and adds a cyanide group (from NaCN) and a hydrogen atom across the carbonyl (C=O) double bond.\n    2.  **Mechanism:** The nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN attacks the electrophilic carbon of the carbonyl group in butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n    3.  **Role of Reagent A:** The negatively charged alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final neutral hydroxyl (-OH) group in the product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Reagent A must be a proton source.\n    4.  **Evaluating Options for A:**\n        *   `H3O⁺` (hydronium ion, representing an aqueous acid) is a standard proton source used in the workup step of many organic reactions, including cyanohydrin formation. It readily donates a proton to the alkoxide.\n        *   `NaHSO3` (sodium bisulfite) is a reagent that also reacts with ketones in an addition reaction, but it does not serve as the proton source required here to complete the cyanohydrin formation.\n    5.  **Conclusion for A:** Reagent A must be `H3O⁺`. This eliminates options C and D.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n    1.  **Analysis:** This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a **hydrolysis of a nitrile**.\n    2.  **Mechanism:** Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either acid or base in the presence of water and heat. The problem shows the direct formation of the carboxylic acid, which is characteristic of acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.\n    3.  **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as the acid catalyst for the hydrolysis.\n    4.  **Evaluating Options for B (from the remaining choices A and B):**\n        *   `HCl` (hydrochloric acid) is a strong mineral acid and is a very common and effective catalyst for nitrile hydrolysis.\n        *   `CH3COOH` (acetic acid) is a weak acid. While it could potentially catalyze the reaction, it would be much slower and less efficient than a strong acid like HCl. In the context of a typical synthesis problem, a strong acid is the expected reagent.\n    5.  **Conclusion for B:** Reagent B is `HCl`.\n\n*   **Final Combination:**\n    *   For the first reaction, `A = H3O⁺`.\n    *   For the second reaction, `B = HCl`.\n    *   This combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
