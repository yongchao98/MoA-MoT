    "This is a classic structure elucidation problem that can be solved by systematically piecing together the information from the provided spectra.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data to Determine the Number of Hydrogens and Structural Fragments:**\n\n*   **Aromatic-H signals (2 signals):** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring (a benzene ring) has 4 protons on the ring itself (formula C6H4). The presence of only two signals for these four protons strongly suggests a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern with two different substituents, which would give a characteristic AA'BB' system, often appearing as two distinct signals (doublets).\n    *   *Protons accounted for:* **4 H** (aromatic)\n\n*   **Vinyl-H signals (2 signals, one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is indicative of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to the aromatic ring.\n    *   Let's label the carbons: Ring-CH(A)=CH(B)-CH3(C).\n    *   H(B) is split by H(A) (a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n    *   H(A) is only split by H(B), resulting in a **doublet**.\n    *   This fragment accounts for the two vinyl protons.\n    *   *Protons accounted for:* **2 H** (vinyl)\n\n*   **–CH3 group signals (2 signals):**\n    *   One of these signals corresponds to the methyl group in the propenyl fragment (-CH=CH-CH3). This methyl group is adjacent to a vinyl proton (H(B)), so its signal would be a doublet.\n    *   The other -CH3 signal must belong to the second substituent, the ester group. Since there are no adjacent protons, this would be a singlet.\n    *   These two methyl groups account for 2 * 3 = 6 protons.\n    *   *Protons accounted for:* **6 H** (methyl)\n\n*   **No –CH2 group signals:** This is a key constraint that eliminates many possibilities.\n\n**2. Sum the Hydrogens:**\n\nBy adding up the protons from all the identified fragments, we can determine the total number of hydrogens in the molecule.\nTotal H = 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 6 (methyl) = **12 H**\n\nNow, we can compare this with the options provided:\nA) C11H14O2 (14 H) - Incorrect.\nB) C12H14O2 (14 H) - Incorrect.\nC) C11H12O2 (12 H) - **Possible**.\nD) C12H12O2 (12 H) - **Possible**.\n\nThis analysis narrows the choice down to C or D.\n\n**3. Determine the Carbon Count:**\n\nLet's build the molecule's carbon skeleton based on the fragments we identified.\n*   **Di-substituted benzene ring:** This is a C6H4 fragment, so **6 Carbons**.\n*   **Propenyl group:** The -CH=CH-CH3 group has **3 Carbons**.\n*   **Ester group:** The FTIR shows an ester group (-COO-), which contains one C=O bond. The second methyl group must be part of this ester. There are two possibilities that fit the \"no -CH2\" rule:\n    1.  A methyl ester: -COOCH3. This contains **2 Carbons** (the carbonyl carbon and the methyl carbon).\n    2.  An acetate group attached via oxygen: -O-CO-CH3. This also contains **2 Carbons**.\nIn either case, this fragment contributes 2 carbons.\n\n**4. Sum the Carbons:**\n\nTotal C = 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 2 (ester fragment) = **11 C**\n\n**5. Final Identification:**\n\nThe molecule must have 11 carbons and 12 hydrogens. The only formula that matches this is **C11H12O2**. The two oxygens are from the ester group.\n\nTo confirm, let's check the degree of unsaturation (DoU) for C11H12O2:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\nOur proposed structure has:\n*   1 benzene ring = 4 DoU\n*   1 C=C double bond (in propenyl) = 1 DoU\n*   1 C=O double bond (in ester) = 1 DoU\n*   Total DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\nThe calculated DoU matches the DoU derived from the structure, confirming our analysis. The chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
