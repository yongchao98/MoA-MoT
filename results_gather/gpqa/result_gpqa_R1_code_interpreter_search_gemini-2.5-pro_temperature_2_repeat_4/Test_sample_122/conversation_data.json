    "This problem requires the application of the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere is the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Galaxy Frame (S):** This is the stationary frame of reference from which we are observing the ejecta.\n    *   **Ejecta Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame of reference. It is moving at a velocity `v` relative to the Galaxy frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   Relative velocity, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   Time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame, `Δt' = 50 s`. Since this time is measured in the moving object's own frame, it is the **proper time** (`Δt₀`).\n    *   Speed of light, `c ≈ 299,792.458 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the **Galaxy's reference frame (`d`)**.\n\n4.  **Apply the Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   The distance traveled in the Galaxy frame is calculated as `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   According to the theory of special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will observe time passing more slowly for a moving object (the ejecta). This effect is known as **time dilation**.\n    *   The time measured in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) is related to the proper time in the ejecta's frame (`Δt₀`) by the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    *   Where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Formulate the Complete Equation:**\n    By substituting the expressions for `Δt` and `γ` into the distance formula, we get:\n    `d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀) = v * Δt₀ / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    First, let's calculate the \"classical\" distance without considering relativistic effects. This would be `d_classical = v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to option A.\n\n    However, due to time dilation, the Lorentz factor `γ` will be greater than 1, which means the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) will be longer than 50 seconds. Consequently, the distance measured in the Galaxy's frame must be **greater than 3,000,000 km**.\n\n    Looking at the options:\n    A) 3,000,000 km\n    B) 2,880,000 km\n    C) 2,940,000 km\n    D) 3,060,000 km\n\n    Only option D is greater than the classical distance. This strongly suggests it is the correct answer. Let's verify with a precise calculation.\n\nWe can use Python to perform the calculation accurately.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000.0  # Velocity of the ejecta in km/s\nt0 = 50.0     # Proper time in the ejecta's frame in seconds\nc = 299792.458 # Speed of light in km/s\n\n# Calculate the numerator (classical distance)\nclassical_distance = v * t0\n\n# Calculate the term inside the square root for the denominator\nbeta_squared = (v / c)**2\n\n# Calculate the denominator (the square root term)\ndenominator = math.sqrt(1 - beta_squared)\n\n# Calculate the final relativistic distance\nd = classical_distance / denominator\n\nprint(d)\n```\n<execute_result>\n3061954.5204439033\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated distance is approximately `3,061,955 km`. This value is extremely close to option D, `3,060,000 km`. The small difference (about 0.06%) is likely due to the use of a rounded value for the speed of light or the relative velocity when the problem and options were created.\n\nConclusion: The physics principle of time dilation dictates that the distance measured in the Galaxy's frame must be greater than the non-relativistic calculation. Option D is the only choice that satisfies this condition, and our precise calculation confirms it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The user has provided an alternative code output, which is functionally identical to the one I generated. My reasoning and conclusion remain unchanged based on this new output.\n\nThe calculated value, approximately 3,061,950 km, is closest to option D.\n\n**Recap of Reasoning:**\n1.  The problem involves time dilation from special relativity.\n2.  The time `Δt₀ = 50 s` is the proper time, measured in the moving frame (the ejecta).\n3.  The time `Δt` that passes in the stationary frame (the Galaxy) is longer due to time dilation: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor and is always > 1 for `v > 0`.\n4.  The distance measured in the Galaxy frame is `d = v * Δt`.\n5.  Therefore, `d = v * γ * Δt₀`, which is greater than the classical distance `v * Δt₀ = 3,000,000 km`.\n6.  Only option D (`3,060,000 km`) is greater than 3,000,000 km.\n7.  The code calculation confirms that the relativistic distance is approximately 3,062,000 km, making D the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>"
