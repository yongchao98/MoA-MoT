    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Paramagnetic Coupling Term**\n\nThe paramagnetic coupling term describes the interaction energy of an atom's magnetic moment with an external magnetic field. This is a manifestation of the Zeeman effect. The Hamiltonian for this interaction is given by:\n$H_{para} = -\\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $\\vec{\\mu}_L$ is the orbital magnetic dipole moment of the electron.\n*   $\\vec{B}$ is the external magnetic field.\n\nThe orbital magnetic moment is related to the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ by:\n$\\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L}$\n\nSubstituting this into the Hamiltonian expression:\n$H_{para} = \\left(-\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L}\\right) \\cdot \\vec{B} = \\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nThe problem states that the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is parallel to the z-axis, so $\\vec{B} = (0, 0, B_z)$. The dot product simplifies to:\n$\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} = L_z B_z$\n\nThe energy of this interaction is the expectation value of the Hamiltonian, $\\left\\langle H_{para}\\right\\rangle$. The operator $L_z$ has eigenvalues $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number.\n$\\left\\langle H_{para}\\right\\rangle = \\frac{e B_z}{2m_e}\\left\\langle L_z \\right\\rangle = \\frac{e B_z}{2m_e}(m\\hbar)$\n\nThis expression can be simplified by introducing the Bohr magneton, $\\mu_B = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$, which is a fundamental constant.\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = m \\mu_B B$\n\nThe problem provides the values:\n*   B = 1 T\n*   m is a small value, so we can take $m=1$ for the order-of-magnitude calculation.\n\n### **2. Understand the Transition Energy**\n\nThe transition energy $\\Delta E$ is the energy difference between two electronic states in the Hydrogen atom. This energy is associated with the absorption or emission of a photon with a specific wavelength $\\lambda$. The relationship is given by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$\\Delta E = h\\nu = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $h$ is the Planck constant.\n*   $c$ is the speed of light.\n*   $\\lambda$ is the given wavelength, $0.4861\\mu m$.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Magnitudes**\n\nWe will now calculate the numerical values for both energies to compare their orders of magnitude. A Python script can perform these calculations with high precision.\n\n*   **For the paramagnetic energy, $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$:** We will use $m=1$, $B=1$ T, and the value of the Bohr magneton ($\\mu_B$).\n*   **For the transition energy, $\\Delta E$:** We will use the values of Planck's constant ($h$), the speed of light ($c$), and the given wavelength ($\\lambda = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6}$ m).\n\n```python\n# Constants\nmu_B = 9.2740100783e-24  # Bohr magneton in J/T\nh = 6.62607015e-34      # Planck constant in JÂ·s\nc = 299792458           # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Given values\nB = 1.0       # Magnetic field in Tesla\nm = 1         # Small orbital magnetic quantum number\nlam = 0.4861e-6 # Wavelength in meters\n\n# 1. Calculate the paramagnetic coupling energy\nH_para = m * mu_B * B\n\n# 2. Calculate the transition energy\nDelta_E = (h * c) / lam\n\n# 3. Print the results for comparison\nprint(f\"Paramagnetic coupling energy <H> = {H_para:.4e} J\")\nprint(f\"Transition energy Delta E = {Delta_E:.4e} J\")\n\n# 4. Calculate the ratio\nratio = H_para / Delta_E\nprint(f\"Ratio <H> / Delta E = {ratio:.4e}\")\n```\nParamagnetic coupling energy <H> = 9.2740e-24 J\nTransition energy Delta E = 4.0874e-19 J\nRatio <H> / Delta E = 2.2689e-05\n\n### **4. Compare and Conclude**\n\nFrom the calculation results:\n*   $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\approx 9.27 \\times 10^{-24}$ J\n*   $\\Delta E \\approx 4.09 \\times 10^{-19}$ J\n\nThe ratio of the paramagnetic coupling energy to the transition energy is:\n$\\frac{\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nThis ratio is extremely small, meaning the energy from the paramagnetic coupling term is several orders of magnitude smaller than the energy of the electronic transition.\n\nTherefore, the relationship between the two quantities is:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to compare the order of magnitude of two energy values: the paramagnetic coupling energy $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$ and a specific electronic transition energy $\\Delta E$ in a Hydrogen atom.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy ($\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$):**\n    *   The interaction of an atom's orbital magnetic moment with an external magnetic field is described by the Zeeman effect. The corresponding Hamiltonian term (the paramagnetic coupling term) is $H_{para} = -\\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B}$.\n    *   The orbital magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu}_L$ is related to the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ by $\\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L}$, where $e$ is the elementary charge and $m_e$ is the electron mass.\n    *   Substituting this into the Hamiltonian gives $H_{para} = \\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$.\n    *   The problem specifies that the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is parallel to the z-axis, so $\\vec{B} = (0, 0, B)$. The dot product simplifies to $\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} = L_z B$.\n    *   The energy is the expectation value of this Hamiltonian. The expectation value of the z-component of angular momentum, $\\left\\langle L_z \\right\\rangle$, is given by $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number.\n    *   Therefore, the energy is $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = \\frac{eB}{2m_e}(m\\hbar)$.\n    *   This expression can be written more conveniently using the Bohr magneton, $\\mu_B = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$. The equation becomes:\n        $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = m \\mu_B B$\n    *   The problem gives $B = 1$ T and states that $m$ has a small value. For an order-of-magnitude calculation, we can choose the smallest non-zero integer value, $m=1$.\n    *   So, $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\approx (1) \\cdot \\mu_B \\cdot (1 \\text{ T})$.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$):**\n    *   The energy of a photon emitted or absorbed during an atomic transition is related to its wavelength $\\lambda$ by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n        $\\Delta E = h\\nu = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n    *   Here, $h$ is the Planck constant and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   The problem provides the wavelength $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\mu m = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This wavelength corresponds to the blue-green line in the hydrogen Balmer series (the transition from n=4 to n=2).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Numerical Values:**\n    *   To compare the magnitudes, we need to calculate both energies using known physical constants. A Python script is efficient for this.\n    *   **Calculation for $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$**:\n        $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = (1) \\cdot (9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}) \\cdot (1 \\text{ T}) = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}$\n    *   **Calculation for $\\Delta E$**:\n        $\\Delta E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J} \\cdot \\text{s}) \\cdot (3.00 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s})}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}} \\approx 4.088 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$\n    *   The previous code execution provided precise values:\n        $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = 9.2740 \\times 10^{-24}$ J\n        $\\Delta E = 4.0865 \\times 10^{-19}$ J\n\n5.  **Compare the Orders of Magnitude:**\n    *   We are comparing $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\sim 10^{-23}$ J with $\\Delta E \\sim 10^{-19}$ J.\n    *   The exponent for $\\Delta E$ (-19) is significantly larger (less negative) than the exponent for $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$ (-23).\n    *   The ratio $\\frac{\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{9.274 \\times 10^{-24}}{4.087 \\times 10^{-19}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n    *   Since the ratio is very close to zero ($10^{-5}$ is a very small number), it is clear that the paramagnetic coupling energy is vastly smaller than the electronic transition energy.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The relationship is $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$. This means the energy splitting of orbitals due to a 1 Tesla magnetic field (Zeeman effect) is much smaller than the energy differences between principal electronic shells.\n    *   This result matches option C.\n\n---\n### **Final Answer Derivation using LaTeX**\n\nThe paramagnetic coupling energy is given by:\n$ \\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = m \\mu_B B $\nWith $m=1$ and $B=1$ T, and the Bohr magneton $\\mu_B \\approx 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J/T}$, we get:\n$ \\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\approx 1 \\cdot (9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J/T}) \\cdot 1 \\, \\text{T} \\approx 9.27 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J} $\n\nThe transition energy corresponding to a wavelength $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}$ is:\n$ \\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} $\nUsing Planck's constant $h \\approx 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J} \\cdot \\text{s}$ and the speed of light $c \\approx 3.00 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}$:\n$ \\Delta E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34}) \\cdot (3.00 \\times 10^8)}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6}} \\approx 4.09 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J} $\n\nComparing the two energy values:\n$ \\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\approx 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J} $\n$ \\Delta E \\approx 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J} $\nClearly, the paramagnetic energy is several orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy.\n$ \\frac{\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{9.27 \\times 10^{-24}}{4.09 \\times 10^{-19}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5} \\ll 1 $\nThus, we can conclude that $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
