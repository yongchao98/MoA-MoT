    "To determine the total number of stereoisomers for a compound, we need to identify all of its stereocenters. Stereocenters include chiral centers (asymmetric carbon atoms) and double bonds that can exhibit geometric (E/Z) isomerism. The maximum number of stereoisomers is given by the formula 2^n, where 'n' is the number of stereocenters.\n\n**Step 1: Draw the structure of the compound from its IUPAC name.**\n\nThe name is **6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol**. Let's break it down:\n*   **undeca**: The parent chain has 11 carbon atoms.\n*   **-3,7-dien**: There are two double bonds in the chain, starting at carbon #3 and carbon #7 (i.e., between C3-C4 and C7-C8).\n*   **-5-ol**: There is a hydroxyl (-OH) group on carbon #5.\n*   **6-chloro**: There is a chlorine (-Cl) atom on carbon #6.\n*   **9-ethyl**: There is an ethyl (-CH2CH3) group on carbon #9.\n*   **2-methyl**: There is a methyl (-CH3) group on carbon #2.\n\nLet's sketch the carbon skeleton of the main chain and add the functional groups and substituents:\n\nMain chain: C(1)-C(2)-C(3)=C(4)-C(5)-C(6)-C(7)=C(8)-C(9)-C(10)-C(11)\n\nAdding the substituents at their designated positions:\n```\n           CH3 (on C2)   OH (on C5)   Cl (on C6)   CH2CH3 (on C9)\n            |              |            |               |\nC(1)-C(2)-C(3)=C(4)-C(5)-C(6)-C(7)=C(8)-C(9)-C(10)-C(11)\n```\n\nNow, let's add the hydrogen atoms to complete the structure:\n```\n           CH3          OH   Cl          CH2CH3\n            |            |    |              |\nCH3(1)-CH(2)-CH(3)=CH(4)-CH(5)-CH(6)-CH(7)=CH(8)-CH(9)-CH2(10)-CH3(11)\n```\n\n**Step 2: Identify all stereocenters.**\n\n**A) Chiral Centers (Asymmetric Carbons):** A carbon atom is chiral if it is bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **C2:** The groups attached to C2 are:\n    1.  -CH3 (the C1 atom)\n    2.  -CH3 (the methyl substituent)\n    3.  -H\n    4.  -CH=CH-... (the rest of the chain from C3)\n    Since C2 is attached to two identical methyl groups, it is **not** a chiral center.\n\n*   **C5:** The groups attached to C5 are:\n    1.  -H\n    2.  -OH\n    3.  -CH=CH-CH(CH3)2 (the chain towards C4)\n    4.  -CH(Cl)-CH=CH-CH(C2H5)2 (the chain towards C6)\n    All four groups are different. Thus, **C5 is a chiral center** (1).\n\n*   **C6:** The groups attached to C6 are:\n    1.  -H\n    2.  -Cl\n    3.  -CH(OH)-CH=CH-CH(CH3)2 (the chain towards C5)\n    4.  -CH=CH-CH(C2H5)2 (the chain towards C7)\n    All four groups are different. Thus, **C6 is a chiral center** (2).\n\n*   **C9:** The groups attached to C9 are:\n    1.  -CH=CH-... (the rest of the chain from C8)\n    2.  -CH2CH3 (the ethyl substituent)\n    3.  -H\n    4.  -CH2CH3 (the C10-C11 part of the main chain)\n    Since C9 is attached to two identical ethyl groups, it is **not** a chiral center.\n\nSo, there are 2 chiral centers (C5 and C6).\n\n**B) Geometric Isomerism at Double Bonds:** A double bond exhibits E/Z isomerism if each carbon of the double bond is attached to two different groups.\n\n*   **C3=C4 double bond:**\n    *   On C3: Attached to -H and a -CH(CH3)2 group. These are different.\n    *   On C4: Attached to -H and the rest of the molecule (-CH(OH)-...). These are different.\n    Therefore, the **C3=C4 double bond is a stereocenter** (3).\n\n*   **C7=C8 double bond:**\n    *   On C7: Attached to -H and the rest of the molecule (-CH(Cl)-...). These are different.\n    *   On C8: Attached to -H and a -CH(CH2CH3)2 group. These are different.\n    Therefore, the **C7=C8 double bond is a stereocenter** (4).\n\nSo, there are 2 double bonds that can show geometric isomerism.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of stereoisomers.**\n\nWe have a total of n stereocenters:\nn = (number of chiral centers) + (number of stereogenic double bonds)\nn = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nThe total number of possible stereoisomers is 2^n.\nTotal stereoisomers = 2^4 = 16.\n\nThe molecule is not symmetrical, so there is no possibility of meso compounds, which would reduce the total count. Therefore, all 16 calculated stereoisomers are unique.\n\nThe correct answer is 16.\n\n<<<C>>>"
