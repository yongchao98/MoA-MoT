    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This typically arises from the presence of a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups) and the absence of any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`. The double bond geometry is Z (cis), meaning the Cl and the ethyl group (-CH2CH3) are on the same side of the double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule contains a double bond. All atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2, H on C1, Cl on C1, C of methyl, C of ethyl) lie in the same plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the molecule (assuming free rotation of the ethyl group). There are no chiral centers in the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex tricyclic molecule. The name itself provides the crucial information.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The stereochemical descriptors `(3aR, 7aS)` indicate the presence of chiral centers with a specific absolute configuration. A name that specifies a single stereoisomer with `R` or `S` designations implies that the molecule is chiral and the name refers to one of its enantiomers. While some molecules with chiral centers can be achiral (meso compounds), this molecule's complex and unsymmetrical structure (due to the E-chloromethylene group, `=CHCl`, and the tricyclic core) makes it extremely unlikely to have a plane of symmetry or center of inversion. A specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral and therefore **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The `(2R, 3S)` designation indicates the stereochemistry. Let's analyze its symmetry. If you draw the molecule in a staggered conformation or a Fischer projection, you can identify a center of inversion (`i`) halfway along the C2-C3 bond. In an eclipsed conformation, a plane of symmetry (σ) becomes apparent. The presence of these symmetry elements means the molecule is achiral, despite having two chiral centers. This is a classic example of a meso compound.\n        ```\n          COOH\n          |\n      H --|-- CH3   (2R)\n          |\n    CH3 --|-- H     (3S)\n          |\n          COOH\n        (Center of inversion is present)\n        ```\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is a meso compound, which is achiral. It is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a diastereomer of the previous compound, `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH` with the `(2R,3R)` configuration.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** This stereoisomer lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` compound, which is non-superimposable. The `(2R,3R)` and `(2S,3S)` forms constitute a pair of enantiomers.\n        ```\n              COOH\n              |\n          H --|-- CH3   (2R)\n              |\n          H --|-- CH3   (3R)\n              |\n              COOH\n        (No internal symmetry elements)\n        ```\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral and therefore **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The carbon at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) the ring segment `-CH2-CH=` (path C2-C3), and 4) the ring segment `-CH2-CH2-` (path C6-C5). Since these four groups are different, C1 is a chiral center. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral and a specific enantiomer is given. It is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The `(1s,3s,5s)` notation implies that all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (the all-cis isomer).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** There are two possible stereoisomers for 1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol: the all-cis isomer and the cis,trans isomer (one -OH trans to the other two).\n        *   The all-cis isomer possesses a C3 rotational axis and three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry contains one C-OH bond and the CH2 group on the opposite side of the ring.\n        *   The cis,trans isomer (e.g., 1,3-cis, 5-trans) also possesses a plane of symmetry passing through the carbon atom of the trans-substituent (C5) and the CH2 group opposite to it (C2).\n        Since both possible stereoisomers of this compound have at least one plane of symmetry, they are all achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** The name indicates a butan-1-one parent chain, meaning a 4-carbon chain with a ketone at C1. The group at C1 is cyclopentyl, and there is a methyl group at C3. This leads to the structure: `Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** We need to search for any chiral centers.\n        *   The isobutyl group `–CH2–CH(CH3)2` has no chiral center (the carbon with two methyl groups is not chiral).\n        *   The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized and not a chiral center.\n        *   The cyclopentyl ring has a single, achiral substituent. The ring itself retains a plane of symmetry.\n        The entire molecule is symmetrical and has no chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive (achiral)\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>"
