    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Products**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is a substituted lactone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring containing an ester group (a δ-lactone or oxan-2-one). The stereocenter is at position 4, which bears an ethyl group.\n    *   Reaction 1 produces the (R)-enantiomer.\n    *   Reaction 2 produces the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The proposed starting materials are enantiomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". While the name is slightly ambiguous, the most chemically sensible structure for this name is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu`\n    *   This molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`).\n    *   It has a single stereocenter at carbon-3, the one bearing the ethyl group. This stereocenter is what determines if the starting material is (R) or (S). This C3 in the starting material will become the C4 in the lactone product.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reagents:** A + `LiBH₄` + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Chemoselectivity of LiBH₄:** Lithium borohydride is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. It will reduce the ester group `(-COOiBu)` to a primary alcohol `(-CH₂OH)`. The carboxylic acid group `(-COOH)` remains largely unaffected.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  The starting material `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu` is treated with `LiBH₄`.\n    2.  The ester group at C5 is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol. The intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization). The hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1 to form a stable six-membered ring.\n    4.  The final product is indeed 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n*   **Stereochemistry for Reaction 1:** We need to determine if the configuration at the stereocenter is retained or inverted. This depends on how the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change.\n    *   **At C3 of the Starting Material:** The substituents are -H, -CH₂CH₃ (Et), `-CH₂COOH` (Group 1), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (Group 2).\n        *   Comparing Group 1 and Group 2, the ester group (`-COOiBu`) has a higher priority than the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) because the oxygen is bonded to a carbon (in isobutyl) rather than a hydrogen. So, Priority: `-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂COOH` > `-CH₂CH₃` > `-H`.\n    *   **At C4 of the Product Lactone:** The substituents are -H, -Et, `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` (ring portion, from the original acid), and `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (ring portion, from the original ester).\n        *   Comparing the ring portions, the one containing the carbonyl group has higher priority. So, Priority: `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` > `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` > `-Et` > `-H`.\n    *   **Comparing Priorities:**\n        *   The group with the highest priority in the starting material (`-CH₂COOiBu`) becomes the group with the second-highest priority in the product (`-CH₂CH₂O-`).\n        *   The group with the second-highest priority in the starting material (`-CH₂COOH`) becomes the group with the highest priority in the product (`-CH₂C(=O)O-`).\n    *   Since the priorities of the top two groups are swapped, the stereochemical configuration is **inverted**. (R) becomes (S), and (S) becomes (R).\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material A must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reagents:** B + `BH₃` + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Chemoselectivity of BH₃:** Borane is a reducing agent that exhibits the opposite selectivity to `LiBH₄`. It selectively reduces carboxylic acids much faster than esters.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  The starting material `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu` is treated with `BH₃`.\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group at C1 is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol. The intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate: `HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (`iBuOH`) and forming the same six-membered lactone ring.\n    4.  The final product is also 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n*   **Stereochemistry for Reaction 2:** We analyze the priority changes again.\n    *   **Starting Material Priorities (same as before):** `-CH₂COOiBu` (P1) > `-CH₂COOH` (P2) > `-Et` (P3) > `-H` (P4).\n    *   **Product Lactone Priorities (same as before):** `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` (P'1) > `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (P'2) > `-Et` (P'3) > `-H` (P'4).\n    *   **Comparing Priorities:**\n        *   The group with the highest priority in the starting material (`-CH₂COOiBu`) becomes the group with the highest priority in the product (`-CH₂-C(=O)O-`). (P1 -> P'1)\n        *   The group with the second-highest priority in the starting material (`-CH₂COOH`) becomes the group with the second-highest priority in the product (`-CH₂-CH₂-O-`). (P2 -> P'2)\n    *   Since the relative priority order of the substituents does not change, the stereochemical configuration is **retained**. (R) remains (R), and (S) remains (S).\n*   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material B must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth reactions start with the same compound. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
