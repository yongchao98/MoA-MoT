    "The problem asks for the kinematically allowed decay channels of a boson $X$ with a mass of $M_X = 6$ GeV. The decay is governed by the interaction Lagrangian:\n$\\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\lambda_f \\bar{\\psi}_f (y)(\\upsilon + X(y))\\psi_f(y)$\n\nThis Lagrangian contains an interaction term between the boson $X$ and fermion-antifermion pairs ($f\\bar{f}$), which is given by:\n$\\mathcal{L}_{Xf\\bar{f}} = -\\lambda_f X(y) \\bar{\\psi}_f(y) \\psi_f(y)$\n\nThis interaction allows the boson $X$ to decay into any fermion-antifermion pair, $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$, as long as it is kinematically possible.\n\n**Kinematic Condition for Decay**\n\nFor a particle decay to be kinematically allowed, the mass of the decaying particle ($M_X$) must be greater than or equal to the sum of the masses of the decay products. In this case, the decay products are a fermion $f$ and its antifermion $\\bar{f}$. Since a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass ($m_f = m_{\\bar{f}}$), the condition is:\n\n$M_X \\geq m_f + m_{\\bar{f}} = 2m_f$\n\nGiven that the mass of the boson $X$ is $M_X = 6$ GeV, we need to find all fundamental fermions (leptons and quarks) whose mass $m_f$ satisfies:\n$6 \\text{ GeV} \\geq 2m_f$\nor\n$m_f \\leq 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**Fermion Masses and Kinematic Check**\n\nWe will now check this condition for all fundamental fermions using their approximate masses (values from the Particle Data Group, PDG).\n\n**Leptons:**\n*   **Electron ($e$)**: $m_e \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.000511 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    Since $m_e \\ll 3$ GeV, the decay $X \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$ is **allowed**.\n*   **Muon ($\\mu$)**: $m_\\mu \\approx 105.7 \\text{ MeV} = 0.1057 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    Since $m_\\mu < 3$ GeV, the decay $X \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ is **allowed**.\n*   **Tau ($\\tau$)**: $m_\\tau \\approx 1.777 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    Since $m_\\tau < 3$ GeV, the decay $X \\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ is **allowed**.\n\n**Quarks:**\n*   **Up quark ($u$)**: $m_u \\approx 2.2 \\text{ MeV} = 0.0022 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    Since $m_u \\ll 3$ GeV, the decay $X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}$ is **allowed**.\n*   **Down quark ($d$)**: $m_d \\approx 4.7 \\text{ MeV} = 0.0047 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    Since $m_d \\ll 3$ GeV, the decay $X \\rightarrow d\\bar{d}$ is **allowed**.\n*   **Strange quark ($s$)**: $m_s \\approx 95 \\text{ MeV} = 0.095 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    Since $m_s < 3$ GeV, the decay $X \\rightarrow s\\bar{s}$ is **allowed**.\n*   **Charm quark ($c$)**: $m_c \\approx 1.27 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    Since $m_c < 3$ GeV, the decay $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$ is **allowed**.\n*   **Bottom quark ($b$)**: $m_b \\approx 4.18 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    Since $m_b > 3$ GeV, the condition $2m_b \\leq 6$ GeV is not met ($8.36 \\text{ GeV} > 6 \\text{ GeV}$). Therefore, the decay $X \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ is **kinematically forbidden**.\n*   **Top quark ($t$)**: $m_t \\approx 173 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    Since $m_t \\gg 3$ GeV, the decay $X \\rightarrow t\\bar{t}$ is **kinematically forbidden**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe set of all kinematically allowed decay channels for the boson X at the lowest order consists of the pairs of all leptons and quarks with masses less than 3 GeV.\nThe allowed decays are:\n$X \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}, \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}, \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}, u\\bar{u}, d\\bar{d}, s\\bar{s}, c\\bar{c}$\n\nNow we compare this list with the given options:\nA) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ - Incorrect, contains forbidden $b\\bar{b}$ and misses allowed channels.\nB) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ - Incorrect, contains forbidden $b\\bar{b}$.\nC) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},t\\bar{t},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ - Incorrect, contains forbidden $t\\bar{t}$.\nD) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ - Correct, this list exactly matches our derived set of allowed decays.\n\n<<<D>>>"
