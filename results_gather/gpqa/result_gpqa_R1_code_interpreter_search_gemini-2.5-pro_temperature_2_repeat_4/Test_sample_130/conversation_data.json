    "*   **Step 1: Identify the reactants.**\n    *   The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid that forms an anhydride upon dehydration. This anhydride has specific NMR characteristics:\n        *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm. A single peak implies all protons are chemically equivalent. The chemical shift (7 ppm) is in the vinylic or aromatic region.\n        *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon).\n    *   This description perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. Maleic acid is a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. Upon dehydration, it forms a cyclic anhydride. Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry, making its two vinylic protons equivalent (hence one ¹H NMR peak) and its two vinylic carbons and two carbonyl carbons equivalent (hence two ¹³C NMR peaks). The chemical shifts provided are also characteristic of maleic anhydride. So, the dienophile is maleic anhydride.\n    *   The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system (C1=C2-C3=C4) and methyl groups attached to all four of these carbons. The fifth carbon (C5) is a methylene (CH₂) group.\n\n*   **Step 2: The Diels-Alder Reaction.**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a [4+2] cycloaddition, also known as a Diels-Alder reaction.\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The stereochemistry of the reaction is important. Two main products can be formed: the *endo* and the *exo* isomer.\n    *   The **Endo Rule** for Diels-Alder reactions states that the kinetic product (the one formed faster, usually the major product under non-reversible conditions) is the *endo* isomer. In the *endo* isomer, the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride part) are tucked underneath the newly formed cyclohexene ring.\n    *   The *exo* isomer, where the anhydride part points away from the ring system, is usually the thermodynamically more stable product but forms more slowly, making it the minor product.\n    *   Therefore, the **major product is the *endo* adduct**, and the **minor product is the *exo* adduct**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the structure of the products and their predicted ¹H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Both the *endo* and *exo* products have the same molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (Diene C₉H₁₄ + Dienophile C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃), which matches the problem statement.\n    *   Both products have a plane of symmetry that bisects the C=C bond, the anhydride oxygen, and the CH₂ bridge. This symmetry simplifies the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n    *   Let's predict the key proton signals based on the structure of the adduct:\n        *   **Vinyl methyls:** Two equivalent methyl groups are attached to the double bond of the product. They will appear as a single peak, integrating to 6H. Typical chemical shift for vinyl methyls is ~1.7-2.0 ppm. Let's assign this to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Bridgehead methyls:** Two equivalent methyl groups are on the bridgehead carbons. These are on saturated carbons and should be more shielded (upfield). They will appear as a single peak, integrating to 6H. Let's assign this to the **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n        *   **Anhydride protons:** The two protons on the carbons that were originally part of maleic anhydride are equivalent due to symmetry. They are adjacent to carbonyl groups in a strained ring system. Their chemical shift would be relatively downfield. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Bridge protons:** The two protons of the CH₂ bridge are diastereotopic (one is *syn* to the double bond, the other is *anti*). They should appear as two distinct signals, coupled to each other (i.e., two doublets). One of these is likely the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Use the NOESY information to distinguish between the major and minor products.**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product (*endo*)** and **absent in the minor product (*exo*)**. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n    *   **In the *endo* isomer (major product):** The anhydride ring is tucked *underneath* the bicyclic system. This brings the anhydride protons (the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) very close in space to the vinyl methyl groups (the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm) on the double bond above them. A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between these two groups.\n    *   **In the *exo* isomer (minor product):** The anhydride ring is pointing *away* from the bicyclic system. The anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) are now very far from the vinyl methyl groups (~1.7 ppm). No NOESY cross-peak is expected between them.\n    *   This observation perfectly matches the problem statement. The specific cross-peak that appears in the major (*endo*) product but not the minor (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons and the vinyl methyl protons.\n\n*   **Step 5: Match the protons to the options.**\n    *   The protons involved are:\n        *   The vinyl methyl groups: **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**\n        *   The anhydride protons: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n    *   These two resonances are connected by the unique cross-peak in the major product. This corresponds to option B.\n\nLet's check the other options for completeness:\n*   A) 6H singlet (~1 ppm, bridgehead Me) and 6H singlet (~1.7 ppm, vinyl Me): These groups are far apart in both isomers.\n*   C) 6H singlet (~1 ppm, bridgehead Me) and 1H doublet (~1.5 ppm, bridge H): Their distance is similar in both isomers.\n*   D) 1H doublet (~1.5 ppm, bridge H) and 2H singlet (~3.5 ppm, anhydride H): These are close in the *exo* (minor) product and far in the *endo* (major) product. This is the opposite of what is observed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
