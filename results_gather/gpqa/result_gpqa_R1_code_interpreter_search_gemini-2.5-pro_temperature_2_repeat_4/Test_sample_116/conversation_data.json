    "This question asks us to identify which of the given compounds can exhibit optical isomerism. Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are molecules that are non-superimposable on their mirror images. Let's analyze each compound for chirality.\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The two phenyl rings are joined by a single C-C bond.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** Biphenyl compounds can exhibit a type of stereoisomerism called **atropisomerism**. This happens when rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is significantly restricted, usually by bulky substituents in the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6').\n*   In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) at positions 2 and 2', and two nitro groups (-NO2) at positions 6 and 6'.\n*   The steric hindrance from these large groups prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond that connects them. This locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n*   This fixed, non-planar conformation lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. As a result, its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral due to atropisomerism and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule has the chemical formula CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. It is the methyl ester of lactic acid.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** We need to look for a chiral center. A chiral center is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one attached to the -OH group):\n    1.  It is bonded to a hydrogen atom (-H).\n    2.  It is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    3.  It is bonded to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    4.  It is bonded to a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃).\n*   Since this carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center (or stereocenter).\n*   **Conclusion:** Molecules containing a single chiral center are always chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism. It exists as a pair of enantiomers (R and S isomers).\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule has the chemical formula (C₆H₅)₂CO. It consists of a central carbonyl group (C=O) attached to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** To be chiral, a molecule must not be superimposable on its mirror image. This is often because it lacks any elements of symmetry like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n*   The benzophenone molecule is not planar in its lowest energy state due to steric interactions between the phenyl rings, but the barrier to rotation around the C-C bonds is very low, allowing for rapid interconversion between twisted conformations at room temperature.\n*   More importantly, the molecule can easily adopt a conformation that has a plane of symmetry. This plane would pass through the C=O bond and bisect the angle between the two phenyl rings. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes a molecule achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and therefore does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is H₃COOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** This molecule is planar. Let's check for elements of symmetry.\n*   It has a **plane of symmetry**, which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n*   It also has a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. If you start at any atom, go to the center, and continue the same distance in the opposite direction, you will find an identical atom.\n*   A molecule with a center of inversion is always achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. It is a geometric isomer (stereoisomer), but not an optical isomer.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Chiral (atropisomerism)\n*   Compound 2: Chiral (chiral center)\n*   Compound 3: Achiral (has a plane of symmetry)\n*   Compound 4: Achiral (has a center of inversion)\n\nTherefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
