    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Mass Dimension of the Lagrangian Density ($\\mathcal{L}$)\n\nIn natural units, where the speed of light $c$ and the reduced Planck constant $\\hbar$ are set to 1 ($c=\\hbar=1$), the action $S$ is dimensionless. The action is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ over four-dimensional spacetime:\n$S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L}$\n\nThe dimension of a spacetime coordinate $x^\\mu$ is length, which in natural units has a dimension of inverse mass, $[x] = M^{-1}$. Therefore, the four-volume element $d^4x$ has a mass dimension of:\n$[d^4x] = [x]^4 = (M^{-1})^4 = M^{-4}$\n\nFor the action $S$ to be dimensionless, $[S] = M^0$, the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension that cancels out the dimension of $d^4x$:\n$[\\mathcal{L}] [d^4x] = M^0 \\implies [\\mathcal{L}] M^{-4} = M^0 \\implies [\\mathcal{L}] = M^4$\n\nAny term added to the Lagrangian density must have this same mass dimension of $M^4$.\n\n### 2. Mass Dimension of the Fermion Field ($\\psi$)\n\nTo find the mass dimension of the fermion field $\\psi$, we look at its kinetic term in the standard Dirac Lagrangian, $\\mathcal{L}_{kinetic} = i\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu\\psi$. This term must have a mass dimension of $M^4$.\n\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{kinetic}] = [i\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu\\psi] = M^4$\n\nLet's break down the dimensions of the components:\n*   The imaginary unit $i$ is dimensionless.\n*   The gamma matrices $\\gamma^\\mu$ are dimensionless matrices.\n*   The partial derivative $\\partial_\\mu = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\mu}$ has the dimension of inverse length, which is mass: $[\\partial_\\mu] = M^1$.\n*   The fields $\\bar{\\psi}$ and $\\psi$ are assumed to have the same mass dimension: $[\\bar{\\psi}] = [\\psi]$.\n\nSo, the dimensional equation is:\n$[\\bar{\\psi}][\\psi][\\partial_\\mu] = M^4$\n$[\\psi]^2 M^1 = M^4$\n$[\\psi]^2 = M^3$\n$[\\psi] = M^{3/2}$\n\n### 3. Mass Dimension of the Field Strength Tensor ($F^{\\mu\\nu}$)\n\nTo find the mass dimension of the electromagnetic field strength tensor $F^{\\mu\\nu}$, we look at the kinetic term for the gauge field in the standard Maxwell Lagrangian, $\\mathcal{L}_{kinetic} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$. This term must also have a mass dimension of $M^4$.\n\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{kinetic}] = [F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^4$\n$[F^{\\mu\\nu}]^2 = M^4$\n$[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^2$\n\n### 4. Mass Dimension of $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$\n\nThe term $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ is defined as $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}=\\frac{i}{2}\\left[\\gamma_{\\mu},\\gamma_{\\nu}\\right]$. As established before, the gamma matrices $\\gamma_\\mu$ are dimensionless. Therefore, their commutator, and thus $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$, is also dimensionless.\n$[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] = M^0$\n\n### 5. Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant ($\\kappa$)\n\nNow we can analyze the given interaction Lagrangian:\n$\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$\n\nThe mass dimension of this term must be $M^4$:\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa][\\bar{\\psi}][\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}][\\psi][F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^4$\n\nSubstitute the dimensions we have found:\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot (M^{3/2}) \\cdot (M^0) \\cdot (M^{3/2}) \\cdot (M^2) = M^4$\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot M^{3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2} = M^4$\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot M^{3 + 2} = M^4$\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot M^5 = M^4$\n$[\\kappa] = \\frac{M^4}{M^5} = M^{-1}$\n\nThe mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ is -1.\n\n### 6. Renormalizability of the Theory\n\nThe renormalizability of a quantum field theory can be assessed by the mass dimension of its coupling constants (this is known as power-counting renormalizability):\n\n*   **Super-renormalizable**: All coupling constants have a positive mass dimension.\n*   **Renormalizable**: All coupling constants have a non-negative mass dimension (zero or positive). The ones with zero dimension are called marginal operators.\n*   **Non-renormalizable**: At least one coupling constant has a negative mass dimension. These are called irrelevant operators.\n\nIn this theory, the coupling constant $\\kappa$ has a mass dimension of $[\\kappa] = -1$, which is negative. Therefore, the theory is non-renormalizable. Non-renormalizable theories typically require an infinite number of counterterms to absorb the ultraviolet divergences that appear in loop calculations, making them lose predictive power at arbitrarily high energies.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
