    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the uncertainty in the measurement of the operator $P_z$, which is denoted by $\\Delta P_z$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Uncertainty:** The uncertainty of an operator A in a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by the formula:\n    $\\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2}$\n    where $\\langle A \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|A|\\psi\\rangle$ is the expectation value of A, and $\\langle A^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|A^2|\\psi\\rangle$ is the expectation value of $A^2$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula to $P_z$:** For our specific problem, the formula becomes:\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n\n4.  **Define the Given Quantities:**\n    *   The matrix for the operator $P_z$:\n        $P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The state of the system (as a column vector, or 'ket'):\n        $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   We also need the conjugate transpose of the state vector (the 'bra'):\n        $\\langle\\psi| = (|\\psi\\rangle)^\\dagger = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$ (Since all components are real, the conjugate transpose is just the transpose).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$:**\n    *   First, we apply the operator $P_z$ to the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar \\cdot (-1/2) + 0 + 0 \\\\ 0 + 0 + 0 \\\\ 0 + 0 + (-\\hbar) \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Next, we perform the inner product with $\\langle\\psi|$:\n        $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi| (P_z |\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        $\\langle P_z \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(\\hbar/2) = \\hbar/4 + 0 - \\hbar/4 = 0$\n    *   So, the expectation value of $P_z$ is 0.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$:**\n    *   First, we need to find the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$ by squaring the matrix $P_z$:\n        $P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Now, we calculate $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi| P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle$. First, apply $P_z^2$ to $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Next, we perform the inner product with $\\langle\\psi|$:\n        $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi| (P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) = \\hbar^2/4 + 0 + \\hbar^2/4 = 2\\hbar^2/4 = \\hbar^2/2$\n    *   So, the expectation value of $P_z^2$ is $\\hbar^2/2$.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$:**\n    *   Substitute the calculated values back into the uncertainty formula:\n        $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}}$\n    *   Simplify the expression:\n        $\\Delta P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** The result $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$ matches option C. I will confirm this with a python script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define h_bar as 1 for simplicity in calculation, and add it back at the end.\nh_bar = 1\n\n# Define the operator Pz\nPz = np.array([\n    [h_bar, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, -h_bar]\n])\n\n# Define the state vector psi\npsi = np.array([\n    [-1/2],\n    [1/np.sqrt(2)],\n    [-1/2]\n])\n\n# Calculate the conjugate transpose of psi\npsi_dagger = psi.conj().T\n\n# Calculate the expectation value of Pz: <Pz> = psi_dagger * Pz * psi\nexp_Pz = psi_dagger @ Pz @ psi\n# print(f\"Expectation value of Pz: {exp_Pz[0,0]}\")\n\n# Calculate the Pz^2 operator\nPz_squared = Pz @ Pz\n\n# Calculate the expectation value of Pz^2: <Pz^2> = psi_dagger * Pz^2 * psi\nexp_Pz_squared = psi_dagger @ Pz_squared @ psi\n# print(f\"Expectation value of Pz^2: {exp_Pz_squared[0,0]}\")\n\n# Calculate the uncertainty squared: (Delta Pz)^2 = <Pz^2> - <Pz>^2\nuncertainty_squared = exp_Pz_squared - (exp_Pz**2)\n\n# Calculate the uncertainty Delta Pz\nuncertainty = np.sqrt(uncertainty_squared[0,0])\n\n# The result needs to be multiplied by h_bar.\n# We get 1/sqrt(2) from the calculation.

    "The problem asks for the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$ for a system in a given state $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\n### 1. Definition of Uncertainty\n\nThe uncertainty of an operator $A$ in a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is defined by the standard deviation:\n$$ \\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2} $$\nwhere $\\langle A \\rangle$ is the expectation value of $A$, and $\\langle A^2 \\rangle$ is the expectation value of $A^2$.\n\nFor our problem, this becomes:\n$$ \\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} $$\n\n### 2. Given Information\n\nWe are given the matrix form of the operator $P_z$ and the state vector $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\nThe operator $P_z$ is:\n$$ P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThe state of the system is given as a column vector (ket):\n$$ |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nTo compute the expectation values, we will also need the conjugate transpose of $|\\psi\\rangle$, which is a row vector (bra), denoted by $\\langle\\psi|$. Since all the components are real numbers, the conjugate transpose is simply the transpose:\n$$ \\langle\\psi| = (|\\psi\\rangle)^\\dagger = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n### 3. Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$\n\nThe expectation value is calculated as $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi| P_z |\\psi\\rangle$.\n\nFirst, we apply the operator $P_z$ to the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$$ P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nNext, we multiply this result by the bra vector $\\langle\\psi|$:\n$$ \\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi| (P_z |\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\langle P_z \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(\\hbar/2) = \\frac{\\hbar}{4} + 0 - \\frac{\\hbar}{4} = 0 $$\nSo, the expectation value of $P_z$ is 0.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$\n\nFirst, we need the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$, which is found by squaring the matrix for $P_z$:\n$$ P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nNow, we calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi| P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle$.\nFirst, apply $P_z^2$ to $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$$ P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nNext, we multiply by the bra vector $\\langle\\psi|$:\n$$ \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi| (P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{2\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} $$\n\n### 5. Calculate the Uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$\n\nNow we can substitute our calculated expectation values into the uncertainty formula:\n$$ \\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} $$\n$$ \\Delta P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\n\nThis result corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
