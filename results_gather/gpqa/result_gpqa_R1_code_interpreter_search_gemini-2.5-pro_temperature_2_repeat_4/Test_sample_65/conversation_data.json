    "*   **1. Lorentz Symmetry & 2. Poincare Symmetry:** The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as a local, relativistic quantum field theory. A fundamental tenet of such theories is invariance under the Poincare group, which consists of spacetime translations, rotations, and boosts. Lorentz symmetry (rotations and boosts) is a subgroup of the Poincare group. Therefore, any valid operator in the SMEFT Lagrangian must be constructed to be a Lorentz scalar, ensuring the laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames. This means both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries must be respected.\n\n*   **3. CP Symmetry:** CP symmetry (Charge conjugation + Parity) is known to be violated in the Standard Model by the weak interaction (specifically, by a complex phase in the CKM matrix). SMEFT is an extension of the Standard Model that parameterizes potential new physics beyond the SM. One of the primary motivations for searching for new physics is to find new sources of CP violation (for example, to explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe). SMEFT operators can have complex coefficients that introduce new sources of CP violation. Therefore, CP symmetry is *not* a required symmetry for all operators in the SMEFT. Some operators might preserve it, but many are explicitly constructed to test for its violation.\n\n*   **4. CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a cornerstone of quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be symmetric under the combined transformation of Charge conjugation (C), Parity inversion (P), and Time reversal (T). Since the SMEFT is constructed to be a local and Lorentz-invariant QFT, it must respect CPT symmetry. Violating CPT would require a much more drastic modification of fundamental physics than what SMEFT describes.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not a required symmetry.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
