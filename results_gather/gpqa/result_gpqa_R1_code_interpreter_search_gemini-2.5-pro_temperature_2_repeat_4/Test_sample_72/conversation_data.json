    "This problem requires us to calculate two quantities in special relativity: the relative speed of two objects and the total energy of the system.\n\n**Part 1: Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nWe are given the velocities of the two astronauts as `v1 = 0.6c` and `v2 = 0.5c`, both in the same direction. We can't simply subtract the velocities (`0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c`) because that's a classical calculation. For relativistic speeds, we must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula.\n\nThe formula for relative velocity `v_rel` between two objects moving in the same direction with velocities `v1` and `v2` in a stationary frame is:\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nLet's plug in the given values:\n*   `v1 = 0.6c`\n*   `v2 = 0.5c`\n\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - (0.3 * c^2) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7`\n`v_rel ≈ 0.142857c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`.\n\n**Part 2: Total Energy (E)**\n\nThe total energy of a system is the sum of the total energies of its individual components. The total energy `E` of a single particle with rest mass `m0` moving at velocity `v` is given by `E = γ * m0 * c^2`, where `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is `1 / sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)`.\n\n**Energy of the first astronaut (E1):**\n*   Rest mass `m0_1 = 2m`\n*   Velocity `v1 = 0.6c`\n*   Lorentz factor `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n*   Energy `E1 = γ1 * m0_1 * c^2 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2 = 2.5 mc^2`\n\n**Energy of the second astronaut (E2):**\n*   Rest mass `m0_2 = 3m`\n*   Velocity `v2 = 0.5c`\n*   Lorentz factor `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547`\n*   Energy `E2 = γ2 * m0_2 * c^2 ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c^2 ≈ 3.464 mc^2`\n\n**Total Energy (E_total):**\n*   `E_total = E1 + E2`\n*   `E_total = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.464 mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy `E ≈ 5.96 mc^2`.\n\nLet's use a Python script to verify these calculations.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Constants\nm1_mass_factor = 2.0\nv1_speed_factor = 0.6\nm2_mass_factor = 3.0\nv2_speed_factor = 0.5\n\n# 1.

    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nThe problem asks for two quantities related to two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds:\na) Their relative speed (`v_rel`).\nb) The total energy (`E`) of the system.\n\n**Given information:**\n*   Astronaut 1: mass `m1 = 2m`, velocity `v1 = 0.6c`\n*   Astronaut 2: mass `m2 = 3m`, velocity `v2 = 0.5c`\n*   Both are traveling in the same direction (positive x-direction).\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n\n**2. Part A: Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nSince the velocities are relativistic, we cannot simply subtract them (i.e., `0.6c - 0.5c`). We must use the **relativistic velocity addition/subtraction formula**. The formula for the relative velocity `v_rel` of object 1 as seen from object 2's frame is:\n\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nLet's plug in the values:\n*   `v1 = 0.6c`\n*   `v2 = 0.5c`\n\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - (0.3 * c^2) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7`\n`v_rel ≈ 0.142857c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`.\n\n**3. Part B: Calculate the Total Energy (E)**\n\nThe total energy of a system is the sum of the total energies of its components. The total relativistic energy `E` of a single particle is given by the formula:\n\n`E = γ * m₀ * c²`\n\nwhere `m₀` is the rest mass and `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is:\n\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nWe need to calculate the energy for each astronaut and then add them together.\n\n**Energy of Astronaut 1 (E1):**\n*   Rest mass `m₀₁ = 2m`\n*   Velocity `v₁ = 0.6c`\n*   Calculate `γ₁`:\n    `γ₁ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n*   Calculate `E₁`:\n    `E₁ = γ₁ * m₀₁ * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²`\n\n**Energy of Astronaut 2 (E2):**\n*   Rest mass `m₀₂ = 3m`\n*   Velocity `v₂ = 0.5c`\n*   Calculate `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547`\n*   Calculate `E₂`:\n    `E₂ = γ₂ * m₀₂ * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.4641 mc²`\n\n**Total System Energy (E_total):**\n*   `E_total = E₁ + E₂`\n*   `E_total = 2.5 mc² + 3.4641 mc² = 5.9641 mc²`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, `E_total ≈ 5.96 mc²`.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`\n*   `E ≈ 5.96 mc²`\n\nThese values match the ones provided in the Python code output.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc²\nB) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc²\nC) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\nD) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
