    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System and the Problem:**\n    The problem asks for the net potential energy of a system composed of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The charge `q` is located at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere, where `d > R`. A \"grounded\" sphere has a constant potential of zero (V=0).\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:**\n    To solve this electrostatics problem, we use the method of images. This technique allows us to replace the complex induced charge distribution on the surface of the conducting sphere with a single, strategically placed \"image charge\" inside the sphere. The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere are the same in both the original problem and the simplified image-charge problem.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b):**\n    For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` must be placed such that the potential at the surface of the sphere (at radius R) is zero. The established results for this configuration are:\n    *   The position of the image charge, `b`, from the center along the line connecting the center and `q`, is `b = R^2 / d`.\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -q * (R/d)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the sphere. As the charge `q` is brought in, the sphere remains grounded, and an induced charge builds up on its surface. The force on `q` is due to this induced charge.\n\n    Using the method of images, the force on `q` is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`. However, it's crucial to realize that as `q` moves from infinity to `d`, the image charge `q'` also changes its magnitude and position. Therefore, we must integrate the force over the path.\n\n    Let's consider an intermediate position `x` for the charge `q` (`x > R`). At this point:\n    *   The image charge is `q'(x) = -qR/x`.\n    *   Its position is `b(x) = R^2/x`.\n    *   The distance between `q` at `x` and `q'(x)` at `b(x)` is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n\n    The force on charge `q` at position `x` is the attractive Coulomb force from the image charge:\n    `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n    `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R / (x * (x^2 - R^2)^2 / x^2) = - (k * q^2 * R * x) / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\n    The potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to `d`. This is the negative of the work done by the electric field:\n    `U = - W_field = - ∫[from ∞ to d] F(x) dx`\n    `U = - ∫[from ∞ to d] [- (k * q^2 * R * x) / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R) ∫[from ∞ to d] x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\n\n    To solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, which gives `du = 2x dx`, or `x dx = du/2`. The limits of integration become:\n    *   When `x → ∞`, `u → ∞`.\n    *   When `x = d`, `u = d^2 - R^2`.\n\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R) ∫[from ∞ to d^2-R^2] (1/u^2) (du/2)`\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-1/u] |_[from ∞ to d^2-R^2]`\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [ -1/(d^2 - R^2) - (-1/∞) ]`\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [ -1/(d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * (k * q^2 * R) / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated potential energy `U = - (1/2) * k*q^2*R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
