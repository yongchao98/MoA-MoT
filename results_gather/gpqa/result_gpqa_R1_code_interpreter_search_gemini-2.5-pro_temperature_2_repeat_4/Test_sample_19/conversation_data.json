    "This question asks for the set of assumptions that collectively define the \"impulse approximation\" in the context of many-body nuclear physics. The impulse approximation simplifies a complex interaction with a nucleus by treating it as an interaction with a single, quasi-free nucleon. Let's analyze each statement to see how it contributes to this approximation.\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"** This is a foundational assumption. The complex many-body interaction operator is replaced by a sum of one-body operators, each acting on a single nucleon. This ignores contributions from multi-nucleon currents (like meson-exchange currents), reducing the problem from a true many-body interaction to an incoherent sum of single-nucleon interactions. This is a core component of the impulse approximation.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"** This assumption deals with what happens *after* the initial interaction. It states that the scattered probe and the ejected nucleon leave the nucleus without any further interactions (Final State Interactions or FSI). If these interactions occurred, the measured final state would not be representative of the initial quasi-free collision. Neglecting FSI is crucial for the simplest form of the impulse approximation, often called the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA), as it allows the outgoing particles to be described by simple plane waves, just like in a free-particle collision.\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"** This assumption concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself, describing it as a composite of quarks. The impulse approximation, however, operates at the level of nucleons as the fundamental degrees of freedom. It approximates the behavior of a *nucleon within a nucleus*, not the behavior of *quarks within a nucleon*. Whether the quarks are relativistic or not is a separate modeling question related to nucleon form factors, but it is not a prerequisite for the impulse approximation itself. Therefore, this statement is not part of the standard set of assumptions for the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"** This is the very heart of the \"impulse\" concept. The approximation assumes that the interaction happens over an extremely short time. During this brief instant, the energy and momentum transferred by the probe are so large compared to the nucleon's binding energy and the forces from neighboring nucleons that the binding potential can be momentarily ignored. The nucleon is treated as a free particle, only constrained by its initial momentum distribution within the nucleus.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nTo treat the interaction as occurring on a single, free nucleon, one must assume:\n*   The interaction singles out one nucleon (Assumption 1).\n*   During the brief interaction, this nucleon does not feel the binding forces from its neighbors (Assumption 4).\n*   To analyze the outcome simply, the products of the interaction must escape the nucleus without further scattering (Assumption 2).\n\nTherefore, the assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
