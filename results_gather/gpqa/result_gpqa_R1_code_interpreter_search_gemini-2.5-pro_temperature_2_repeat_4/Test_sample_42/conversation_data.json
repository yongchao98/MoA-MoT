    "This problem requires a systematic approach to IUPAC nomenclature. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n### 1. Identify Substituents and the Parent Ring\n*   **Parent Ring**: Benzene\n*   **Functional Groups/Substituents**:\n    *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n    *   Carbaldehyde (-CHO), named as a 'formyl' prefix.\n    *   Cyano (-CN), named as a 'cyano' prefix.\n    *   Hydroxyl (-OH), named as a 'hydroxy' prefix.\n    *   Dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n    *   Methoxy (-OCH₃)\n\n### 2. Determine the Principal Functional Group\nAccording to IUPAC priority rules, the functional groups are ranked as follows:\nCarboxylic acid > Nitrile > Aldehyde > Alcohol > Amine > Ether.\nTherefore, the **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is the principal functional group. This makes the parent molecule a **benzoic acid**.\n\n### 3. Draw the Structure and Number the Ring\n\n1.  **Assign C1**: The carbon atom attached to the principal group (-COOH) is designated as C1.\n\n2.  **Place the other groups based on the description**:\n    *   \"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\": Methoxy (-OCH₃) is at C4.\n    *   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\": The -OH and -N(CH₃)₂ groups are at C2 and C6.\n    *   \"a carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another\": Since -COOH is at C1, the -CHO and -CN groups must be at C3 and C5.\n\n3.  **Use the final clue to fix the positions**:\n    *   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile\".\n    *   The methoxy group (-OCH₃) is at C4.\n    *   The nitrile group (-CN) must be at C3 or C5.\n    *   If the -CN group were at C5, its ortho positions would be C4 and C6.\n    *   If the -CN group were at C3, its ortho positions would be C2 and C4.\n    *   The description states that both the methoxy (-OCH₃ at C4) and the alcohol/hydroxyl (-OH) are ortho to the nitrile. This is only possible if the **nitrile (-CN) is at C3**, which puts the **hydroxyl (-OH) at C2**.\n\n4.  **Finalize the Structure**:\n    *   **C1**: -COOH\n    *   **C2**: -OH (ortho to -COOH and ortho to -CN)\n    *   **C3**: -CN (meta to -COOH and ortho to -OCH₃ and -OH)\n    *   **C4**: -OCH₃ (para to -COOH and ortho to -CN)\n    *   **C5**: This leaves the remaining meta position for the carbaldehyde (-CHO).\n    *   **C6**: This leaves the remaining ortho position for the dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂) group.\n\n    The structure is:\n    *   C1: -COOH (Carboxylic acid)\n    *   C2: -OH (Hydroxy)\n    *   C3: -CN (Cyano)\n    *   C4: -OCH₃ (Methoxy)\n    *   C5: -CHO (Formyl)\n    *   C6: -N(CH₃)₂ (Dimethylamino)\n\n    This structure and numbering scheme satisfies all the conditions described in the question.\n\n### 4. Assemble the IUPAC Name\n\n1.  **Alphabetize the prefixes**: The prefixes must be listed in alphabetical order, not numerical order.\n    *   **c**yano\n    *   **d**imethylamino\n    *   **f**ormyl\n    *   **h**ydroxy\n    *   **m**ethoxy\n\n2.  **Combine prefixes with their locants and the parent name**:\n    *   **3-cyano-**\n    *   **6-(dimethylamino)-** (parentheses are often used for complex substituents)\n    *   **5-formyl-**\n    *   **2-hydroxy-**\n    *   **4-methoxy**\n    *   **benzoic acid**\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 5. Compare with the Options\n*   **A) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid** - This exactly matches our derived name.\n*   B) This option uses incorrect numbering.\n*   C) This option incorrectly orders the substituents numerically instead of alphabetically.\n*   D) This option uses incorrect locants.\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
