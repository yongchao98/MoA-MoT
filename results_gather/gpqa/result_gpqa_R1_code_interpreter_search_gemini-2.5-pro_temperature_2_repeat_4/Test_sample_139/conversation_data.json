    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 6: The nature of substance B.**\n    *   \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"\n    *   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   This temperature is significantly different from the melting point of normal water (H₂O), which is 0 °C. However, it is almost identical to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O or ²H₂O), which is 3.82 °C.\n    *   Therefore, we can confidently identify **B as D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 3: The nature of gas W.**\n    *   \"a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n    *   Since the system clearly involves deuterium (from the identification of D₂O), let's examine hydrogen and its isotopes as components of the gas.\n    *   H₂ (Protium): Each ¹H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. H₂ molecule has 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Does not fit)\n    *   HD (Protium-Deuterium): ¹H has (1p, 0n), ²H has (1p, 1n). HD molecule has 2 protons, 1 neutron. (Does not fit)\n    *   D₂ (Deuterium): Each ²H has 1 proton, 1 neutron. D₂ molecule has **2 protons, 2 neutrons**. (This fits the condition).\n    *   While other gases like ¹⁴N₂ (14p, 14n) or ¹²C¹⁶O (14p, 14n) also fit this numerical criterion, the presence of D₂O elsewhere in the reaction system makes D₂ the most chemically consistent candidate for gas W.\n    *   So, we identify **W as D₂ (di-deuterium gas)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Identify G, X, and Y.**\n    *   The reaction is: Substance X + Liquid Y → Gas W (D₂) + Precipitate G.\n    *   Also, heating G releases B (D₂O). This means G is likely a deuterated metal hydroxide, which upon heating decomposes into a metal oxide and D₂O. For example, 2M(OD)₃ → M₂O₃ + 3D₂O. The fact that a precipitate forms suggests a metal hydroxide that is insoluble, such as Al(OH)₃ or Mg(OH)₂.\n    *   Let's consider **G = Al(OD)₃** (aluminum deuteroxide), as Al(OH)₃ is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. Heating it would give: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This is consistent.\n    *   Now, we can assemble the reaction: X must contain Al and D. The reaction produces D₂ gas and a precipitate of Al(OD)₃ after reacting with liquid Y. To provide the oxygen and the extra deuterium for the products, Y must be D₂O.\n    *   The full reaction is: X + D₂O → D₂ + Al(OD)₃ + [soluble byproduct].\n    *   Let's look at Clue 8: \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a famous, powerful reducing agent. Its \"close analog\" incorporating a \"heavier isotope\" (Clue 1) is **Lithium aluminum deuteride, LiAlD₄**.\n    *   Let's test if X = LiAlD₄ fits the reaction:\n        **LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → 4D₂ (W) + Al(OD)₃ (G) + LiOD**\n    *   This is a known violent reaction. All components match our deductions:\n        *   X = LiAlD₄ (contains heavier isotope D).\n        *   Y = D₂O (liquid).\n        *   W = D₂ (gas with equal protons and neutrons).\n        *   G = Al(OD)₃ (precipitate). Heating gives D₂O.\n        *   B = D₂O.\n\n4.  **Verify with the Final Clue (Clue 7).**\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   A keto acid has a ketone group (-C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   X (LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent. It will reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol (-CD(OH)-) and the carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol (-CD₂OH).\n    *   R-C(=O)-R'-COOH + LiAlD₄ (followed by workup) → R-CD(OH)-R'-CD₂OH.\n    *   The final product is a diol, which contains exactly **2 oxygen atoms**. This clue is satisfied.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer.**\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements in X are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   Their atomic numbers are: H (Z=1), Li (Z=3), Al (Z=13).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (present as D).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present\". This means we sum the mass numbers of all atoms of these two elements in one molecule of X.\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are **4** atoms of Deuterium (²H). The mass number of D is 2.\n        Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is **1** atom of Aluminum. The most stable and common isotope is ²⁷Al. The mass number is 27.\n        Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative (total) mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
