    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the identity of compound E and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:**\n    *   **Reaction 1:** `A(s) + 8B(g) -> C(bright red)`. This suggests a reaction with a very high stoichiometry, possibly leading to a high coordination number. `A` is a solid.\n    *   **Reaction 3:** `C + H₂O -> A(s) + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)`. This is the most crucial clue. The starting reactant `A` is reformed upon hydrolysis of `C`. This is rare. Also, two different acids are formed, one strong and one weak. This gives a strong hint about the elemental composition of `C`.\n    *   **Reaction 4:** `D(g) + B(g) -> H(solvent)`. A 1:1 reaction between two gases to form a solvent.\n    *   **Reaction 2:** `C + 2D(g) -> E(extremely hazardous)`. The final product `E` is noted for being very hazardous.\n    *   **The Goal:** Find the molecular symmetry group of `E`. The options are C₂, C₂ᵥ, D∞h, D₄h.\n\n2.  **Deduce the Compounds from Reaction 3:**\n    *   The reformation of `A(s)` from hydrolysis is a key feature. It suggests `C` might be an adduct or a compound that undergoes disproportionation. A simple hydrolysis `MX + H₂O -> MOH + HX` would not reform the metal `M`.\n    *   The formation of a strong acid (`F`) and a weak acid (`G`) from a single compound (`C`, which is formed from `A` and `B`) points towards the hydrolysis of an interhalogen compound.\n    *   Let's test this hypothesis. Consider the hydrolysis of **Bromine pentafluoride (BrF₅)**:\n        `BrF₅ + 3H₂O → HBrO₃ + 5HF`\n    *   Here, Bromic acid (`HBrO₃`) is a **strong acid (F)**, and Hydrofluoric acid (`HF`) is a **weak acid (G)**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   This implies that the species being hydrolyzed (which must come from `C`) is `BrF₅`. If this is true, then `B` could be `BrF₅`.\n    *   If `B` is `BrF₅`, how is `A(s)` reformed? Let's assume `C` is an adduct of `A` with `B`. Let `A` be Iodine, `I₂(s)`, which is a solid. Then `C` could be an adduct like `I₂(BrF₅)₈`. Upon contact with water, the iodine guest `I₂` would be released (reforming `A(s)`), and the host `BrF₅` molecules would hydrolyze as described above.\n\n3.  **Construct a Working Hypothesis:**\n    *   **A = I₂** (Iodine, a solid).\n    *   **B = BrF₅** (Bromine pentafluoride, a gas above 41.3 °C).\n    *   **C = I₂(BrF₅)₈** (A hypothetical adduct that is assumed to be \"bright red\"). This fits `A + 8B -> C`.\n    *   **F = HBrO₃** (strong acid), **G = HF** (weak acid).\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Remaining Reactions:**\n    *   While the hypothesis above provides a consistent explanation for reactions 1 and 3, identifying D, H, and E definitively proves difficult due to the hypothetical nature of C and the potential for multiple side reactions. Such puzzles are often constructed around a well-known final product `E`.\n\n5.  **Identify E and its Symmetry:**\n    *   The problem likely hinges on identifying the \"extremely hazardous\" product `E` from a limited list of plausible molecules whose symmetries match the options. The options for the point group are C₂, C₂ᵥ, D∞h, and D₄h.\n    *   Given the context of fluorine and interhalogen chemistry, we should look for hazardous molecules in this family.\n        *   **XeF₂**: Hazardous fluorinating agent. Structure is linear, point group **D∞h**.\n        *   **O₂F₂ (\"FOOF\")**: Extremely hazardous and explosive. Structure is bent/chiral, point group **C₂**.\n        *   **ClF₃**: Extremely hazardous. Structure is T-shaped, point group **C₂ᵥ**.\n        *   **XeF₄**: Hazardous fluorinating agent. Structure is **square planar**, with a point group of **D₄h**.\n    *   Of these candidates, **Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄)** is a classic example in inorganic chemistry courses for its square planar geometry (D₄h symmetry), a direct consequence of the VSEPR theory applied to a noble gas compound. Its synthesis and reactivity are hallmarks of the field of noble gas chemistry, which aligns with the \"unusual reactions\" theme of the puzzle. The problem is likely constructed to lead to this canonical example of D₄h symmetry.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the analysis, while a full, unambiguous deduction of all compounds (A-H) is challenging due to the puzzle-like nature of the question, the context strongly points towards fluorine/noble gas chemistry. Among the possible hazardous products `E`, `XeF₄` is the most prominent example with one of the listed symmetries, **D₄h**.\n\n```python\nimport chempy\nfrom chempy.util import periodic\nimport re\n\ndef get_point_group_name(mol_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function is a placeholder for a real point group determination logic.\n    For this problem, we will hardcode the answers for a few key molecules\n    based on established chemical knowledge.\n    \"\"\"\n    known_point_groups = {\n        'XeF4': 'D4h',\n        'XeF2': 'D∞h',\n        'O2F2': 'C2',\n        'ClF3': 'C2v',\n        'COCl2': 'C2v',\n        'OsO4': 'Td'\n    }\n    return known_point_groups.get(mol_name, \"Unknown\")\n\n# The puzzle involves highly reactive and hazardous materials.
