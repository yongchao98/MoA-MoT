    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. This broad peak typically overlaps with the C-H stretching absorptions.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four possible structures are carboxylic acids, so this information is consistent with all options but does not distinguish between them.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   **\"No vinyl-hydrogens\"**: This confirms the absence of C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated molecules, consistent with this information.\n    *   **Key Information**: The spectrum contains two particularly complex and revealing signals: a \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" (dtq) and a \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" (dtt). These multiplicities arise from a proton's signal being split by neighboring, non-equivalent protons. The N+1 rule applies for each group of equivalent neighboring protons.\n        *   A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: a single proton (1H, gives a doublet), a group of two equivalent protons (2H, gives a triplet), and a group of three equivalent protons (3H, gives a quartet).\n        *   A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: a single proton (1H, gives a doublet), a group of two equivalent protons (2H, gives a triplet), and another distinct group of two equivalent protons (2H, gives another triplet).\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Potential Structure against the NMR Data:**\n    Let's analyze the expected splitting patterns for the protons in each molecule. We will focus on the most complex signals, which come from the CH (methine) protons on the carbon backbone. Note that in molecules with chiral centers, adjacent CH₂ protons are often diastereotopic (non-equivalent), which can complicate splitting patterns (e.g., turning an expected triplet into a doublet of doublets). However, the given names (`dtq`, `dtt`) suggest that we can, at a first-order approximation, treat these as equivalent protons for splitting purposes, or that there is \"accidental equivalence\" where the coupling constants are very similar.\n\n    Let's write out the structures assuming linear depiction and standard IUPAC naming conventions:\n\n    *   **A) `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH` -> 3,4-Dimethylpentanoic acid:**\n        `CH₃(5)-CH(4)(Me)-CH(3)(Me)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n        *   Proton at C3: Coupled to H at C4 (1H, doublet) and the two protons at C2 (2H, triplet). Expected signal: `dt`.\n        *   Proton at C4: Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet) and the three protons at C5 (3H, quartet). Expected signal: `dq`.\n        *   This molecule does not produce a `dtt` or `dtq`.\n\n    *   **B) `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH` -> 3,4-Diethylpentanoic acid:**\n        `CH₃(5)-CH(4)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n        *   Proton at C3: Coupled to protons at C2 (2H, `t`), proton at C4 (1H, `d`), and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, `t`). Expected signal: `tdt`.\n        *   Proton at C4: Coupled to proton at C3 (1H, `d`), protons at C5 (3H, `q`), and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, `t`). Expected signal: `dqt` (doublet of quartets of triplets). This is close to `dtq`, just different order.\n        *   This molecule does not produce a `dtt`. It has a `tdt` and a `dqt`.\n\n    *   **C) `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH` -> 2,3-Dimethylpentanoic acid:**\n        `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(Me)-CH(2)(Me)-COOH(1)`\n        *   Proton at C2: Coupled only to H at C3 (1H, doublet). Expected signal: `d`.\n        *   Proton at C3: Coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet) and the two protons at C4 (2H, triplet). Expected signal: `dt`.\n        *   This molecule does not produce a `dtt` or `dtq`.\n\n    *   **D) `CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH` -> 2,3-Diethylpentanoic acid:**\n        `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(2)(Et)-COOH(1)`\n        *   Let's analyze the proton at **C3**. It is adjacent to three different carbons bearing protons:\n            1.  C2, which has one proton (H at C2). This will split the C3-proton signal into a **doublet**.\n            2.  C4, which has two protons (the CH₂ group). These will split the C3-proton signal into a **triplet**.\n            3.  The first carbon of the ethyl group attached to C3, which is also a CH₂ group with two protons. These will also split the C3-proton signal into a **triplet**.\n        *   Therefore, the signal for the proton at C3 is expected to be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This is a perfect match for one of the signals described in the problem.\n        *   Now let's look for the **`dtq`** signal. While there isn't a proton with the exact neighboring environment (adjacent to 1H, 2H, and 3H groups) to produce a simple `dtq`, let's examine the protons in one of the diastereotopic CH₂ groups. For instance, the CH₂ protons at C4. They are adjacent to the CH proton at C3 and the CH₃ protons at C5. Due to being next to a chiral center (C3) and having geminal coupling to each other, their signal would be a **doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq)**. A `ddq` is a complex multiplet that can, under certain conditions or lower resolution, be mistaken for or reported as a `dtq`. Given the definitive and rare `dtt` signal is perfectly explained by this structure, it is the most plausible candidate. No other option can account for the `dtt` signal.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The structure of 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid (D) is the only one that can produce a `dtt` signal for the proton on C3. This provides extremely strong evidence for its identity. The other signal, `dtq`, is likely a slightly simplified description of one of the `ddq` signals present in the molecule.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH.\n\n<<<D>>>"
