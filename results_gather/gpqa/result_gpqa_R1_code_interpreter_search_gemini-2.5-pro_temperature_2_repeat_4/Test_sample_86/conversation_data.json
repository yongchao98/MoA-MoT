    "*   **Step 1: Deconstruct the information provided in the question.**\n    1.  **Molecular Formula information:** The compound has a total of 8 carbon atoms. It is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The aromatic ring itself (benzene) accounts for 6 carbon atoms (C6). Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms (8 total C - 6 ring C = 2 C).\n    2.  **Functional Group information (from FTIR):**\n        *   A peak indicates a carbonyl group (C=O).\n        *   A peak indicates an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X, where X is a halogen like F, Cl, Br, or I).\n    3.  **Structural deductions:**\n        *   We have a benzene ring with two groups attached (di-substituted).\n        *   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X) directly attached to the ring.\n        *   The other substituent must contain the remaining atoms: 2 carbons and 1 oxygen, including a C=O group. The most plausible and common group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n\n*   **Step 2: Propose the most likely structure.**\n    *   Combining the deductions from Step 1, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The molecular structure consists of a benzene ring substituted with one halogen atom and one acetyl group.\n    *   The molecular formula is C8H7XO. This fits all the initial criteria.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the 1H NMR spectral features based on the proposed structure.**\n    *   The structure is a di-substituted benzene ring. This means there are 4 protons on the aromatic ring. The substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para) will determine the splitting pattern of these protons.\n    *   Let's examine the patterns in the options provided, specifically in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n        *   Options B and C show a pattern of `(2H, d)` and `(2H, d)`. This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The symmetry of the para isomer results in only two distinct types of aromatic protons, which split each other into doublets.\n    *   So, we can refine our proposed structure to be a **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Predict the complete 1H NMR spectrum for para-haloacetophenone and compare it with the given options.**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are two sets of equivalent protons.\n        1.  The two protons ortho (adjacent) to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group (-COCH3). These will be deshielded and appear further downfield.\n        2.  The two protons ortho to the halogen atom (-X).\n        *   These two sets split each other, giving two doublets. The integration will be 2H for each doublet. Their chemical shift will be in the range of ~7.5-8.0 ppm.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There is one methyl group (-CH3) from the acetyl substituent.\n        *   These three protons are equivalent.\n        *   They are attached to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons on it, so they will appear as a **singlet** (no splitting).\n        *   The integration will be 3H.\n        *   The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone (Ar-CO-CH3) is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** ~7.5-8.0 ppm (4H total, split into two doublets of 2H each) and ~2.1-2.6 ppm (3H, singlet).\n\n*   **Step 5: Match the predicted spectrum with the options.**\n    *   A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)\n        *   Incorrect. The chemical shifts are not in the aromatic region.\n    *   B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)\n        *   Incorrect. The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde, not a ketone. This would correspond to a different structure, and the multiplicities are inconsistent for that structure anyway.\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **This is a perfect match.** It shows the two doublets for the 4 aromatic protons of a para-substituted ring (`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`) and the singlet for the 3 methyl protons of the acetyl group at a characteristic chemical shift (`2.3 (3H, s)`).\n    *   D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)\n        *   Incorrect. The aromatic region is wrong (only 1H), and the other signals do not match.\n\n<<<C>>>"
