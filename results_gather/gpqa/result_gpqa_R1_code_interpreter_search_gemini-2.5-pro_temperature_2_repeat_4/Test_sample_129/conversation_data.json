    "The user wants to find the minimum redshift (z) at which the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) absorption line from a background quasar can be detected by a ground-based optical telescope.\n\n1.  **Identify the Rest Wavelength:** The Lyman-alpha transition of neutral hydrogen has a rest wavelength (λ_rest) of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å). This is in the far-ultraviolet (FUV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n2.  **Consider the Constraint of Ground-Based Telescopes:** Ground-based telescopes observe through the Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere is opaque to most wavelengths outside the \"optical window\" and the \"radio window\". Specifically, ozone (O₃) in the upper atmosphere absorbs most of the incoming ultraviolet radiation. The atmosphere starts becoming transparent to light at a wavelength of around 3500 Å (350 nm). This is the atmospheric cutoff at the blue/UV end of the optical spectrum. Therefore, to be detected from the ground, the Lyα line must be redshifted to a wavelength (λ_obs) greater than this cutoff.\n\n3.  **Use the Redshift Formula:** The relationship between the observed wavelength (λ_obs), the rest wavelength (λ_rest), and the redshift (z) is given by:\n    λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z)\n\n4.  **Set up the Inequality:** For the Lyα line to be detectable, its observed wavelength must be greater than the atmospheric cutoff wavelength (λ_cutoff):\n    λ_obs > λ_cutoff\n    Substituting the redshift formula:\n    λ_rest * (1 + z) > λ_cutoff\n\n5.  **Solve for the Minimum Redshift (z):**\n    We need to find the lower limit for z.\n    (1 + z) > λ_cutoff / λ_rest\n    z > (λ_cutoff / λ_rest) - 1\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   λ_rest = 1216 Å\n    *   λ_cutoff ≈ 3500 Å (a standard estimate for the atmospheric cutoff)\n\nI will now use a Python script to calculate the precise value for this lower limit.\n```python\n# Define the rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line in Angstroms.\nlambda_rest = 1216\n\n# Define the atmospheric cutoff wavelength in Angstroms for ground-based optical telescopes.\n# This is the approximate lower limit of the optical window.\nlambda_cutoff = 3500\n\n# Calculate the minimum redshift using the formula: z > (lambda_obs / lambda_rest) - 1\n# We set lambda_obs = lambda_cutoff to find the lower limit.\nz_min = (lambda_cutoff / lambda_rest) - 1\n\nprint(z_min)\n```\nThe calculation yields a minimum redshift of approximately 1.878.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) 3\n    *   B) 1.2\n    *   C) 1.9\n    *   D) 2.4\n\nThe calculated value of z ≈ 1.88 is closest to 1.9. Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift for these objects to be detected with optical ground-based telescopes is approximately 1.9.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the minimum redshift (the lower limit) required to observe the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) spectral line from deep space using a ground-based optical telescope.\n\n**1. Identify the key wavelengths:**\n*   **Rest wavelength of Lyman-alpha (λ_rest):** This is the wavelength of the Lyα transition of neutral hydrogen in its rest frame. This is a fundamental physical constant, equal to approximately 1216 Å (Angstroms). This wavelength falls in the far-ultraviolet (FUV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n*   **Observational limit for ground-based telescopes (λ_cutoff):** Ground-based telescopes are limited by the Earth's atmosphere, which is opaque to most ultraviolet radiation, primarily due to ozone (O₃). The atmosphere begins to become transparent at the blue end of the optical window, around 3500 Å. Therefore, any light to be detected from the ground must have a wavelength longer than this cutoff.\n\n**2. Apply the cosmological redshift formula:**\nThe redshift (z) relates the rest wavelength of emitted light (λ_rest) to the wavelength we observe (λ_obs) with the following formula:\nλ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z)\n\n**3. Determine the condition for detection:**\nFor the Lyα line to be detected by a ground-based optical telescope, its observed wavelength (λ_obs) must be greater than the atmospheric cutoff wavelength (λ_cutoff).\nλ_obs > λ_cutoff\n\nTo find the lower limit on the redshift, we set the observed wavelength equal to the cutoff wavelength:\nλ_rest * (1 + z_min) = λ_cutoff\n\n**4. Solve for the minimum redshift (z_min):**\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for z_min:\n1 + z_min = λ_cutoff / λ_rest\nz_min = (λ_cutoff / λ_rest) - 1\n\n**5. Calculation:**\nUsing the values identified in step 1:\n*   λ_rest = 1216 Å\n*   λ_cutoff ≈ 3500 Å\n\nz_min = (3500 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\nz_min ≈ 2.878 - 1\nz_min ≈ 1.878\n\nThe calculated minimum redshift is approximately 1.88.\n\n**6. Compare with the given options:**\n*   A) 3\n*   B) 1.2\n*   C) 1.9\n*   D) 2.4\n\nThe calculated value of ~1.88 is closest to 1.9. Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift for these objects is approximately 1.9.\n\n<<<C>>>"
