    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of an O-H stretching vibration. The significant broadness is caused by strong hydrogen bonding, which is characteristic of a carboxylic acid (R-COOH) group. While alcohols also have O-H peaks, they are typically less broad than those of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This frequency is typical for the C=O bond in a carboxylic acid (usually 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n    *Conclusion from FTIR:* The combination of a broad O-H stretch and a C=O stretch strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. The additional C=C peak indicates the molecule is also unsaturated. Therefore, the unknown compound is likely an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene group, supporting the conclusion drawn from the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak in the FTIR spectrum.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a key piece of evidence. We need to find a fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxylic acid group itself:\n        *   Fragment: -COOH\n        *   Mass = (1 x Carbon) + (2 x Oxygen) + (1 x Hydrogen)\n        *   Mass = (1 x 12) + (2 x 16) + (1 x 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45.\n    *   The observation of a fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a very common and strong indicator for a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   Based on all the spectral data, the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n    *   A carboxylic acid requires **two oxygen atoms** in its formula. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen.\n    *   Now we must choose between B (C6H10O2) and D (C6H12O2). The difference between them is the presence of an extra C=C double bond or a ring structure, which we can determine using the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU). The formula for DoU for a compound CxHyOz is: `DoU = x + 1 - (y/2)`.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **For D) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. A DoU of 1 can account for the C=O double bond of the carboxylic acid, but it cannot account for the additional C=C double bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR. Therefore, this formula represents a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which contradicts the data.\n        *   **For B) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. A DoU of 2 perfectly accommodates both the C=O double bond (1 degree of unsaturation) and the C=C double bond (1 degree of unsaturation). This formula is consistent with an unsaturated carboxylic acid containing six carbons (e.g., hexenoic acid).\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe evidence from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry all converge to identify the unknown as an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The only chemical formula that fits this description by having two oxygen atoms and a degree of unsaturation of 2 is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
