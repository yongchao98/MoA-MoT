    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Operators:**\n    The problem provides the components of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ along the x, y, and z axes. These are proportional to the Pauli matrices ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$):\n    *   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n    *   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n    *   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n    This operator $\\vec{P}$ is the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S}$ for a spin-1/2 particle like a muon.\n\n2.  **Define the Direction Vector:**\n    The problem specifies an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane. A unit vector in the x-z plane can be parameterized by an angle $\\theta$ relative to the positive z-axis. In Cartesian coordinates, this unit vector is:\n    $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\n\n3.  **Construct the Operator in the Direction $\\vec{n}$:**\n    The operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is the dot product of the operator vector $\\vec{P}$ and the direction vector $\\vec{n}$, denoted as $P_n$:\n    $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    Substituting the components:\n    $P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_y(0) + P_z \\cos\\theta = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_z \\cos\\theta$\n    Now, substitute the matrix representations:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left[ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right]$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left[ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right]$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Set up the Eigenvalue Equation:**\n    We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n    $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n    Let the eigenvector be represented by a column vector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n5.  **Solve the Eigenvalue Equation:**\n    We can cancel the factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    This gives a system of two linear equations:\n    1) $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n    2) $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\n    Let's solve the first equation for the relationship between $a$ and $b$:\n    $b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    Using the half-angle trigonometric identities $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$ and $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$:\n    $b [2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)] = a [2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)]$\n    Assuming $\\sin(\\theta/2) \\neq 0$ (if it is, $\\theta=0$, which we can check later), we can divide by $2\\sin(\\theta/2)$:\n    $b \\cos(\\theta/2) = a \\sin(\\theta/2)$\n    $b = a \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n    (This relationship can also be derived from the second equation, confirming consistency).\n\n6.  **Determine and Normalize the Eigenvector:**\n    The eigenvector has the form $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = a \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    To simplify and match the given options, we can choose a convenient value for the constant $a$. Let's set $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$. Then:\n    $b = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\tan(\\theta/2) = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\sin(\\theta/2)$\n    So, the unnormalized eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle_{un} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n    Now, we normalize this eigenvector. The squared norm is:\n    $\\langle\\psi_{un}|\\psi_{un}\\rangle = (\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\n    Since the norm is already 1, the eigenvector is self-normalized.\n    The normalized eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n7.  **Final Answer:**\n    The elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This matches option A.\n\nA quick sanity check:\n*   If $\\theta = 0$, $\\vec{n}$ is along the z-axis. The eigenvector should be the \"spin up\" state $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. Our formula gives $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(0) \\\\ \\sin(0) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. Correct.\n*   If $\\theta = \\pi/2$, $\\vec{n}$ is along the x-axis. The eigenvector for $P_x$ with eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$ is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Our formula gives $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\pi/4) \\\\ \\sin(\\pi/4) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\end{pmatrix}$. Correct.\n\n<<<A>>>"
