    "An electron is in a state `|alpha>`. This state is proportional to `(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`.\nAn operator `A` is given by its matrix elements in the `{|up>, |down>}` basis: `Aij = hbar/2` if `i != j` and `Aij = 0` if `i = j`.\n\nFirst, let's normalize the state `|alpha>`.\nThe unnormalized state is `|alpha_un> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`.\nThe norm squared is `<alpha_un|alpha_un>`.\nIn vector notation, `|up> = [[1],[0]]` and `|down> = [[0],[1]]`, so `|alpha_un> = [[1+i],[2-i]]`.\nThe corresponding bra is `<alpha_un| = [1-i, 2+i]`.\n\n`<alpha_un|alpha_un> = (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)`\n`= (1^2 - i^2) + (2^2 - i^2)`\n`= (1 - (-1)) + (4 - (-1))`\n`= 2 + 5 = 7`\n\nThe normalization constant is `1/sqrt(7)`.\nThe normalized state is `|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`.\n\nNext, we write the matrix for operator A.\nThe basis vectors are `|1> = |up>` and `|2> = |down>`.\nThe elements are given as `Aij = 0` if `i=j` and `Aij = hbar/2` if `i != j`.\n`A11 = 0`, `A22 = 0`\n`A12 = hbar/2`, `A21 = hbar/2`\nSo, the matrix is:\n`A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n\nWe need to find the eigenstates and eigenvalues of this operator A.\nThe matrix `[[0, 1], [1, 0]]` is the Pauli matrix `sigma_x`.\nLet's find the eigenvalues `lambda`.\n`det(A - lambda*I) = 0`\n`det([[-lambda, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -lambda]]) = lambda^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = 0`\n`lambda^2 = (hbar/2)^2`\nThe eigenvalues are `lambda_1 = +hbar/2` and `lambda_2 = -hbar/2`.\n\nNow let's find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors.\nFor `lambda_1 = +hbar/2`:\n`[[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] [[x], [y]] = (hbar/2) * [[x], [y]]`\n`(hbar/2) * [[y], [x]] = (hbar/2) * [[x], [y]]`\nThis gives `y=x`.\nThe eigenvector is proportional to `[[1], [1]]`.\nNormalized, `|v1> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [[1], [1]] = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n\nFor `lambda_2 = -hbar/2`:\n`[[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] [[x], [y]] = (-hbar/2) * [[x], [y]]`\n`(hbar/2) * [[y], [x]] = (-hbar/2) * [[x], [y]]`\nThis gives `y=-x`.\nThe eigenvector is proportional to `[[1], [-1]]`.\nNormalized, `|v2> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [[1], [-1]] = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\nThe probability of measuring the particle in an eigenstate is the square of the magnitude of the projection of `|alpha>` onto that eigenstate.\n`P(lambda_1) = |<v1|alpha>|^2`\n`P(lambda_2) = |<v2|alpha>|^2`\n\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n`<v1| = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1]`\n`<v2| = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1]`\n\n`c1 = <v1|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n`= (1/sqrt(14)) * [1*(1+i) + 1*(2-i)]`\n`= (1/sqrt(14)) * [1+i+2-i] = 3/sqrt(14)`\n\n`c2 = <v2|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n`= (1/sqrt(14)) * [1*(1+i) - 1*(2-i)]`\n`= (1/sqrt(14)) * [1+i-2+i] = (-1+2i)/sqrt(14)`\n\nNow calculate the probabilities:\n`P1 = |c1|^2 = |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14 approx 0.6429`\n`P2 = |c2|^2 = |(-1+2i)/sqrt(14)|^2 = ((-1)^2 + 2^2) / 14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14 approx 0.3571`\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\nFinally, we calculate the average value (expectation value) of A.\n`<A> = <alpha|A|alpha>`\n\n`A|alpha> = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n`= (hbar / (2*sqrt(7))) * [[2-i], [1+i]]`\n\n`<alpha|A|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1-i, 2+i] * (hbar / (2*sqrt(7))) * [[2-i], [1+i]]`\n`= (hbar/14) * [(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)]`\n`= (hbar/14) * [(2-i-2i+i^2) + (2+2i+i+i^2)]`\n`= (hbar/14) * [(2-3i-1) + (2+3i-1)]`\n`= (hbar/14) * [(1-3i) + (1+3i)]`\n`= (hbar/14) * 2 = hbar/7`\n\nAlternatively, `<A> = P1*lambda_1 + P2*lambda_2`\n`<A> = (9/14)*(hbar/2) + (5/14)*(-hbar/2)`\n`= (hbar/28) * (9 - 5) = 4*hbar/28 = hbar/7`\n\nThe probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is hbar/7.\n\n<<<D>>>"
