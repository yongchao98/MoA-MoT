    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is chiral, with a stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S).\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reaction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n    *   The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces. Since the molecule is already chiral (due to C5), these two attacks lead to the formation of two different products.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    *   The starting stereocenter at C5 remains (S). The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products have one stereocenter the same (S at C5) and one different (R/S at C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH₄ reduces ketones to alcohols. \"Excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups at C2 and C4 are reduced to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters, at C2 and C4. The maximum number of stereoisomers is 2² = 4. Let's analyze the possibilities:\n        1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n        2.  **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n        3.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n        4.  **(2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are an **enantiomeric pair**. They will be formed in equal amounts (a racemic mixture) because the starting material is achiral.\n    *   Let's look at the (2R, 4S) isomer. This molecule possesses an internal plane of symmetry that passes through C3. A molecule with stereocenters that is achiral due to internal symmetry is called a **meso compound**.\n    *   The (2S, 4R) isomer is identical to the (2R, 4S) isomer (it is the same meso compound).\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces three stereoisomers: a racemic mixture of (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, and the meso-pentane-2,4-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC is an achiral technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity), which means it can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it cannot separate enantiomers.\n\n*   **Products from Reaction I:** We have two diastereomers, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated by normal-phase HPLC. This will produce **2 peaks**.\n*   **Products from Reaction II:** We have a pair of enantiomers ((2R,4R)/(2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound. Enantiomers are inseparable on an achiral column and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it has different physical properties and will be separated, giving a second peak. This will produce **2 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The products of Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are different compounds with different molecular formulas, structures, and polarities. They will be separated from each other. Therefore, the total number of peaks is the sum of the peaks from each reaction's products.\n    *   Total Peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\nChiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers.\n\n*   **Products from Reaction I:** The two diastereomers ((3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) will be separated. This produces **2 peaks**.\n*   **Products from Reaction II:** The chiral column will separate the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers from each other. This will produce 2 peaks. The meso compound is a distinct, achiral stereoisomer and will elute as its own peak. Thus, the three stereoisomers from Reaction II will be fully resolved. This produces **3 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks:** Again, the compounds from Reaction I and Reaction II are different and will not co-elute. The total number of peaks is the sum from each group.\n    *   Total Peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: 4 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
