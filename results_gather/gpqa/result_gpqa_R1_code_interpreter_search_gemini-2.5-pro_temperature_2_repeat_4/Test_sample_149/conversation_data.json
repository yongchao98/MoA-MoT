    "**1. Analysis of the Starting Material (C8H9NO)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A benzene ring accounts for 4 DBEs, and a carbonyl group (C=O) accounts for 1 DBE, totaling 5. This suggests the presence of a benzene ring and a carbonyl group.\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H-NMR Data:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet multiplicity (t) indicates that it is coupled to a neighboring methylene group (-CH₂-), with two equivalent protons (n=2, so 2+1=3 peaks, a triplet).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This is a methylene group (-CH₂-). The doublet multiplicity (d) indicates it's coupled to a single proton (n=1, so 1+1=2 peaks, a doublet). This confirms the presence of a **-CH₂-CHO** fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons in this region strongly suggests a primary amine group (**-NH₂**). This signal is broad due to quadrupole relaxation of the nitrogen nucleus and its protons often exchange with trace amounts of water or D₂O.\n\n*   **Putting it all together:** We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring with two substituents: an amino group (-NH₂) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH₂CHO).\n    The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    Let's check the molecular formula: C₆H₄ (ring) + CH₂CHO (side chain) + NH₂ (substituent) = C₈H(4+2+1+2)NO = C₈H₉NO. The formula matches.\n\n    **Starting Material:**\n    ```\n       H₂N-Ph-CH₂-CHO (para-substitution)\n    ```\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1 & 2: 1. NaNO₂ + HCl; 2. H₂O, Heat**\n    *   The first reagent (NaNO₂ + HCl, typically at 0-5°C) is used for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH₂ group is converted into a diazonium salt, -N₂⁺Cl⁻.\n        *   Intermediate 1: 4-(diazonium chloride)phenylacetaldehyde `[Cl⁻N₂⁺-Ph-CH₂-CHO]`\n    *   The second step (H₂O, Heat) is the hydrolysis of the aryl diazonium salt to form a phenol. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N₂ gas), and it is replaced by an -OH group from water.\n        *   Intermediate 2: **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde** `[HO-Ph-CH₂-CHO]`\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   The reagent is a strong base (KOH) with heat. The reactant is 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which has an aldehyde group and acidic alpha-protons on the -CH₂- group.\n    *   These are the classic conditions for an **Aldol Condensation**. It is a self-condensation because only one type of aldehyde is present.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Enolate formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) from KOH deprotonates the acidic α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the C=O group) to form an enolate ion.\n            `HO-Ph-CH₂-CHO + OH⁻ ⇌ [HO-Ph-CH-CHO]⁻ + H₂O` (Enolate)\n        2.  **Aldol Addition:** The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of another molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n            `[HO-Ph-CH-CHO]⁻ + HO-Ph-CH₂-CHO → HO-Ph-CH₂(CH-O⁻)-CH(CHO)-Ph-OH`\n        3.  **Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated by water to form a β-hydroxy aldehyde, the aldol addition product.\n            `HO-Ph-CH₂(CH-O⁻)-CH(CHO)-Ph-OH + H₂O → HO-Ph-CH₂(CH-OH)-CH(CHO)-Ph-OH + OH⁻`\n            The structure of this addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to **Option D**.\n\n        4.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The -OH group from the β-carbon (C3) and a proton from the α-carbon (C2) are eliminated. This is favored because the resulting C=C double bond is conjugated with both the aldehyde's C=O group and one of the phenyl rings, creating a very stable α,β-unsaturated system.\n            `HO-Ph-CH₂(C³H-OH)-(C²H)(CHO)-Ph-OH  --Heat--> HO-Ph-CH₂-C³H=C²(CHO)-Ph-OH + H₂O`\n\n*   **Identifying the Final Product:**\n    *   The aldol addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option D).\n    *   The final condensation product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal** (Option B).\n    *   Since the reaction is carried out with heat, the reaction proceeds to completion to form the more stable condensation product.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>"
