    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of product 3 and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Toluene is treated with nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic electrophilic aromatic substitution, specifically, the nitration of toluene.\n*   **Mechanism:** The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an ortho-, para-directing activator for electrophilic substitution. The nitronium ion (NO₂⁺), generated from HNO₃ and H₂SO₄, will add to the ring primarily at the ortho and para positions. Due to steric hindrance, the para product is typically the major product.\n*   **Product 1:** *p*-Nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n    ```\n      CH₃\n      |\n     / \\\n    | O |  + HNO₃/H₂SO₄  --->   CH₃\n     \\ /                       |\n      |                       / \\\n                              | O |\n                               \\ /\n                                |\n                               NO₂\n    (Toluene)               (p-Nitrotoluene, Product 1)\n    ```\n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (*p*-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an oxidation reaction. MnO₂ in a strong acid like H₂SO₄ is a powerful oxidizing agent.\n*   **Mechanism:** This combination of reagents will oxidize the benzylic methyl group (-CH₃) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The nitro group (-NO₂) is resistant to these oxidizing conditions.\n*   **Product 2:** *p*-Nitrobenzoic acid (4-nitrobenzoic acid).\n\n    ```\n      CH₃                       COOH\n      |                         |\n     / \\                       / \\\n    | O |  + MnO₂/H₂SO₄  --->  | O |\n     \\ /                       \\ /\n      |                         |\n     NO₂                       NO₂\n    (Product 1)             (p-Nitrobenzoic acid, Product 2)\n    ```\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3 and its Symmetry**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (*p*-nitrobenzoic acid) is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This step involves multiple potential reactions, but we should first consider the most straightforward one. *p*-Nitrobenzoic acid is an acid, and sodium hydroxide is a strong base. The primary and most rapid reaction will be an acid-base neutralization.\n*   **Mechanism:** The acidic proton of the carboxylic acid group will react with the hydroxide ion (OH⁻) from NaOH to form water and the carboxylate salt.\n    *   `R-COOH + NaOH → R-COO⁻ Na⁺ + H₂O`\n*   **Role of Acetone:** Acetone is a common organic solvent that is miscible with water. In this context, it most likely serves as a co-solvent. While acetone can form an enolate in the presence of base and participate in further reactions (like forming a Meisenheimer complex by attacking the nitro-activated ring), these reactions are more complex. The resulting structures from such reactions (e.g., a Meisenheimer adduct or a substitution product) do not possess the high degree of symmetry found in the given options (like D₂h or C₂h). A common strategy in such problems is to identify the simplest, most fundamental reaction first. Therefore, we conclude that \"product 3\" refers to the salt formed in the acid-base reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** The *p*-nitrobenzoate anion.\n\n    ```\n      COOH                      COO⁻\n      |                         |\n     / \\                       / \\\n    | O |  + NaOH (aq) /       | O |\n     \\ /      acetone         \\ /\n      |                         |\n     NO₂                       NO₂\n    (Product 2)             (p-nitrobenzoate anion, Product 3)\n    ```\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\n\n*   **Molecule:** We need to find the point group for the *p*-nitrobenzoate anion.\n*   **Structure:** It consists of a planar benzene ring with a carboxylate group (-COO⁻) and a nitro group (-NO₂) at para positions (1 and 4). Both the -COO⁻ and -NO₂ groups are symmetrical and can lie in the plane of the benzene ring. The overall molecule is planar.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:**\n    1.  **E:** The identity element (all molecules have this).\n    2.  **Three C₂ axes:**\n        *   One C₂ axis passes through the C1 and C4 atoms of the ring (the main axis).\n        *   A second C₂ axis lies in the plane of the ring, perpendicular to the first, passing through the ring's center.\n        *   A third C₂ axis is perpendicular to the plane of the ring, passing through the ring's center.\n    3.  **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule has a center of symmetry at the center of the benzene ring.\n    4.  **Three mirror planes (σ):**\n        *   One plane is the plane of the molecule itself (σh).\n        *   A second plane contains the main C₂ axis (passing through C1 and C4) and is perpendicular to the ring.\n        *   A third plane is also perpendicular to the ring and contains the other in-plane C₂ axis.\n*   **Point Group:** A molecule possessing three perpendicular C₂ axes, an inversion center, and three mirror planes belongs to the **D₂h** point group.\n\nThus, the molecular symmetry group of product 3 is D₂h.\n\n<<<B>>>"
