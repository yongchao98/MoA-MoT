    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gas Mixture Purification Process**\n\nThe initial mixture of salts A and B is heated and decomposes completely into a mixture of gases. This gas mixture is then passed through a series of tubes to identify its components.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is a test for acidic gases like CO₂. Since the weight did not change, no such gases were produced. This means the original salts do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) via the reaction `2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO`. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas did not react with the reagents in tubes 1, 2, or 3.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Since the original salts are likely nitrogen-based (common in thermal decomposition problems) and the gas is inert under the conditions, Gas C is most likely nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture**\n\nBased on the products, we can determine the amount of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B. Since the decomposition produced only H₂O, O₂, and N₂, the salts must be composed solely of Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), and Nitrogen (N).\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.008 g/mol ≈ 0.40 g.\n\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × Moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.007 g/mol ≈ 2.80 g.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both H₂O and O₂.\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × Moles of H₂O) + (2 × Moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.00 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n\n**3. Verify Mass Conservation**\n\nLet's check if the total mass of the calculated elements equals the initial mass of the mixture.\n*   Total Mass = Mass(H) + Mass(N) + Mass(O) = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass perfectly, confirming our product analysis and elemental composition are correct.\n\n**4. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe salts are composed of N, H, and O, and the entire compound vaporizes upon heating. This strongly suggests ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. The most common ones are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's hypothesize that A and B are these two salts. The problem states the mixture is equimolar, meaning we have `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B.\n\nLet's check if the elemental ratios in an equimolar mixture of NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃ match our findings.\n*   Formula of NH₄NO₂: N₂H₄O₂\n*   Formula of NH₄NO₃: N₂H₄O₃\n\nFor an equimolar mixture, the molar ratio of the elements will be the sum of atoms in their formulas:\n*   Total N atoms: 2 + 2 = 4\n*   Total H atoms: 4 + 4 = 8\n*   Total O atoms: 2 + 3 = 5\n\nThe ratio of moles of elements in the mixture should be H:N:O = 8:4:5.\nOur experimental mole counts are H=0.40, N=0.20, O=0.25. The ratio is 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25.\nTo simplify, divide by the smallest number (0.20): (0.40/0.20) : (0.20/0.20) : (0.25/0.20) = 2 : 1 : 1.25.\nNow, multiply by 4 to get integers: 8 : 4 : 5.\nThis H:N:O ratio of 8:4:5 perfectly matches the ratio for an equimolar mixture of NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃. The hypothesis is correct.\n\nWe can also calculate the value of `n` (moles of each salt).\n*   Total moles of N = `n` × (N in A) + `n` × (N in B) = `n` × (2 + 2) = 4`n`\n*   0.20 = 4`n`  => `n` = 0.05 mol.\n\nSo the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃. Let's verify the mass.\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol × (64.04 g/mol) = 3.202 g\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol × (80.04 g/mol) = 4.002 g\n*   Total Mass = 3.202 g + 4.002 g = 7.204 g. This confirms our identification.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in their respective formula units.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Formula: N₂H₄O₂\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Formula: N₂H₄O₃\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n```python\n# Molar masses\nM_H2O = 18.0\nM_O2 = 32.0\nM_N2 = 28.0\nMOLAR_VOLUME_STP = 22.4\n\n# Given data\nmass_h2o = 3.60\nmass_o2 = 0.80\nvolume_gas_c = 2.24\ninitial_mass = 7.20\n\n# Calculate moles of products\nmoles_h2o = mass_h2o / M_H2O\nmoles_o2 = mass_o2 / M_O2\nmoles_n2 = volume_gas_c / MOLAR_VOLUME_STP\n\n# Calculate moles of elements\nmoles_H = 2 * moles_h2o\nmoles_N = 2 * moles_n2\nmoles_O = moles_h2o + 2 * moles_o2\n\n# Identify salts: Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3)\n# NH4NO2 -> N2H4O2\natoms_A = 2 + 4 + 2\n# NH4NO3 -> N2H4O3\natoms_B = 2 + 4 + 3\n\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\nprint(total_atoms)\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products of Decomposition:**\n    The problem describes the decomposition of an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. The resulting gas mixture is analyzed by passing it through three tubes.\n\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful desiccant (drying agent). It absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.02 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is a limewater test. A milky precipitate (CaCO₃) would form if acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂ were present. Since the weight did not change, no such gases were formed. This implies the original salts do not contain carbon or sulfur.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO) via the reaction `2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO`. The mass increase of the tube is due to the mass of oxygen consumed.\n        *   Mass increase = Mass of O = 0.80 g.\n        *   Wait, the reaction shows the mass increase is the mass of O₂, not just O. Let's re-examine. `2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO`. The tube contains copper initially. The mass *increase* is the mass of the other reactant, which is O₂.\n        *   Okay, wait. Let's think carefully. If we have a tube of copper, and we pass O₂ through it, the copper turns into CuO. The mass of the *tube's contents* increases. The increase is the mass of the oxygen that has become part of the solid CuO. So the 0.80 g increase is the mass of atomic oxygen, not diatomic oxygen gas.\n        *   Let's check the wording again: \"the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3)\". This phrasing usually means the mass of the absorbed/reacted substance. For red-hot copper, it reacts with O₂ gas. The mass increase of the *copper* itself is the mass of oxygen atoms. So, mass of O is 0.80g.\n            *   Moles of O from this source = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol. This came from O₂ gas, so Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol. This is consistent.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** After the first three steps, 2.24 L of a gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to the reagents used.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = Volume at STP / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n        *   Given the elements likely present (H, O from H₂O and O₂), and the fact that we're dealing with decomposing salts, a very common inert gaseous product is Nitrogen (N₂). Let's assume Gas C is N₂.\n\n2.  **Determine Elemental Composition of the Original Salts:**\n    Since the products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂, the original salts must be composed of Hydrogen (H), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O). Let's calculate the total moles of each element in the 7.20 g mixture.\n\n    *   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in the H₂O.\n        *   Moles of H = 2 × Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.2 mol = 0.4 mol.\n        *   Mass of H = 0.4 mol × 1.008 g/mol ≈ 0.4 g.\n\n    *   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N is in the N₂.\n        *   Moles of N = 2 × Moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.1 mol = 0.2 mol.\n        *   Mass of N = 0.2 mol × 14.01 g/mol ≈ 2.8 g.\n\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the produced H₂O and from the O that reacted with copper (which came from O₂ gas).\n        *   Moles of O from H₂O = 1 × Moles of H₂O = 0.2 mol.\n        *   Moles of O that reacted with Cu = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Total moles of O = 0.2 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n        *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.00 g/mol = 4.0 g.\n\n3.  **Verify the Composition and Identify the Salts:**\n    *   **Total Mass Check:** Mass(H) + Mass(N) + Mass(O) = 0.4 g + 2.8 g + 4.0 g = 7.2 g. This matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming our analysis.\n    *   **Find the Salt Formulas:** We have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. Let's say we have `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B.\n        *   The overall ratio of atoms in the mixture is H : N : O = 0.4 : 0.2 : 0.25.\n        *   To get integers, multiply by 20: 8 : 4 : 5.\n    *   This H₈N₄O₅ represents the total atoms from one formula unit of salt A plus one formula unit of salt B. We are looking for two common salts made of H, N, and O that add up to this composition.\n    *   These salts are typically ammonium salts of oxyacids of nitrogen. Let's consider Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n        *   Chemical formula of NH₄NO₂ is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n        *   Chemical formula of NH₄NO₃ is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n    *   Let's check if the sum of their atoms matches our ratio:\n        *   Total H = 4 (from N₂H₄O₂) + 4 (from N₂H₄O₃) = 8. (Matches)\n        *   Total N = 2 (from N₂H₄O₂) + 2 (from N₂H₄O₃) = 4. (Matches)\n        *   Total O = 2 (from N₂H₄O₂) + 3 (from N₂H₄O₃) = 5. (Matches)\n    *   The identification is successful. Salt A is NH₄NO₂ and Salt B is NH₄NO₃ (or vice-versa).\n\n4.  **Answer the Question:**\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in the chemical formula unit of each salt.\n\n    *   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n        *   Number of atoms = 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n\n    *   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n        *   Number of atoms = 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n\n    *   **Total atoms in both salts** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\nThe Python code executed previously confirmed this calculation by taking the same logical steps and computing the total atoms from the identified formulas (N₂H₄O₂ and N₂H₄O₃). The output `17` is correct.\n\n<<<C>>>"
