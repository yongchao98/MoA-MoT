    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical equilibrium:** The problem involves a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex (CaY^2-). This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium (Ca^2+) and EDTA (Y^4-). The reaction for the formation of the complex is:\n    Ca^2+ + Y^4- ⇌ CaY^2-\n\n2.  **Define the formation constant (K_f):** The equilibrium constant for this formation reaction is given as K_Ca-EDTA or K_f.\n    K_f = [CaY^2-] / ([Ca^2+][Y^4-]) = 5 x 10^10\n\n3.  **Consider the dissociation:** We start with the Ca-EDTA complex, which will dissociate slightly. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    CaY^2- ⇌ Ca^2+ + Y^4-\n\n4.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:** We can track the concentrations of the species involved in the dissociation. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca^2+ formed at equilibrium. According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation, the concentration of Y^4- formed will also be 'x', and the concentration of the CaY^2- complex will decrease by 'x'.\n\n| Species   | Initial (I) | Change (C) | Equilibrium (E) |\n|-----------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| CaY^2-    | 0.02 M      | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| Ca^2+     | 0 M         | +x         | x               |\n| Y^4-      | 0 M         | +x         | x               |\n\n    *Note:* The \"ideal pH\" condition implies that all EDTA not bound to calcium is in the fully deprotonated Y^4- form.\n\n5.  **Write the equilibrium expression:** We can use the formation constant (K_f) expression and substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table.\n    K_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n    5 x 10^10 = (0.02 - x) / x^2\n\n6.  **Simplify the equation:** Because the formation constant (K_f) is very large (5 x 10^10), the equilibrium lies far to the right (favoring the complex). This means that the amount of dissociation, 'x', will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can make the simplifying approximation:\n    (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02\n\n    The equation becomes:\n    5 x 10^10 ≈ 0.02 / x^2\n\n7.  **Solve for x:** Now, we rearrange the equation to solve for 'x', which represents the concentration of calcium ions, [Ca^2+].\n    x^2 ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10^10)\n    x^2 ≈ (2 x 10^-2) / (5 x 10^10)\n    x^2 ≈ 0.4 x 10^-12\n    x^2 ≈ 4 x 10^-13\n\n    To solve for x, we take the square root of both sides.\n    x = sqrt(4 x 10^-13)\n\nTo perform this calculation accurately, let's use a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\nk_f = 5e10\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# From the approximation: k_f = initial_complex_conc / x^2\n# Rearranging gives: x^2 = initial_complex_conc / k_f\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / k_f\n\n# x is the concentration of Ca2+ ions\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"The concentration of Ca2+ ions is: {x:.2e} M\")\n```\n>>>\n6.32e-07 M\n<<<\n\nThe calculated concentration of calcium ions is 6.32 x 10^-7 M. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 2.0x10^-2 M\nB) 5.0x10^-3 M\nC) 6.3x10^-7 M\nD) 1.0x10^-2 M\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical reaction and equilibrium:** The problem deals with a solution of the calcium-EDTA complex (CaY^2-, where Y^4- represents the fully deprotonated EDTA ion). This complex dissociates slightly into its constituent ions, calcium (Ca^2+) and EDTA (Y^4-). The equilibrium for this dissociation is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    CaY^2-(aq) ⇌ Ca^2+(aq) + Y^4-(aq)\n\n2.  **Use the given Formation Constant (Kf):** The problem provides the formation constant (K_f, also denoted as K_Ca-EDTA), which is for the formation reaction:\n    Ca^2+(aq) + Y^4-(aq) ⇌ CaY^2-(aq)\n    K_f = [CaY^2-] / ([Ca^2+][Y^4-]) = 5 x 10^10\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:** We will track the molar concentrations of the species involved in the dissociation. Let 'x' be the change in concentration as the complex dissociates.\n    *   **Initial Concentration:** We start with 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex and essentially zero of the free ions.\n    *   **Change in Concentration:** As the complex dissociates, its concentration decreases by 'x', while the concentrations of Ca^2+ and Y^4- each increase by 'x'.\n    *   **Equilibrium Concentration:** The concentrations at equilibrium are the sum of the initial and change values.\n\n| Species   | Initial (I) | Change (C) | Equilibrium (E) |\n| :-------- | :---------- | :--------- | :-------------- |\n| CaY^2-    | 0.02 M      | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| Ca^2+     | 0 M         | +x         | x               |\n| Y^4-      | 0 M         | +x         | x               |\n\n    *(Note: The condition of \"ideal pH\" means we can assume all non-complexed EDTA is in the Y^4- form, simplifying the problem by not needing to consider protonated forms of EDTA.)*\n\n4.  **Substitute equilibrium concentrations into the K_f expression:**\n    K_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n    5 x 10^10 = (0.02 - x) / x^2\n\n5.  **Apply a simplifying approximation:** The formation constant K_f is very large (5 x 10^10 >> 1), which indicates that the equilibrium strongly favors the formation of the complex. This means that the amount of dissociation, 'x', will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can make the assumption:\n    (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02\n\n    This simplifies the equation significantly:\n    5 x 10^10 ≈ 0.02 / x^2\n\n6.  **Solve for x:** Now we rearrange the simplified equation to solve for 'x', which represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca^2+ ions.\n    x^2 ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10^10)\n    x^2 ≈ (2 x 10^-2) / (5 x 10^10)\n    x^2 ≈ 0.4 x 10^-12\n    x^2 ≈ 4.0 x 10^-13\n\n    Now, take the square root of both sides:\n    x = √(4.0 x 10^-13)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10^-7 M\n\n7.  **Final check and answer selection:** The calculated concentration of calcium ions, [Ca^2+], is approximately 6.32 x 10^-7 M. Comparing this with the provided options:\n    A) 2.0x10^-2 M\n    B) 5.0x10^-3 M\n    C) 6.3x10^-7 M\n    D) 1.0x10^-2 M\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
