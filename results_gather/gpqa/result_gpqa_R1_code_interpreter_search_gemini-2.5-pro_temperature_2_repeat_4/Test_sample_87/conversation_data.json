    "The user is asking to identify a biological process based on an experimental description. Let's break down the experiment and the observations to determine the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Antigen and Delivery:** Rotavirus capsid proteins (the antigen) are delivered orally. This mimics a natural gut infection.\n2.  **Location of Immune Response:** The fluorescence is observed in Peyer's patches. Peyer's patches are a key component of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and function as secondary lymphoid organs where immune responses to intestinal antigens are initiated.\n3.  **Cells of Interest:** Proliferating cells are isolated from these Peyer's patches. Following antigen encounter, lymphocytes (specifically B and T cells) that recognize the antigen undergo massive proliferation (clonal expansion). This typically happens in structures called germinal centers within secondary lymphoid organs.\n4.  **Genetic Analysis:** The *variable heavy chain gene* of these proliferating cells is sequenced. This gene is a part of the B-cell receptor (BCR) and the antibodies that B cells eventually secrete. The variable region is what binds to the antigen.\n5.  **Key Observation:** \"High variability\" is found in the sequences of the variable heavy chain gene from this population of cells. This means that among the proliferating B cells, their antigen-binding regions have accumulated differences from each other.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options based on these facts:\n\n*   **A) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that generates the initial, vast repertoire of B-cell receptors. However, it occurs in the bone marrow (a primary lymphoid organ) during B cell development, *before* the B cell ever encounters an antigen. The experiment is looking at cells that are *already responding* to an antigen in a *secondary* lymphoid organ. Therefore, VDJ recombination is not the process causing the observed variability *during* this immune response.\n\n*   **B) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This process occurs specifically in activated B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches) after they encounter an antigen. The enzyme Activation-Induced Deaminase (AID) introduces point mutations at a very high rate into the variable region genes (including the variable heavy chain). This creates a pool of B cells with slightly different receptors. B cells with mutations that improve binding to the antigen are then selected for survival and proliferation (a process called affinity maturation). This mechanism is the direct cause of \"high variability\" in the variable heavy chain gene of a proliferating B cell population responding to an antigen. This perfectly matches the experimental observations.\n\n*   **C) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system (and can be linked to the adaptive system via antibodies). It involves a cascade of proteins that help clear pathogens but does not involve any genetic changes to lymphocyte DNA.\n\n*   **D) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers. It changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene, which switches the antibody class (e.g., from IgM to IgA, which is very common for mucosal responses like this). However, it does not affect the *variable* region of the gene. The question specifically highlights variability in the *variable heavy chain gene*, which is the hallmark of somatic hypermutation, not class switching. While class switching is likely also occurring in these cells, the observation described points directly to SHM.\n\n**Conclusion:** The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating B cells in a Peyer's patch following antigen exposure is the defining characteristic of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
