These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### **Reaction A:**\n**dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify Nucleophile and Electrophile:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the highly acidic α-carbon between the two ester groups, forming a resonance-stabilized enolate: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The electrophilic site for conjugate addition is the β-carbon (the one bonded to the p-tolyl group).\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   This forms a new C-C bond between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is an enolate, which is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) during workup to yield the final neutral product.\n\n3.  **Product Structure Determination:**\n    *   Reactants: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` + `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`\n    *   The new bond forms between the `CH` of the malonate and the `CH(β)` of the acrylate.\n    *   Product: `p-Tolyl-CH(β)[CH(COOCH₃)₂] - CH₂(α)-COOCH₃`\n\n4.  **Product Naming:**\n    *   Let's name this product according to the options provided. The options use a \"propane-tricarboxylate\" naming convention. This implies a 3-carbon backbone.\n    *   The backbone can be traced from the malonate carbon (`C1`), to the acrylate's β-carbon (`C2`), to the acrylate's α-carbon (`C3`).\n    *   Structure: `(MeOOC)₂CH(1) - CH(p-tolyl)(2) - CH₂(COOMe)(3)`\n    *   This corresponds to the IUPAC name **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### **Reaction B:**\n**1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify Nucleophile and Electrophile:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral nitrogen analogs of enolates and serve as nucleophiles at the α-carbon (the C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The electrophilic site is the β-carbon.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation / Michael Addition):**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms a C-C bond, and the intermediate is an iminium salt.\n    *   The final step involves hydrolysis with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). The iminium salt is hydrolyzed back to a carbonyl group (ketone), regenerating the cyclohexanone structure.\n\n3.  **Product Structure Determination:**\n    *   The initial cyclohexanone ring is substituted at its α-position (C2).\n    *   The substituent is derived from but-2-enenitrile, becoming the `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with this group at the C2 position.\n\n4.  **Product Naming:**\n    *   The molecule has two functional groups: a ketone and a nitrile. The nitrile has higher priority in IUPAC nomenclature.\n    *   The parent chain is the butanenitrile.\n    *   The substituent is the `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group, attached at position 3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   Thus, the product name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto tautomer is the major product over the enol form.\n\n### **Reaction C:**\n**C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Retrosynthesis (Working Backwards):**\n    *   The reaction is a Michael addition. We need to identify the bond formed. Michael additions create a bond between the α-position of the donor and the β-position of the acceptor.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** We are given but-3-en-2-one (Methyl Vinyl Ketone, MVK), `CH₂(β)=CH(α)-C(=O)CH₃`. The fragment it contributes to the product is `-CH₂(β)-CH₂(α)-C(=O)CH₃`, which is the `3-oxobutyl` group.\n    *   **Michael Donor (Reactant C):** The bond must have formed between the C2 of the dione and the `β-CH₂` of MVK. Therefore, the nucleophile must have been the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. The starting material `C` is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n2.  **Verification:**\n    *   Reactant C: Cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   The C2 methylene protons are highly acidic (flanked by two C=O groups) and are readily deprotonated by KOH to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   This enolate attacks but-3-en-2-one to form the given product.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
