    "This problem requires us to calculate the molar fraction of a specific complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This molar fraction can then be converted into a percentage.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the species in solution:**\n    The cobalt(II) ions, `Co^2+`, react with thiocyanate ions, `SCN-`, to form a series of complexes. The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free `Co^2+` ion and all its complexes:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]+ + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3]- + [Co(SCN)4]^2-`\n\n2.  **Use the overall stability constants (β):**\n    The stability constants (β) relate the concentration of each complex to the concentration of the free metal ion (`[Co^2+]`) and the ligand (`[SCN-]`).\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]+ = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)3]- = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)4]^2- = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\n3.  **Express the total cobalt concentration in terms of `[Co^2+]`:**\n    We can substitute the expressions from step 2 into the equation for `c(Co)` from step 1:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + (β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]) + (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) + (β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3) + (β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4)`\n    By factoring out `[Co^2+]`, we get:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the fraction (α) of the desired complex:**\n    The question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`. The fraction of this species, which we'll call `α2`, is the concentration of `[Co(SCN)2]` divided by the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)`.\n    `α2 = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)`\n\n    Now, substitute the expressions for `[Co(SCN)2]` and `c(Co)`:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4))`\n\n    The `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, leaving:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n5.  **Perform the calculation:**\n    We are given the following values:\n    *   `[SCN-]` = 0.1 M\n    *   `β1` = 9\n    *   `β2` = 40\n    *   `β3` = 63\n    *   `β4` = 16\n\n    We can write a short Python script to compute the result accurately.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nSCN_conc = 0.1\n\n# Calculate the individual terms for the denominator sum\n# Let L represent the ligand concentration [SCN-]\nterm0 = 1  # For free Co^2+\nterm1 = beta1 * SCN_conc**1     # For [Co(SCN)]+\nterm2 = beta2 * SCN_conc**2     # For [Co(SCN)2]\nterm3 = beta3 * SCN_conc**3     # For [Co(SCN)3]-\nterm4 = beta4 * SCN_conc**4     # For [Co(SCN)4]^2-\n\n# The numerator is the term corresponding to the complex of interest, [Co(SCN)2]\nnumerator = term2\n\n# The denominator is the sum of all terms, representing all cobalt species\ndenominator = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# The fraction of the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage=}\")\n```\n>>>\npercentage=16.916180326482276\n\nThe calculation shows that the fraction `α2` is approximately 0.169, which corresponds to 16.9%.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is a breakdown of the calculation:\n\nThe total concentration of all cobalt-containing species, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free ion and all its complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)]⁺ + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\nUsing the overall stability constants (β), we can express the concentration of each species in terms of the free cobalt ion `[Co²⁺]` and the thiocyanate ligand `[SCN⁻]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nThe fraction (α₂) of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration:\n`α₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)`\n\nSubstituting the expressions gives:\n`α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, leaving a formula that depends only on the known ligand concentration and stability constants:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   `β₁` = 9\n*   `β₂` = 40\n*   `β₃` = 63\n*   `β₄` = 16\n\nLet's calculate the terms in the denominator first:\n*   `β₁[SCN⁻]¹` = 9 * (0.1)¹ = 0.9\n*   `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   `β₃[SCN⁻]³` = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴` = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNow, calculate the full expression:\n*   **Numerator** = `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = **0.4**\n*   **Denominator** = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n`α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo get the percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100 = **16.916%**\n\nThis value is closest to 16.9%.\n\n<<<D>>>"
