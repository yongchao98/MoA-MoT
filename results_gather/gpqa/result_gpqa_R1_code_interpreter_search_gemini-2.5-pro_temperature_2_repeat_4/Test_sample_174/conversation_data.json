    "An oscillating charge distribution radiates electromagnetic waves. The nature of this radiation can be understood by considering the multipole expansion of the oscillating source. The problem describes a spheroid-shaped charge distribution with its symmetry axis along the z-axis. The simplest mode of oscillation for such a shape is a \"sloshing\" of charge along this symmetry axis.\n\n1.  **Determining the Radiation Pattern and Angular Dependence:**\n    *   An oscillation of charge along the z-axis creates a time-varying electric dipole moment, `p(t)`, oriented along the z-axis.\n    *   For a system where the size of the source is much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation (which is a standard assumption in such problems unless stated otherwise), the dominant form of radiation will be the lowest-order multipole radiation, which is electric dipole radiation.\n    *   The formula for the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) from an oscillating electric dipole `p(t) = p₀cos(ωt)ẑ` is given by:\n        `dP/dΩ = f(λ, θ) ∝ sin²(θ)`\n        where `θ` is the polar angle measured from the axis of the dipole (the z-axis).\n    *   The function `f` is therefore proportional to `sin²(θ)`.\n    *   The maximum power, `A`, is radiated when `sin²(θ)` is at its maximum value. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n        `A = (dP/dΩ)_max ∝ sin²(90°) = 1`.\n    *   The question asks for the radiated power at an angle `θ = 30°`. We need to calculate the value of the angular function at this angle.\n        `Power at 30° ∝ sin²(30°)`.\n    *   We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    *   Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at `θ = 30°` is the ratio of the power at 30° to the maximum power:\n        `Fraction = (Power at 30°) / A = sin²(30°) / sin²(90°) = (1/4) / 1 = 1/4`.\n\n2.  **Determining the Wavelength Dependence:**\n    *   The power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole depends on the frequency of oscillation. The full expression for the power per unit solid angle is:\n        `dP/dΩ = (p₀²ω⁴) / (32π²ε₀c³) * sin²(θ)`\n    *   Here, `ω` is the angular frequency of the oscillation. We are interested in the dependence of this power function, `f`, on the wavelength `λ`.\n    *   The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` and the speed of light `c` by the formula: `ω = 2πc / λ`.\n    *   Substituting this into the power formula, we can see the dependence on `λ`:\n        `f(λ, θ) = dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`.\n    *   This inverse fourth-power relationship with wavelength is characteristic of dipole radiation and is also famously known as Rayleigh's law of scattering.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nCombining the two results:\n*   The fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   A possible form for the function `f`, which describes the power's dependence on wavelength, is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."
