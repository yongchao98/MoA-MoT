    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    For an isolated system, the total energy is conserved. In this relativistic system, the total energy ($E_{total}$) is the sum of the relativistic energy of the mass and its potential energy ($U(x)$).\n\n2.  **Define the components of the total energy.**\n    *   The relativistic energy of a particle with rest mass $m$ and speed $v$ is $E_{rel} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   The potential energy of a harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law ($F=-kx$) is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    *   Therefore, the total conserved energy of the system at any point in its motion is:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n3.  **Apply the conservation of energy to two specific points in the oscillation.**\n    *   **Point 1: Maximum amplitude ($x = A$).** At this point, the mass is momentarily at rest, so its speed is $v=0$.\n        *   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        *   The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        *   The total energy at this point is:\n            $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n    *   **Point 2: Equilibrium position ($x = 0$).** At this point, the potential energy is zero, and the speed is maximum ($v = v_{max}$).\n        *   The Lorentz factor is at its maximum: $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        *   The potential energy is zero: $U(0) = 0$.\n        *   The total energy at this point is:\n            $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$.\n\n4.  **Equate the total energy at these two points and solve for $v_{max}$.**\n    Since energy is conserved, the total energy at $x=A$ must be equal to the total energy at $x=0$.\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n    Now, substitute the expression for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    Divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n    $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, we first isolate the square root term. We can do this by taking the reciprocal of both sides, but it's easier to square both sides first:\n    $\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}$\n\n    Now, take the reciprocal of both sides to get the term with $v_{max}$ in the numerator:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for $v_{max}^2/c^2$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n5.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The derived expression for $v_{max}$ matches option D exactly.\n\n    *   A) $v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$ is the non-relativistic (classical) answer.\n    *   B) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$ would lead to $v_{max} > c$, which is physically impossible.\n    *   C) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$ is dimensionally inconsistent.\n    *   D) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$ is the correct relativistic result.\n\n<<<D>>>"
