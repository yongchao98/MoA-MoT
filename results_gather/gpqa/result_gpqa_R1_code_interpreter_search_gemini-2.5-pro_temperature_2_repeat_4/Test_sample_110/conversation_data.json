    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is a classic Michael Addition reaction.\n    *   The **nucleophile** is an enolate generated from the ketone.\n    *   The **Michael acceptor** (electrophile) is ethyl acrylate, an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   The **base** is potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong and sterically hindered base.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate (Nucleophile):**\n    *   The ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   To form an enolate, a proton must be removed from a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-carbon). The α-carbons are at positions C-2 and C-6.\n    *   The C-2 position is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C-1, and C-3) and has no α-protons.\n    *   The C-6 position has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the base t-BuOK can only deprotonate the C-6 position. This regioselectivity means only one enolate is formed, with the double bond between C-1 and C-6.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The C-6 of the ketone enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH−COOEt).\n    *   This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C-6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate moiety.\n    *   After the attack, an intermediate enolate is formed, which is then protonated during aqueous workup (implied) to regenerate the carbonyl group and neutralize the molecule, yielding the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The original ketone ring is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let's use the standard numbering where C=O is C-1.\n    *   The substituents are: C-2 has an ethyl and a methyl group. C-6 has a methyl group.\n    *   The new group added to C-6 is `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` (from ethyl acrylate).\n    *   To name the final product according to IUPAC rules, the ester can be treated as the parent chain: `ethyl propanoate`. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on this chain.\n    *   The chain is `Substituent-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`. It's an ethyl 3-(substituent)propanoate.\n    *   Now let's name the cyclohexyl substituent. The ring is attached to the propanoate chain at what was originally C-6 of the ketone. For naming purposes, this attachment point on the ring is designated as C-1'.\n        *   C-1' (the attachment point) has a methyl group.\n        *   C-2' is the carbon with the carbonyl (C=O) group.\n        *   C-3' has the ethyl and methyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, the substituent is named **(1,3-dimethyl-3-ethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**, which can be alphabetized to **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Combining everything, the full name for product A is: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\nThis matches the name for product A in options C and D.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is also a Michael Addition.\n    *   The **nucleophile** is a carbanion (specifically a nitronate ion) formed from 1-nitropropane.\n    *   The **Michael acceptor** is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile).\n    *   The **base** is potassium hydroxide (KOH), a strong base.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The starting material is 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂-NO₂). The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, making the protons on the α-carbon (the carbon bonded to the -NO₂) acidic.\n    *   KOH removes one of these α-protons to form a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion, which acts as the carbon nucleophile.\n    *   Nucleophile: CH₃CH₂-C⁻H-NO₂\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The α-carbon of the 1-nitropropane anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-C(β)H=C(α)H-CN).\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitroalkane and the β-carbon of the unsaturated nitrile.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   Let's trace the carbon backbones:\n        *   From 1-nitropropane: (NO₂)-CH-(CH₂CH₃)\n        *   From (E)-but-2-enenitrile: CH₃-CH-(CH₂CN)\n    *   Combining these at the newly formed bond gives the structure: CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The parent chain is the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n    *   Numbering from the nitrile carbon as C-1:\n        `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so it is a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C-3 and a nitro group at C-4.\n    *   The full name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis matches the name for product B in options B and C.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   **Product B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these with the given options, the only option that matches both products is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
