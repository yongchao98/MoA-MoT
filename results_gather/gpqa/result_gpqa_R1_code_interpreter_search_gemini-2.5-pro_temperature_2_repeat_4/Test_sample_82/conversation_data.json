    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\nThe initial volume of the acetic acid solution is V1 = 20.00 cm³, and its concentration is M1 = 0.05 M. It is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, so the final volume is V2 = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³. We use the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2 to find the new concentration, M2.\n*   M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M.\nThe concentration of the acetic acid solution to be titrated is 0.025 M.\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\nThe titration reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O.\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻). This means the remaining acid is 75%. The solution is a buffer containing both the weak acid and its conjugate base. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\npH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n\nFirst, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n*   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n\nThen, substitute the ratio of conjugate base to acid into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. At 25% titration, the ratio [A⁻]/[HA] is 25/75 or 1/3.\n*   pH = pKa + log(1/3) = pKa - log(3)\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, forming sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution contains only the conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), which will hydrolyze in water to produce OH⁻ ions, making the solution basic.\nCH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n\nFirst, we need to find the concentration of the acetate ion at the equivalence point.\n*   Initial moles of acetic acid = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.040 L = 0.001 mol.\n*   At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added = moles of initial acetic acid = 0.001 mol.\n*   Volume of NaOH needed = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   Total volume at equivalence point = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n*   Concentration of acetate, [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n\nNext, we calculate the Kb for acetate using the relationship Kw = Ka × Kb (where Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C).\n*   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n\nNow we use the Kb expression for the hydrolysis of acetate to find the [OH⁻] concentration. Let x = [OH⁻].\n*   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\nAssuming x is very small compared to 0.02, we can approximate:\n*   Kb ≈ x² / 0.02\n*   x = [OH⁻] = √(Kb × 0.02)\n\nFinally, we calculate the pOH and then the pH.\n*   pOH = -log([OH⁻])\n*   pH = 14.00 - pOH\n\nTo perform these calculations accurately, a Python script is used.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Constants and Initial Values ---\nKa_acetic_acid = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\nM_acid_initial = 0.05  # M\nV_acid_initial = 20.00  # cm3\nV_water = 20.00  # cm3\nM_NaOH = 0.1 #M\n\n# --- Step 1: Dilution Calculation ---\nV_acid_diluted = V_acid_initial + V_water\nM_acid_diluted = (M_acid_initial * V_acid_initial) / V_acid_diluted\n\n# --- Step 2: pH at 25% Titration ---\n# pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n# At 25% titration, [A-]/[HA] = 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3\npKa = -math.log10(Ka_acetic_acid)\npH_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- Step 3: pH at Equivalence Point ---\n# Moles of diluted acid\nmoles_acid = M_acid_diluted * (V_acid_diluted / 1000)\n\n# Volume of NaOH to reach equivalence\nV_NaOH_eq = (moles_acid / M_NaOH) * 1000 # in cm3\n\n# Total volume at equivalence\nV_total_eq = V_acid_diluted + V_NaOH_eq # in cm3\n\n# Concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) at equivalence\nmoles_acetate = moles_acid\nM_acetate_eq = moles_acetate / (V_total_eq / 1000)\n\n# Calculate Kb for acetate\nKb_acetate = Kw / Ka_acetic_acid\n\n# Calculate [OH-] from hydrolysis: CH3COO- + H2O <=> CH3COOH + OH-\n# Kb = [OH-]^2 / [CH3COO-]  (approximation)\n# [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [CH3COO-])\nOH_concentration = math.sqrt(Kb_acetate * M_acetate_eq)\n\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(OH_concentration)\npH_eq = 14 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation shows that the pH at 25% titration is 4.26 and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here's the detailed thinking process to arrive at the solution.\n\n### **1. Understand the Initial State and the Dilution**\n\n*   **Initial solution:** We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   **Dilution:** We add 20.00 cm³ of water. This doubles the volume of the solution while keeping the number of moles of acetic acid the same. We need to calculate the new concentration of the acetic acid.\n*   **Dilution Formula:** M₁V₁ = M₂V₂\n    *   M₁ (initial concentration) = 0.05 M\n    *   V₁ (initial volume) = 20.00 cm³\n    *   V₂ (final volume) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n    *   M₂ (final concentration) = (M₁ * V₁) / V₂\n    *   M₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n*   **Conclusion of Step 1:** We are titrating a 40.00 cm³ solution of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n### **2. Calculate the pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   **Reaction:** The titration involves the neutralization of the weak acid (acetic acid, HA) with a strong base (NaOH). The net ionic equation is:\n    CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n*   **Buffer Region:** \"25% titration\" means we have added enough NaOH to neutralize 25% of the initial acetic acid. At this point, the solution contains:\n    *   75% of the original acetic acid (HA).\n    *   25% has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻, which is CH₃COO⁻).\n*   **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:** A solution containing a weak acid and its conjugate base is a buffer. Its pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    pH = pKa + log([A⁻] / [HA])\n*   **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   The ratio of concentrations [A⁻]/[HA] is equal to the ratio of moles, which is 25/75 or 1/3.\n    *   pH = pKa + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) - log(3)\n    *   pH ≈ 4.7328 - 0.4771 ≈ 4.2557\n*   **Conclusion of Step 2:** The pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.\n\n### **3. Calculate the pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   **Definition:** The equivalence point is reached when the moles of added NaOH are exactly equal to the initial moles of acetic acid.\n*   **Solution Composition:** At this point, all the CH₃COOH has been converted to its conjugate base, CH₃COO⁻. The solution contains sodium acetate (Na⁺CH₃COO⁻) in water.\n*   **Hydrolysis:** The acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) is a weak base and will react with water (hydrolyze) to produce OH⁻ ions, making the solution basic.\n    CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   **Calculation Steps:**\n    1.  **Find the moles of acid:**\n        *   Moles = Molarity × Volume (in Liters)\n        *   Moles CH₃COOH = 0.025 mol/L × (40.00 cm³ / 1000 L/cm³) = 0.001 mol\n    2.  **Find the volume of NaOH needed:**\n        *   At equivalence, moles NaOH = moles CH₃COOH = 0.001 mol.\n        *   Volume NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    3.  **Find the total volume and concentration of acetate at equivalence:**\n        *   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n        *   Moles of acetate (CH₃COO⁻) = initial moles of acid = 0.001 mol.\n        *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n    4.  **Calculate [OH⁻] from hydrolysis:**\n        *   First, we need Kb for the acetate ion. We use the relationship Kw = Ka × Kb, where Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C.\n        *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n        *   For the hydrolysis reaction, Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻].\n        *   Let x = [OH⁻]. Then [CH₃COOH] also equals x.\n        *   Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n        *   x² = Kb × 0.02 = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹.\n        *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n    5.  **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n        *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483.\n        *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 = 8.517.\n*   **Conclusion of Step 3:** The pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52.\n\n### **Summary of Results**\n\n*   pH at 25% titration ≈ 4.26\n*   pH at equivalence point ≈ 8.52\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) 4.26; 8.52\nB) 4.73; 7.00\nC) 3.17; 6.73\nD) 4.57; 6.92\n\nThe calculated values perfectly match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
