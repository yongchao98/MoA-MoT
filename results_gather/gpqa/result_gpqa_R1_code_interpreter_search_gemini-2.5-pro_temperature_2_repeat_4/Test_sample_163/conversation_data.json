    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Understand the Physics of the Problem**\n\nThe problem describes two binary star systems (system_1 and system_2) that are both **eclipsing** and for which we have **spectroscopic** data (radial velocity amplitudes for both stars). We need to find the ratio of their total masses.\n\n*   **Spectroscopic Binary:** The sinusoidal variation of radial velocities (RV) allows us to measure the orbital properties. Since we have RV data for *both* stars (a double-lined spectroscopic binary, SB2), we can determine the sum of their masses.\n*   **Eclipsing Binary:** The fact that the systems exhibit eclipses tells us that their orbital plane is nearly edge-on to our line of sight. This means the inclination angle, `i`, is close to 90 degrees, and therefore `sin(i) ≈ 1`. This is a crucial simplification.\n\n### **2. Derive the Relevant Formula**\n\nLet's start from Kepler's Third Law for a binary system:\n`P^2 = (4 * π^2 * a^3) / (G * (m1 + m2))`\nwhere:\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the relative orbit (`a = a1 + a2`).\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `m1` and `m2` are the masses of the stars. Let `M_total = m1 + m2`.\n\nRearranging for `M_total`:\n`M_total = (4 * π^2 * a^3) / (G * P^2)`\n\nNow, let's relate the semi-major axis `a` to the observed radial velocities. The radial velocity amplitude `K` for a star in a circular orbit is given by `K = v * sin(i)`, where `v` is the orbital speed.\nThe orbital speed is `v = (2 * π * r) / P`, where `r` is the orbital radius of that star around the center of mass.\nSo, for the two stars:\n*   `K1 = (2 * π * a1 / P) * sin(i)`\n*   `K2 = (2 * π * a2 / P) * sin(i)`\n\nSumming these two equations:\n`K1 + K2 = (2 * π * (a1 + a2) / P) * sin(i)`\nSince `a = a1 + a2`:\n`K1 + K2 = (2 * π * a / P) * sin(i)`\n\nNow we can solve this for `a`:\n`a = (P * (K1 + K2)) / (2 * π * sin(i))`\n\nSubstitute this expression for `a` into the `M_total` equation:\n`M_total = (4 * π^2 / (G * P^2)) * [ (P * (K1 + K2)) / (2 * π * sin(i)) ]^3`\n`M_total = (4 * π^2 / (G * P^2)) * (P^3 * (K1 + K2)^3) / (8 * π^3 * sin^3(i))`\n`M_total = (P * (K1 + K2)^3) / (2 * π * G * sin^3(i))`\n\nAs established, for an eclipsing binary, `sin(i) ≈ 1`, so `sin^3(i) ≈ 1`. The term `1 / (2 * π * G)` is a constant. Therefore, the total mass is directly proportional to the period and the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes:\n`M_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)^3`\n\n### **3. Apply the Formula to the Given Data**\n\nWe can now find the ratio of the mass of system_1 (`M1_total`) to the mass of system_2 (`M2_total`).\n\n`Ratio = M1_total / M2_total = [ P1 * (K1a + K1b)^3 ] / [ P2 * (K2a + K2b)^3 ]`\n\n**For system_1:**\n*   `P1` = 2 years\n*   `K1a` = 10 km/s\n*   `K1b` = 5 km/s\n*   Sum of velocities = `10 + 5 = 15 km/s`\n\n**For system_2:**\n*   `P2` = 1 year\n*   `K2a` = 15 km/s\n*   `K2b` = 10 km/s\n*   Sum of velocities = `15 + 10 = 25 km/s`\n\n### **4. Calculate the Ratio**\n\nNow, substitute the values into the ratio formula.\n\n`Ratio = [ 2 * (15)^3 ] / [ 1 * (25)^3 ]`\n`Ratio = 2 * (15 / 25)^3`\n`Ratio = 2 * (3 / 5)^3`\n`Ratio = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n`Ratio = 54 / 125`\n`Ratio = 0.432`\n\nThe calculated factor is `0.432`.\n\n### **5. Compare with Options and Final Answer**\n\nThe calculated value `0.432` is closest to the option `D) ~ 0.4`.\n\nI will use Python to confirm the calculation.\n```python\n# Data for system_1\nP1 = 2  # years\nK1_sys1 = 10  # km/s\nK2_sys1 = 5  # km/s\n\n# Data for system_2\nP2 = 1  # year\nK1_sys2 = 15  # km/s\nK2_sys2 = 10  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the sum of the velocity amplitudes for each system\nK_sum1 = K1_sys1 + K2_sys1\nK_sum2 = K1_sys2 + K2_sys2\n\n# The total mass is proportional to P * (K_sum)^3\n# The constant of proportionality cancels out in the ratio.\nmass_ratio = (P1 * (K_sum1)**3) / (P2 * (K_sum2)**3)\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n\n>>>0.432\nThe result from the Python code confirms the manual calculation. The ratio is 0.432, which is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The analysis is based on the relationship derived for the total mass of a double-lined spectroscopic eclipsing binary system.\n\n### **1. Physical Principles**\n\nThe total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) of a binary star system is related to its orbital period (P) and the semi-major axis of the relative orbit (a) by Kepler's Third Law:\nM_total = (4π² / G) * (a³ / P²)\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the semi-major axis (a) can be related to the observed radial velocity amplitudes (K1 and K2) and the period (P). The velocity amplitudes are given by:\nK₁ = (2π * a₁ / P) * sin(i)\nK₂ = (2π * a₂ / P) * sin(i)\n\nWhere `a₁` and `a₂` are the semi-major axes of each star's orbit around the center of mass, and `i` is the inclination of the orbital plane to the line of sight.\n\nSumming the two velocity equations:\nK₁ + K₂ = (2π / P) * (a₁ + a₂) * sin(i)\n\nSince `a = a₁ + a₂`:\nK₁ + K₂ = (2π * a / P) * sin(i)\n\nSolving for `a`:\na = P * (K₁ + K₂) / (2π * sin(i))\n\nNow, substitute this expression for `a` back into Kepler's Third Law:\nM_total = (4π² / (G * P²)) * [ P * (K₁ + K₂) / (2π * sin(i)) ]³\nM_total = (4π² / (G * P²)) * (P³ * (K₁ + K₂)³ / (8π³ * sin³(i)))\n\nSimplifying this gives the mass function for a double-lined system:\n**M_total = (1 / (2πG)) * [ P * (K₁ + K₂)³ / sin³(i) ]**\n\nFor an eclipsing binary, the inclination `i` is very close to 90°, meaning `sin(i) ≈ 1` and `sin³(i) ≈ 1`.\nTherefore, the constant of proportionality `1 / (2πG * sin³(i))` is the same for both systems. We can establish a direct proportionality:\n**M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)²**\n\n### **2. Calculation**\n\nWe need to find the ratio M_system1 / M_system2.\n\n**Data for System 1:**\n*   Period (P₁): 2 years\n*   Velocity amplitudes (K₁₁, K₁₂): 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n*   Sum of amplitudes (K_sum1): 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n\n**Data for System 2:**\n*   Period (P₂): 1 year\n*   Velocity amplitudes (K₂₁, K₂₂): 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n*   Sum of amplitudes (K_sum2): 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\nNow, we compute the ratio:\nRatio = M_system1 / M_system2 = [ P₁ * (K_sum1)³ ] / [ P₂ * (K_sum2)³ ]\nRatio = [ 2 * (15)³ ] / [ 1 * (25)³ ]\nRatio = 2 * (15 / 25)³\nRatio = 2 * (3 / 5)³\nRatio = 2 * (27 / 125)\nRatio = 54 / 125\nRatio = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
