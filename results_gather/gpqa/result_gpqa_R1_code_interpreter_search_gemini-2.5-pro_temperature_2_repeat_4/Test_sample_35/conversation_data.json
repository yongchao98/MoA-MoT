    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **De-redshift the Observation:** The first step is to determine the energy of the absorption line in its own rest frame, i.e., what its energy would be if it were observed within the Milky Way. The source is at a cosmological distance, so its light is redshifted. We need to calculate this redshift (`z`) and correct the observed energy.\n\n2.  **Calculate Redshift (z):** We can estimate the redshift using Hubble's Law, which relates a galaxy's recessional velocity (`v`) to its distance (`d`) via the Hubble constant (`H₀`).\n    *   Hubble's Law: `v = H₀ × d`\n    *   For cosmological redshifts, the redshift `z` is approximately `v / c`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   Let's use a standard value for the Hubble constant, `H₀ ≈ 70 km/s/Mpc`.\n    *   The distance is given as `d = 2.1 Gpc`. We need to convert this to Megaparsecs (Mpc): `2.1 Gpc = 2100 Mpc`.\n    *   Now, we can calculate the velocity: `v ≈ 70 km/s/Mpc × 2100 Mpc = 147,000 km/s`.\n    *   The redshift is then: `z ≈ v / c = 147,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.49`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Rest-Frame Energy (E_rest):** The observed energy (`E_obs`) is related to the rest-frame energy (`E_rest`) by the redshift `z`.\n    *   The formula is `E_rest = E_obs × (1 + z)`.\n    *   We are given `E_obs = 3.9 × 10⁻⁶ eV`.\n    *   `E_rest ≈ (3.9 × 10⁻⁶ eV) × (1 + 0.49) = (3.9 × 10⁻⁶ eV) × 1.49 ≈ 5.81 × 10⁻⁶ eV`.\n\n4.  **Identify the Transition:** Now we need to find a known spectral line from the interstellar medium that has an energy of approximately `5.81 × 10⁻⁶ eV`.\n    *   This very low energy level is characteristic of hyperfine transitions.\n    *   The most famous hyperfine transition in astrophysics is the **21-cm line** of neutral atomic hydrogen (H I). This line is produced by the \"spin-flip\" of the electron relative to the proton in a hydrogen atom.\n    *   Let's calculate the energy of the 21-cm line to see if it matches.\n        *   Frequency (`ν`) = 1420.4 MHz = 1.4204 × 10⁹ Hz.\n        *   Planck's constant (`h`) ≈ 4.136 × 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s.\n        *   Energy (`E`) = `h × ν` = (4.136 × 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s) × (1.4204 × 10⁹ s⁻¹) ≈ `5.87 × 10⁻⁶ eV`.\n    *   Our calculated rest-frame energy (`5.81 × 10⁻⁶ eV`) is an excellent match for the energy of the 21-cm line (`5.87 × 10⁻⁶ eV`). The small discrepancy is due to the approximations used for the Hubble constant.\n\n5.  **Identify the Medium:** The line is identified as the 21-cm line of neutral atomic hydrogen. The question now becomes: which phase of the interstellar medium is traced by a 21-cm *absorption* line?\n    *   Neutral atomic hydrogen (H I) exists in two main phases: a Cold Neutral Medium (CNM, T ~ 100 K) and a Warm Neutral Medium (WNM, T ~ 8000 K).\n    *   The 21-cm line is seen in **emission** from the diffuse, warm atomic medium, which is widespread throughout the galaxy.\n    *   The 21-cm line is seen in **absorption** when there is a cool, dense cloud of atomic hydrogen in front of a bright background radio source. The cooler gas absorbs the radio waves from the hotter source behind it.\n    *   Since the observation is an *absorption* line, it is tracing the **Cold atomic interstellar medium**.\n\n6.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   A) Warm atomic interstellar medium. (Incorrect, this is seen in emission).\n    *   B) Cold molecular interstellar medium. (Incorrect, this is atomic, not molecular, hydrogen).\n    *   C) Warm molecular interstellar medium. (Incorrect).\n    *   D) Cold atomic interstellar medium. (**Correct**).\n\nThe following code verifies the calculations.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Constants\nH0 = 70.0  # Hubble constant in km/s/Mpc\nc = 299792.458  # Speed of light in km/s\nh = 4.135667696e-15  # Planck constant in eV*s\nnu_21cm = 1420.405751e6  # Frequency of the 21 cm line in Hz\n\n# Given values\nd_gpc = 2.1  # Distance in Gpc\nE_obs_ev = 3.9e-6  # Observed energy in eV\n\n# 1.

    "The problem requires us to identify the interstellar medium component in our galaxy, the Milky Way, that would produce an absorption line whose observed energy at a distance of 2.1 Gpc is 3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Rest-Frame Energy\n\nThe light from a source at a cosmological distance is redshifted, meaning its wavelength is stretched and its energy is reduced. We need to calculate the energy the absorption line would have if it were not redshifted (its \"rest-frame energy\").\n\n1.  **Calculate the Redshift (z):** We use Hubble's Law, `v = H₀ × d`, where `v` is the recessional velocity, `H₀` is the Hubble constant, and `d` is the distance. The redshift `z` is approximately `v/c`.\n    *   **Distance (d):** 2.1 Gpc = 2100 Mpc.\n    *   **Hubble Constant (H₀):** A commonly accepted value is approximately 70 km/s/Mpc.\n    *   **Recessional Velocity (v):** v = 70 km/s/Mpc × 2100 Mpc = 147,000 km/s.\n    *   **Redshift (z):** z = v/c = 147,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.49.\n    *(The Python code provides a more precise value of z ≈ 0.4903).*\n\n2.  **De-redshift the Energy:** The relationship between observed energy (`E_obs`) and rest-frame energy (`E_rest`) is `E_rest = E_obs × (1 + z)`.\n    *   `E_rest` = (3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV) × (1 + 0.49)\n    *   `E_rest` ≈ 5.81 * 10⁻⁶ eV.\n    *(The Python code provides a more precise value of E_rest ≈ 5.812 × 10⁻⁶ eV).*\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Spectral Line\n\nNow we must identify a common spectral line from the interstellar medium with an energy of approximately 5.8 × 10⁻⁶ eV. This extremely low energy is characteristic of a hyperfine transition.\n\n*   The most significant spectral line in this energy range is the **21-cm line of neutral atomic hydrogen (H I)**. This line is created by the spin-flip transition of the electron in a hydrogen atom.\n*   Let's calculate the theoretical energy of the 21-cm line: Its frequency is 1420.4 MHz. Using `E = hν`, where `h` is Planck's constant, the energy is approximately 5.87 × 10⁻⁶ eV.\n\nOur calculated rest-frame energy (≈5.81 × 10⁻⁶ eV) is an excellent match for the energy of the 21-cm hydrogen line (≈5.87 × 10⁻⁶ eV).\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Interstellar Medium\n\nThe line is identified as the 21-cm line of atomic hydrogen. The question specifies that it is an **absorption line**. We need to determine which phase of the atomic interstellar medium produces this line in absorption.\n\n*   **21-cm Emission:** Originates from the widespread, diffuse **Warm Atomic Interstellar Medium** (also called the Warm Neutral Medium, WNM).\n*   **21-cm Absorption:** Occurs when a background radio source shines through a cool, dense cloud of neutral hydrogen. The cool gas absorbs the radio waves at the 21-cm wavelength. This absorption specifically traces the **Cold Atomic Interstellar Medium** (also called the Cold Neutral Medium, CNM).\n\nSince the observation is of an *absorption* line, it traces the cold atomic interstellar medium.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n\n*   A) Warm atomic interstellar medium: Incorrect. This produces 21-cm emission.\n*   B) Cold molecular interstellar medium: Incorrect. This is atomic hydrogen, not molecular.\n*   C) Warm molecular interstellar medium: Incorrect.\n*   D) **Cold atomic interstellar medium:** Correct. This produces the 21-cm line in absorption.\n\n<<<D>>>"
