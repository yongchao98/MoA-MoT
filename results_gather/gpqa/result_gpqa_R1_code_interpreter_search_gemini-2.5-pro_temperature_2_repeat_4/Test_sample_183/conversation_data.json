    "This is a multistep synthesis problem. The goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Structure:** The parent name is benzene. It has three substituents:\n    1.  `ethoxy` (-OCH2CH3)\n    2.  `tert-butyl` (-C(CH3)3)\n    3.  `nitro` (-NO2)\n*   **Numbering and IUPAC Name:** According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, we number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. The substituents are then listed alphabetically. The name `2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene` corresponds to a structure where the ethoxy group is at C1, the tert-butyl group is at C2, and the nitro group is at C3. This is a vicinal (1,2,3) substitution pattern.\n\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    *   **Ethoxy (-OEt):** Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **tert-Butyl (-tBu):** Weak activator, *ortho, para*-director. Due to its large size, it strongly favors *para* substitution.\n    *   **Nitro (-NO2):** Strong deactivator, *meta*-director.\n    *   **Amine (-NH2):** Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **Hydroxyl (-OH):** Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **Sulfonic Acid (-SO3H):** Strong deactivator, *meta*-director. Can be used as a removable blocking group.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n**Option A:**\n*   i) HNO3/H2SO4: Benzene -> Nitrobenzene. (Correct)\n*   ii) Fe/HCl: Nitrobenzene -> Aniline. (Correct)\n*   iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on Aniline: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. **This reaction fails.** The lone pair on the nitrogen of aniline acts as a Lewis base and coordinates with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This forms a strongly deactivated complex, [-NH2-AlCl3]+, which prevents the electrophilic substitution from occurring.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option A is incorrect due to a failed reaction step.\n\n**Option D:**\n*   i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene. (Correct)\n*   ii) HNO3/H2SO4: tert-Butylbenzene -> 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene (major product). (Correct)\n*   iii) SO3/H2SO4: 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. (Correct, sulfonation occurs ortho to the t-Bu and meta to the NO2).\n*   iv) NaNO2/HCl: This reagent is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The substrate at this point, 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid, does not have an amine group. **This reaction is incorrect as written.**\n*   **Conclusion:** Option D is incorrect due to an inapplicable reaction.\n\n**Option B:**\n*   This option follows a blocking group strategy:\n    *   i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: -> tert-Butylbenzene.\n    *   ii) SO3/H2SO4: -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (para-blocking).\n    *   iii) HNO3/H2SO4: -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid (ortho-nitration).\n    *   iv) Fe/HCl: -> 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (nitro reduction).\n    *   v) NaNO2/HCl: -> 2-diazonium-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (diazotization).\n*   The steps up to this point are chemically sound. However, the subsequent step is:\n    *   vi) HNO3/H2SO4: Applying strong nitrating conditions to a diazonium salt is not a standard or logical transformation. Diazonium salts are generally unstable and would likely decompose under these conditions, and HNO3 is not a reagent for any of the standard Sandmeyer-type replacements.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option B contains a nonsensical reaction step and is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\nLet's analyze the sequence presented in option C. (Note: The provided options have up to 9 steps, some of which seem redundant. Let's analyze the core transformation).\n*   i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Benzene -> **tert-Butylbenzene**. (Correct)\n*   ii) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The major product is **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene** due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group favoring para substitution.\n*   iii) Fe/HCl: Reduction of the nitro group -> **4-tert-butylaniline**. (Correct)\n*   iv) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. For this to be a high-yield reaction, the amine must first be protected (e.g., via acetylation to form an acetanilide) to prevent oxidation and moderate its reactivity. The -NHAc group directs ortho. The only available ortho positions are C2 and C6, so nitration yields **2-nitro-4-tert-butylacetanilide**. (Correct, assuming protection/deprotection).\n*   v) NaNO2/HCl: Diazotization of the amino group (after deprotection) -> **2-nitro-4-tert-butyldiazonium chloride**. (Correct)\n*   vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat: Replacement of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group -> **2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**. (Correct)\n*   vii) NaOH/EtBr: Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol to an ether -> **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**. (Correct)\n\nLet's examine the product of this synthesis: `1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene`.\nNow let's compare it to the target molecule: `2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`, which is `1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene`.\nThe synthesized product (`OEt@1, NO2@2, tBu@4`) is an **isomer** of the target product (`OEt@1, tBu@2, NO2@3`).\n\n**Reconciliation:**\nWe have analyzed all four options:\n*   A, B, and D contain steps that are fundamentally incorrect (forbidden reaction, inapplicable reagent, nonsensical step).\n*   C outlines a logical and plausible multi-step synthesis. However, it leads to a structural isomer of the desired product.\n\nIn multiple-choice chemistry questions of this nature, it is common for there to be an error in the question itself, specifically in the name of the target compound. Given that sequence C is a coherent and valid synthesis pathway, while the others are not, it is the most probable intended answer. The discrepancy suggests the question should have asked for the synthesis of **4-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-2-nitrobenzene** or **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n\nTherefore, despite the final product mismatch, Option C represents the only viable chemical pathway among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>"
