    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Part 1: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism (A)**\n\n1.  **Analyze Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where two structures (tautomers) can readily interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the migration of a proton (H+) from an alpha-carbon (a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group) to the carbonyl oxygen, along with a shift of a double bond. For keto-enol tautomerism to occur, there must be at least one hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized alpha-carbon.\n\n2.  **Analyze Benzoquinone:** The structure of 1,4-benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two carbonyl (C=O) groups at opposite ends.\n    *   The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds. These alpha-carbons are sp²-hybridized and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached that can be easily removed to form an enol.\n    *   Since there is no alpha-hydrogen on an sp³ carbon, benzoquinone cannot undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** The structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl (C=O) groups separated by methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   The carbon atoms of the methylene groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are alpha to two carbonyl groups. These are sp³-hybridized carbons.\n    *   The hydrogens on these methylene groups are highly acidic and readily available for tautomerization.\n    *   In fact, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione exists in equilibrium with its enol tautomer, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). This enol form is aromatic and therefore exceptionally stable, meaning the compound exhibits tautomerism to a very large extent.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A:** Benzoquinone is the compound that does not show tautomerism. Therefore, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism (B)**\n\n1.  **Analyze Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n2.  **Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n    *   This carbon is attached to four distinct groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. Therefore, it will have two enantiomers (mirror images) and will show optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Dimethyl fumarate:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups in a *trans* configuration across the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers.\n    *   It possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane containing all the atoms except for some hydrogens of the methyl groups) and a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C bond.\n    *   Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and its mirror image is superimposable on itself. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism. (It does have a geometric isomer, dimethyl maleate, but this is a different type of stereoisomerism).\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the compound that will show optical isomerism. Therefore, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Combination:**\n*   A (does not show tautomerism) = benzoquinone\n*   B (shows optical isomerism) = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThis combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
