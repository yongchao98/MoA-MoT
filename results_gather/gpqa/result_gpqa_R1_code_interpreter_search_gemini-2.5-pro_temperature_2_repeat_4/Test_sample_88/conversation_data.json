    "**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence to determine the structure of Product 3.**\n\n    *   **Reaction 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane to Product 1.**\n        *   The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane.\n        *   The reaction conditions are high temperature (240°C) and a strong base (KOH).\n        *   The spectral data for Product 1 (a light yellow solid) show a molecular formula of C10H14O (based on the ¹H NMR integration of 14H, implying the two Br atoms are replaced by one O atom), and an IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a ketone (C=O).\n        *   Reactions of 1,3-dihalo-adamantanes with a strong base at high temperatures are known to cause skeletal rearrangements. A common product from 1,3-dibromoadamantane under such conditions is a rearranged ketone, such as 4-protoadamantanone (tricyclo[4.3.1.0(3,8)]decan-4-one). While the provided ¹H NMR data for Product 1 (especially the δ 4.79 ppm signal) does not perfectly match literature values for 4-protoadamantanone, the class of compound (a C10H14O rearranged ketone) is strongly suggested by the reaction type and the IR spectrum.\n\n    *   **Reaction 2: Product 1 to Product 2.**\n        *   Product 1 (a ketone) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide [Al(OiPr)₃]. This reagent is used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts a ketone to an alcohol.\n        *   So, the ketone group in Product 1 is reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH). The initial product is an alcohol, C10H16O.\n\n    *   **Reaction 3: Product 2 to Product 3.**\n        *   Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS). This is a reductive ozonolysis reaction, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C).\n        *   This implies that Product 2 must be an alkene. How can an alkene be formed from a ketone via MPV reduction? The MPV reaction is performed with heating. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid. These conditions are suitable for the dehydration of the alcohol formed from the reduction. This is especially likely if the alcohol is tertiary or if the resulting alkene is more stable (e.g., relieves ring strain).\n        *   So, the reaction sequence is: **Ketone (P1) --(reduction)--> Alcohol --(dehydration)--> Alkene (P2)**.\n        *   If Product 1 is 4-protoadamantanone, it is reduced to 4-protoadamantanol. Dehydration of this alcohol would yield protoadamantene (specifically, protoadamant-4-ene). So, Product 2 is protoadamantene (C10H14).\n\n    *   **Formation of Product 3.**\n        *   Product 3 is formed by the ozonolysis of Product 2 (protoadamantene). Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond, and reductive workup (DMS) yields two carbonyl groups (aldehydes or ketones).\n        *   The ozonolysis of protoadamant-4-ene is a known reaction that breaks open one of the rings in the strained tricyclic system to yield a more stable bicyclic product. The literature confirms that this reaction produces **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde**. This is Product 3.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3.**\n\n    *   **Structure of Product 3:** Bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde. This molecule has a high degree of symmetry (C2v point group). It consists of two six-membered rings fused in a double-chair conformation. The aldehyde groups (-CHO) are at the C3 and C7 positions. Due to steric hindrance, the bulky aldehyde groups will preferentially occupy the equatorial positions on the chair rings.\n\n    *   **Identify the Most Deshielded Hydrogen Atom:**\n        *   The molecule contains several types of protons: aldehyde protons (-CHO), methine protons on the carbons bearing the aldehyde groups (H3 and H7), bridgehead methine protons (H1 and H5), and methylene protons (H2, H4, H6, H8, H9).\n        *   The most deshielded protons are the aldehyde protons themselves (δ ≈ 9-10 ppm).\n        *   The question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom, *excluding those that will exchange with a deuterated solvent*. While aldehyde protons don't typically exchange, this phrasing is often used to direct attention away from protons like -OH, -NH, and sometimes -CHO, to focus on the C-H protons of the skeleton. Furthermore, if we were to consider the aldehyde proton, it is coupled only to the adjacent methine proton (H3 or H7) and would be a doublet. \"Doublet\" is not among the options, confirming we should look at a proton on the carbon skeleton.\n        *   The next most deshielded protons are those alpha (α) to the electron-withdrawing aldehyde groups. These are the methine protons at C3 and C7 (H3 and H7). Due to the molecule's symmetry, H3 and H7 are chemically and magnetically equivalent. We need to determine their coupling pattern.\n\n    *   **Determine the Coupling Pattern of H3 (or H7):**\n        *   We will analyze H3, assuming the molecule is in its stable double-chair conformation with the -CHO group equatorial. This places the H3 proton in an axial position.\n        *   The H3 proton is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Each of these carbons has two diastereotopic protons: one axial (ax) and one equatorial (eq).\n        *   Therefore, the axial H3 proton is vicinally coupled to four neighboring protons: H2ax, H2eq, H4ax, and H4eq.\n        *   The magnitude of vicinal coupling (³J) depends on the dihedral angle (Karplus relationship):\n            *   **Axial-Axial Coupling (H3ax - H2ax and H3ax - H4ax):** The dihedral angle is ~180°. This gives a large coupling constant, J_ax,ax ≈ 10-13 Hz.\n            *   **Axial-Equatorial Coupling (H3ax - H2eq and H3ax - H4eq):** The dihedral angle is ~60°. This gives a small coupling constant, J_ax,eq ≈ 2-5 Hz.\n        *   Due to the C2v symmetry of the molecule, the coupling of H3 to the C2 protons is identical to its coupling to the C4 protons.\n            *   So, we have two large, identical couplings (to H2ax and H4ax).\n            *   And we have two small, identical couplings (to H2eq and H4eq).\n        *   The splitting pattern is determined by applying the n+1 rule for each set of equivalent couplings:\n            *   The two large couplings (J ≈ 12 Hz) to the two axial protons will split the H3 signal into a **triplet** (n=2, so n+1=3).\n            *   Each line of this triplet is then further split by the two small couplings (J ≈ 3 Hz) to the two equatorial protons. This will split each line into another **triplet**.\n        *   The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion on Options:**\n        *   A) doublet of triplets: Incorrect. Arises from coupling to one unique proton and a set of two equivalent protons.\n        *   B) triplet: Incorrect. Arises from coupling to two equivalent protons.\n        *   C) pentet: Incorrect. Arises from coupling to four equivalent protons. This would only happen if the ring were rapidly flipping (fluxional) to average all couplings, or if H3 were equatorial, making all vicinal couplings small and accidentally similar. The static double-chair is the most likely conformation to consider.\n        *   D) triplet of triplets: Correct. Arises from coupling to two sets of two equivalent protons, with a different coupling constant for each set. This matches our analysis perfectly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
