    "This problem requires a careful analysis of the stereochemistry of two reactions and the subsequent separation of the products using two different types of HPLC.\n\nLet's break down each reaction:\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H₃O⁺\n\nThis two-step sequence is an **anti-dihydroxylation** of an alkene. The first step, reaction with mCPBA, is a syn-addition of an oxygen atom to form an epoxide. The second step, acid-catalyzed ring-opening by water, is an anti-addition of the second hydroxyl group. The net result is the addition of two hydroxyl groups across the double bond in an anti-fashion.\n\n1.  **Starting Material**: (E)-oct-4-ene is a trans-alkene. It is achiral as it possesses a C₂ rotational axis of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n2.  **Stereochemical Rule**: The anti-addition of two identical groups to a trans-alkene results in a **meso** compound.\n    *   **Step-by-step confirmation:**\n        *   Epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene (trans) with mCPBA (syn-addition) yields a racemic mixture of trans-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n        *   Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis (anti-addition of H₂O) of this racemic mixture opens the epoxides. Let's analyze one enantiomer, (4R,5R)-epoxide:\n            *   Attack by H₂O at C4 (which is R) causes an inversion of configuration, leading to an S configuration at C4. The configuration at C5 (R) is unchanged. The product is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n            *   Attack by H₂O at C5 (which is R) causes an inversion, leading to an S configuration at C5. The configuration at C4 (R) is unchanged. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   The two potential products, (4R,5S)-diol and (4S,5R)-diol, are in fact the same single molecule because it is a meso compound (it has stereocenters but is achiral due to a center of inversion). The reaction of the other epoxide enantiomer, (4S,5S)-epoxide, also yields the same meso diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 1**: A single product is formed, which is the meso compound, **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (which can be named (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol). Let's call this compound **M**.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H₃O⁺\n\nThis is also an anti-dihydroxylation reaction.\n\n1.  **Starting Material**: (Z)-oct-4-ene is a cis-alkene. It is achiral as it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Stereochemical Rule**: The anti-addition of two identical groups to a cis-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n    *   **Step-by-step confirmation:**\n        *   Epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene (cis) with mCPBA (syn-addition) yields a single achiral meso epoxide: meso-4,5-epoxyoctane (which can be named (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n        *   Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis (anti-addition of H₂O) of this meso-epoxide:\n            *   Attack by H₂O at C4 (which is R) causes an inversion to S. The configuration at C5 (S) is unchanged. The product is (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n            *   Attack by H₂O at C5 (which is S) causes an inversion to R. The configuration at C4 (R) is unchanged. The product is (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   The two products, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, are enantiomers. Since attack at the two equivalent carbons (C4 and C5) is equally likely, a 50:50 mixture is formed.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 2**: A racemic mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. Let's call them **P** and **P'**.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n*   **M**: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n*   **P**: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n*   **P'**: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\nThe relationships between these isomers are:\n*   **P** and **P'** are **enantiomers**.\n*   **M** is a **diastereomer** of both **P** and **P'**. (For example, compare M=(4R,5S) to P=(4R,5R); they have the same configuration at C5 but different configurations at C4).\n\n### HPLC Analysis\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC**:\n    *   Achiral HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated. Therefore, compound **M** will have a different retention time from **P** and **P'**.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, **P** and **P'** will have the exact same retention time and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**: one for M, and one for the P/P' pair.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC**:\n    *   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment where enantiomers can interact differently and thus be separated.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (**P** and **P'**) will be separated into two distinct peaks.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (**M** vs. **P** and **P'**) are also separated.\n    *   **Compound M** is achiral (meso), so it will appear as a single peak.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The chiral HPLC will resolve all three unique stereoisomers. It will show **3 peaks**: one for M, one for P, and one for P'.\n\n### Summary of Observations\n\n*   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
