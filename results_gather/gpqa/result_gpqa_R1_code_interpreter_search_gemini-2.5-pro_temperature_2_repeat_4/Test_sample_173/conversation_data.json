    "An atomic nucleus of mass M has a rest-mass energy $E_0 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$.\nThis nucleus fissions into two fragments, with rest masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n\n**1. Determine the properties of the fragments:**\n\n*   **Mass relation:** One fragment is 2 times more massive than the other. Let $m_1$ be the more massive fragment.\n    $m_1 = 2m_2$\n*   **Sum of masses:** The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass M.\n    $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n\nWe can solve for $m_1$ and $m_2$ in terms of M:\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n$3m_2 = 0.99M \\implies m_2 = 0.33M$\nAnd for the more massive fragment:\n$m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33M) = 0.66M$\n\nNow, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1: $m_1c^2 = 0.66(Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2: $m_2c^2 = 0.33(Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**2. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value):**\n\nThe Q-value of the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy. This difference is converted into the total kinetic energy ($T_{total} = T_1 + T_2$) of the fragments.\n\n$Q = T_1 + T_2 = (\\text{Initial rest-mass energy}) - (\\text{Final rest-mass energy})$\n$Q = Mc^2 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV})$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**3. Calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment ($T_1$) using classical approximation:**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is $T = p^2/(2m)$.\nThe initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum is zero. By conservation of momentum, the fragments must fly apart with equal and opposite momenta.\n$p_1 = p_2 = p$\n\nSo, we have:\n$T_1 = \\frac{p^2}{2m_1}$ and $T_2 = \\frac{p^2}{2m_2}$\n\nFrom this, we can find the ratio of their kinetic energies:\n$\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{p^2/2m_1}{p^2/2m_2} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1}$\nSince $m_1 = 2m_2$, we have $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{m_2}{2m_2} = \\frac{1}{2}$, which means $T_2 = 2T_1$.\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy:\n$T_1 + T_2 = Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$T_1 + 2T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$3T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$T_{1, classical} = 1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**4. Calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment ($T_1$) using the correct relativistic formula:**\n\nThe relationship between relativistic total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass ($m_0$) is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\nThe total energy is the sum of kinetic energy (T) and rest-mass energy ($m_0c^2$): $E = T + m_0c^2$.\nSubstituting this into the energy-momentum relation:\n$(T + m_0c^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$\n$T^2 + 2T(m_0c^2) + (m_0c^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$\n$(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2T(m_0c^2)$\n\nFrom momentum conservation, $p_1 = p_2$, so $(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$.\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = T_2^2 + 2T_2(m_2c^2)$\n\nWe also know that $T_2 = Q - T_1 = 3 - T_1$. Let's substitute this and the rest-mass energy values (in GeV):\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(198) = (3 - T_1)^2 + 2(3 - T_1)(99)$\n$T_1^2 + 396T_1 = (9 - 6T_1 + T_1^2) + (594 - 198T_1)$\n\nThe $T_1^2$ terms on both sides cancel out:\n$396T_1 = 9 - 6T_1 + 594 - 198T_1$\n$396T_1 = 603 - 204T_1$\n$396T_1 + 204T_1 = 603$\n$600T_1 = 603$\n$T_1 = \\frac{603}{600} \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThe correct relativistic kinetic energy is $T_1 = 1.005 \\text{ GeV} = 1005 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**5. Find the difference:**\n\nDifference = (Correct relativistic value) - (Classical approximation value)\nDifference = $T_1 - T_{1, classical}$\nDifference = $1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n```python\n# Initial values\nM_c2 = 300  # Initial rest-mass energy in GeV\n\n# Fragment rest-mass energies\n# m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M and m1 = 2 * m2\n# 3 * m2 = 0.99 * M => m2 = 0.33 * M\n# m1 = 0.66 * M\nm1_c2 = 0.66 * M_c2  # Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment\nm2_c2 = 0.33 * M_c2  # Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment\n\n# Q-value (total kinetic energy released)\nQ = M_c2 - (m1_c2 + m2_c2)\n\n# --- Classical Calculation ---\n# From momentum conservation (p1=p2) and classical T=p^2/(2m), we get m1*T1 = m2*T2.\n# So, T2 = (m1/m2)*T1 = 2*T1.\n# Since T1 + T2 = Q, we have T1 + 2*T1 = Q, which gives 3*T1 = Q.\nT1_classical_GeV = Q / 3\nT1_classical_MeV = T1_classical_GeV * 1000\n\n# --- Relativistic Calculation ---\n# From relativistic momentum conservation p1=p2, we have:\n# T1^2 + 2*T1*m1_c2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2_c2\n# Using T2 = Q - T1, we can solve for T1.\n# The resulting formula is: T1 = (Q^2 + 2*Q*m2_c2) / (2 * (m1_c2 + m2_c2 + Q))\n# The denominator (m1_c2 + m2_c2 + Q) is simply the initial energy M_c2.\nT1_relativistic_GeV = (Q**2 + 2 * Q * m2_c2) / (2 * M_c2)\nT1_relativistic_MeV = T1_relativistic_GeV * 1000\n\n# --- Difference ---\ndifference_MeV = T1_relativistic_MeV - T1_classical_MeV\n\nprint(f\"{difference_MeV=}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\ndifference_MeV=5.0\n</execute_result>\nThe difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy ($T_1$) and the value calculated using the classical approximation ($T_{1, classical}$) is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "An atomic nucleus with a rest-mass energy of $E_0 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$ is initially at rest. It fissions into two fragments with rest masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n\n**1. Determine Fragment Masses and Energies**\n\n*   **Mass Relationship:** We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let $m_1$ be the mass of the more massive fragment.\n    $m_1 = 2m_2$\n*   **Sum of Masses:** The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass M.\n    $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n*   **Solving for Masses:** Substitute the first equation into the second:\n    $2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99M \\implies m_2 = 0.33M$\n    And for the more massive fragment:\n    $m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33M) = 0.66M$\n*   **Calculating Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    *   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1: $m_1c^2 = 0.66(Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2: $m_2c^2 = 0.33(Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released in the fission (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest energy and the final total rest energy. This released energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n$Q = T_{total} = T_1 + T_2 = (\\text{Initial rest energy}) - (\\text{Final rest energy})$\n$Q = Mc^2 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV}) = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**3. Calculate Kinetic Energy ($T_1$) using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Momentum Conservation:** The initial nucleus is at rest, so the initial total momentum is zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta after the fission.\n    $p_1 = p_2 = p$\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is $T = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$.\n*   **Relating Kinetic Energies:** We can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n    $\\frac{T_{1, classical}}{T_{2, classical}} = \\frac{p^2/(2m_1)}{p^2/(2m_2)} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{m_2}{2m_2} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n    This means $T_{2, classical} = 2T_{1, classical}$.\n*   **Solving for $T_1$:** Using the total kinetic energy:\n    $T_{1, classical} + T_{2, classical} = Q$\n    $T_{1, classical} + 2T_{1, classical} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $3T_{1, classical} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $T_{1, classical} = 1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**4. Calculate Kinetic Energy ($T_1$) using Relativistic Formulas**\n\n*   **Relativistic Momentum-Energy Relation:** The relationship between total energy ($E = T + m_0c^2$) and momentum is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$. From this, we derive the expression for momentum: $(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2T(m_0c^2)$.\n*   **Momentum Conservation:** As before, $p_1 = p_2$, which implies $(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$.\n    $T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = T_2^2 + 2T_2(m_2c^2)$\n*   **Solving for $T_1$:** We know $T_2 = Q - T_1$. Let's substitute the values for $Q$, $m_1c^2$, and $m_2c^2$ (all in GeV):\n    $T_1^2 + 2T_1(198) = (3 - T_1)^2 + 2(3 - T_1)(99)$\n    $T_1^2 + 396T_1 = (9 - 6T_1 + T_1^2) + (594 - 198T_1)$\n    Cancel the $T_1^2$ terms on both sides:\n    $396T_1 = 9 - 6T_1 + 594 - 198T_1$\n    $396T_1 = 603 - 204T_1$\n    $396T_1 + 204T_1 = 603$\n    $600T_1 = 603$\n    $T_1 = \\frac{603}{600} \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV} = 1005 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**5. Find the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\nDifference = (Correct $T_1$) - (Classical $T_1$)\nDifference = $1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n<<<A>>>"
