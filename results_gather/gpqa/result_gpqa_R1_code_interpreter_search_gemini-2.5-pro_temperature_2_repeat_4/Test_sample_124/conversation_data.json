    "An isotropic three-dimensional harmonic oscillator is a system described by the potential $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$. The Schrödinger equation for this system is separable in Cartesian coordinates, meaning the total energy is the sum of the energies of three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators.\n\n1.  **Energy Eigenvalues:**\n    The energy of a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator in the state $n_i$ is given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n    For a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of the energies from the three dimensions (x, y, z):\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E_n = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n    Let the principal quantum number for the 3D oscillator be $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels are then given by:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$\n\n2.  **Identifying the Energy States:**\n    *   **Ground State:** This corresponds to the lowest possible energy, which is for $n=0$.\n        $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** This is for $n=1$.\n        $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** This is for $n=2$.\n        $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** This is for $n=3$.\n        $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n    So, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n3.  **Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of different quantum states (linearly independent eigenfunctions) that have the same energy. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of different combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ such that their sum is $n=3$.\n\n    We can list the combinations for $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$:\n    *   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n        (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) -> 3 states\n    *   One quantum number is 2, one is 1, one is 0:\n        (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) -> 6 states\n    *   All three quantum numbers are 1:\n        (1, 1, 1) -> 1 state\n\n    The total number of states (degeneracy) is the sum of these possibilities: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n    Alternatively, the degeneracy of the n-th level for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by the formula:\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n    For the third excited state, n = 3:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy (degeneracy) is 10. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
