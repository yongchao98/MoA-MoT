    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nWe need to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M strong acid required to completely dissolve 0.1 g of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, in a final volume of 100 cm3 at 25°C. We also need to find the pH of this final solution.\n\n**2. Stoichiometric Reaction**\nFirst, consider the neutralization reaction between the base Fe(OH)3 and the strong acid (represented by H+):\nFe(OH)3(s) + 3H+(aq) -> Fe^3+(aq) + 3H2O(l)\nThis tells us that 1 mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ for complete neutralization.\n\n**3. Moles of Fe(OH)3**\nWe need to calculate the number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3.\n*   Molar mass of Fe = 55.845 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of O = 15.999 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of H = 1.008 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of Fe(OH)3 = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n\nNow, calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3:\nMoles = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol = 0.0009357 mol\n\n**4. Stoichiometric Amount of Acid**\nFrom the reaction stoichiometry, we need 3 times the moles of H+ as we have moles of Fe(OH)3.\nMoles of H+ for neutralization = 3 * 0.0009357 mol = 0.002807 mol.\n\nVolume of 0.1 M acid for neutralization = moles / concentration = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm3.\n\n**5. The Equilibrium Condition for Dissolution**\nJust neutralizing the Fe(OH)3 is not enough. The dissolution of Fe(OH)3 is an equilibrium:\nFe(OH)3(s) <=> Fe^3+(aq) + 3OH-(aq)\n\nThis equilibrium is governed by the solubility product constant, Ksp. To ensure the solid remains dissolved, the ion product, Qsp = [Fe^3+][OH-]^3, must be less than or equal to Ksp. The \"minimum volume\" of acid implies we are at the limit of solubility, so Qsp = Ksp.\nA literature value for Ksp of Fe(OH)3 at 25°C is Ksp ≈ 2.79 x 10^-39.\n\nSo, we need to add *excess* acid (more than the 28.07 cm3 for neutralization) to keep the [OH-] concentration low enough. This means the correct volume will be greater than 28.07 cm3, which eliminates options B and C.\n\n**6. Hydrolysis of Fe^3+**\nOnce dissolved, the Fe^3+ ion hydrolyzes in water, which also affects the pH by producing H+ ions:\nFe^3+(aq) + H2O(l) <=> Fe(OH)^2+(aq) + H+(aq)\nThis is an acidic equilibrium with a constant Ka ≈ 6.3 x 10^-3.\n\nThe final pH of the solution is determined by two sources of H+: the excess strong acid added and the H+ from this hydrolysis.\n\n**7. Solving the System of Equilibria**\nThis is a complex problem involving three simultaneous equilibria (Ksp, Ka, and Kw for water). A rigorous solution would involve solving a complex polynomial. However, in multiple-choice questions, it is often more efficient to test the options for self-consistency.\n\nLet's test the remaining options, A and D. We will assume the values in an option are correct and check if they lead to a consistent chemical state based on the equilibrium principles. The most reliable method is to calculate the amount of \"excess acid\" required in two different ways and see if they match.\n\n*   **Method 1: [H+]_excess from Volume:** The excess acid concentration is the concentration of H+ that would be present after neutralization but before hydrolysis.\n    `Moles H+ added = 0.1 M * (V_cm3 / 1000)`\n    `Moles H+ for neutralization = 0.002807 mol`\n    `Moles H+ excess = (Moles H+ added) - (Moles H+ for neutralization)`\n    `[H+]_excess = (Moles H+ excess) / 0.1 L`\n\n*   **Method 2: [H+]_excess from pH and Equilibria:** A detailed derivation combining the Ksp and Ka equilibria gives the following relationship:\n    `[H+]_excess = [H+]_final - (Ka * Ksp / Kw^3) * [H+]_final^2`\n    Using the standard constants: `Ka=6.3e-3`, `Ksp=2.79e-39`, `Kw=1e-14`\n    `[H+]_excess = [H+]_final - 17.58 * [H+]_final^2`\n\nNow let's test the options.\n\n**Test Option D: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3**\n*   `[H+]_final = 10^-2.69 = 0.00204 M`\n*   **Method 1 (from Volume):**\n    `Moles H+ added = 0.1 * (30.09 / 1000) = 0.003009 mol`\n    `Moles H+ excess = 0.003009 - 0.002807 = 0.000202 mol`\n    `[H+]_excess = 0.000202 / 0.1 = 0.00202 M`\n*   **Method 2 (from pH):**\n    `[H+]_excess = 0.00204 - 17.58 * (0.00204)^2 = 0.00204 - 0.000073 = 0.00197 M`\n\nThe two calculated values for the excess acid concentration (0.00202 M and 0.00197 M) are very close (a difference of only ~2.5%). This small discrepancy is easily explained by slight variations in the Ksp and Ka values used to create the problem versus the standard literature values used here. This indicates a high likelihood of consistency.\n\n**Test Option A: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3**\n*   `[H+]_final = 10^-3.16 = 0.00069 M`\n*   **Method 1 (from Volume):**\n    `Moles H+ added = 0.1 * (32.14 / 1000) = 0.003214 mol`\n    `Moles H+ excess = 0.003214 - 0.002807 = 0.000407 mol`\n    `[H+]_excess = 0.000407 / 0.1 = 0.00407 M`\n*   **Method 2 (from pH):**\n    `[H+]_excess = 0.00069 - 17.58 * (0.00069)^2 = 0.00069 - 0.000008 = 0.00068 M`\n\nThe two values (0.00407 M and 0.00068 M) are vastly different. Option A is inconsistent.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe pair of values in Option D is the only one that is chemically consistent with the principles of stoichiometry and equilibrium governing this system.\n\n<<<D>>>"
