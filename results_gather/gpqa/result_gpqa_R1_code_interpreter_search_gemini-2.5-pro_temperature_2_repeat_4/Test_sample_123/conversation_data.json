    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Concepts:** The problem involves the decay of unstable particles moving at relativistic speeds. The key concepts are:\n    *   **Radioactive Decay Law:** The number of particles `N` remaining from an initial sample `N₀` after a time `t` is given by `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t/T)`, where `T` is the mean lifetime of the particle *in the frame where the time `t` is measured*.\n    *   **Time Dilation:** A moving particle's lifetime appears longer to a stationary observer. The lifetime in the observer's lab frame (`T_lab`) is related to the particle's intrinsic proper lifetime (`τ`) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`): `T_lab = γ * τ`.\n\n2.  **Define Variables and Set Up the Equations for the First Scenario:**\n    *   Radius of the detector, `R = 30` m.\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`.\n    *   Fraction of particles reaching the detector, `f₁ = N/N₀ = 1/3`.\n    *   The particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" which means their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. So, we can approximate `v ≈ c`.\n    *   The time it takes for a particle to travel from the center to the detector wall in the lab frame is `t_travel = R / v ≈ R / c`.\n    *   The decay equation in the lab frame uses the dilated lifetime `T_lab = γ₁ * τ`.\n    *   Plugging these into the decay law: `f₁ = exp(-t_travel / T_lab)`.\n    *   Substituting the expressions for `t_travel` and `T_lab`:\n        `1/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (γ₁ * τ))`\n        `1/3 = exp(-R / (c * γ₁ * τ))`\n\n3.  **Define Variables and Set Up the Equations for the Second Scenario:**\n    *   The goal is to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n    *   The desired fraction of particles reaching the detector is `f₂ = 2/3`.\n    *   The detector radius `R`, the speed of light `c`, and the proper lifetime `τ` of the particle type remain the same.\n    *   The equation for the second scenario is:\n        `2/3 = exp(-R / (c * γ₂ * τ))`\n\n4.  **Solve the System of Equations:**\n    We now have two equations with the unknown `γ₂` and the combined unknown constant `R/(c*τ)`.\n\n    *   From the first scenario:\n        `ln(1/3) = -R / (c * γ₁ * τ)`\n        `-ln(3) = -R / (20 * c * τ)`\n        `R / (c * τ) = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n    *   From the second scenario:\n        `ln(2/3) = -R / (c * γ₂ * τ)`\n        `-ln(3/2) = -R / (c * γ₂ * τ)`\n        `R / (c * τ) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n    *   Now, we can equate the two expressions for the constant term `R/(c*τ)`:\n        `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n    *   Solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    To get the final numerical answer, we need to calculate the value of the expression. This can be done with a calculator or a simple script.\n\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value for the new Lorentz factor\ngamma_2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(3/2)\n\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n[Execution result]\n54.18531343118968\n\nThe calculated value for `γ₂` is approximately `54.19`.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated value `~54.19` is closest to option C.\n\n    *   A) 40\n    *   B) 28\n    *   C) 54\n    *   D) 68\n\nTherefore, the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem involves relativistic time dilation and particle decay.\n\n**1. Understand the relationship between particle decay, time, and distance.**\n\nThe number of particles `N` that have not decayed after a time `t` is given by the exponential decay law:\n`N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / T)`\nwhere:\n*   `N₀` is the initial number of particles.\n*   `T` is the mean lifetime of the particle *in the frame where time t is measured*.\n\n**2. Apply Time Dilation.**\n\nThe particle's mean lifetime as measured in the laboratory frame (`T_lab`) is dilated (appears longer) compared to its intrinsic lifetime (proper lifetime, `τ`) due to its high velocity. This relationship is given by:\n`T_lab = γ * τ`\nwhere `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\nSo, the decay equation in the lab frame is:\n`N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / (γ * τ))`\n\n**3. Relate Time to Distance.**\n\nThe particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time `t` it takes for them to travel the detector radius `R` is:\n`t = R / v ≈ R / c`\n\nSubstituting this into the decay equation gives the fraction of particles `N/N₀` that reach the detector wall at radius `R`:\n`N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ)) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n**4. Set up equations for the two scenarios.**\n\nLet `K = R / (c * τ)`. This term is a constant because the detector radius, the particle type (and thus its proper lifetime `τ`), and the speed of light `c` do not change between the two scenarios. The equation simplifies to:\n`N/N₀ = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n*   **Scenario 1:**\n    *   Fraction of particles reaching the wall, `N/N₀ = 1/3`.\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`.\n    *   Equation: `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\n*   **Scenario 2:**\n    *   Fraction of particles reaching the wall, `N/N₀ = 2/3`.\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ₂` (this is what we need to find).\n    *   Equation: `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\n**5. Solve for the unknown Lorentz factor `γ₂`.**\n\nFirst, solve for the constant `K` using the equation from Scenario 1:\n`ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n`-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n`K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\nNow, use this value of `K` in the equation for Scenario 2 and solve for `γ₂`:\n`ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n`ln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n\n`γ₂ = - (20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\n`γ₂ = - (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(2) - ln(3))`\n`γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n`γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n`γ₂ = (20 * 1.0986) / ln(1.5)`\n`γ₂ = (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThis value is very close to 54.\n\n**6. Final Answer Selection**\n\nComparing the calculated value of `γ₂ ≈ 54.19` to the given options:\nA) 40\nB) 28\nC) 54\nD) 68\n\nThe closest answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
