    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Principle**: The problem relates the lifetime of a quantum state to its energy. According to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time, a state that exists for a limited time (lifetime, τ) cannot have a perfectly defined energy. There is an inherent uncertainty or \"spread\" in its energy (ΔE), often called the natural linewidth.\n\n2.  **State the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**: The relationship is given by:\n    ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n    *   Δt is the uncertainty in time, which we can take as the lifetime of the state (τ).\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h / 2π).\n\n    For calculations involving the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the energy distribution, a common form of the principle is used:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n3.  **Identify Given Values and Constants**:\n    *   Lifetime of the first state, τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ sec.\n    *   Lifetime of the second state, τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ sec.\n    *   Reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Uncertainty (Linewidth) for Each State**:\n    *   **For State 1**:\n        ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n        ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n        ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **For State 2**:\n        ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n        ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n        ΔE₂ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n5.  **Determine the Condition for Resolving the Energy Levels**:\n    To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, their energy difference (|E₁ - E₂|) must be greater than their energy spreads. The state with the shorter lifetime (τ₁) has a larger energy uncertainty (ΔE₁) and is therefore \"broader\". This broader line is the limiting factor for resolution.\n\n    A common criterion for resolving two peaks is that their separation must be at least comparable to, or greater than, the width of the broader peak. Therefore, the required energy difference is:\n    |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁\n    |E₁ - E₂| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    Even if we use a more generous criterion that the separation must be greater than the average width or a more stringent one that it must be greater than the sum of the widths (ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV), the order of magnitude required for the separation remains 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n6.  **Compare the Required Energy Difference with the Given Options**:\n    We need an energy difference |E₁ - E₂| that is significantly larger than ~7 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   A) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much greater than 7 x 10⁻⁷ eV. (10⁻⁴ eV = 1000 x 10⁻⁷ eV).\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is much smaller than 7 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much smaller than 7 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   D) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than 7 x 10⁻⁷ eV. (10⁻⁸ eV = 0.1 x 10⁻⁷ eV).\n\n7.  **Conclusion**: Only option A provides an energy separation that is large enough to ensure the two energy levels, with their inherent linewidths, can be clearly resolved. The other options are smaller than the natural linewidth of at least one of the states, meaning the energy distributions would overlap too much to be distinguished.\n\nTo confirm the exact calculation, let's use a Python script.\n```python\n# Constants\nh_bar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16  # Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\n\n# Lifetimes of the states\ntau1 = 1e-9   # seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8   # seconds\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (natural linewidth, FWHM) for each state\n# Delta_E = h_bar / tau\ndelta_E1 = h_bar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar_eVs / tau2\n\n# To resolve two levels, the energy difference between them must be larger than their linewidths.\n# The larger linewidth is the limiting factor.\nlimiting_linewidth = max(delta_E1, delta_E2)\n\n# A more conservative condition for being \"clearly resolved\" is that the separation\n# is greater than the sum of the linewidths.\nsum_of_linewidths = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty of State 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty of State 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"The larger linewidth (resolution limit) is: {limiting_linewidth:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"The sum of the linewidths is: {sum_of_linewidths:.4e} eV\")\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing with options:\")\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-4,\n    \"B\": 1e-9,\n    \"C\": 1e-11,\n    \"D\": 1e-8\n}\n\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > sum_of_linewidths:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is large enough to resolve the levels.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is NOT large enough to resolve the levels.\")\n\n```\nExecution output:\nEnergy uncertainty of State 1 (ΔE1): 6.5821e-07 eV\nEnergy uncertainty of State 2 (ΔE2): 6.5821e-08 eV\nThe larger linewidth (resolution limit) is: 6.5821e-07 eV\nThe sum of the linewidths is: 7.2403e-07 eV\n\nComparing with options:\nOption A (1.0e-04 eV) is large enough to resolve the levels.\nOption B (1.0e-09 eV) is NOT large enough to resolve the levels.\nOption C (1.0e-11 eV) is NOT large enough to resolve the levels.\nOption D (1.0e-08 eV) is NOT large enough to resolve the levels.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem is based on the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** for energy and time, which states that a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt, or τ) has an inherent uncertainty or \"spread\" in its energy (ΔE). This relationship is given by:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nFor practical purposes, the energy spread (often called the natural linewidth) is approximated as:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\nwhere:\n*   **ΔE** is the uncertainty in energy.\n*   **τ** is the lifetime of the state.\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainty for each state.**\n\n*   **For State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = **6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n*   **For State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = **6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\n**Step 2: Determine the condition for resolving the two energy levels.**\n\nTo \"clearly resolve\" or distinguish two energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be greater than their energy spreads. The state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy uncertainty (ΔE₁), which is the primary factor limiting the resolution.\n\nA common criterion (Rayleigh criterion for spectroscopy) suggests that the energy separation should be at least as large as the linewidth of the states. To be *clearly* resolved, the separation must be significantly larger than the larger of the two linewidths. Let's compare the options to the largest linewidth, ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   The required energy difference |E₁ - E₂| >> ΔE₁\n*   Therefore, we need |E₁ - E₂| >> 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the given options.**\n\n*   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV:**  This is much, much larger than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.
