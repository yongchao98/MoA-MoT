    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ₁ and λ₂.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions of λ₁ and λ₂:**\n    *   **λ₁:** This is the mean free path of the *gas molecules* colliding with each other. This is the standard definition of mean free path in kinetic theory for a single-component gas.\n    *   **λ₂:** This is the mean free path of the *electrons* from the high-energy beam as they travel through the remaining gas molecules.\n\n2.  **Recall the Mean Free Path Formula:**\n    The general formula for mean free path (λ) is given by:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which is the effective area that a particle presents for a collision.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Scenario for λ₁ (Gas-Gas Collisions):**\n    *   In a gas where all molecules are moving, we must account for their relative velocities. For a single species of gas molecules following a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, this introduces a factor of √2 into the denominator of the standard formula.\n    *   The collision cross-section, σ_gg, for two identical spherical molecules of diameter `d` is πd².\n    *   Therefore, the formula for λ₁ is:\n        **λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) = 1 / (√2 * n * π * d²)**\n        where `n` is the number density of the gas molecules and `d` is their effective diameter.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Scenario for λ₂ (Electron-Gas Collisions):**\n    *   In this case, the projectile is a very high-energy electron (1000 kV) and the target is a gas molecule. The speed of the electron is extremely high, approaching the speed of light, while the gas molecules at room temperature have much lower thermal velocities. Therefore, the gas molecules can be considered effectively stationary targets.\n    *   Because the targets are stationary, the √2 factor (which accounts for relative motion between *two sets* of moving particles) is not applicable here.\n    *   The collision involves an electron (which is, for practical purposes, a point particle in terms of size) and a gas molecule (of diameter `d`). The collision cross-section, σ_eg, is determined by the size of the gas molecule. The effective area for a collision is πr², where `r` is the radius of the molecule (`r = d/2`).\n    *   So, the collision cross-section for an electron hitting a gas molecule is σ_eg ≈ πr² = π(d/2)² = (πd²)/4.\n    *   Therefore, the formula for λ₂ is:\n        **λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg) = 1 / (n * (πd²/4)) = 4 / (n * π * d²)**\n\n5.  **Compare λ₂ and λ₁:**\n    Now we establish a ratio between λ₂ and λ₁:\n    λ₂ / λ₁ = [ 4 / (n * π * d²) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * π * d²) ]\n    λ₂ / λ₁ = 4 * √2\n\n6.  **Calculate the Result and Evaluate Options:**\n    *   We know that √2 is approximately 1.414.\n    *   So, λ₂ / λ₁ ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656.\n    *   This means **λ₂ ≈ 5.66 * λ₁**.\n\n    Let's check this result against the given options:\n    *   A) λ₂ = λ₁ : Incorrect.\n    *   B) λ₂ < λ₁ : Incorrect.\n    *   C) λ₂ >= 1.22 * λ₁ : Correct. Our calculated ratio of ~5.66 is much greater than 1.22.\n    *   D) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁ : Incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:** The mean free path of the electrons (λ₂) is significantly longer than the mean free path of the gas molecules (λ₁). This is due to two factors:\n1.  **Stationary Targets:** The electrons are moving so fast that the gas molecules are effectively stationary, which removes the √2 term from the denominator (increasing MFP by ~1.41x).\n2.  **Smaller Collision Cross-Section:** The effective target area for a point-like electron hitting a molecule is smaller than for two molecules hitting each other (increasing MFP by a factor of 4 in the simple hard-sphere model).\n\nBoth effects combined lead to a much larger mean free path for the electrons. Option C is the only one that reflects this physical reality.\n\n<<<C>>>"
