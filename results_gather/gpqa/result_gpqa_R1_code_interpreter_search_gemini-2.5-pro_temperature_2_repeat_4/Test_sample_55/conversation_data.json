    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules**\n    The problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the state |3,0,0> to |1,0,0> via two electric dipole transitions. We must follow the selection rules for electric dipole transitions:\n    *   Change in the principal quantum number, `n`: `Δn` can be any integer. For decay (spontaneous emission), `n` decreases.\n    *   Change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, `l`: `Δl = ±1`.\n    *   Change in the magnetic quantum number, `m`: `Δm = 0, ±1`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Initial, Intermediate, and Final States**\n    *   Initial state: `|i⟩ = |n=3, l=0, m=0⟩` (a `3s` state).\n    *   Final state: `|f⟩ = |n=1, l=0, m=0⟩` (a `1s` state).\n    *   The transition from `l=0` to `l=0` directly is forbidden because `Δl=0`. It must proceed through an intermediate state `|int⟩ = |n', l', m'⟩` in a two-step process:\n        `|3,0,0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`\n\n3.  **Determine the Properties of the Intermediate State**\n    *   **First Transition:** `|3,0,0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩`\n        *   `Δl = l' - l = l' - 0 = ±1`. Since `l'` must be non-negative, we must have `l' = 1`. The intermediate state must be a `p` state.\n        *   `Δm = m' - m = m' - 0 = m'`. The selection rule is `Δm = 0, ±1`, so `m'` can be `0, 1, -1`.\n        *   The principal quantum number `n'` must be less than 3 for a decay process. The options provided suggest `n'=2`. So the possible intermediate states are `|2,1,0⟩`, `|2,1,1⟩`, and `|2,1,-1⟩`. These are the `2p` orbitals.\n\n    *   **Second Transition:** `|n', l', m'⟩ = |2, 1, m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`\n        *   `Δl = l_final - l' = 0 - 1 = -1`. This satisfies the `Δl = ±1` rule.\n        *   `Δm = m_final - m' = 0 - m'`. This must be `0` or `±1`.\n        *   If `m' = 0`, then `Δm = 0`. Allowed.\n        *   If `m' = 1`, then `Δm = -1`. Allowed.\n        *   If `m' = -1`, then `Δm = 1`. Allowed.\n    *   So, all three potential intermediate states (`|2,1,0⟩`, `|2,1,1⟩`, `|2,1,-1⟩`) can decay to the final state `|1,0,0⟩`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Branching Ratios (Probabilities)**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is the branching ratio for that path compared to all other possible paths. The overall process is the cascade `3s → 2p → 1s`. We need to find the probability of the atom taking a specific intermediate `2p` state.\n\n    *   **Probability of the first step:** `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩`\n        The initial state `|3,0,0⟩` is a `3s` state, which is spherically symmetric (`l=0`). When it decays, there is no preferred direction in space (unless an external field is applied, which is not stated). Therefore, the emission process populates the three possible final `m'` states (`m'=-1, 0, 1`) with equal probability.\n        Let `W(i→f)` be the transition rate. The rates `W(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩)`, `W(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩)`, and `W(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩)` are equal due to the spherical symmetry of the initial state.\n        Let the total rate of decay from `3s` to `2p` be `W_{total}`.\n        `W_{total} = W(m'=-1) + W(m'=0) + W(m'=1)`\n        Since `W(m'=-1) = W(m'=0) = W(m'=1)`, the probability (branching ratio) of transitioning to any single `m'` state is:\n        `P(3s → 2p, specific m') = W(m') / W_{total} = 1/3`.\n\n    *   **Probability of the second step:** `|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`\n        Once the atom is in an intermediate state, say `|2,1,0⟩`, it will decay again. The only dipole-allowed transition to a lower energy level is to the `|1,0,0⟩` (`1s`) state. (There are no `n=1, l=0` or `n=1, l=2` states to decay to). Therefore, the probability of this second step, given that the atom is in a `2p` state, is 1.\n        `P(|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩) = 1` for any `m'`.\n\n    *   **Total Probability for a specific path**\n        The probability of a complete cascade path is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n        Let's take the path given in option A: `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`.\n        `P(path A) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) × P(|2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩)`\n        `P(path A) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3`.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options**\n    *   **A) `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩` and `1/3`**\n        This matches our calculation. The path is valid, and the probability (branching ratio) is correct.\n\n    *   **B) `... → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩` and `2/3`**\n        The probability is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩` and `1/4`**\n        The path is valid, but the probability should be `1/3`, not `1/4`.\n\n    *   **D) `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩` and `1/4`**\n        The path is valid, but the probability should be `1/3`, not `1/4`.\n\nTherefore, option A provides a valid transition route with the correct corresponding probability.\n\n<<<A>>>"
