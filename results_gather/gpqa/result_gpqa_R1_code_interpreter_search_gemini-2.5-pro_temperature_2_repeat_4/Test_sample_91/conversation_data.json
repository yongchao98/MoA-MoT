    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Molar Mass**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2 to determine its molecular formula.\n\n*   `(CH3)2C=`: 1 central Carbon, 2 methyl groups (2 Carbons, 6 Hydrogens). Total: 3 C, 6 H.\n*   `=CH-`: 1 Carbon, 1 Hydrogen.\n*   `-CH2-`: 1 Carbon, 2 Hydrogens.\n*   `-CH(CH3)-`: 1 chain Carbon, 1 methyl group (1 Carbon, 3 Hydrogens). Total: 2 C, 4 H.\n*   `-CH2-`: 1 Carbon, 2 Hydrogens.\n*   `-CH=`: 1 Carbon, 1 Hydrogen.\n*   `=C(CH3)2`: 1 central Carbon, 2 methyl groups (2 Carbons, 6 Hydrogens). Total: 3 C, 6 H.\n\nSumming these up:\n*   Total Carbons (C) = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n*   Total Hydrogens (H) = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\nThe molar mass is calculated using atomic masses (C≈12 g/mol, H≈1 g/mol):\nMolar Mass = (12 * 12) + (22 * 1) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\n**2. Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\nWe need to count all the single and double bonds within the molecule.\n\n*   **C-H bonds**: The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C bonds**: The structure clearly shows two double bonds (`C=C`). So, there are **2** C=C bonds.\n*   **C-C bonds**: These are the single bonds between carbon atoms.\n    *   Bonds connecting methyl groups to the main chain:\n        *   (CH3)2C=: 2 bonds\n        *   -CH(CH3)-: 1 bond\n        *   =C(CH3)2: 2 bonds\n        *   Total from methyl groups = 5 bonds.\n    *   Bonds within the main \"backbone\" of the molecule:\n        *   `=CH-CH2-` : 1 bond\n        *   `-CH2-CH(CH3)-`: 1 bond\n        *   `-CH(CH3)-CH2-`: 1 bond\n        *   `-CH2-CH=`: 1 bond\n        *   Total in backbone = 4 bonds.\n    *   Total C-C single bonds = 5 + 4 = **9**.\n\n*Summary of bonds:*\n*   22 C-H bonds\n*   9 C-C bonds\n*   2 C=C bonds\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) can be calculated using the following formula, which is derived from Hess's law:\n\nΔH_f = [Σ Enthalpies of atomization of elements in standard state] - [Σ Bond energies of the product molecule]\n\n**Step 3a: Calculate the total enthalpy of atomization of the elements.**\nThis is the energy needed to convert the reactants (12 moles of solid Carbon and 11 moles of H2 gas) into gaseous atoms.\nFormation reaction: `12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) -> C12H22(g)`\nEnergy for atomization of elements = `12 * ΔH_atom(C) + 11 * BE(H-H)`\nGiven:\nΔH_atom(C) = 1000 kJ/mol\nBE(H-H) = 100 kJ/mol\nEnergy = (12 * 1000) + (11 * 100) = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ**\n\n**Step 3b: Calculate the total bond energy of the molecule.**\nThis is the energy released when one mole of the gaseous molecule is formed from its gaseous atoms. It is the sum of the bond energies of all bonds in the molecule.\nTotal Bond Energy = `(22 * BE(C-H)) + (9 * BE(C-C)) + (2 * BE(C=C))`\nGiven:\nBE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\nBE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\nBE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\nTotal Bond Energy = (22 * 400) + (9 * 200) + (2 * 300)\nTotal Bond Energy = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**Step 3c: Calculate the enthalpy of formation.**\nΔH_f = (Energy for atomization of elements) - (Total Bond Energy of molecule)\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**4. Compare with the Options**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Now we check the given options:\nA) 11.44 kJ/g\nB) 67.4 kJ/mol\nC) 11200 kJ/mol\nD) 1900 kJ/g\n\nOur calculated value in kJ/mol (1900) does not match option B. Option C (11200 kJ/mol) is the total bond energy of the molecule (enthalpy of atomization), not the enthalpy of formation. Option D has the correct numerical value (1900) but the wrong units (kJ/g instead of kJ/mol).\n\nLet's convert our result to kJ/g using the molar mass we calculated (166 g/mol) to check option A.\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g\n\nThis value is consistent with option A.\n\n```python\n# Number of atoms and bonds\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\nnum_CH_bonds = 22\nnum_CC_bonds = 9\nnum_C_dbl_C_bonds = 2\n\n# Given thermodynamic data (kJ/mol)\ndH_atom_C = 1000\nBE_HH = 100\nBE_CC = 200\nBE_C_dbl_C = 300\nBE_CH = 400\n\n# Enthalpy of atomization of elements: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) -> 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)\ndH_atom_elements = (num_C * dH_atom_C) + (num_H / 2 * BE_HH)\n\n# Enthalpy of atomization of the molecule (sum of bond energies)\ndH_atom_molecule = (num_CH_bonds * BE_CH) + (num_CC_bonds * BE_CC) + (num_C_dbl_C_bonds * BE_C_dbl_C)\n\n# Enthalpy of formation\ndH_f_mol = dH_atom_elements - dH_atom_molecule\n\n# Molar mass (g/mol)\nmolar_mass = (num_C * 12) + (num_H * 1)\n\n# Enthalpy of formation per gram\ndH_f_gram = dH_f_mol / molar_mass\n\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of Formation (kJ/mol): {dH_f_mol}\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of Formation (kJ/g): {dH_f_gram}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\nEnthalpy of Formation (kJ/mol): 1900.0\nEnthalpy of Formation (kJ/g): 11.44578313253012\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation confirms that the enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol, which is equivalent to approximately 11.44 kJ/g. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>",
