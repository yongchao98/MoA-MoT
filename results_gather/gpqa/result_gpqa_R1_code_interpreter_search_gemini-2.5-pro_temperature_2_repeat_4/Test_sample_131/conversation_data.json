    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the Problem Statement**\n\nWe are given the following information about a 1:1 mixture of two isomers with the molecular formula C10H14:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (around 6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (around 2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nThe task is to identify the two compounds from the given options that would produce this combined 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Potential Compound**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four compounds based on their structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Due to the high symmetry, they give a single signal, which is a **singlet** (no adjacent protons to couple with). This signal integrates to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups (at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5) are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal, a **singlet**, integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:**\n        *   Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H)\n        *   Aliphatic: 1 singlet (12H)\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 atoms.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. They give a **single singlet** (no adjacent protons) integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   Methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry (total 6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is on the plane of symmetry and is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is also on the plane of symmetry and is unique (3H).\n        *   This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:**\n        *   Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H)\n        *   Aliphatic: 3 singlets (ratio 2:1:1)\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2-C3 bond and the C5-C6 bond.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Although adjacent, they are magnetically equivalent due to symmetry and thus appear as a **single singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   Methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent by symmetry (total 6H).\n        *   Methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry (total 6H).\n        *   This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:**\n        *   Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H)\n        *   Aliphatic: 2 singlets (ratio 1:1)\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are equivalent, producing a **single singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The signals will not be singlets. The two equivalent CH2 groups will be a **quartet**, and the two equivalent CH3 groups will be a **triplet**. The problem statement specifies only singlets in the aliphatic region, so this compound can be ruled out from any potential mixture.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixtures in the Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that results in:\n*   2 aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio)\n*   3 aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio)\n\nLet's check the options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: Prehnitene (1 singlet, 2H) + Isodurene (1 singlet, 2H) -> 2 singlets, 1:1 ratio. (Matches)\n    *   Aliphatic: Prehnitene (2 singlets) + Isodurene (3 singlets) -> **5 total singlets**. (Does not match)\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   As determined earlier, 1,4-diethylbenzene produces quartets and triplets, which contradicts the given data. (Does not match)\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: Durene (1 singlet, 2H) + Prehnitene (1 singlet, 2H) -> **2 singlets, 1:1 ratio**. (Matches)\n    *   Aliphatic: Durene (1 singlet, 12H) + Prehnitene (2 singlets, 6H+6H) -> This combines to **3 singlets** in total. The integration ratio would be 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. (Matches)\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: Durene (1 singlet, 2H) + Isodurene (1 singlet, 2H) -> 2 singlets, 1:1 ratio. (Matches)\n    *   Aliphatic: Durene (1 singlet) + Isodurene (3 singlets) -> **4 total singlets**. (Does not match)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair whose 1:1 mixture is consistent with all the spectral data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene).\n\n<<<C>>>"
