    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let's determine the empirical formula of Z (CxHy).\n        The mass fraction of H is given by: `mass%(H) = (y * Ar(H)) / (x * Ar(C) + y * Ar(H))`.\n        Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), we get: `0.1428 ≈ y / (12x + y)`.\n        This fraction is very close to 1/7 (`1/7 ≈ 0.142857`).\n        So, `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n        `7y = 12x + y`\n        `6y = 12x`\n        `y = 2x`\n    *   The empirical formula is CH2. The general molecular formula is (CH2)n, or CnH2n.\n    *   This formula corresponds to either an alkene (C=C bond) or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a product of hydrogenation under severe conditions and \"does not react further with hydrogen\". This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   Therefore, Z must be a **cycloalkane** with the formula **CnH2n**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   It \"does not decolorize bromine water\". This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   One component of Y is Z itself, which is a saturated cycloalkane (CnH2n). Let's call this Y1. So, Y1 = Z = CnH2n.\n    *   Mixture Y is formed from mixture X by \"disproportionation\" using a platinum catalyst and heat. Disproportionation is a redox reaction. In hydrocarbon chemistry, this often involves hydrogen transfer, where one molecule is hydrogenated (reduced) and another is dehydrogenated (oxidized).\n    *   The hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only substance Z. This means the other component of Y (let's call it Y2) must also have the same carbon skeleton as Z. Upon hydrogenation, Y2 becomes Z.\n    *   Since Y2 has the same carbon skeleton (a C-n ring) and must be formed by dehydrogenation, it is most likely an aromatic compound. The formula for a simple aromatic compound derived from a CnH2n cycloalkane is **CnH2n-6**. For example, cyclohexane (C6H12) is related to benzene (C6H6). Methylcyclohexane (C7H14) is related to toluene (methylbenzene, C7H8). Aromatic compounds like benzene and toluene do not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions.\n    *   So, Mixture Y consists of **CnH2n** (Z) and **CnH2n-6** in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them X1 and X2.\n    *   X \"decolorizes bromine water\", meaning its components have C=C double bonds. They are unsaturated.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z (CnH2n). This confirms that X1 and X2 also have the same CnH- carbon skeleton as Z. They are therefore cycloalkenes or cycloalkadienes.\n    *   The problem states \"There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X\". This gives a specific structural constraint.\n    *   The reaction `Mixture X -> Mixture Y` is a 1:1 molar reaction, as an *equimolar* mixture X forms an *equimolar* mixture Y. This implies the stoichiometry is `X1 + X2 -> Y1 + Y2`.\n        `X1 + X2 -> CnH2n + CnH2n-6`\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X is reduced to CnH2n, while the other is oxidized to CnH2n-6. For this to work, X1 must be more hydrogenated than Y2 (the aromatic) and X2 must be more hydrogenated than Y2. Also, X1 must be less hydrogenated than Y1 (the cycloalkane). The most logical combination for X1 and X2, which are non-conjugated and have a CnH- skeleton, is a cycloalkene (**CnH2n-2**) and a non-conjugated cycloalkadiene (**CnH2n-4**).\n\n4.  **Balance the Reaction and Find the Solution**\n    *   Let's check if this combination works:\n        `X1 (CnH2n-4) + X2 (CnH2n-2) -> Y1 (CnH2n) + Y2 (CnH2n-6)` (The order of X1, X2 is arbitrary).\n        This does not balance.\n    *   Let's rethink the hydrogen transfer. The overall process must be balanced. Let the hydrogen counts in X1 and X2 be `a` and `b`. The reaction is:\n        `CnH_a + CnH_b -> CnH2n + CnH2n-6`\n        The hydrogen atoms must balance: `a + b = 2n + (2n - 6) = 4n - 6`.\n    *   The question asks for \"the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\", which corresponds to `a + b`. So we need to find the value of `4n - 6`.\n    *   We have to determine 'n'. The problem mentions Z is \"widely used as a solvent\". Both cyclohexane (n=6) and methylcyclohexane (n=7) fit this description and the CnH2n formula with H% ≈ 14.3%. The reaction scheme is plausible for both. In the absence of further information, the most fundamental and simplest example is usually intended. The C6 system (cyclohexane/benzene) is the parent system for this type of chemistry. Let's assume **n=6**.\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane, C6H12\n        *   Y = Equimolar mixture of Cyclohexane (C6H12) and Benzene (C6H6).\n        *   X must be an equimolar mixture of C6 compounds that can react to form Y. Based on our model:\n            *   `X1` would be a cyclohexadiene, C6H8. To be non-conjugated, it must be **cyclohexa-1,4-diene**.\n            *   `X2` would be a cyclohexene, C6H10. The only one is **cyclohexene**.\n        *   The reaction is: `C6H8 + C6H10 -> C6H6 + C6H12`. This is a balanced hydrogen transfer.\n        *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two liquids in mixture X is the sum of hydrogens in C6H8 and C6H10.\n        *   Total H atoms = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\n    *   Alternatively, using the formula `4n - 6`:\n        For n=6, Total H = 4(6) - 6 = 24 - 6 = 18.\n\n5.  **Check the Options**\n    *   The calculated value is 18.\n    *   The given options are A) 18, B) 22, C) 16, D) 12.\n    *   Our result matches option A.\n\n    (Note: If we had chosen n=7, the total H atoms would be 4(7) - 6 = 22, which is option B. However, the C6 system is the most classic and fundamental example for this type of problem.)\n\nThe final answer is the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two molecules of mixture X. This is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>"
