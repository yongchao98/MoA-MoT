    "*   **Step 1: Identify the structure of Compound X from the spectroscopic data.**\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   The very broad peak at `3400–2500 cm-1` is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n        *   The strong peak at `1720 cm-1` is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The peaks at `1610 cm-1` and `1450 cm-1` suggest the presence of a C=C stretch in an aromatic ring.\n        *   Conclusion from IR: The compound is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   `10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)`: This signal, being a broad singlet far downfield, is classic for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the IR analysis.\n        *   `8.0 ppm (d, 2H)` and `7.2 ppm (d, 2H)`: The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   Now let's decipher the alkyl group from the remaining signals: `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`, `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`, `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`, and `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`.\n            *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A triplet indicates a -CH₃ group adjacent to a -CH₂ group (`-CH₂-CH₃`).\n            *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A doublet indicates a -CH₃ group adjacent to a -CH group (`-CH-CH₃`).\n            *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: This multiplet is the -CH₂ group, which is coupled to both the -CH₃ (at 0.9 ppm) and the -CH group.\n            *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: This multiplet is the -CH group. Its downfield shift indicates it is directly attached to the aromatic ring (a benzylic proton). It is coupled to the adjacent -CH₃ (at 1.4 ppm) and -CH₂ (at 1.7 ppm).\n        *   Assembling the alkyl group: The fragments `-CH₂CH₃` and `-CH(CH₃)` are connected at the CH and CH₂ positions, forming a `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃` group, which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Based on all the data, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the reaction and the product.**\n    *   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (P) and hydriodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reaction:** This combination is a powerful reducing agent, specifically used for the complete reduction of carbonyl groups, including those in carboxylic acids, to alkanes.\n    *   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the aromatic ring will be reduced all the way down to a methyl group (-CH₃). The benzene ring and the sec-butyl group will remain unaffected by these reagents.\n    *   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   **Product:** The -COOH group is converted to a -CH₃ group. The product is therefore **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Compare the product with the given options.**\n    *   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material (Compound X).\n    *   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - The alkyl group is incorrect; it is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n    *   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - The structure is incorrect.\n    *   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches the predicted final product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
