    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the unknown compound from its 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n\nLet's examine each signal provided:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon, specifically an acetate group (CH₃-C=O).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** A singlet means these protons are not coupled to any neighboring protons. This is consistent with an isolated acetate methyl group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This peak corresponds to the methyl group of the acetate ester, which is present in all four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal also represents three protons, so it is a methyl group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~1.6 ppm):** This shift is typical for an allylic methyl group (a methyl group attached to a C=C double bond).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** A doublet means this methyl group is coupled to one adjacent proton (n+1 rule: 2 peaks = n+1, so n=1). This indicates a `CH₃-CH=` structural fragment.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal eliminates the butenyl acetate options. Butenyl acetate (`CH₃COOCH=CHCH₂CH₃`) would have a terminal ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`), which would show up as a triplet for the `CH₃` and a quartet for the `CH₂`, not a methyl doublet. Therefore, the compound must be a propenyl acetate.\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This is a single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~5.5 ppm):** This shift is in the vinylic region (a proton on a C=C double bond).\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This is a complex splitting pattern which tells us this proton is being split by two different sets of neighbors.\n        *   The **doublet (\"d\")** part comes from being coupled to one other proton. This must be the other proton on the double bond.\n        *   The **quartet (\"q\")** part comes from being coupled to three equivalent protons (n+1 rule: 4 peaks = n+1, so n=3). This must be the neighboring allylic methyl group (`CH₃`) we identified at 1.6 ppm.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This proton is the one on the double bond that is also adjacent to the methyl group: `=CH-CH₃`.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This is the other single vinylic proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~7.0 ppm):** This proton is significantly downfield (higher ppm value) compared to the other vinylic proton. This is due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent electronegative oxygen atom from the ester group (`-O-CH=`).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This proton is coupled only to the other vinylic proton (at 5.5 ppm).\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the key piece of information to determine the stereochemistry. The magnitude of the coupling constant (J value) between two protons on a double bond is dependent on their geometry:\n        *   **Trans protons:** J values are typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n        *   **Cis protons:** J values are smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The observed J value of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely in the trans range. This confirms the two vinylic protons are on opposite sides of the double bond.\n\n**2. Assembling the Structure:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have:\n*   An acetate group: `CH₃COO-`\n*   A propenyl group with a trans double bond: `-CH=CH-CH₃`\n*   The vinylic proton at 7.0 ppm is attached to the oxygen, and the vinylic proton at 5.5 ppm is attached to the methyl group.\n\nPutting it all together, the structure is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n      H₃C                H\n         \\              /\n          C = C\n         /     \\\n      H₃C-C-O        H\n         ||\n         O\n\n**3. Matching with Options:**\n\n*   A) Trans-butenyl acetate - Incorrect, not a butenyl chain.\n*   B) Cis-propenyl acetate - Incorrect, J value would be smaller.\n*   C) Trans-propenyl acetate - Correct. All data points match this structure.\n*   D) Cis-butenyl acetate - Incorrect, not a butenyl chain and wrong stereochemistry.\n\n<<<C>>>"
