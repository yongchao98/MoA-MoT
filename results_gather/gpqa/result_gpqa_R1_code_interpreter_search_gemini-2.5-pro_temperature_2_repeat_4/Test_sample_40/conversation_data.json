    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   The **Laboratory Frame (S)**: This is the observer's frame of reference, which is considered stationary.\n    *   The **Moving Frame (S')**: This is the frame of reference of the glass, which is moving with a constant velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Determine Velocities in Each Frame:**\n    *   **Velocity of the glass relative to the lab (S):** This is given as `v`.\n    *   **Velocity of the light beam relative to the glass (S'):** In any medium with a refractive index `n`, the speed of light is `c/n`. Since the problem sets the speed of light in vacuum `c=1`, the speed of the light beam as measured within the rest frame of the glass is `u' = 1/n`. The problem states that the beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass is moving.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    Classical (Galilean) velocity addition would simply be `u = u' + v`. However, velocities close to the speed of light must be handled using Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity. The correct formula for adding velocities in the same direction is:\n\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`\n\n    where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in the laboratory frame (S). This is what we need to find.\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in the moving frame (S').\n    *   `v` is the velocity of the moving frame (S') relative to the laboratory frame (S).\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula:**\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    Substituting these into the formula gives:\n\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) * v / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    First, simplify the denominator:\n\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n    To eliminate the fractions within the main fraction, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n\n    `u = n * [ (1/n) + v ] / n * [ 1 + v/n ]`\n\n    Distribute `n` in both the numerator and the denominator:\n\n    `u = ( n*(1/n) + n*v ) / ( n*1 + n*(v/n) )`\n    `u = ( 1 + n*v ) / ( n + v )`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived expression for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n    B) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    C) 1\n    D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\n    Our result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
