    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the correct equation:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical principle:** The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in stellar photospheres, which are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The governing equation for this situation is the **Boltzmann equation**.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation relates the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy states (`N_j` and `N_i`) to the temperature (`T`):\n    `(N_j / N_i) = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    where:\n    *   `N_j` and `N_i` are the number of atoms in the higher energy level `j` and lower energy level `i`, respectively.\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   `ΔE = E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.3806 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `T` is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Apply the equation to each star:** We can write the population ratio for each star using its respective temperature (`T_1` and `T_2`).\n    *   For star_1 (temperature T_1):  `Ratio_1 = (N_j / N_i)_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))`\n    *   For star_2 (temperature T_2):  `Ratio_2 = (N_j / N_i)_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n4.  **Use the information from the problem statement:** The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star_2. This means the ratio of the populations for the specified levels in star_1 is twice that in star_2.\n    `Ratio_1 = 2 * Ratio_2`\n\n5.  **Set up the equation and simplify:** Substitute the expressions from step 3 into the relationship from step 4.\n    `(g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n    Since we are considering the same transition in the same atom (iron), the statistical weight term `(g_j / g_i)` is the same on both sides and can be canceled out.\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n6.  **Solve for the temperatures:** To isolate the temperatures from the exponential function, we take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides.\n    `ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]`\n\n    Using the logarithm properties (`ln(e^x) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`):\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]`\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)`\n\n7.  **Rearrange the equation:** We want to find an expression for `ln(2)`. Let's rearrange the terms.\n    `ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)`\n\n    Factor out the common term `(ΔE / k)`:\n    `(ΔE / k) * (1 / T_2 - 1 / T_1) = ln(2)`\n\n    Combine the fractions inside the parentheses by finding a common denominator (`T_1 * T_2`):\n    `(ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)`\n\n8.  **Substitute the given numerical values:** The problem gives:\n    *   Energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`\n    *   The Boltzmann constant `k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K`\n\n    Now, calculate the ratio `ΔE / k`:\n    `ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 1 K`\n\n    Substitute this value back into our derived equation:\n    `(1 K) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)`\n\n9.  **Final Equation:**\n    `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n    This equation matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
