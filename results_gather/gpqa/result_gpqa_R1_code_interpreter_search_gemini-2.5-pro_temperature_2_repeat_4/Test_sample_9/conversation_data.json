    "*   **Analysis of the Options:**\n\n    1.  **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is essentially Earth. Earth's average density is a benchmark value, approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n    2.  **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is given as about 5.5 g/cm³, which is very close to Earth's density.\n\n    3.  **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** The key concept here is gravitational compression. For a planet with a given composition (e.g., a mix of rock and iron like Earth), a more massive planet will have stronger self-gravity. This increased gravity pulls all the material inward more forcefully, compressing it and leading to a higher overall density. Therefore, a 5-Earth-mass planet with Earth's composition (a \"Super-Earth\") will be significantly denser than Earth. Its density will be greater than 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n    4.  **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Following the same logic as above, a planet with less mass has weaker self-gravity. This results in less compression of its material compared to Earth. Consequently, its density will be lower than Earth's density (< 5.51 g/cm³).\n\n*   **Comparison:**\n\n    *   Planet (a): Density ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Planet (b): Density ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   Planet (c): Density > 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Planet (d): Density < 5.51 g/cm³\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n\n    By comparing the densities, it is clear that the planet described in option (c) has the highest density due to the significant gravitational compression from its large mass.\n\n<<<B>>>"
