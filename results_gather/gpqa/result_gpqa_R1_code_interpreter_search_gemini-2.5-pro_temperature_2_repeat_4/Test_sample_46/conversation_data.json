    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the structure of the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2)\n    *   DoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two medium-to-strong bands in the N-H stretching region are characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂). Primary amines exhibit two bands due to symmetric and asymmetric stretching modes.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is typical for an ester group, especially one that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **IR Conclusion:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) group and a carbonyl group, most likely from an ester.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents three protons, characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** The signal is split into a triplet, which means it is adjacent to a carbon with two protons (a -CH₂- group), according to the n+1 rule (2+1=3).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents two protons, characteristic of a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** The signal is a quartet, meaning it is adjacent to a carbon with three protons (a -CH₃ group) (3+1=4).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This downfield shift indicates the -CH₂- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, such as oxygen.\n    *   **Combined Analysis (1.20 & 4.5 ppm):** The triplet-quartet pair is the classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms it is an ethoxy group attached to a carbonyl, forming an ethyl ester fragment (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents two protons.\n    *   **Shape (bs, broad singlet):** A broad singlet for 2H is highly characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). Broadening is common due to proton exchange and nitrogen's quadrupole moment.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0-8.0 ppm):** These signals are in the aromatic region.\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** There are a total of four protons on the aromatic ring.\n    *   **Splitting (d, doublet & d, doublet):** This pattern is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two protons ortho to one substituent are equivalent and split the two protons ortho to the other substituent (and vice versa), resulting in two doublets.\n    *   The protons at 7.0 ppm are relatively upfield (shielded), suggesting they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (the -NH₂ group). The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield (deshielded), suggesting they are adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester, -COOEt).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a primary amine group (-NH₂).\n*   The other substituent is an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nPutting these pieces together, we get the structure for **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this structure against the options:\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The ester is formed on the phenyl ring's oxygen, which doesn't match the NMR.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, not an ester, and has a secondary amine, not a primary one.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all spectroscopic data and the molecular formula (C₉H₁₁NO₂).\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted amide, which contradicts both the IR and the NMR aromatic pattern.\n\nThe correct structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
