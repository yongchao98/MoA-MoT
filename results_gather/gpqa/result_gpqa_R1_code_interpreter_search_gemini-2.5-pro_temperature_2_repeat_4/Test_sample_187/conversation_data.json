    "The problem asks for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal.\n\nHere's the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Identify the crystal system and given parameters:**\n    *   Crystal System: Rhombohedral (also known as trigonal with a rhombohedral lattice).\n    *   Lattice parameter, a = 10 Angstrom.
