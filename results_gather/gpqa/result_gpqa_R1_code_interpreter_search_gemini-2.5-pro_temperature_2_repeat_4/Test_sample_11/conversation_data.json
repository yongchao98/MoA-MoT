    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principles:**\n    This problem involves a particle decay at rest. The fundamental principles that govern this process are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum. Since the speeds of the product particles can be relativistic, we will use the relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n2.  **Define the States:**\n    *   **Initial State:** A positive pion ($\\pi^+$) is at rest.\n        *   Initial Momentum ($p_i$): $p_{\\pi^+} = 0$.\n        *   Initial Energy ($E_i$): Since the pion is at rest, its total energy is its rest mass energy, $E_{\\pi^+} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2$.\n    *   **Final State:** The pion decays into a positive muon ($\\mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($\\nu$). (Note: To conserve lepton number, this must be a muon neutrino, $\\nu_{\\mu}$, but we'll just call it $\\nu$ as in the question).\n        *   Final Particles: $\\mu^+$ and $\\nu$.\n        *   Final Momenta: $\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+}$ and $\\vec{p}_{\\nu}$.\n        *   Final Energies: $E_{\\mu^+}$ and $E_{\\nu}$.\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n        $p_i = p_f$\n        $0 = \\vec{p}_{\\mu^+} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu}$\n        This implies that the two product particles must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: $|\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}|$. Let's call this momentum magnitude `p`.\n\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:**\n        $E_i = E_f$\n        $E_{\\pi^+} = E_{\\mu^+} + E_{\\nu}$\n        $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = E_{\\mu^+} + E_{\\nu}$  (Equation 1)\n\n4.  **Use the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    The total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass ($m_0$) of a particle are related by:\n    $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$\n\n    *   For the muon ($\\mu^+$):\n        $E_{\\mu^+}^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$  (Equation 2)\n\n    *   For the neutrino ($\\nu$):\n        Neutrinos have a very small mass, which is considered to be zero in this context. So, $m_{\\nu} \\approx 0$.\n        $E_{\\nu}^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\nu}c^2)^2 \\approx (pc)^2$\n        Therefore, $E_{\\nu} \\approx pc$  (Equation 3)\n\n5.  **Solve the System of Equations:**\n    We have the following given values:\n    *   $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = 139.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   $m_{\\mu^+}c^2 = 105.7 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n    Let's substitute $pc$ from Equation 3 into Equation 2:\n    $E_{\\mu^+}^2 = E_{\\nu}^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n\n    From the conservation of energy (Equation 1), we can express $E_{\\mu^+}$ as:\n    $E_{\\mu^+} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - E_{\\nu}$\n\n    Now, substitute this into the previous equation:\n    $(m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - E_{\\nu})^2 = E_{\\nu}^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n\n    Expand the left side:\n    $(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)E_{\\nu} + E_{\\nu}^2 = E_{\\nu}^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n\n    The $E_{\\nu}^2$ terms cancel out. Now, we can solve for $E_{\\nu}$:\n    $(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2 = 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)E_{\\nu}$\n    $E_{\\nu} = \\frac{(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Numerical Values:**\n    Let's use Python to perform the calculations accurately.\n\n    *   First, we'll find the total energy of the neutrino, $E_{\\nu}$.\n    *   Since the neutrino's rest mass is zero, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy: $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu}$.\n    *   Then, we'll find the total energy of the muon, $E_{\\mu^+} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - E_{\\nu}$.\n    *   Finally, the kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest energy: $KE_{\\mu^+} = E_{\\mu^+} - m_{\\mu^+}c^2$.\n\n```python\n# Rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the neutrino (E_nu)\nE_nu = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the massless neutrino is its total energy\nKE_nu = E_nu\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the muon (E_mu)\nE_mu = m_pi_c2 - E_nu\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu)\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu_c2\n\n# Print the kinetic energies of the product particles\n# The standard convention is to list the KE of the heavier particle (muon) first.\nprint(f\"KE of muon: {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino: {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n\n```\nKE of muon: 4.12 MeV\nKE of neutrino: 29.78 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are 4.12 MeV for the muon ($\\mu^+$) and approximately 29.8 MeV for the neutrino ($\\nu$).\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nB) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nC) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nD) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This is a classic problem in relativistic kinematics, specifically involving a two-body decay of a particle at rest.\n\n### **Reasoning and Steps**\n\n1.  **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    Since the initial pion ($\\pi^+$) is stationary, its total momentum is zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the final products must also be zero.\n    $p_{initial} = p_{final}$\n    $0 = \\vec{p}_{\\mu^+} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu}$\n    This means the muon ($\\mu^+$) and the neutrino ($\\nu$) must fly off in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let this magnitude be $p$.\n    $|\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$\n\n2.  **Conservation of Energy:**\n    The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay. The initial energy is the rest energy of the stationary pion. The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = E_{\\mu^+} + E_{\\nu}$\n    where $E$ represents the *total* relativistic energy (rest energy + kinetic energy).\n\n3.  **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    The total energy ($E$), momentum ($p$), and rest mass ($m_0$) of a particle are related by the equation:\n    $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$\n\n    *   For the muon ($\\mu^+$):\n        $E_{\\mu^+}^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n\n    *   For the neutrino ($\\nu$): Neutrinos have a mass that is extremely small and can be treated as zero for this calculation ($m_{\\nu} \\approx 0$).\n        $E_{\\nu}^2 = (pc)^2 + (0)^2 \\implies E_{\\nu} = pc$\n\n4.  **Solving for the Energies:**\n    We can now solve for the unknown energies.\n    *   From the neutrino's energy relation, we have $pc = E_{\\nu}$.\n    *   Substitute this into the muon's energy equation:\n        $E_{\\mu^+}^2 = (E_{\\nu})^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$  **(Equation 1)**\n    *   From the conservation of energy, we can write $E_{\\mu^+} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - E_{\\nu}$.\n    *   Substitute this expression for $E_{\\mu^+}$ into **Equation 1**:\n        $(m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - E_{\\nu})^2 = E_{\\nu}^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n    *   Expand the left side:\n        $(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)E_{\\nu} + E_{\\nu}^2 = E_{\\nu}^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n    *   The $E_{\\nu}^2$ terms cancel. Rearrange the equation to solve for $E_{\\nu}$:\n        $(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2 = 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)E_{\\nu}$\n        $E_{\\nu} = \\frac{(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)}$\n\n5.  **Calculations:**\n    *   **Given values:**\n        *   $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = 139.6$ MeV\n        *   $m_{\\mu^+}c^2 = 105.7$ MeV\n    *   **Calculate the neutrino's energy ($E_{\\nu}$):**\n        $E_{\\nu} = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6} = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.78$ MeV\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of Neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$):** Since the neutrino's rest mass is considered zero, its total energy is its kinetic energy.\n        $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} \\approx 29.8$ MeV\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of Muon ($KE_{\\mu^+}$):** First, find the muon's total energy using conservation of energy.\n        $E_{\\mu^+} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - E_{\\nu} = 139.6 - 29.78 = 109.82$ MeV\n        The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest energy.\n        $KE_{\\mu^+} = E_{\\mu^+} - m_{\\mu^+}c^2 = 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12$ MeV\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon is **4.12 MeV**, and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is **29.8 MeV**. These values correspond to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
