    "This problem requires us to calculate the minimum track length that a particle must travel for its decay to be considered \"observed\" by a detector. We are given the condition that at least 30% of the decays must be observable. This implies we need to find the resolution distance `d` such that the probability of the particle traveling at least this distance before decaying is 30%.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Relativistic Parameters**: The particle $X^0$ is moving at a relativistic speed. We first need to calculate its Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) and its velocity ($\\beta = v/c$). The Lorentz factor is the ratio of the total energy (E) to the rest mass energy ($m_0 c^2$). Given the energy and mass in the same units (GeV), this simplifies to:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}$\n\n2.  Once $\\gamma$ is known, we can find $\\beta$ using the relativistic identity:\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\n3.  **Mean Decay Length**: The lifetime of the particle in the lab frame ($\\tau$) is dilated by the Lorentz factor: $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$. The average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying, known as the mean decay length ($\\lambda$), is its speed multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime:\n    $\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau = (\\beta c) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\beta \\gamma c \\tau_0$\n\n4.  **Probability of Observation**: The decay of unstable particles follows an exponential probability law. The probability that a particle survives for a time $t$ or, equivalently, travels a distance $d = vt$, is given by:\n    $P(\\text{survival}) = e^{-t/\\tau} = e^{-d/\\lambda}$\n\n    For a decay to be \"observed\", the particle must travel a distance greater than or equal to the detector's minimum resolution, let's call it $d_{res}$. Therefore, the probability of observing the decay is the probability that the particle travels a distance $d \\ge d_{res}$.\n    $P(\\text{observe}) = P(d \\ge d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$\n\n5.  **Solving for Resolution**: We are given that we need to observe at least 30% of the decays. So, we set the probability of observation to 0.30 and solve for the resolution $d_{res}$:\n    $0.30 = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $\\ln(0.30) = -\\frac{d_{res}}{\\lambda}$\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$\n\n6.  **Calculation**: Now, we substitute the values into the equations. A Python script can perform this calculation accurately.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the given physical constants and parameters.\nE_GeV = 27.0      # Total energy of the particle in the bubble chamber [GeV]\nm0_GeV = 3.41     # Rest mass of the particle X^0 [GeV]\ntau0_s = 8e-16    # Proper lifetime of the particle X^0 [s]\nc_m_per_s = 299792458 # Speed of light [m/s]\nP_observe = 0.30  # The minimum fraction of decays to be observed\n\n# 1. Calculate the Lorentz factor, gamma.\ngamma = E_GeV / m0_GeV\n\n# 2. Calculate the relativistic velocity factor, beta (v/c).\nbeta = np.sqrt(1 - 1/gamma**2)\n\n# 3. Calculate the mean decay length in the lab frame, lambda.\n# lambda = (speed) * (lab lifetime) = (beta * c) * (gamma * tau0)\nlambda_lab = beta * gamma * c_m_per_s * tau0_s\n\n# 4. Calculate the minimum resolution required.\n# P_observe = exp(-d_res / lambda_lab) => d_res = -lambda_lab * ln(P_observe)\nd_res = -lambda_lab * np.log(P_observe)\n\n# Print the final result.\nprint(f\"{d_res:.2e}\")\n```\n\nThe output of this calculation gives the minimum required resolution.\n2.26e-06\n\nThe calculated minimum resolution is $2.26 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Comparing this value with the given options:\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\nThe value $2.26 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is closest to option D. The slight difference is likely due to the precision of the constants used in the problem's original calculation (e.g., using $c=3 \\times 10^8$ m/s or a slightly different value for $\\ln(0.3)$). Let's verify by recalculating with the value from option D to see if it makes sense. If $d_{res} = 2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, the percentage of observable decays would be $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = e^{-2.08/1.87} \\approx e^{-1.11} \\approx 0.33$, which is \"at least 30%\". So option D is consistent with the physics.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The user wants to find the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle $X^0$.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem\n\n*   **Particle Decay**: The decay of particles is a random process. The probability that a particle survives for a time $t$ in its rest frame follows an exponential law: $P(t) = e^{-t/\\tau_0}$, where $\\tau_0$ is the proper mean lifetime.\n*   **Relativity**: Since the particle $X^0$ is moving at high energy (27 GeV) compared to its rest mass (3.41 GeV), its properties (like lifetime and distance traveled) must be described using special relativity.\n*   **Observation Condition**: A decay is considered \"observed\" if the particle travels a distance greater than or equal to the detector's resolution, $d_{res}$. We are given that the probability of this observation must be at least 30% ($P \\ge 0.30$).\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$)**\n\nThe Lorentz factor relates the total energy (E) to the rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$). In particle physics, mass is often given in units of energy (e.g., GeV), so we can directly compute the ratio.\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{\\text{Total Energy (E)}}{\\text{Rest Mass Energy} (m_0c^2)} = \\frac{E}{m_0}$\n$\\gamma = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.9179$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the relativistic velocity factor ($\\beta$)**\n\nThe factor $\\beta$ is the particle's speed as a fraction of the speed of light ($v/c$). It is related to $\\gamma$ by:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(7.9179)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.01595} \\approx 0.9920$\n\nThe particle is traveling at about 99.2% of the speed of light.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the mean decay length in the lab frame ($\\lambda$)**\n\nThe particle's lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$) is dilated by the factor $\\gamma$:\n$\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n\nThe mean distance it travels in the lab frame before decaying ($\\lambda$) is its speed ($v = \\beta c$) multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime ($\\tau$):\n\n$\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau = (\\beta c) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\beta \\gamma c \\tau_0$\nUsing the given values:\n*   $\\beta \\approx 0.9920$\n*   $\\gamma \\approx 7.9179$\n*   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n*   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n\n$\\lambda \\approx (0.9920)(7.9179)(3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s})(8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the required minimum resolution ($d_{res}$)**\n\nThe probability that a particle travels a distance $d$ before decaying is given by an exponential decay law based on distance: $P(\\text{distance traveled} \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$.\n\nWe want this probability to be at least 30% (or 0.30) for a distance equal to the resolution, $d_{res}$:\n\n$P(\\text{observed}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\nTo solve for $d_{res}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n$\\ln(e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}) = \\ln(0.30)$\n$-\\frac{d_{res}}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30)$\n$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$\n\nUsing $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$:\n\n$d_{res} \\approx -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204) \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated minimum resolution is approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. We now compare this result to the given options:\n\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\nOur calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is very close to option D ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). The small discrepancy is likely due to the precision of the constants used in the problem's original formulation. Option D is the only one with the correct order of magnitude.\n\n<<<D>>>"
