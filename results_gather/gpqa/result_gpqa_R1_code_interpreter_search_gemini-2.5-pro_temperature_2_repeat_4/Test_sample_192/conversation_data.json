    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are given the relationship between the number of stars (`N`) and their parallax (`plx`). The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as `1/plx^5`. This is best interpreted as a distribution function, meaning the number of stars per unit interval of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n    *   We are asked to find how the number of stars changes with distance `r`, per unit range of distance. This corresponds to the quantity `dN/dr`.\n\n2.  **Establish the Key Relationships:**\n    *   **Given distribution:**\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n    *   **Relationship between parallax and distance:** Parallax (`plx`) is the inverse of the distance (`r`). For simplicity, we can write:\n        `plx = 1/r`\n    *   **Goal:** Find the proportionality for `dN/dr`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Chain Rule (Change of Variables):**\n    To convert the distribution from being a function of parallax to being a function of distance, we use the chain rule from calculus. The number of stars `dN` in a small parallax interval `d(plx)` must be the same as the number of stars in the corresponding distance interval `dr`.\n    `dN = (dN/dr) * dr`\n    `dN = (dN/d(plx)) * d(plx)`\n\n    Therefore:\n    `(dN/dr) * dr = (dN/d(plx)) * d(plx)`\n\n    Rearranging to solve for our target `dN/dr`, we get:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n\n    We use the absolute value because the number of stars must be positive, while the derivative `d(plx)/dr` is negative (as distance `r` increases, parallax `plx` decreases).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Derivative:**\n    We need to find the derivative of `plx` with respect to `r`:\n    `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`\n    `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    The absolute value is:\n    `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`\n\n5.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    Now we substitute the known parts back into our chain rule equation:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (dN/d(plx)) * (1/r²)`\n\n    We also need to express `dN/d(plx)` in terms of `r`. We know `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5` and `plx = 1/r`:\n    `1/plx^5 = 1 / (1/r)^5 = r^5`\n    So, `dN/d(plx) ∝ r^5`.\n\n    Now, substitute this back into the equation for `dN/dr`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (1/r²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The number of stars in that region of the sky per unit range of distance `r` changes proportionally to `r³`. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
