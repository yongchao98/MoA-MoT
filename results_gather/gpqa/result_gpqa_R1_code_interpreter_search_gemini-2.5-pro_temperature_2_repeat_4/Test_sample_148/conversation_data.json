    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** Two distinct peaks are observed for what should be a single alpha-proton.\n    *   **Details:** The peaks have similar chemical shifts and a roughly 1:1 integral ratio. Spin-spin coupling is not the cause.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This strongly indicates the presence of two different species in the sample. Since the chemical shifts are similar, these two species must be structurally very similar. The 1:1 ratio suggests they are present in equal amounts. Because they are not due to coupling, they must represent two distinct chemical environments for the same proton. This points towards isomers.\n\n2.  **Analyze the LC-MS Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** Two clearly defined peaks are seen in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace.\n    *   **Details:** The peaks have equal intensities (correlating with the 1:1 ratio in the NMR). The analysis was run at an elevated temperature.\n    *   **Interpretation:** The presence of two peaks in LC confirms that there are two distinct compounds that can be separated based on their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   **Observation:** Both peaks have the exact same mass spectrum (MS), and this mass is consistent with the expected product.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This is a critical piece of information. It means the two species are isomers (same molecular formula, same mass), not an impurity with a different chemical formula (like a precursor or a side product from an incomplete or incorrect reaction). The elevated temperature condition suggests that if the two species were rapidly interconverting conformers, they might have coalesced into a single peak. Seeing two sharp peaks suggests they are either stable isomers or conformers with a high energy barrier to interconversion.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options based on the Combined Data:**\n\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** This is incorrect. A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular weight and thus a different mass spectrum. The MS data shows both species have the same, expected mass.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other.\n        *   They have the **same mass**, which is consistent with the MS data.\n        *   They are different chemical compounds with different physical properties. Therefore, they will have **different NMR spectra** (even if the differences are small, as observed) and can be **separated by standard LC**, which explains the two peaks.\n        *   This scenario can arise in peptide synthesis in two common ways:\n            1.  **Use of a racemic starting material:** If one of the amino acid building blocks was a mixture of D and L forms, the final peptide would be a mixture of diastereomers. For example, synthesizing a dipeptide from pure L-Alanine and a racemic mixture of Phenylalanine would yield L-Ala-L-Phe and L-Ala-D-Phe, which are diastereomers and would be present in a roughly 1:1 ratio.\n            2.  **Atropisomerism (Rotamers):** Rotation around the amide (peptide) bond is restricted. This can lead to stable *cis* and *trans* isomers, which are a type of diastereomer. These rotamers have different chemical environments and are often observable as separate species in NMR and can sometimes be separated by LC.\n        *   This option is fully consistent with all experimental observations.\n\n    *   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This implies a side reaction that would create a new molecule with a different chemical structure and, crucially, a **different mass**. This is inconsistent with the MS data showing the expected mass for both peaks.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.\n        *   In an achiral environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties.\n        *   A standard 1H NMR spectrometer is achiral, so a mixture of enantiomers gives a **single, identical spectrum**. You would only see one peak for the alpha-proton, not two.\n        *   Standard LC columns are also achiral and **cannot separate enantiomers**. You would only see one LC peak.\n        *   This option is directly contradicted by both the NMR and LC data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only option that cohesively explains all the evidence—two NMR signals for a single proton type, two separable peaks by LC, and the same mass for both species—is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<B>>>"
