    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotope of each element.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units heavier than the molecular ion peak. The relative intensity ratio of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1. This is the characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom** (natural abundance: ~75% ³⁵Cl, ~25% ³⁷Cl).\n\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\nLet's calculate the molecular weight for the proposed structures using the most common isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ¹⁶O, ³⁵Cl):\n*   Formula for A, B, and D (C₇H₅ClO₂): (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n*   Formula for C (C₇H₅ClO₂): Same as above, 156 g/mol.\nAll options are consistent with the molecular weight and the presence of one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a **carboxylic acid**. The extreme broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) double bond stretch. Specifically, a C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid is expected around 1725-1700 cm⁻¹.\n\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This immediately makes options C (Phenyl chloroformate, an ester/acid halide) and D (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, an aldehyde/phenol) highly unlikely. The evidence strongly points toward a chlorobenzoic acid (A or B).\n\n**3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A chemical shift greater than 10 ppm is characteristic of a **carboxylic acid proton** (-COOH). The 's' (singlet) indicates it has no adjacent protons to couple with, which is expected. The integration '1H' confirms it represents one proton. This further supports the conclusion that the compound is a carboxylic acid.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). We see two distinct signals, both of which are doublets ('d'). The total integration is 2H + 2H = 4H on the aromatic ring. A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para substitution results in only two chemically distinct types of aromatic protons.\n\n**4. Final Structure Determination:**\n\n*   Based on all the data, the compound is a carboxylic acid containing one chlorine atom attached to a benzene ring.\n*   The NMR data specifically indicates a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n*   Let's compare the remaining options:\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This has a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern, which would produce two doublets in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This has an *ortho* (1,2) substitution pattern. This would result in a more complex splitting pattern with four unique aromatic protons, not two simple doublets.\n\nTherefore, all evidence points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown solid.\n\n<<<A>>>"
