    "*   **Analyze the Core Concept:** The question posits the existence of magnetic monopoles, which are isolated north or south magnetic poles. In our universe, magnetic poles always come in pairs (dipoles), and there are no known magnetic monopoles.\n\n*   **Recall Standard Maxwell's Equations:**\n    1.  **Gauss's Law for Electricity:** ∇ ⋅ **E** = ρ / ε₀\n        *   This law relates the divergence (flux per unit volume) of the electric field (**E**) to the density of electric charge (ρ). It essentially says electric field lines originate from positive charges and terminate on negative charges.\n    2.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** ∇ ⋅ **B** = 0\n        *   This law states that the divergence of the magnetic field (**B**) is zero. This is the mathematical statement that there are no magnetic monopoles. Magnetic field lines are always closed loops; they don't start or end anywhere.\n    3.  **Faraday's Law of Induction:** ∇ × **E** = -∂**B**/∂t\n        *   This law describes how a time-varying magnetic field creates a circulating (or \"curling\") electric field. This is the principle behind electric generators.\n    4.  **Ampère-Maxwell Law:** ∇ × **B** = μ₀(**J** + ε₀ ∂**E**/∂t)\n        *   This law describes how an electric current (**J**) or a time-varying electric field creates a circulating magnetic field.\n\n*   **Introduce Magnetic Monopoles and Evaluate Changes:**\n    1.  **Impact on Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** If magnetic monopoles (magnetic charges) existed, they would be sources or sinks for magnetic field lines, just as electric charges are for electric field lines. Let's denote the magnetic charge density as ρₘ. The equation would change to be analogous to Gauss's law for electricity:\n        *   **Modified:** ∇ ⋅ **B** = μ₀ρₘ (or some other constant times ρₘ).\n        *   **Conclusion:** The equation for the **divergence of the magnetic field** must change. It is no longer zero.\n\n    2.  **Impact on Faraday's Law:** Symmetry is a key principle in physics. If electric charges moving create a current (**J**) that generates a magnetic field (Ampère's Law), then magnetic charges moving should create a magnetic current (**J**ₘ) that generates an electric field. This magnetic current would be an additional source for the curling of the electric field.\n        *   **Modified:** ∇ × **E** = -∂**B**/∂t - μ₀**J**ₘ\n        *   **Conclusion:** The equation for the **circulation of the electric field** (Faraday's Law) must also change to account for this new source (magnetic currents).\n\n*   **Review the Options:**\n    *   A) The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. — This is true, but incomplete. Another equation also changes.\n    *   B) The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field. — Incorrect. The curl of **B** (Ampère-Maxwell) is not the one that changes.\n    *   C) The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. — Incorrect. These refer to Ampere's Law and Gauss's Law for Electricity, respectively.\n    *   D) The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field. — Correct. This accurately identifies the two modified equations: Faraday's Law (circulation of **E**) and Gauss's Law for Magnetism (divergence of **B**).\n\n<<<D>>>"
