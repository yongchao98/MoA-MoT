Meta-directors (-NO2, -COOC2H5, -COOH) yield negligible amounts of the para-isomer and thus must appear at the beginning of the sequence (lowest yield). Ortho/para-directors (-Cl, -CH3, -C2H5) yield significant amounts of the para-isomer and must appear at the end. This constraint correctly eliminated option B, which incorrectly placed ortho/para directors at the beginning of the sequence.\n\n3.  **Constraint 2: Steric Hindrance:** The second constraint focused on the ortho/para directors (Cl, CH3, C2H5). For these groups, a larger substituent size causes more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, which favors the formation of the para-isomer. The order of increasing substituent size is Cl < CH3 < C2H5. Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield must be C6H5-Cl < C6H5-CH3 < C6H5-C2H5 (substance 3 < 1 < 5). The script checked the surviving hypotheses (A, C, D) against this rule. Only option A had the correct ordering [3, 1, 5] for its ortho/para directors. Options C and D were eliminated.\n\nThe script concluded that option A is the only one that satisfies both chemical constraints.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction, we must analyze the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring.\n\nThe six substances are:\n1.  **C6H5-CH3** (Toluene)\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5** (Ethyl benzoate)\n3.  **C6H5-Cl** (Chlorobenzene)\n4.  **C6H5-NO2** (Nitrobenzene)\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5** (Ethylbenzene)\n6.  **C6H5-COOH** (Benzoic acid)\n\nSubstituents on a benzene ring are classified based on how they influence the rate and regioselectivity of electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n\n**Meta-Directing Groups (Deactivating):**\nThese groups withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive, and direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position. Consequently, they produce very low yields of the para-isomer.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group is a very strong deactivating, meta-directing group. It produces almost exclusively the meta-isomer, with only trace amounts of ortho and para products. For bromination, the para-isomer yield is extremely low, often cited as less than 1%.\n*   **-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The carboxylic acid group is a deactivating, meta-directing group. It directs bromination primarily to the meta position.\n*   **-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** The ester group is also a deactivating, meta-directing group, similar in effect to the carboxylic acid group. For the related nitration reaction, ethyl benzoate yields about 5% of the para-isomer.\n\nAmong these meta-directors, the deactivating strength generally follows the order -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5. A stronger deactivating group leads to a lower proportion of the para product. Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: Nitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate.\n\n**Ortho-, Para-Directing Groups:**\nThese groups direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. The ratio of para to ortho product is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n*   **-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** Halogens are deactivating but ortho-, para-directing. Due to the combination of inductive withdrawal and resonance donation, along with steric factors, halobenzenes often give a high yield of the para-isomer. For the bromination of bromobenzene, the para-isomer is formed in 85% yield. For the nitration of chlorobenzene, the para-isomer yield is about 70%. Chlorobenzene is highly selective for the para position.\n*   **-CH3 (Toluene):** The methyl group is an activating, ortho-, para-directing group. In the bromination of toluene, the para-isomer is the major product, with a reported yield of 66.8%.\n*   **-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group is also an activating, ortho-, para-directing group. It is slightly bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions would be expected to favor the para-isomer even more than in toluene. However, experimental data for various electrophilic substitutions can be complex. For bromination, the para position in ethylbenzene has been found to be less reactive than the ortho positions under certain conditions, which is an exception to the general trend. In general, for alkylbenzenes, increasing the steric bulk of the alkyl group increases the para/ortho ratio. For example, in nitration, tert-butylbenzene gives a 75% para yield compared to 37% for toluene. While specific data for bromination of ethylbenzene can vary, it is an activating group and will produce a significant amount of para product, likely comparable to or slightly more than toluene.\n\n**Arranging all substances:**\n\nThe meta-directing compounds will have the lowest para-isomer yields, followed by the ortho-, para-directing compounds.\n\n1.  **Lowest para-yields (meta-directors):**\n    *   Nitrobenzene (4) will have the lowest yield (<1%).\n    *   Benzoic acid (6) and Ethyl benzoate (2) will have slightly higher, but still very low, yields. Comparing -COOH and -COOC2H5, their deactivating effects are similar. Data for nitration shows ethyl benzoate gives ~5% para product. We can place them in the order 4 < 6 < 2.\n\n2.  **Highest para-yields (ortho-, para-directors):**\n    *   Toluene (1) gives a 66.8% para yield in bromination.\n    *   Ethylbenzene (5) is expected to have a para yield similar to or slightly higher than toluene due to sterics.\n    *   Chlorobenzene (3) is known to be highly para-selective, with para yields often exceeding those of simple alkylbenzenes in halogenation reactions (e.g., 85% for bromination of bromobenzene).\n\nCombining these observations, the overall order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\nNitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2) < Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction, we must analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### Analysis of Substituents\n\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution. The substituent already on the ring determines where the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br+) will add. Substituents are classified as either ortho-, para-directing or meta-directing.\n\n1.  **С₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is an activating, ortho-, para-director.\n2.  **C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate):** The ethyl carboxylate group (-COOC₂H₅) is a deactivating, meta-director.\n3.  **C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group (-Cl) is a deactivating, ortho-, para-director.\n4.  **C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group (-NO₂) is a strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n5.  **C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is an activating, ortho-, para-director.\n6.  **C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The carboxyl group (-COOH) is a deactivating, meta-director.\n\n### Ordering the Substances\n\nThe yield of the para-isomer is significantly lower for meta-directing groups compared to ortho-, para-directing groups. Therefore, substances 4, 2, and 6 will have the lowest para-isomer yields.\n\n**1. Meta-directing groups (lowest para-yield):**\n*   **4 (C₆H₅-NO₂):** The -NO₂ group is a very strong deactivating meta-director. Bromination of nitrobenzene primarily yields the meta-isomer, with very small amounts of ortho and para products.\n*   **2 (C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅) and 6 (C₆H₅-COOH):** The -COOC₂H₅ and -COOH groups are also deactivating meta-directors. Their deactivating strength is generally considered less than the nitro group but still strong. For nitration, a benzoic ester gave 73% meta, 22% ortho, and only 5% para product. The para-yield for these will be very low, but likely slightly higher than for the strongly deactivated nitrobenzene. It is difficult to definitively order -COOH and -COOC₂H₅ without specific data for bromination, but they are often grouped together in terms of directing effects. Based on available data for similar reactions, the order of increasing para-yield among these is generally considered to be NO₂ < COOH ≈ COOC₂H₅. Let's assume for this problem that the deactivating strength correlates inversely with para-yield, so the order is 4 < 2 < 6 or 4 < 6 < 2.\n\n**2. Ortho-, para-directing groups (highest para-yield):**\nFor these groups, the distribution between the ortho and para positions is primarily influenced by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will hinder attack at the nearby ortho positions, thus increasing the proportion of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **1 (С₆H₅-CH₃ - Toluene):** The methyl group is relatively small. It allows for significant substitution at both ortho and para positions. For nitration, toluene gives about 37% para-product.\n*   **5 (C₆H₅-C₂H₅ - Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance disfavors the ortho position more than in toluene, leading to a higher para/ortho ratio and thus a higher yield of the para-isomer.\n*   **3 (C₆H₅-Cl - Chlorobenzene):** Halogens are an exception; although they are deactivating, they are ortho-, para-directors. The chloro group often leads to a high percentage of the para-isomer. For example, nitration of chlorobenzene yields 70% para-product. This high para-selectivity is a known characteristic for halogens.\n\n**3. Combining and Finalizing the Order:**\n\nLet's establish the order from lowest to highest para-yield:\n\n*   The meta-directors will come first: 4, 2, and 6. Based on the strong deactivating nature of the nitro group, it will have the lowest para-yield. Between -COOH and -COOC₂H₅, their directing effects are similar, but typically the ester group is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid. However, some sources place the para yield for nitration of benzoic esters (5%) lower than what might be expected for benzoic acid. A common order of deactivating strength is -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOR. A stronger deactivating effect generally correlates with a lower ortho/para yield. Thus, the order of increasing para-yield is likely 4 < 6 < 2.\n*   The ortho-, para-directors will come next: 1, 5, and 3.\n    *   Comparing alkyl groups, the bulkier ethyl group (5) will give more para-product than the methyl group (1) due to greater steric hindrance at the ortho positions. So, 1 < 5.\n    *   Comparing the alkyl groups to the chloro group (3), halogens are known to give very high para-selectivity. The para-isomer is the major product in the halogenation of chlorobenzene, often around 87-90%. This is significantly higher than for toluene (around 62% para) or ethylbenzene. Therefore, chlorobenzene (3) will have the highest para-yield among the o,p-directors.\n*   So, the order for the o,p-directors is 1 < 5 < 3.\n\nCombining the two groups, the complete sequence for increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer during electrophilic bromination, we must analyze the directing effects of the substituent on each benzene ring.\n\nThe directing effect of a substituent determines the position (ortho, meta, or para) where the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br+) will attach.\n\nFirst, we can categorize the substituents into two groups:\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. As a result, they will produce very low yields of the para-isomer. The substituents in this category are:\n    *   **-NO2 (Nitrobenzene, 4):** Strongly deactivating.\n    *   **-COOH (Benzoic acid, 6):** Deactivating.\n    *   **-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate, 2):** Deactivating.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions, resulting in significant yields of the para-isomer. The substituents in this category are:\n    *   **-CH3 (Toluene, 1):** Activating.\n    *   **-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene, 5):** Activating.\n    *   **-Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3):** Deactivating overall, but ortho, para-directing.\n\n**Step 1: Ordering the meta-directors (lowest para-yield)**\n\nFor meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is minimal. The stronger the deactivating effect of the group, the more strongly it directs to the meta position, and thus the lower the yield of the para-isomer. The order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be the lowest for nitrobenzene, followed by benzoic acid, and then ethyl benzoate. This gives us the beginning of our sequence:\n**4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**Step 2: Ordering the ortho, para-directors (highest para-yield)**\n\nFor ortho, para-directing groups, the ratio of the para to ortho isomer is primarily influenced by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of the para product.\n\n*   **-CH3 vs. -C2H5:** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased steric hindrance around the ortho positions in ethylbenzene favors the formation of the para-isomer more than in toluene. Thus, the para-isomer yield for ethylbenzene is higher than for toluene.\n    *   Yield(para-isomer of 1) < Yield(para-isomer of 5)\n\n*   **-Cl vs. alkyl groups:** The chloro group is also ortho, para-directing. Due to a combination of its size and electronic effects, it strongly favors the formation of the para-isomer, often yielding a very high para-to-ortho ratio in bromination reactions. The bromination of chlorobenzene typically yields about 88-89% of the para-isomer, which is generally higher than for toluene (~66%) and ethylbenzene.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield among these three is:\n**1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**Step 3: Combining the sequences**\n\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final sequence from the lowest para-yield to the highest:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Reaction and the Goal**\nThe reaction is the electrophilic bromination of substituted benzene rings. The goal is to arrange the starting substances in order of increasing yield (weight fraction) of the para-substituted product (para-isomer).\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\nWe need to classify each substituent on the benzene ring (C6H5-X) based on its electronic effect (activating or deactivating) and its directing effect (ortho/para or meta).\n\n*   **Activating, Ortho/Para-Directing Groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive than benzene. They direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) **-CH3 (methyl)**: Activating (by induction and hyperconjugation).\n    *   5) **-C2H5 (ethyl)**: Activating (by induction and hyperconjugation), slightly more so than methyl.\n\n*   **Deactivating, Ortho/Para-Directing Groups:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring (making it less reactive) but direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   3) **-Cl (chloro)**: Deactivating (strong inductive withdrawal) but o,p-directing (resonance donation).\n\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups strongly withdraw electron density from the ring and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position.\n    *   2) **-COOC2H5 (ethyl ester)**: Deactivating (by resonance).\n    *   4) **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating (by induction and resonance).\n    *   6) **-COOH (carboxylic acid)**: Deactivating (by resonance).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Para-Isomer Yield for Each Group**\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Substances 2, 4, 6):**\n    *   These substances will produce the meta-isomer as the major product. The yield of the para-isomer will be extremely low, close to zero.\n    *   To order them, we consider the strength of their deactivating effect. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, meaning it will produce an even smaller amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n    *   Therefore, the order of *increasing* para-isomer yield for this group is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n*   **Ortho/Para-Directors (Substances 1, 3, 5):**\n    *   These substances will produce a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The yield of the para-isomer will be significant.\n    *   The ratio of para to ortho product is determined by steric and electronic factors.\n    *   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene.\n        *   Order: **1 < 5**.\n    *   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chloro group is deactivating due to its strong inductive effect, which is felt most strongly at the ortho positions. This electronic effect disfavors ortho substitution more than para substitution. This, combined with the steric hindrance of the chlorine atom, leads to a very high preference for the para-isomer. The para-isomer is the major product by a large margin (often ~90% yield). This percentage is higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n        *   Order: **5 < 3**.\n    *   Combining these, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups to Get the Final Order**\nThe meta-directing substances will have the lowest para-isomer yields, followed by the ortho/para-directing substances.\n\n1.  Start with the meta-directors, ordered from strongest to weakest deactivator: **4 < 6 < 2**\n2.  Continue with the ortho/para-directors, ordered by their increasing preference for the para position: **< 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe final combined order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric properties of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\nThe substances are:\n1)  **Toluene** (C₆H₅-CH₃)\n2)  **Ethyl benzoate** (C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅)\n3)  **Chlorobenzene** (C₆H₅-Cl)\n4)  **Nitrobenzene** (C₆H₅-NO₂)\n5)  **Ethylbenzene** (C₆H₅-C₂H₅)\n6)  **Benzoic acid** (C₆H₅-COOH)\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents based on their directing effects for electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. Consequently, they produce a very low yield of the para-isomer. The groups in this category are:\n    *   -NO₂ (Nitrobenzene, 4)\n    *   -COOH (Benzoic acid, 6)\n    *   -COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate, 2)\n\n    Among these, the nitro group (-NO₂) is the strongest deactivating group, followed by the carboxyl group (-COOH), and then the ester group (-COOC₂H₅). A stronger deactivating effect leads to higher meta-selectivity and thus a lower yield of the para-isomer. Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for these three substances is: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The ratio of para to ortho product is influenced by steric hindrance. The groups in this category are:\n    *   -CH₃ (Toluene, 1)\n    *   -C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene, 5)\n    *   -Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3)\n\n    1.  **-CH₃ (Toluene) vs. -C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased steric hindrance around the ortho positions makes the para position more accessible for the incoming electrophile. As a result, ethylbenzene produces a higher percentage of the para-isomer compared to toluene. So, the order is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5).\n\n    2.  **-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group is deactivating overall but is an ortho, para-director due to its resonance effect. Halogens typically give a high yield of the para-isomer in electrophilic substitution reactions, often higher than alkylbenzenes, because the ortho positions are significantly deactivated by the strong inductive effect. For example, in nitration, chlorobenzene yields about 70% of the para-isomer, whereas toluene yields only about 37%. A similar high selectivity for the para position is expected for bromination.\n\n    Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\n**Combining the two groups:**\n\nThe meta-directing substances will have the lowest para-isomer yields, followed by the ortho, para-directing substances.\n\nCombining the established orders:\n(4 < 6 < 2) and (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete sequence in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### **1. Understand the Reaction and the Goal**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (specifically, bromination) on a series of monosubstituted benzene rings. The goal is to arrange the starting substances in order of *increasing* weight fraction of the *para*-bromo derivative among the monobrominated products. This is determined by the directing effect of the substituent already on the benzene ring.\n\n### **2. Classify the Substituents**\n\nWe need to classify each substituent based on its effect on the benzene ring's reactivity and its directing influence (ortho, para, or meta).\n\n*   **Activating, Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive than benzene. They direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) **-CH₃ (methyl)**: Activating\n    *   5) **-C₂H₅ (ethyl)**: Activating\n\n*   **Deactivating, Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups withdraw electron density (deactivating the ring) but have lone pairs that can participate in resonance, directing the electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   3) **-Cl (chloro)**: Deactivating\n\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive than benzene. They direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position.\n    *   2) **-COOC₂H₅ (ethyl carboxylate)**: Deactivating\n    *   4) **-NO₂ (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating\n    *   6) **-COOH (carboxylic acid)**: Deactivating\n\n### **3. Analyze the Groups with Low Para-Yield (Meta-Directors)**\n\nSubstances with meta-directing groups will produce the meta-isomer as the major product. The yield of the ortho and para isomers will be very low. To rank them, we consider their deactivating strength. The stronger the deactivating effect, the more pronounced the meta-direction, and thus the lower the yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n**-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**\n\n*   **-NO₂ (4)** is one of the strongest deactivating groups. It will give the lowest yield of the para-isomer.\n*   **-COOH (6)** is a strong deactivator.\n*   **-COOC₂H₅ (2)** is also a deactivator, but slightly weaker than -COOH because the ethyl group is weakly electron-donating to the carboxyl system.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this set is:\n**4 < 6 < 2**\n\n### **4. Analyze the Groups with High Para-Yield (Ortho, Para-Directors)**\n\nSubstances with ortho, para-directing groups will produce a mixture of ortho and para isomers as the major products. The ratio between the para and ortho isomers determines their rank. The para position is generally favored over the ortho position due to reduced steric hindrance.\n\n*   **-CH₃ (1) vs. -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions more significantly. Consequently, substitution at the less hindered para position is more favored for ethylbenzene than for toluene.\n    *   Yield of para-isomer for Toluene (1) < Yield of para-isomer for Ethylbenzene (5).\n\n*   **-Cl (3) vs. Alkyl Groups (1, 5):** The chloro group is an ortho, para-director. For halogenated benzenes (especially F, Cl, Br), the para-isomer is typically highly favored in electrophilic substitutions. Experimental data for bromination shows that chlorobenzene gives a very high percentage of the para-product (around 87%), which is significantly higher than for toluene (~67%) or ethylbenzene (~70%).\n\nCombining these observations, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this set is:\n**1 (Toluene) < 5 (Ethylbenzene) < 3 (Chlorobenzene)**\n\n### **5. Combine the Rankings**\n\nThe meta-directing groups will always produce a much lower yield of the para-isomer than the ortho, para-directing groups. By combining the two ranked sets, we get the final overall order.\n\n(Low para-yield group) < (High para-yield group)\n**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe complete order of substances in increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to:\nNitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate < Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\n\n### **6.

The position of the incoming bromine atom (ortho, meta, or para) is determined by the directing effect of the substituent already on the ring.\n\n2.  **Classify the Substituents:** We need to classify each substituent as either an ortho, para-director or a meta-director.\n    *   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They are typically electron-donating groups (activating) or halogens (deactivating).\n        *   -CH3 (in Toluene, 1): Activating, o,p-director.\n        *   -C2H5 (in Ethylbenzene, 5): Activating, o,p-director.\n        *   -Cl (in Chlorobenzene, 3): Deactivating, o,p-director.\n    *   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They are electron-withdrawing groups (deactivating).\n        *   -NO2 (in Nitrobenzene, 4): Strongly deactivating, m-director.\n        *   -COOH (in Benzoic acid, 6): Deactivating, m-director.\n        *   -COOC2H5 (in Ethyl benzoate, 2): Deactivating, m-director.\n\n3.  **Initial Grouping:** Substances with meta-directing groups will produce very little para-isomer, while substances with ortho, para-directing groups will produce a significant amount. Therefore, the final order will have all the meta-directing substances first, followed by the ortho, para-directing substances.\n    *   Group 1 (low para-yield): {Nitrobenzene (4), Benzoic acid (6), Ethyl benzoate (2)}\n    *   Group 2 (high para-yield): {Toluene (1), Ethylbenzene (5), Chlorobenzene (3)}\n    *   The final order will be: {Group 1 sorted} < {Group 2 sorted}\n\n4.  **Order within Group 1 (Meta-directors):** The yield of the para-isomer for these compounds is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the para product.\n    *   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse: Nitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate.\n    *   This gives the order: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n5.  **Order within Group 2 (Ortho, para-directors):** For these compounds, we need to compare the ratio of the para product to the ortho product. This is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n    *   **Toluene (1) vs. Ethylbenzene (5):** Both have activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased steric hindrance near the ortho positions in ethylbenzene makes the para position more accessible and thus more favored compared to toluene. Therefore, the para-yield for ethylbenzene is higher than for toluene. Order: **1 < 5**.\n    *   **Chlorobenzene (3):** Halogens are a special case. While they are deactivating overall due to their strong inductive effect, they are o,p-directing due to resonance. The para-isomer is highly favored over the ortho-isomer, often more so than with activating alkyl groups. This is partly because the deactivating inductive effect is felt more strongly at the closer ortho position, making the para position electronically more favorable. Bromination of chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer (around 87%).\n    *   Comparing the para-yields: Toluene (~67%) < Ethylbenzene (~70%) < Chlorobenzene (~87%).\n    *   This gives the order: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n6.  **Combine the Orders:** Now we combine the sorted groups.\n    *   Order of Group 1: 4 < 6 < 2\n    *   Order of Group 2: 1 < 5 < 3\n    *   Combined final order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\n7.  **Match with Options:** The derived order `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3` matches option A.\n\nThe Python code execution has already confirmed this order based on established experimental data for para-isomer yields.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires arranging substituted benzenes by the increasing yield of the para-isomer upon bromination. This depends on the electronic and steric effects of the substituent.\n\n1.  **Plan:**\n    *   Categorize substituents as ortho/para-directing or meta-directing.\n    *   For meta-directors, order them by increasing deactivating strength (stronger deactivation leads to less para product).\n    *   For ortho/para-directors, order them based on steric hindrance (larger groups favor the para position more) and electronic effects.\n    *   Combine the two groups to get the final order.\n\n2.  **Execute Action 1 (Categorization & Meta-Directors):**\n    *   **Meta-directors (deactivating):** -NO₂ (4), -COOH (6), -COOC₂H₅ (2). These will have the lowest para yields.\n    *   **Ortho/para-directors:** -CH₃ (1, activating), -C₂H₅ (5, activating), -Cl (3, deactivating). These will have the highest para yields.\n    *   Now, let's order the meta-directors. The strength of deactivation is -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅. A more strongly deactivating group directs more strongly to the meta position, leaving a smaller fraction for the para position.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para yield is: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n\n3.  **Execute Action 2 (Ortho/Para-Directors):**\n    *   Now, let's order the o,p-directors: Toluene (1), Ethylbenzene (5), and Chlorobenzene (3).\n    *   The yield of the para isomer relative to the ortho isomer is primarily governed by sterics. A bulkier group will hinder the ortho positions more, leading to a higher proportion of the para product.\n    *   The steric bulk increases in the order: -CH₃ < -C₂H₅. Therefore, ethylbenzene should give a higher percentage of para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   Chlorine (-Cl) is an exception. Although it's deactivating, it's a very strong para-director due to a combination of its size and electronic effects (inductive vs. resonance), often yielding the highest percentage of para-product among these three.\n    *   So, the order of increasing para yield is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\n4.  **Final Arrangement:**\n    *   Combining the two groups, we get the complete order of increasing para-isomer yield:\n    *   4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3\n    *   This sequence matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a breakdown of the analysis to determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield for the electrophilic bromination of the given substances.\n\n### 1. Classifying the Substituents\n\nFirst, we classify each substituent on the benzene ring (C6H5-) based on its directing effect in electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br+) to the positions ortho (adjacent) and para (opposite) to themselves.\n    *   **Activating:** -CH3 (Toluene, 1), -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene, 5)\n    *   **Deactivating:** -Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3)\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They are all deactivating.\n    *   -NO2 (Nitrobenzene, 4)\n    *   -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate, 2)\n    *   -COOH (Benzoic acid, 6)\n\n### 2. Estimating Para-Isomer Yield\n\nThe yield of the para-isomer depends on two main factors: the directing effect of the substituent and steric hindrance.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (4, 2, 6):** These substances will produce the meta-isomer as the major product. The yield of the para-isomer will be very low.\n    *   **Nitrobenzene (-NO2, 4):** The -NO2 group is strongly deactivating. Bromination yields almost exclusively the meta-isomer, with only trace amounts of the ortho and para products. Outside of special laboratory conditions, the para yield is nearly 0%.\n    *   **Benzoic acid (-COOH, 6) and Ethyl benzoate (-COOC2H5, 2):** These are also meta-directors. While the primary product is meta, they typically yield a small but measurable percentage of the para-isomer, which is generally higher than that for nitrobenzene. For example, in nitration (a similar electrophilic substitution), ethyl benzoate gives about 5% para-isomer. The para yield for benzoic acid is also expected to be in this low single-digit range. Comparing the two, the -COOH and -COOC2H5 groups have similar deactivating strengths, leading to very low and comparable para yields.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (1, 5, 3):** These substances will produce significant amounts of both ortho and para isomers. The ratio between them is influenced by sterics.\n    *   **Toluene (-CH3, 1):** The methyl group is relatively small. For bromination, the product distribution is approximately 33% ortho and 67% para. Another source reports about 56% para-isomer.\n    *   **Ethylbenzene (-C2H5, 5):** The ethyl group is larger than the methyl group. This increased steric bulk hinders the attack at the ortho positions, thus favoring the formation of the para-isomer even more than in toluene.\n    *   **Chlorobenzene (-Cl, 3):** The chloro group is an ortho, para-director. Due to its electronic properties and size, it strongly favors the para position. For similar reactions like nitration, chlorobenzene gives a product mixture of about 30% ortho and 70% para. For bromination, the para-selectivity is even higher, often yielding close to 90% para-isomer.\n\n### 3. Ranking the Substances\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can arrange the substances in order of increasing yield of the para-isomer:\n\n1.  **Nitrobenzene (4):** Yields virtually no para-isomer (approaching 0%).\n2.  **Benzoic acid (6) and Ethyl benzoate (2):** Yield very small amounts of the para-isomer (low single-digit percentages). It is difficult to definitively order these two without precise experimental data for bromination, but they are clearly next after nitrobenzene.\n3.  **Toluene (1):** Yields a significant amount of para-isomer, around 56-67%.\n4.  **Ethylbenzene (5):** The larger ethyl group leads to greater steric hindrance at the ortho position compared to toluene, resulting in a higher yield of the para-isomer.\n5.  **Chlorobenzene (3):** Exhibits very high para-selectivity, often the highest among common monosubstituted benzenes, with para-isomer yields that can approach or exceed 90%.\n\nTherefore, the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n\n**4 < 6 ≈ 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nLooking at the provided options, option D matches this derived order.\n\n**4 (-NO2) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC2H5) < 1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl)**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we need to consider the directing effects and steric hindrance of the substituents on the benzene ring.\n\n### Analysis of Substituents:\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents based on their activating/deactivating and directing properties:\n\n*   **Activating and ortho-, para-directing groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive towards electrophiles, and direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   **1) -CH₃ (Toluene):** Activating.\n    *   **5) -C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene):** Activating.\n\n*   **Deactivating and ortho-, para-directing groups:** Halogens are electron-withdrawing by induction (deactivating) but can donate electron density via resonance, directing incoming groups to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   **3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene):** Deactivating.\n\n*   **Deactivating and meta-directing groups:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive and directing the incoming bromine primarily to the meta position. For these substances, the yield of the para-isomer will be very low.\n    *   **2) -COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate):** Deactivating.\n    *   **4) -NO₂ (Nitrobenzene):** Strongly deactivating.\n    *   **6) -COOH (Benzoic acid):** Deactivating.\n\n### Isomer Distribution:\n\nNow, let's analyze the expected distribution of isomers for each group.\n\n**Meta-directing groups (4, 6, 2):**\nThese substituents direct the electrophile to the meta position. The formation of the para-isomer is highly disfavored.\n*   **4) Nitrobenzene (-NO₂):** This is a very strong deactivating group. In nitration, it gives about 93% meta, 6% ortho, and less than 1% para. Bromination is similar, yielding almost entirely the meta-isomer, with only trace amounts of the para-isomer.\n*   **6) Benzoic acid (-COOH):** This is a deactivating, meta-directing group. Bromination yields primarily m-bromobenzoic acid. The para-isomer is formed in very small amounts.\n*   **2) Ethyl benzoate (-COOC₂H₅):** Similar to benzoic acid, the ester group is deactivating and meta-directing. The yield of the para-isomer is expected to be very low.\n\nAmong these three, the -NO₂ group is the strongest deactivating group, leading to the lowest yield of the para-isomer. The -COOH and -COOC₂H₅ groups are also strongly deactivating. Generally, the order of deactivating strength is -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅. A stronger deactivating effect correlates with a lower yield of the minor (ortho, para) products. Thus, the order of increasing para-isomer yield among these three is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Ortho-, para-directing groups (1, 5, 3):**\nThese substituents direct the electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The ratio of para to ortho product is largely determined by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will favor the formation of the para-isomer to a greater extent.\n*   **1) Toluene (-CH₃):** The methyl group is relatively small. Bromination of toluene gives a mixture of ortho- and para-bromotoluene. The para-isomer is generally favored, but a significant amount of the ortho-isomer is also formed.\n*   **5) Ethylbenzene (-C₂H₅):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions leads to a higher proportion of the para-isomer compared to toluene.\n*   **3) Chlorobenzene (-Cl):** The chloro group is an ortho-, para-director. Due to its size and electronic properties, it gives a high yield of the para-isomer upon halogenation. For bromination, chlorobenzene yields a significant amount of p-bromochlorobenzene.\n\nComparing the ortho-, para-directors, the steric hindrance increases from -CH₃ to -C₂H₅, so the percentage of the para-isomer will be higher for ethylbenzene than for toluene. The -Cl group, while deactivating, strongly favors the para position over the ortho position due to a combination of electronic and steric effects. Typically, halogenation of chlorobenzene gives a very high para/ortho ratio. Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### Final Ordering:\n\nCombining the two groups, we have the meta-directors with very low para-isomer yields, followed by the ortho-, para-directors with much higher yields.\n\nThe final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2) < Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nTo arrange the given substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### Step 1: Classify the Substituents\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents based on their effect on the benzene ring's reactivity and their directing properties.\n\n*   **Group 1: Ortho-, Para-Directing Substituents**\n    *   These groups direct the incoming electrophile (bromine) to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) **-CH₃** (in Toluene): Activating group.\n    *   5) **-C₂H₅** (in Ethylbenzene): Activating group.\n    *   3) **-Cl** (in Chlorobenzene): Deactivating group, but still ortho-, para-directing.\n\n*   **Group 2: Meta-Directing Substituents**\n    *   These groups are all deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position.\n    *   4) **-NO₂** (in Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating.\n    *   6) **-COOH** (in Benzoic acid): Strongly deactivating.\n    *   2) **-COOC₂H₅** (in Ethyl benzoate): Strongly deactivating.\n\n### Step 2: Compare Para-Isomer Yield Between Groups\n\nSubstances with meta-directing groups will produce very low yields of the para-isomer, as the main product will be the meta-isomer. For example, the bromination of nitrobenzene and benzoic acid predominantly yields the meta-bromo derivative. In contrast, substances with ortho-, para-directing groups will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer. Therefore, the substances in Group 2 will have a lower weight fraction of the para-isomer than the substances in Group 1.\n\nThe overall order will be: **{Group 2} < {Group 1}**\n\n### Step 3: Order Substances within Group 2 (Meta-Directors)\n\nWe need to arrange nitrobenzene (4), benzoic acid (6), and ethyl benzoate (2) in order of increasing para-isomer yield. These groups are strongly deactivating, and the para-product is formed in very small amounts. The order depends on the strength of the deactivating and meta-directing effect. Stronger deactivation leads to a lower proportion of ortho and para products.\n\n*   **-NO₂ (4):** This is one of the most powerful deactivating groups. It directs very strongly to the meta position, resulting in a minuscule yield of the para-isomer (typically <1%).\n*   **-COOH (6):** This is also a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Its deactivating effect is comparable to, but generally considered slightly less powerful than, the nitro group. The para yield is extremely low.\n*   **-COOC₂H₅ (2):** This ester group is strongly deactivating and meta-directing, similar to the carboxylic acid group. Data from nitration reactions, which follow similar principles, show that ethyl benzoate yields a slightly higher percentage of the para-isomer (around 5%) compared to nitrobenzene or benzoic acid (around 1-2%).\n\nBased on the deactivating strength (-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅), the yield of the para-isomer will increase in the reverse order.\nOrder of increasing para yield: **4 (-NO₂) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC₂H₅)**\n\n### Step 4: Order Substances within Group 1 (Ortho-, Para-Directors)\n\nFor toluene (1), ethylbenzene (5), and chlorobenzene (3), the yield of the para-isomer relative to the ortho-isomer is primarily determined by **steric hindrance**. A larger substituent will block the adjacent ortho positions, making an attack at the more distant para position more favorable.\n\n*   **-CH₃ (1):** The methyl group is relatively small. It provides some steric hindrance, but a significant amount of ortho-product is still formed. For bromination of toluene, the para-isomer yield is high (around 67%), but the ortho-isomer yield is also significant (around 33%).\n*   **-C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased size causes more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer compared to toluene.\n*   **-Cl (3):** The chloro group, although a single atom, is sterically demanding. It strongly favors the formation of the para-isomer. For example, in the nitration of chlorobenzene, the para-isomer is the major product with a yield of about 70%. In the bromination of bromobenzene, the para-product can be as high as 85%. This indicates a very strong preference for the para position.\n\nComparing the steric bulk and resulting para-preference: -CH₃ < -C₂H₅ < -Cl.\nOrder of increasing para yield: **1 (-CH₃) < 5 (-C₂H₅) < 3 (-Cl)**\n\n### Step 5: Combine the Orders\n\nBy combining the ordered groups, we get the final sequence for the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe user has confirmed the previous step's output was correct by providing no errors. The model has successfully identified the correct order by applying chemical constraints. The final step is to provide the answer.\n\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n\n1.  **Constraint 1: Identify Directing Groups.** The first step is to classify the substituents as either ortho,para-directing or meta-directing.\n    *   **Ortho,para-directors (activating groups and halogens):** These will produce a high yield of the para-isomer.\n        *   1) -CH₃ (Toluene)\n        *   5) -C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n        *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n    *   **Meta-directors (deactivating groups):** These will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n        *   4) -NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n        *   2) -COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n        *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid)\n\n2.  **Constraint 2: Prune the Search Space.** Any correct ordering must place the substances with meta-directors before the substances with ortho,para-directors, as their para-isomer yield will be significantly lower.\n    *   Correct Order Form: `{4, 2, 6} < {1, 5, 3}`\n    *   This immediately eliminates option C, which starts with ortho,para-directors.\n\n3.  **Constraint 3: Order the Meta-Directors.** The yield of the para-isomer for meta-directing groups is inversely related to their deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, leading to an even smaller percentage of ortho and para products.\n    *   Deactivating strength: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-yield is: 4 (-NO₂) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC₂H₅).\n    *   The final sequence must begin with `4 < 6 < 2`. This eliminates option D.\n\n4.  **Constraint 4: Order the Ortho,Para-Directors.** The ratio of para to ortho product depends on steric hindrance and electronic factors.\n    *   **Steric Hindrance:** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased bulk hinders attack at the ortho positions more, leading to a higher relative yield of the para-isomer for ethylbenzene (5) compared to toluene (1). So, `1 < 5`.\n    *   **Halogen Selectivity:** Halogens like chlorine (-Cl) are known to give very high para-selectivity in electrophilic substitution, especially with a bulky electrophile like bromine. The para-isomer is strongly favored.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-yield is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\n5.  **Final Assembly:** Combining the ordered groups gives the final sequence: `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a self-debate to determine the correct order of substances.\n\n**Proposer's Initial Argument:**\nThe question asks to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing yield of the para-bromo isomer upon electrophilic substitution. The key factors are the directing effects of the substituents (ortho/para vs. meta) and steric hindrance.\n\n1.  **Categorize Substituents:**\n    *   **Ortho/para directors:** These will produce a significant amount of the para isomer. They are `-CH3` (1), `-C2H5` (5), and `-Cl` (3).\n    *   **Meta directors:** These will produce very little of the para isomer. They are `-NO2` (4), `-COOC2H5` (2), and `-COOH` (6).\n\n2.  **Order the Meta Directors:**\n    These groups are all deactivating. The stronger the deactivating effect, the more strongly it directs to the meta position, and therefore the lower the yield of the para isomer. The order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n    Therefore, the order of increasing para yield for this group is: `4 < 6 < 2`.\n\n3.  **Order the Ortho/Para Directors:**\n    For these groups, the ratio of para to ortho product determines the final yield. This is largely influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n    *   The `-C2H5` group (5) is bulkier than the `-CH3` group (1). This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions will favor the formation of the para isomer more in ethylbenzene than in toluene. So, `1 < 5`.\n    *   The `-Cl` group (3) is an ortho/para director, but its strong inductive effect deactivates the ortho position more than the para position, leading to a very high preference for the para isomer.\n\n4.  **Proposed Solution Path:**\n    Combining these, the meta-directors will have the lowest para yields, followed by the ortho/para directors. The proposed full order is `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`. This corresponds to option B. To confirm the relative para yields of the ortho/para directors, a search is warranted.\n\n**Skeptic's Cross-Examination:**\nThe logic is sound, but it relies on textbook knowledge of directing effects and steric hindrance. The relative ordering of the ortho/para directors, specifically placing chlorobenzene (3) as having the highest para yield, is a critical point that should be verified with data. While the inductive effect argument is correct, its magnitude compared to the steric effects of alkyl groups might not be immediately obvious. Furthermore, the assumption about the deactivating strength order of `-COOH` vs. `-COOC2H5` is standard but worth a quick confirmation. A single search action can verify the product distributions for the key ortho/para directing groups.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe next action will be to perform a search to find the typical percentage yields of the para isomer for the bromination of toluene, ethylbenzene, and chlorobenzene to confirm the proposed order `1 < 5 < 3`.\n\n**Proposer's Final Argument:**\nThe initial hypothesis is strongly supported by the search results. The core logic remains the same, but now it is backed by specific data.\n\n1.  **Meta Directors (Substances 4, 2, 6):** These are `-NO2`, `-COOC2H5`, and `-COOH`. They are all deactivating and meta-directing, meaning they will produce the lowest yields of the para-isomer. The stronger the deactivating effect, the lower the para yield. The established order of deactivating strength is `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`. Therefore, the order of increasing para yield is nitrobenzene (4) < benzoic acid (6) < ethyl benzoate (2).\n\n2.  **Ortho/Para Directors (Substances 1, 3, 5):** These are `-CH3`, `-Cl`, and `-C2H5`. They will produce much higher yields of the para-isomer. The search results provide the data needed to order them:\n    *   **Toluene (1, -CH3):** Bromination yields about 66.8% of the para-isomer, although some sources cite lower figures for other halogenations (e.g., 39% para for chlorination). Let's consider the bromination-specific data.\n    *   **Ethylbenzene (5, -C2H5):** The bulkier ethyl group increases steric hindrance at the ortho positions compared to the methyl group, thus increasing the proportion of the para product relative to toluene. The para isomer is the major product.\n    *   **Chlorobenzene (3, -Cl):** Halogenation of chlorobenzene strongly favors the para position. For example, nitration gives 70% para product. For bromination of bromobenzene, the para product can be as high as 85%. This high para selectivity is due to the strong deactivating inductive effect of the halogen at the ortho position, which disfavors attack there more than at the para position.\n\n3.  **Refined Ordering of Ortho/Para Directors:** Based on the data, chlorobenzene (3) gives the highest percentage of para-isomer. Between the two alkylbenzenes, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para yield than toluene (1) due to greater steric hindrance. However, a direct comparison of bromination data shows toluene at 66.8% para and chlorination of chlorobenzene at 70% para. Bromination of bromobenzene is even higher at 85%. This confirms that the halogen (-Cl) is more para-directing than the alkyl groups. The order of increasing para yield is Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:** Combining the two groups, the complete order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n    `4 (-NO2) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC2H5) < 1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl)`.\n\nThis sequence matches option B.\n\n**Skeptic's Final Assessment:**\nThe proposer's initial reasoning was sound, and the search results have confirmed the critical details, especially the surprisingly high para-directing nature of halogens compared to alkyl groups in this context. The final derived order is well-supported by the principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution and by specific reaction data.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first step is to categorize the substituents on the benzene ring. This will determine the primary products and give a rough grouping for the para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the meta position. Consequently, they produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) C6H5-**NO2** (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C6H5-**COOH** (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C6H5-**COOC2H5** (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) C6H5-**CH3** (Toluene)\n    *   5) C6H5-**C2H5** (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C6H5-**Cl** (Chlorobenzene)\n\nBased on this classification, the three substances with meta-directing groups (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest para-isomer yields and will appear first in the sequence. The three substances with ortho, para-directing groups (1, 5, 3) will have the highest yields and will appear last.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Groups (Lowest Para-Yield)**\nFor meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the para product.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse:\nNitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)\n\nThe beginning of our sequence is **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Groups (Highest Para-Yield)**\nFor these groups, we need to compare the ratio of the para product to the ortho product. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (-CH3 vs. -C2H5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) in substance 5 is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3) in substance 1. This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene (1).\n    *   Order: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)\n\n*   **Comparing with the Chloro Group (-Cl):** The chloro group in substance 3 is a special case. While it is deactivating overall, it is an ortho, para-director. Due to a combination of its size and its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (which is felt more strongly at the ortho positions), it strongly favors the formation of the para-isomer. Experimental data shows that the bromination of chlorobenzene yields a very high percentage of the para-product (e.g., ~87-90%), which is significantly higher than for toluene (~67%) or ethylbenzene.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\nToluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)\n\nThe end of our sequence is **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Orders**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final sequence from the lowest para-yield to the highest:\n\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"

Meta-directors (-NO2, -COOC2H5, -COOH) yield negligible amounts of the para-isomer and thus must appear at the beginning of the sequence (lowest yield). Ortho/para-directors (-Cl, -CH3, -C2H5) yield significant amounts of the para-isomer and must appear at the end. This constraint correctly eliminated option B, which incorrectly placed ortho/para directors at the beginning of the sequence.\n\n3.  **Constraint 2: Steric Hindrance:** The second constraint focused on the ortho/para directors (Cl, CH3, C2H5). For these groups, a larger substituent size causes more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, which favors the formation of the para-isomer. The order of increasing substituent size is Cl < CH3 < C2H5. Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield must be C6H5-Cl < C6H5-CH3 < C6H5-C2H5 (substance 3 < 1 < 5). The script checked the surviving hypotheses (A, C, D) against this rule. Only option A had the correct ordering [3, 1, 5] for its ortho/para directors. Options C and D were eliminated.\n\nThe script concluded that option A is the only one that satisfies both chemical constraints.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction, we must analyze the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring.\n\nThe six substances are:\n1.  **C6H5-CH3** (Toluene)\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5** (Ethyl benzoate)\n3.  **C6H5-Cl** (Chlorobenzene)\n4.  **C6H5-NO2** (Nitrobenzene)\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5** (Ethylbenzene)\n6.  **C6H5-COOH** (Benzoic acid)\n\nSubstituents on a benzene ring are classified based on how they influence the rate and regioselectivity of electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n\n**Meta-Directing Groups (Deactivating):**\nThese groups withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive, and direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position. Consequently, they produce very low yields of the para-isomer.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group is a very strong deactivating, meta-directing group. It produces almost exclusively the meta-isomer, with only trace amounts of ortho and para products. For bromination, the para-isomer yield is extremely low, often cited as less than 1%.\n*   **-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The carboxylic acid group is a deactivating, meta-directing group. It directs bromination primarily to the meta position.\n*   **-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** The ester group is also a deactivating, meta-directing group, similar in effect to the carboxylic acid group. For the related nitration reaction, ethyl benzoate yields about 5% of the para-isomer.\n\nAmong these meta-directors, the deactivating strength generally follows the order -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5. A stronger deactivating group leads to a lower proportion of the para product. Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: Nitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate.\n\n**Ortho-, Para-Directing Groups:**\nThese groups direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. The ratio of para to ortho product is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n*   **-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** Halogens are deactivating but ortho-, para-directing. Due to the combination of inductive withdrawal and resonance donation, along with steric factors, halobenzenes often give a high yield of the para-isomer. For the bromination of bromobenzene, the para-isomer is formed in 85% yield. For the nitration of chlorobenzene, the para-isomer yield is about 70%. Chlorobenzene is highly selective for the para position.\n*   **-CH3 (Toluene):** The methyl group is an activating, ortho-, para-directing group. In the bromination of toluene, the para-isomer is the major product, with a reported yield of 66.8%.\n*   **-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group is also an activating, ortho-, para-directing group. It is slightly bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions would be expected to favor the para-isomer even more than in toluene. However, experimental data for various electrophilic substitutions can be complex. For bromination, the para position in ethylbenzene has been found to be less reactive than the ortho positions under certain conditions, which is an exception to the general trend. In general, for alkylbenzenes, increasing the steric bulk of the alkyl group increases the para/ortho ratio. For example, in nitration, tert-butylbenzene gives a 75% para yield compared to 37% for toluene. While specific data for bromination of ethylbenzene can vary, it is an activating group and will produce a significant amount of para product, likely comparable to or slightly more than toluene.\n\n**Arranging all substances:**\n\nThe meta-directing compounds will have the lowest para-isomer yields, followed by the ortho-, para-directing compounds.\n\n1.  **Lowest para-yields (meta-directors):**\n    *   Nitrobenzene (4) will have the lowest yield (<1%).\n    *   Benzoic acid (6) and Ethyl benzoate (2) will have slightly higher, but still very low, yields. Comparing -COOH and -COOC2H5, their deactivating effects are similar. Data for nitration shows ethyl benzoate gives ~5% para product. We can place them in the order 4 < 6 < 2.\n\n2.  **Highest para-yields (ortho-, para-directors):**\n    *   Toluene (1) gives a 66.8% para yield in bromination.\n    *   Ethylbenzene (5) is expected to have a para yield similar to or slightly higher than toluene due to sterics.\n    *   Chlorobenzene (3) is known to be highly para-selective, with para yields often exceeding those of simple alkylbenzenes in halogenation reactions (e.g., 85% for bromination of bromobenzene).\n\nCombining these observations, the overall order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\nNitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2) < Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction, we must analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### Analysis of Substituents\n\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution. The substituent already on the ring determines where the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br+) will add. Substituents are classified as either ortho-, para-directing or meta-directing.\n\n1.  **С₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is an activating, ortho-, para-director.\n2.  **C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate):** The ethyl carboxylate group (-COOC₂H₅) is a deactivating, meta-director.\n3.  **C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group (-Cl) is a deactivating, ortho-, para-director.\n4.  **C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group (-NO₂) is a strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n5.  **C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is an activating, ortho-, para-director.\n6.  **C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The carboxyl group (-COOH) is a deactivating, meta-director.\n\n### Ordering the Substances\n\nThe yield of the para-isomer is significantly lower for meta-directing groups compared to ortho-, para-directing groups. Therefore, substances 4, 2, and 6 will have the lowest para-isomer yields.\n\n**1. Meta-directing groups (lowest para-yield):**\n*   **4 (C₆H₅-NO₂):** The -NO₂ group is a very strong deactivating meta-director. Bromination of nitrobenzene primarily yields the meta-isomer, with very small amounts of ortho and para products.\n*   **2 (C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅) and 6 (C₆H₅-COOH):** The -COOC₂H₅ and -COOH groups are also deactivating meta-directors. Their deactivating strength is generally considered less than the nitro group but still strong. For nitration, a benzoic ester gave 73% meta, 22% ortho, and only 5% para product. The para-yield for these will be very low, but likely slightly higher than for the strongly deactivated nitrobenzene. It is difficult to definitively order -COOH and -COOC₂H₅ without specific data for bromination, but they are often grouped together in terms of directing effects. Based on available data for similar reactions, the order of increasing para-yield among these is generally considered to be NO₂ < COOH ≈ COOC₂H₅. Let's assume for this problem that the deactivating strength correlates inversely with para-yield, so the order is 4 < 2 < 6 or 4 < 6 < 2.\n\n**2. Ortho-, para-directing groups (highest para-yield):**\nFor these groups, the distribution between the ortho and para positions is primarily influenced by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will hinder attack at the nearby ortho positions, thus increasing the proportion of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **1 (С₆H₅-CH₃ - Toluene):** The methyl group is relatively small. It allows for significant substitution at both ortho and para positions. For nitration, toluene gives about 37% para-product.\n*   **5 (C₆H₅-C₂H₅ - Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance disfavors the ortho position more than in toluene, leading to a higher para/ortho ratio and thus a higher yield of the para-isomer.\n*   **3 (C₆H₅-Cl - Chlorobenzene):** Halogens are an exception; although they are deactivating, they are ortho-, para-directors. The chloro group often leads to a high percentage of the para-isomer. For example, nitration of chlorobenzene yields 70% para-product. This high para-selectivity is a known characteristic for halogens.\n\n**3. Combining and Finalizing the Order:**\n\nLet's establish the order from lowest to highest para-yield:\n\n*   The meta-directors will come first: 4, 2, and 6. Based on the strong deactivating nature of the nitro group, it will have the lowest para-yield. Between -COOH and -COOC₂H₅, their directing effects are similar, but typically the ester group is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid. However, some sources place the para yield for nitration of benzoic esters (5%) lower than what might be expected for benzoic acid. A common order of deactivating strength is -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOR. A stronger deactivating effect generally correlates with a lower ortho/para yield. Thus, the order of increasing para-yield is likely 4 < 6 < 2.\n*   The ortho-, para-directors will come next: 1, 5, and 3.\n    *   Comparing alkyl groups, the bulkier ethyl group (5) will give more para-product than the methyl group (1) due to greater steric hindrance at the ortho positions. So, 1 < 5.\n    *   Comparing the alkyl groups to the chloro group (3), halogens are known to give very high para-selectivity. The para-isomer is the major product in the halogenation of chlorobenzene, often around 87-90%. This is significantly higher than for toluene (around 62% para) or ethylbenzene. Therefore, chlorobenzene (3) will have the highest para-yield among the o,p-directors.\n*   So, the order for the o,p-directors is 1 < 5 < 3.\n\nCombining the two groups, the complete sequence for increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer during electrophilic bromination, we must analyze the directing effects of the substituent on each benzene ring.\n\nThe directing effect of a substituent determines the position (ortho, meta, or para) where the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br+) will attach.\n\nFirst, we can categorize the substituents into two groups:\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. As a result, they will produce very low yields of the para-isomer. The substituents in this category are:\n    *   **-NO2 (Nitrobenzene, 4):** Strongly deactivating.\n    *   **-COOH (Benzoic acid, 6):** Deactivating.\n    *   **-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate, 2):** Deactivating.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions, resulting in significant yields of the para-isomer. The substituents in this category are:\n    *   **-CH3 (Toluene, 1):** Activating.\n    *   **-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene, 5):** Activating.\n    *   **-Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3):** Deactivating overall, but ortho, para-directing.\n\n**Step 1: Ordering the meta-directors (lowest para-yield)**\n\nFor meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is minimal. The stronger the deactivating effect of the group, the more strongly it directs to the meta position, and thus the lower the yield of the para-isomer. The order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be the lowest for nitrobenzene, followed by benzoic acid, and then ethyl benzoate. This gives us the beginning of our sequence:\n**4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**Step 2: Ordering the ortho, para-directors (highest para-yield)**\n\nFor ortho, para-directing groups, the ratio of the para to ortho isomer is primarily influenced by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of the para product.\n\n*   **-CH3 vs. -C2H5:** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased steric hindrance around the ortho positions in ethylbenzene favors the formation of the para-isomer more than in toluene. Thus, the para-isomer yield for ethylbenzene is higher than for toluene.\n    *   Yield(para-isomer of 1) < Yield(para-isomer of 5)\n\n*   **-Cl vs. alkyl groups:** The chloro group is also ortho, para-directing. Due to a combination of its size and electronic effects, it strongly favors the formation of the para-isomer, often yielding a very high para-to-ortho ratio in bromination reactions. The bromination of chlorobenzene typically yields about 88-89% of the para-isomer, which is generally higher than for toluene (~66%) and ethylbenzene.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield among these three is:\n**1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**Step 3: Combining the sequences**\n\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final sequence from the lowest para-yield to the highest:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Reaction and the Goal**\nThe reaction is the electrophilic bromination of substituted benzene rings. The goal is to arrange the starting substances in order of increasing yield (weight fraction) of the para-substituted product (para-isomer).\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\nWe need to classify each substituent on the benzene ring (C6H5-X) based on its electronic effect (activating or deactivating) and its directing effect (ortho/para or meta).\n\n*   **Activating, Ortho/Para-Directing Groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive than benzene. They direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) **-CH3 (methyl)**: Activating (by induction and hyperconjugation).\n    *   5) **-C2H5 (ethyl)**: Activating (by induction and hyperconjugation), slightly more so than methyl.\n\n*   **Deactivating, Ortho/Para-Directing Groups:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring (making it less reactive) but direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   3) **-Cl (chloro)**: Deactivating (strong inductive withdrawal) but o,p-directing (resonance donation).\n\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups strongly withdraw electron density from the ring and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position.\n    *   2) **-COOC2H5 (ethyl ester)**: Deactivating (by resonance).\n    *   4) **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating (by induction and resonance).\n    *   6) **-COOH (carboxylic acid)**: Deactivating (by resonance).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Para-Isomer Yield for Each Group**\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Substances 2, 4, 6):**\n    *   These substances will produce the meta-isomer as the major product. The yield of the para-isomer will be extremely low, close to zero.\n    *   To order them, we consider the strength of their deactivating effect. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, meaning it will produce an even smaller amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n    *   Therefore, the order of *increasing* para-isomer yield for this group is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n*   **Ortho/Para-Directors (Substances 1, 3, 5):**\n    *   These substances will produce a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The yield of the para-isomer will be significant.\n    *   The ratio of para to ortho product is determined by steric and electronic factors.\n    *   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene.\n        *   Order: **1 < 5**.\n    *   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chloro group is deactivating due to its strong inductive effect, which is felt most strongly at the ortho positions. This electronic effect disfavors ortho substitution more than para substitution. This, combined with the steric hindrance of the chlorine atom, leads to a very high preference for the para-isomer. The para-isomer is the major product by a large margin (often ~90% yield). This percentage is higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n        *   Order: **5 < 3**.\n    *   Combining these, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups to Get the Final Order**\nThe meta-directing substances will have the lowest para-isomer yields, followed by the ortho/para-directing substances.\n\n1.  Start with the meta-directors, ordered from strongest to weakest deactivator: **4 < 6 < 2**\n2.  Continue with the ortho/para-directors, ordered by their increasing preference for the para position: **< 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe final combined order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric properties of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\nThe substances are:\n1)  **Toluene** (C₆H₅-CH₃)\n2)  **Ethyl benzoate** (C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅)\n3)  **Chlorobenzene** (C₆H₅-Cl)\n4)  **Nitrobenzene** (C₆H₅-NO₂)\n5)  **Ethylbenzene** (C₆H₅-C₂H₅)\n6)  **Benzoic acid** (C₆H₅-COOH)\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents based on their directing effects for electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. Consequently, they produce a very low yield of the para-isomer. The groups in this category are:\n    *   -NO₂ (Nitrobenzene, 4)\n    *   -COOH (Benzoic acid, 6)\n    *   -COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate, 2)\n\n    Among these, the nitro group (-NO₂) is the strongest deactivating group, followed by the carboxyl group (-COOH), and then the ester group (-COOC₂H₅). A stronger deactivating effect leads to higher meta-selectivity and thus a lower yield of the para-isomer. Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for these three substances is: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The ratio of para to ortho product is influenced by steric hindrance. The groups in this category are:\n    *   -CH₃ (Toluene, 1)\n    *   -C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene, 5)\n    *   -Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3)\n\n    1.  **-CH₃ (Toluene) vs. -C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased steric hindrance around the ortho positions makes the para position more accessible for the incoming electrophile. As a result, ethylbenzene produces a higher percentage of the para-isomer compared to toluene. So, the order is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5).\n\n    2.  **-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group is deactivating overall but is an ortho, para-director due to its resonance effect. Halogens typically give a high yield of the para-isomer in electrophilic substitution reactions, often higher than alkylbenzenes, because the ortho positions are significantly deactivated by the strong inductive effect. For example, in nitration, chlorobenzene yields about 70% of the para-isomer, whereas toluene yields only about 37%. A similar high selectivity for the para position is expected for bromination.\n\n    Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\n**Combining the two groups:**\n\nThe meta-directing substances will have the lowest para-isomer yields, followed by the ortho, para-directing substances.\n\nCombining the established orders:\n(4 < 6 < 2) and (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete sequence in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### **1. Understand the Reaction and the Goal**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (specifically, bromination) on a series of monosubstituted benzene rings. The goal is to arrange the starting substances in order of *increasing* weight fraction of the *para*-bromo derivative among the monobrominated products. This is determined by the directing effect of the substituent already on the benzene ring.\n\n### **2. Classify the Substituents**\n\nWe need to classify each substituent based on its effect on the benzene ring's reactivity and its directing influence (ortho, para, or meta).\n\n*   **Activating, Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive than benzene. They direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) **-CH₃ (methyl)**: Activating\n    *   5) **-C₂H₅ (ethyl)**: Activating\n\n*   **Deactivating, Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups withdraw electron density (deactivating the ring) but have lone pairs that can participate in resonance, directing the electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   3) **-Cl (chloro)**: Deactivating\n\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive than benzene. They direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position.\n    *   2) **-COOC₂H₅ (ethyl carboxylate)**: Deactivating\n    *   4) **-NO₂ (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating\n    *   6) **-COOH (carboxylic acid)**: Deactivating\n\n### **3. Analyze the Groups with Low Para-Yield (Meta-Directors)**\n\nSubstances with meta-directing groups will produce the meta-isomer as the major product. The yield of the ortho and para isomers will be very low. To rank them, we consider their deactivating strength. The stronger the deactivating effect, the more pronounced the meta-direction, and thus the lower the yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n**-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**\n\n*   **-NO₂ (4)** is one of the strongest deactivating groups. It will give the lowest yield of the para-isomer.\n*   **-COOH (6)** is a strong deactivator.\n*   **-COOC₂H₅ (2)** is also a deactivator, but slightly weaker than -COOH because the ethyl group is weakly electron-donating to the carboxyl system.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this set is:\n**4 < 6 < 2**\n\n### **4. Analyze the Groups with High Para-Yield (Ortho, Para-Directors)**\n\nSubstances with ortho, para-directing groups will produce a mixture of ortho and para isomers as the major products. The ratio between the para and ortho isomers determines their rank. The para position is generally favored over the ortho position due to reduced steric hindrance.\n\n*   **-CH₃ (1) vs. -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions more significantly. Consequently, substitution at the less hindered para position is more favored for ethylbenzene than for toluene.\n    *   Yield of para-isomer for Toluene (1) < Yield of para-isomer for Ethylbenzene (5).\n\n*   **-Cl (3) vs. Alkyl Groups (1, 5):** The chloro group is an ortho, para-director. For halogenated benzenes (especially F, Cl, Br), the para-isomer is typically highly favored in electrophilic substitutions. Experimental data for bromination shows that chlorobenzene gives a very high percentage of the para-product (around 87%), which is significantly higher than for toluene (~67%) or ethylbenzene (~70%).\n\nCombining these observations, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this set is:\n**1 (Toluene) < 5 (Ethylbenzene) < 3 (Chlorobenzene)**\n\n### **5. Combine the Rankings**\n\nThe meta-directing groups will always produce a much lower yield of the para-isomer than the ortho, para-directing groups. By combining the two ranked sets, we get the final overall order.\n\n(Low para-yield group) < (High para-yield group)\n**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe complete order of substances in increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to:\nNitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate < Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\n\n### **6. Match with the Given Options**\n\nLet's compare our derived order with the choices provided:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nC) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nD) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nOur calculated order, **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**, matches option D exactly.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe user wants me to solve a chemistry problem by arranging substances in order of increasing yield of the para-isomer during electrophilic bromination.\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Understand the Reaction:** The reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a monosubstituted benzene ring. The position of the incoming bromine atom (ortho, meta, or para) is determined by the directing effect of the substituent already on the ring.\n\n2.  **Classify the Substituents:** We need to classify each substituent as either an ortho, para-director or a meta-director.\n    *   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They are typically electron-donating groups (activating) or halogens (deactivating).\n        *   -CH3 (in Toluene, 1): Activating, o,p-director.\n        *   -C2H5 (in Ethylbenzene, 5): Activating, o,p-director.\n        *   -Cl (in Chlorobenzene, 3): Deactivating, o,p-director.\n    *   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They are electron-withdrawing groups (deactivating).\n        *   -NO2 (in Nitrobenzene, 4): Strongly deactivating, m-director.\n        *   -COOH (in Benzoic acid, 6): Deactivating, m-director.\n        *   -COOC2H5 (in Ethyl benzoate, 2): Deactivating, m-director.\n\n3.  **Initial Grouping:** Substances with meta-directing groups will produce very little para-isomer, while substances with ortho, para-directing groups will produce a significant amount. Therefore, the final order will have all the meta-directing substances first, followed by the ortho, para-directing substances.\n    *   Group 1 (low para-yield): {Nitrobenzene (4), Benzoic acid (6), Ethyl benzoate (2)}\n    *   Group 2 (high para-yield): {Toluene (1), Ethylbenzene (5), Chlorobenzene (3)}\n    *   The final order will be: {Group 1 sorted} < {Group 2 sorted}\n\n4.  **Order within Group 1 (Meta-directors):** The yield of the para-isomer for these compounds is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the para product.\n    *   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse: Nitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate.\n    *   This gives the order: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n5.  **Order within Group 2 (Ortho, para-directors):** For these compounds, we need to compare the ratio of the para product to the ortho product. This is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n    *   **Toluene (1) vs. Ethylbenzene (5):** Both have activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased steric hindrance near the ortho positions in ethylbenzene makes the para position more accessible and thus more favored compared to toluene. Therefore, the para-yield for ethylbenzene is higher than for toluene. Order: **1 < 5**.\n    *   **Chlorobenzene (3):** Halogens are a special case. While they are deactivating overall due to their strong inductive effect, they are o,p-directing due to resonance. The para-isomer is highly favored over the ortho-isomer, often more so than with activating alkyl groups. This is partly because the deactivating inductive effect is felt more strongly at the closer ortho position, making the para position electronically more favorable. Bromination of chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer (around 87%).\n    *   Comparing the para-yields: Toluene (~67%) < Ethylbenzene (~70%) < Chlorobenzene (~87%).\n    *   This gives the order: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n6.  **Combine the Orders:** Now we combine the sorted groups.\n    *   Order of Group 1: 4 < 6 < 2\n    *   Order of Group 2: 1 < 5 < 3\n    *   Combined final order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\n7.  **Match with Options:** The derived order `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3` matches option A.\n\nThe Python code execution has already confirmed this order based on established experimental data for para-isomer yields.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires arranging substituted benzenes by the increasing yield of the para-isomer upon bromination. This depends on the electronic and steric effects of the substituent.\n\n1.  **Plan:**\n    *   Categorize substituents as ortho/para-directing or meta-directing.\n    *   For meta-directors, order them by increasing deactivating strength (stronger deactivation leads to less para product).\n    *   For ortho/para-directors, order them based on steric hindrance (larger groups favor the para position more) and electronic effects.\n    *   Combine the two groups to get the final order.\n\n2.  **Execute Action 1 (Categorization & Meta-Directors):**\n    *   **Meta-directors (deactivating):** -NO₂ (4), -COOH (6), -COOC₂H₅ (2). These will have the lowest para yields.\n    *   **Ortho/para-directors:** -CH₃ (1, activating), -C₂H₅ (5, activating), -Cl (3, deactivating). These will have the highest para yields.\n    *   Now, let's order the meta-directors. The strength of deactivation is -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅. A more strongly deactivating group directs more strongly to the meta position, leaving a smaller fraction for the para position.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para yield is: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n\n3.  **Execute Action 2 (Ortho/Para-Directors):**\n    *   Now, let's order the o,p-directors: Toluene (1), Ethylbenzene (5), and Chlorobenzene (3).\n    *   The yield of the para isomer relative to the ortho isomer is primarily governed by sterics. A bulkier group will hinder the ortho positions more, leading to a higher proportion of the para product.\n    *   The steric bulk increases in the order: -CH₃ < -C₂H₅. Therefore, ethylbenzene should give a higher percentage of para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   Chlorine (-Cl) is an exception. Although it's deactivating, it's a very strong para-director due to a combination of its size and electronic effects (inductive vs. resonance), often yielding the highest percentage of para-product among these three.\n    *   So, the order of increasing para yield is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\n4.  **Final Arrangement:**\n    *   Combining the two groups, we get the complete order of increasing para-isomer yield:\n    *   4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3\n    *   This sequence matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a breakdown of the analysis to determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield for the electrophilic bromination of the given substances.\n\n### 1. Classifying the Substituents\n\nFirst, we classify each substituent on the benzene ring (C6H5-) based on its directing effect in electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br+) to the positions ortho (adjacent) and para (opposite) to themselves.\n    *   **Activating:** -CH3 (Toluene, 1), -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene, 5)\n    *   **Deactivating:** -Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3)\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They are all deactivating.\n    *   -NO2 (Nitrobenzene, 4)\n    *   -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate, 2)\n    *   -COOH (Benzoic acid, 6)\n\n### 2. Estimating Para-Isomer Yield\n\nThe yield of the para-isomer depends on two main factors: the directing effect of the substituent and steric hindrance.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (4, 2, 6):** These substances will produce the meta-isomer as the major product. The yield of the para-isomer will be very low.\n    *   **Nitrobenzene (-NO2, 4):** The -NO2 group is strongly deactivating. Bromination yields almost exclusively the meta-isomer, with only trace amounts of the ortho and para products. Outside of special laboratory conditions, the para yield is nearly 0%.\n    *   **Benzoic acid (-COOH, 6) and Ethyl benzoate (-COOC2H5, 2):** These are also meta-directors. While the primary product is meta, they typically yield a small but measurable percentage of the para-isomer, which is generally higher than that for nitrobenzene. For example, in nitration (a similar electrophilic substitution), ethyl benzoate gives about 5% para-isomer. The para yield for benzoic acid is also expected to be in this low single-digit range. Comparing the two, the -COOH and -COOC2H5 groups have similar deactivating strengths, leading to very low and comparable para yields.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (1, 5, 3):** These substances will produce significant amounts of both ortho and para isomers. The ratio between them is influenced by sterics.\n    *   **Toluene (-CH3, 1):** The methyl group is relatively small. For bromination, the product distribution is approximately 33% ortho and 67% para. Another source reports about 56% para-isomer.\n    *   **Ethylbenzene (-C2H5, 5):** The ethyl group is larger than the methyl group. This increased steric bulk hinders the attack at the ortho positions, thus favoring the formation of the para-isomer even more than in toluene.\n    *   **Chlorobenzene (-Cl, 3):** The chloro group is an ortho, para-director. Due to its electronic properties and size, it strongly favors the para position. For similar reactions like nitration, chlorobenzene gives a product mixture of about 30% ortho and 70% para. For bromination, the para-selectivity is even higher, often yielding close to 90% para-isomer.\n\n### 3. Ranking the Substances\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can arrange the substances in order of increasing yield of the para-isomer:\n\n1.  **Nitrobenzene (4):** Yields virtually no para-isomer (approaching 0%).\n2.  **Benzoic acid (6) and Ethyl benzoate (2):** Yield very small amounts of the para-isomer (low single-digit percentages). It is difficult to definitively order these two without precise experimental data for bromination, but they are clearly next after nitrobenzene.\n3.  **Toluene (1):** Yields a significant amount of para-isomer, around 56-67%.\n4.  **Ethylbenzene (5):** The larger ethyl group leads to greater steric hindrance at the ortho position compared to toluene, resulting in a higher yield of the para-isomer.\n5.  **Chlorobenzene (3):** Exhibits very high para-selectivity, often the highest among common monosubstituted benzenes, with para-isomer yields that can approach or exceed 90%.\n\nTherefore, the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n\n**4 < 6 ≈ 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nLooking at the provided options, option D matches this derived order.\n\n**4 (-NO2) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC2H5) < 1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl)**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we need to consider the directing effects and steric hindrance of the substituents on the benzene ring.\n\n### Analysis of Substituents:\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents based on their activating/deactivating and directing properties:\n\n*   **Activating and ortho-, para-directing groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive towards electrophiles, and direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   **1) -CH₃ (Toluene):** Activating.\n    *   **5) -C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene):** Activating.\n\n*   **Deactivating and ortho-, para-directing groups:** Halogens are electron-withdrawing by induction (deactivating) but can donate electron density via resonance, directing incoming groups to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   **3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene):** Deactivating.\n\n*   **Deactivating and meta-directing groups:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive and directing the incoming bromine primarily to the meta position. For these substances, the yield of the para-isomer will be very low.\n    *   **2) -COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate):** Deactivating.\n    *   **4) -NO₂ (Nitrobenzene):** Strongly deactivating.\n    *   **6) -COOH (Benzoic acid):** Deactivating.\n\n### Isomer Distribution:\n\nNow, let's analyze the expected distribution of isomers for each group.\n\n**Meta-directing groups (4, 6, 2):**\nThese substituents direct the electrophile to the meta position. The formation of the para-isomer is highly disfavored.\n*   **4) Nitrobenzene (-NO₂):** This is a very strong deactivating group. In nitration, it gives about 93% meta, 6% ortho, and less than 1% para. Bromination is similar, yielding almost entirely the meta-isomer, with only trace amounts of the para-isomer.\n*   **6) Benzoic acid (-COOH):** This is a deactivating, meta-directing group. Bromination yields primarily m-bromobenzoic acid. The para-isomer is formed in very small amounts.\n*   **2) Ethyl benzoate (-COOC₂H₅):** Similar to benzoic acid, the ester group is deactivating and meta-directing. The yield of the para-isomer is expected to be very low.\n\nAmong these three, the -NO₂ group is the strongest deactivating group, leading to the lowest yield of the para-isomer. The -COOH and -COOC₂H₅ groups are also strongly deactivating. Generally, the order of deactivating strength is -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅. A stronger deactivating effect correlates with a lower yield of the minor (ortho, para) products. Thus, the order of increasing para-isomer yield among these three is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Ortho-, para-directing groups (1, 5, 3):**\nThese substituents direct the electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The ratio of para to ortho product is largely determined by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will favor the formation of the para-isomer to a greater extent.\n*   **1) Toluene (-CH₃):** The methyl group is relatively small. Bromination of toluene gives a mixture of ortho- and para-bromotoluene. The para-isomer is generally favored, but a significant amount of the ortho-isomer is also formed.\n*   **5) Ethylbenzene (-C₂H₅):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions leads to a higher proportion of the para-isomer compared to toluene.\n*   **3) Chlorobenzene (-Cl):** The chloro group is an ortho-, para-director. Due to its size and electronic properties, it gives a high yield of the para-isomer upon halogenation. For bromination, chlorobenzene yields a significant amount of p-bromochlorobenzene.\n\nComparing the ortho-, para-directors, the steric hindrance increases from -CH₃ to -C₂H₅, so the percentage of the para-isomer will be higher for ethylbenzene than for toluene. The -Cl group, while deactivating, strongly favors the para position over the ortho position due to a combination of electronic and steric effects. Typically, halogenation of chlorobenzene gives a very high para/ortho ratio. Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### Final Ordering:\n\nCombining the two groups, we have the meta-directors with very low para-isomer yields, followed by the ortho-, para-directors with much higher yields.\n\nThe final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2) < Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nTo arrange the given substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### Step 1: Classify the Substituents\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents based on their effect on the benzene ring's reactivity and their directing properties.\n\n*   **Group 1: Ortho-, Para-Directing Substituents**\n    *   These groups direct the incoming electrophile (bromine) to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) **-CH₃** (in Toluene): Activating group.\n    *   5) **-C₂H₅** (in Ethylbenzene): Activating group.\n    *   3) **-Cl** (in Chlorobenzene): Deactivating group, but still ortho-, para-directing.\n\n*   **Group 2: Meta-Directing Substituents**\n    *   These groups are all deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position.\n    *   4) **-NO₂** (in Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating.\n    *   6) **-COOH** (in Benzoic acid): Strongly deactivating.\n    *   2) **-COOC₂H₅** (in Ethyl benzoate): Strongly deactivating.\n\n### Step 2: Compare Para-Isomer Yield Between Groups\n\nSubstances with meta-directing groups will produce very low yields of the para-isomer, as the main product will be the meta-isomer. For example, the bromination of nitrobenzene and benzoic acid predominantly yields the meta-bromo derivative. In contrast, substances with ortho-, para-directing groups will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer. Therefore, the substances in Group 2 will have a lower weight fraction of the para-isomer than the substances in Group 1.\n\nThe overall order will be: **{Group 2} < {Group 1}**\n\n### Step 3: Order Substances within Group 2 (Meta-Directors)\n\nWe need to arrange nitrobenzene (4), benzoic acid (6), and ethyl benzoate (2) in order of increasing para-isomer yield. These groups are strongly deactivating, and the para-product is formed in very small amounts. The order depends on the strength of the deactivating and meta-directing effect. Stronger deactivation leads to a lower proportion of ortho and para products.\n\n*   **-NO₂ (4):** This is one of the most powerful deactivating groups. It directs very strongly to the meta position, resulting in a minuscule yield of the para-isomer (typically <1%).\n*   **-COOH (6):** This is also a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Its deactivating effect is comparable to, but generally considered slightly less powerful than, the nitro group. The para yield is extremely low.\n*   **-COOC₂H₅ (2):** This ester group is strongly deactivating and meta-directing, similar to the carboxylic acid group. Data from nitration reactions, which follow similar principles, show that ethyl benzoate yields a slightly higher percentage of the para-isomer (around 5%) compared to nitrobenzene or benzoic acid (around 1-2%).\n\nBased on the deactivating strength (-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅), the yield of the para-isomer will increase in the reverse order.\nOrder of increasing para yield: **4 (-NO₂) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC₂H₅)**\n\n### Step 4: Order Substances within Group 1 (Ortho-, Para-Directors)\n\nFor toluene (1), ethylbenzene (5), and chlorobenzene (3), the yield of the para-isomer relative to the ortho-isomer is primarily determined by **steric hindrance**. A larger substituent will block the adjacent ortho positions, making an attack at the more distant para position more favorable.\n\n*   **-CH₃ (1):** The methyl group is relatively small. It provides some steric hindrance, but a significant amount of ortho-product is still formed. For bromination of toluene, the para-isomer yield is high (around 67%), but the ortho-isomer yield is also significant (around 33%).\n*   **-C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased size causes more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer compared to toluene.\n*   **-Cl (3):** The chloro group, although a single atom, is sterically demanding. It strongly favors the formation of the para-isomer. For example, in the nitration of chlorobenzene, the para-isomer is the major product with a yield of about 70%. In the bromination of bromobenzene, the para-product can be as high as 85%. This indicates a very strong preference for the para position.\n\nComparing the steric bulk and resulting para-preference: -CH₃ < -C₂H₅ < -Cl.\nOrder of increasing para yield: **1 (-CH₃) < 5 (-C₂H₅) < 3 (-Cl)**\n\n### Step 5: Combine the Orders\n\nBy combining the ordered groups, we get the final sequence for the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe user has confirmed the previous step's output was correct by providing no errors. The model has successfully identified the correct order by applying chemical constraints. The final step is to provide the answer.\n\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n\n1.  **Constraint 1: Identify Directing Groups.** The first step is to classify the substituents as either ortho,para-directing or meta-directing.\n    *   **Ortho,para-directors (activating groups and halogens):** These will produce a high yield of the para-isomer.\n        *   1) -CH₃ (Toluene)\n        *   5) -C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n        *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n    *   **Meta-directors (deactivating groups):** These will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n        *   4) -NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n        *   2) -COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n        *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid)\n\n2.  **Constraint 2: Prune the Search Space.** Any correct ordering must place the substances with meta-directors before the substances with ortho,para-directors, as their para-isomer yield will be significantly lower.\n    *   Correct Order Form: `{4, 2, 6} < {1, 5, 3}`\n    *   This immediately eliminates option C, which starts with ortho,para-directors.\n\n3.  **Constraint 3: Order the Meta-Directors.** The yield of the para-isomer for meta-directing groups is inversely related to their deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, leading to an even smaller percentage of ortho and para products.\n    *   Deactivating strength: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-yield is: 4 (-NO₂) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC₂H₅).\n    *   The final sequence must begin with `4 < 6 < 2`. This eliminates option D.\n\n4.  **Constraint 4: Order the Ortho,Para-Directors.** The ratio of para to ortho product depends on steric hindrance and electronic factors.\n    *   **Steric Hindrance:** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased bulk hinders attack at the ortho positions more, leading to a higher relative yield of the para-isomer for ethylbenzene (5) compared to toluene (1). So, `1 < 5`.\n    *   **Halogen Selectivity:** Halogens like chlorine (-Cl) are known to give very high para-selectivity in electrophilic substitution, especially with a bulky electrophile like bromine. The para-isomer is strongly favored.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-yield is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\n5.  **Final Assembly:** Combining the ordered groups gives the final sequence: `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a self-debate to determine the correct order of substances.\n\n**Proposer's Initial Argument:**\nThe question asks to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing yield of the para-bromo isomer upon electrophilic substitution. The key factors are the directing effects of the substituents (ortho/para vs. meta) and steric hindrance.\n\n1.  **Categorize Substituents:**\n    *   **Ortho/para directors:** These will produce a significant amount of the para isomer. They are `-CH3` (1), `-C2H5` (5), and `-Cl` (3).\n    *   **Meta directors:** These will produce very little of the para isomer. They are `-NO2` (4), `-COOC2H5` (2), and `-COOH` (6).\n\n2.  **Order the Meta Directors:**\n    These groups are all deactivating. The stronger the deactivating effect, the more strongly it directs to the meta position, and therefore the lower the yield of the para isomer. The order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n    Therefore, the order of increasing para yield for this group is: `4 < 6 < 2`.\n\n3.  **Order the Ortho/Para Directors:**\n    For these groups, the ratio of para to ortho product determines the final yield. This is largely influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n    *   The `-C2H5` group (5) is bulkier than the `-CH3` group (1). This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions will favor the formation of the para isomer more in ethylbenzene than in toluene. So, `1 < 5`.\n    *   The `-Cl` group (3) is an ortho/para director, but its strong inductive effect deactivates the ortho position more than the para position, leading to a very high preference for the para isomer.\n\n4.  **Proposed Solution Path:**\n    Combining these, the meta-directors will have the lowest para yields, followed by the ortho/para directors. The proposed full order is `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`. This corresponds to option B. To confirm the relative para yields of the ortho/para directors, a search is warranted.\n\n**Skeptic's Cross-Examination:**\nThe logic is sound, but it relies on textbook knowledge of directing effects and steric hindrance. The relative ordering of the ortho/para directors, specifically placing chlorobenzene (3) as having the highest para yield, is a critical point that should be verified with data. While the inductive effect argument is correct, its magnitude compared to the steric effects of alkyl groups might not be immediately obvious. Furthermore, the assumption about the deactivating strength order of `-COOH` vs. `-COOC2H5` is standard but worth a quick confirmation. A single search action can verify the product distributions for the key ortho/para directing groups.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe next action will be to perform a search to find the typical percentage yields of the para isomer for the bromination of toluene, ethylbenzene, and chlorobenzene to confirm the proposed order `1 < 5 < 3`.\n\n**Proposer's Final Argument:**\nThe initial hypothesis is strongly supported by the search results. The core logic remains the same, but now it is backed by specific data.\n\n1.  **Meta Directors (Substances 4, 2, 6):** These are `-NO2`, `-COOC2H5`, and `-COOH`. They are all deactivating and meta-directing, meaning they will produce the lowest yields of the para-isomer. The stronger the deactivating effect, the lower the para yield. The established order of deactivating strength is `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`. Therefore, the order of increasing para yield is nitrobenzene (4) < benzoic acid (6) < ethyl benzoate (2).\n\n2.  **Ortho/Para Directors (Substances 1, 3, 5):** These are `-CH3`, `-Cl`, and `-C2H5`. They will produce much higher yields of the para-isomer. The search results provide the data needed to order them:\n    *   **Toluene (1, -CH3):** Bromination yields about 66.8% of the para-isomer, although some sources cite lower figures for other halogenations (e.g., 39% para for chlorination). Let's consider the bromination-specific data.\n    *   **Ethylbenzene (5, -C2H5):** The bulkier ethyl group increases steric hindrance at the ortho positions compared to the methyl group, thus increasing the proportion of the para product relative to toluene. The para isomer is the major product.\n    *   **Chlorobenzene (3, -Cl):** Halogenation of chlorobenzene strongly favors the para position. For example, nitration gives 70% para product. For bromination of bromobenzene, the para product can be as high as 85%. This high para selectivity is due to the strong deactivating inductive effect of the halogen at the ortho position, which disfavors attack there more than at the para position.\n\n3.  **Refined Ordering of Ortho/Para Directors:** Based on the data, chlorobenzene (3) gives the highest percentage of para-isomer. Between the two alkylbenzenes, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para yield than toluene (1) due to greater steric hindrance. However, a direct comparison of bromination data shows toluene at 66.8% para and chlorination of chlorobenzene at 70% para. Bromination of bromobenzene is even higher at 85%. This confirms that the halogen (-Cl) is more para-directing than the alkyl groups. The order of increasing para yield is Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:** Combining the two groups, the complete order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n    `4 (-NO2) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC2H5) < 1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl)`.\n\nThis sequence matches option B.\n\n**Skeptic's Final Assessment:**\nThe proposer's initial reasoning was sound, and the search results have confirmed the critical details, especially the surprisingly high para-directing nature of halogens compared to alkyl groups in this context. The final derived order is well-supported by the principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution and by specific reaction data.
