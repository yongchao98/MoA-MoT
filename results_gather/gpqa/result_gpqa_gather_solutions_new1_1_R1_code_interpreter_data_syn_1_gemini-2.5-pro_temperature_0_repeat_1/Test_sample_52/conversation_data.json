  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nYou have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.\n\nA) C12H14O2\nB) C11H12O2\nC) C11H14O2\nD) C12H12O2\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nThe Python script successfully identified the chemical formula by systematically analyzing the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n*   **Hypotheses:** The initial candidates were the four chemical formulas provided: C11H12O2, C12H14O2, C11H14O2, and C12H12O2.\n*   **Constraint Analysis:** The script interpreted the spectroscopic data to identify key structural fragments: a di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4), an ester group (-COO-), a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3), and a methyl group part of the ester (-OCH3). The absence of -CH2- signals was a crucial constraint.\n*   **Structure Deduction:** Assembling these fragments led to the structure of methyl propenylbenzoate (CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-COOCH3).\n*   **Filtering:** The chemical formula for the deduced structure was calculated as C11H12O2. This formula was used to filter the initial hypotheses, leaving only C11H12O2 as the valid option.\n*   **Conclusion:** The script correctly identified C11H12O2 as the only formula consistent with all the given data.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe analysis of the provided spectroscopic data leads to the identification of the unknown compound's chemical formula.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** The core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two substituents, which has a base formula of C6H4. The 1H NMR data, showing two signals in the aromatic region, is characteristic of a para-disubstituted (1,4-substituted) benzene ring with two different substituents.\n\n2.  **FTIR Spectrum:** The presence of an ester group (-COO-) is confirmed.\n\n3.  **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** This corresponds to the four protons on the para-substituted benzene ring, which are split into two distinct signals (typically two doublets).\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals):** The description of one doublet and one doublet of quartets is a classic pattern for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). The two vinyl protons are coupled to each other. One of them is further split by the adjacent methyl group, resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n    *   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):** One methyl signal arises from the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). The other methyl signal, combined with the ester information from FTIR and the constraint of having no -CH2 groups, points to a methyl ester (-COOCH3).\n    *   **No -CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information that eliminates other possible structures, such as those containing an ethyl ester or an allyl group.\n\n### Assembling the Structure\n\nBased on the fragments identified from the spectral data, the molecule consists of:\n*   A para-substituted benzene ring (C6H4)\n*   A methyl ester group (-COOCH3)\n*   A propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)\n\n### Determining the Chemical Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from each fragment, we can determine the overall chemical formula:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from the ring) + 1 (from the C=O) + 1 (from the -OCH3) + 3 (from the propenyl group) = 11\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from the ring) + 3 (from the -OCH3) + 5 (from the propenyl group) = 12\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group)\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**. This corresponds to a structure such as methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n\nComparing this calculated formula with the given options:\nA) C12H14O2\nB) C11H12O2\nC) C11H14O2\nD) C12H12O2\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThe detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic data allows for a definitive identification of the unknown compound's chemical formula.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring (C₆) with two substituents, which means there are four hydrogens directly attached to the ring (C₆H₄). The 1H NMR spectrum confirms this with two signals corresponding to these aromatic hydrogens.\n\n2.  **FTIR Spectrum:** The presence of an ester group (-COO-) is confirmed. This functional group contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n3.  **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** Corresponds to the four protons on the di-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals):** The presence of two vinyl hydrogen signals, one a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets, is a classic pattern for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). The doublet arises from the vinyl proton adjacent to the ring, split by the other vinyl proton. The doublet of quartets arises from the second vinyl proton, which is split into a doublet by the first vinyl proton and into a quartet by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group.\n    *   **-CH₃ groups (2 signals):** One methyl signal corresponds to the propenyl group (-CH=CH-**CH₃**). The second methyl signal must belong to the ester group. To avoid having any -CH₂- groups (which are explicitly stated as absent), this must be either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetoxy group (-OCOCH₃).\n    *   **No -CH₂ groups:** This is a crucial piece of information that rules out other possibilities like an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n### Structure Determination and Formula Calculation\n\nBased on the fragments identified from the spectra, we can construct the molecule. The two substituents on the C₆H₄ ring are a propenyl group and an ester-containing group.\n\n*   **Fragment 1:** C₆H₄ (di-substituted benzene ring)\n*   **Fragment 2:** -CH=CH-CH₃ (propenyl group)\n*   **Fragment 3:** An ester group with a methyl group and no methylene groups. This can be either a methyl ester group (-COOCH₃) or an acetoxy group (-OCOCH₃).\n\nLet's calculate the molecular formula for a structure composed of these fragments:\n\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from the ring) + 3 (from the propenyl group) + 2 (from an acetoxy group, -OCOCH₃) OR 6 (from the ring) + 3 (from the propenyl group) + 1 (from a carbonyl, -**C**O) + 1 (from a methyl ester, -O**C**H₃). Both possibilities sum to **11 carbons**.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from the ring) + 5 (from the propenyl group, H+H+H₃) + 3 (from the methyl/acetoxy group). This sums to **12 hydrogens**.\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group).\n\nCombining these atoms gives the molecular formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\nThis formula is consistent with all the provided spectral data. Comparing this to the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nTo determine the correct chemical formula, we must systematically analyze the structural fragments indicated by the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This implies a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by other groups. The core of this structure is therefore a C6H4 fragment. The ¹H NMR spectrum confirms this with signals for aromatic protons.\n2.  **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum shows the presence of an ester functional group, which has the chemical structure -COO-. This adds two oxygen atoms to the molecule.\n3.  **Vinyl-H and -CH3 Groups (¹H NMR):**\n    *   There are two signals for vinyl protons (-CH=CH-). The splitting pattern described as \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\" is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). In this group, one vinyl proton is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet), and the second vinyl proton is split by both the first vinyl proton and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (creating a doublet of quartets). This fragment has a formula of C3H5.\n    *   The spectrum shows two distinct signals for methyl (-CH3) groups. One of these belongs to the propenyl group identified above. The second methyl group must be part of the ester. Given that an ester has the structure R-COO-R', and the main body of the molecule is the substituted aromatic ring, the most logical structure for the ester is a methyl ester (-COOCH3).\n4.  **No -CH2 Groups:** The explicit absence of signals for methylene (-CH2-) groups is a crucial constraint that helps eliminate other possible structures.\n\n### Assembling the Molecular Structure\n\nBased on the analysis, the unknown compound is composed of the following fragments:\n*   A di-substituted benzene ring: **C6H4**\n*   A propenyl group substituent: **-CH=CH-CH3** (Formula: C3H5)\n*   A methyl ester substituent: **-COOCH3** (Formula: COOCH3)\n\nCombining these fragments gives a structure such as methyl propenylbenzoate (the exact substitution pattern—ortho, meta, or para—does not affect the overall formula).\n\n### Calculating the Chemical Formula\n\nNow, we can sum the atoms from each fragment to determine the total chemical formula:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 1 (from -COOCH3) = 11 carbons\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from -COOCH3) = 12 hydrogens\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from -COOCH3) = 2 oxygens\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n### Verification\n\nThis formula corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of 6 (calculated as C + 1 - H/2). This matches the structure perfectly: 4 for the benzene ring (one ring and three double bonds), 1 for the vinyl C=C double bond, and 1 for the carbonyl C=O double bond. The proposed structure is fully consistent with all the provided spectral information. Other formulas, such as C12H14O2, would require adding a -CH2- group (for example, in an ethyl ester), which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula for the unknown compound is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the information from the problem statement.**\n\n1.  **Molecular Framework:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogens replaced by substituents. The core formula for this part is C6H4. The degree of unsaturation for the ring itself is 4 (one ring and three double bonds).\n2.  **Functional Group (FTIR):** The FTIR spectrum indicates an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for one carbon and two oxygen atoms (C, O2) and adds one degree of unsaturation due to the C=O double bond.\n3.  **Proton NMR (1H NMR) Data:**\n    *   **Six total signals:** This means there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring has four protons (C6H4). Having only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely para (1,4-substitution). In a para-substituted ring with two different substituents, the four protons form two chemically distinct sets (an AA'BB' system), which often appears as two signals (two doublets).\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals:** This indicates the presence of a C=C double bond with a proton on each carbon. Let's call them Ha and Hb.\n        *   One signal is a **doublet (d)**. This means the corresponding proton (e.g., Ha) is coupled to only one other proton (Hb).\n        *   The other signal is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. This means the corresponding proton (e.g., Hb) is coupled to two different groups of protons: one single proton (giving the doublet, which must be Ha) and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet, which must be a -CH3 group).\n        *   This splitting pattern is characteristic of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. The proton on the carbon next to the methyl group would be the doublet of quartets, and the other vinyl proton would be the doublet.\n    *   **Two -CH3 signals:** This means there are two distinct methyl groups in the molecule.\n        *   One -CH3 group is already identified as part of the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n        *   The second -CH3 group must be located elsewhere. Given the presence of an ester group, a methyl ester (-COOCH3) is a very common and plausible structure. A methyl group in this position would be a singlet, as it's not adjacent to any protons.\n    *   **No -CH2 signals:** This is a critical piece of information. It rules out structures containing ethyl (-CH2CH3), propyl (-CH2CH2CH3), or other alkyl chains with methylene groups.\n\n**Step 2: Assemble the structural fragments.**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we have the following pieces:\n*   A para-substituted benzene ring: -C6H4-\n*   A propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3\n*   A methyl ester group: -COOCH3\n\nLet's combine these to form the complete molecule. The two substituents on the benzene ring are the propenyl group and the methyl ester group.\n\nThe proposed structure is: **methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**.\n\n**Structure:**\n```\n      CH3\n       |\n      (O=)C-O\n       |\n      / \\\n     |   |\n    // \\\\ //\n   |     |\n    \\\\ // \\\\\n     |   |\n      \\ /\n       |\n      CH=CH-CH3\n```\n\nLet's verify this structure against the data:\n*   **Di-substituted aromatic ring:** Yes.\n*   **Ester group:** Yes (-COOCH3).\n*   **Aromatic-H:** Yes, 4 protons in a para arrangement, giving 2 signals.\n*   **Vinyl-H:** Yes, the -CH=CH- part gives 2 signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets).\n*   **-CH3 groups:** Yes, two of them. One in the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) and one in the methyl ester (-COOCH3). They are in different chemical environments, so they will give two separate signals.\n*   **No -CH2 groups:** Yes, the structure contains no -CH2- groups.\n\nThe proposed structure is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the chemical formula from the proposed structure.**\n\nNow, we count the atoms in the structure CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-COOCH3.\n*   **Carbon (C):** 1 (from propenyl CH3) + 2 (from -CH=CH-) + 6 (from benzene ring) + 1 (from -COO-) + 1 (from ester CH3) = **11 Carbons**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 3 (from propenyl CH3) + 2 (from -CH=CH-) + 4 (from benzene ring) + 3 (from ester CH3) = **12 Hydrogens**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester -COO-) = **2 Oxygens**\n\nThe chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**Step 4: Match the calculated formula with the given options.**\n\nThe calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option C.\n\n*   A) C11H14O2\n*   B) C12H12O2\n*   C) C11H12O2\n*   D) C12H14O2\n\nThe correct formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic information allows for the identification of the unknown compound's chemical formula.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two attached groups.\n2.  **FTIR - Ester group:** The presence of an ester group (-COO-) is confirmed, which contains two oxygen atoms.\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** This suggests a para-substituted benzene ring, which would have two sets of chemically equivalent protons.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the other vinyl proton and the methyl group is split into a doublet of quartets, while the other vinyl proton is split into a doublet.\n    *   **Two –CH₃ signals:** The molecule contains two distinct methyl groups. One is part of the propenyl group, and the other is consistent with a methyl ester (-COOCH₃).\n    *   **No –CH₂ signals:** The absence of any methylene (-CH₂-) groups is a crucial constraint for the final structure.\n\n### Assembling the Structure:\n\nBased on the fragments identified from the spectroscopic data, the molecule consists of:\n*   A di-substituted benzene ring (C₆H₄)\n*   A methyl ester group (-COOCH₃)\n*   A propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)\n\nA plausible structure is methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate. This structure is consistent with all the provided NMR data: a para-substituted ring, a propenyl group, two different methyl groups, and no methylene groups.\n\n### Determining the Chemical Formula:\n\nTo find the chemical formula, we sum the atoms from each part of the proposed structure:\n*   **Benzene ring:** C₆H₄\n*   **Propenyl group:** C₃H₅\n*   **Methyl ester group:** C₂H₃O₂\n\n**Total Calculation:**\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This corresponds to a molecule with a degree of unsaturation of 6 (one ring, four double bonds), which matches the proposed structure (1 ring + 3 aromatic C=C + 1 vinyl C=C + 1 C=O).\n\n### Evaluating Other Options:\n\n*   **C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** This formula would have a degree of unsaturation of 5. It would require removing a double bond, likely resulting in a propyl group instead of a propenyl group, which would introduce -CH₂- signals, contradicting the data.\n*   **C₁₂H₁₂O₂:** This formula has a degree of unsaturation of 7. Constructing a molecule with this formula that fits all the NMR constraints (especially the absence of -CH₂- groups and the specific vinyl and methyl signals) is not feasible.\n*   **C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** This formula has a degree of unsaturation of 6. A possible structure would be ethyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate. However, the ethyl group contains a -CH₂- group, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical formula that perfectly matches the detailed spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe user has provided the output from the code execution. I will now complete the reasoning process and provide the final answer.\n\n### Analysis of Code Output and Further Reasoning\n\nThe Python code calculated the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for each of the possible chemical formulas. The DBE represents the number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n\n1.  **DBE from Structural Fragments:**\n    *   A 6-membered aromatic ring has 1 ring and 3 double bonds, contributing 4 to the DBE.\n    *   An ester group has a C=O double bond, contributing 1 to the DBE.\n    *   The presence of vinyl-H signals indicates a C=C double bond, contributing 1 to the DBE.\n    *   **Total required DBE = 4 (ring) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = 6.**\n\n2.  **DBE from Provided Formulas (Code Output):**\n    *   A) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DBE = 5 (Incorrect)\n    *   B) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DBE = 6 (Possible)\n    *   C) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DBE = 6 (Possible)\n    *   D) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DBE = 7 (Incorrect)\n\nThe DBE calculation narrows down the possibilities to **B (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) and C (C₁₂H₁₄O₂)**.\n\n### Distinguishing Between B and C using NMR Data\n\nNow, we must use the specific fragment information from the ¹H NMR spectrum to determine the exact number of carbons and hydrogens.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄ (6 carbons, 4 hydrogens)\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The \"doublet\" and \"doublet of quartets\" pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group, **-CH=CH-CH₃**. This fragment contains 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens (1+1+3).\n*   **Methyl Groups:** There are two -CH₃ signals. One belongs to the propenyl group. The other must be part of the ester. Since there are **no -CH₂ signals**, the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃). It must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OOCCH₃). In either case, this second methyl group adds 1 carbon and 3 hydrogens.\n*   **Ester Carbonyl:** The C=O part of the ester adds 1 carbon.\n\nLet's sum the atoms from these identified fragments:\n*   **Carbons:** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from propenyl) + 1 (from the second CH₃) + 1 (from the ester C=O) = **11 Carbons**\n*   **Hydrogens:** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from the second CH₃) = **12 Hydrogens**\n*   **Oxygens:** 2 (from the ester group) = **2 Oxygens**\n\nThe molecular formula assembled from all the spectroscopic evidence is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This matches option B.\n\nTo confirm, let's consider why option C (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) is incorrect. The difference between our derived formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) and option C (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) is one carbon and two hydrogens (a CH₂ group). The problem statement explicitly says, \"**There are no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**.\" Therefore, option C is inconsistent with the provided data.\n\nThe only formula that fits all the evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on the detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data, we can deduce the structure and subsequently the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Aromatic Ring and Ester:** The compound is a di-substituted benzene ring (`-C6H4-`) and contains an ester group (`-COO-`). The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, 4 hydrogens, and a degree of unsaturation (DoU) of 4. The ester's C=O bond adds another degree of unsaturation.\n\n2.  **NMR Signal Analysis:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** This strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern on the benzene ring, which has a plane of symmetry, resulting in two sets of chemically equivalent aromatic protons. This accounts for 4 hydrogens.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals, d & dq):** This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The `CH` adjacent to the ring is split by the other vinyl proton into a doublet (d). The other vinyl `CH` is split by the first vinyl proton (doublet) and the methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq). This group adds 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens (`-C3H5`) and one C=C double bond (1 DoU).\n    *   **-CH3 Groups (2 signals):** One methyl group is from the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The other methyl group must be part of the ester.\n    *   **No -CH2 Groups:** This is a critical constraint. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (`-COOCH2CH3`) or have any other alkyl chain with a -CH2- unit. Therefore, the second methyl group must be either from a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate group (`-O-CO-CH3`).\n\n3.  **Assembling the Structure and Formula:**\n    Let's assemble the pieces: a para-substituted benzene ring (`-C6H4-`), a propenyl group (`-C3H5`), an ester group (`-COO-`), and a methyl group (`-CH3`).\n\n    *   **Carbons:** 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (ester CH3) = **11 Carbons**\n    *   **Hydrogens:** 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (ester CH3) = **12 Hydrogens**\n    *   **Oxygens:** 2 (ester) = **2 Oxygens**\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The structure contains one benzene ring (4 DoU), one C=C double bond (1 DoU), and one C=O double bond (1 DoU). The total DoU is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    *   Let's check the DoU for the formula C11H12O2: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   This matches perfectly. The other options either have the wrong DoU (A and D) or imply the presence of a -CH2- group (C), which is contradicted by the NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Deduce the structural fragments of the unknown compound from the provided FTIR and 1H NMR data.\n    2.  Assemble these fragments into a complete, plausible chemical structure that satisfies all the given constraints (di-substituted aromatic, ester, specific NMR signals, no –CH2– groups).\n    3.  Calculate the molecular formula of the deduced structure and match it with the given options.\n\n*   **Action (Execution of Plan):**\n\n    1.  **Analyze the Spectroscopic Data:**\n        *   **FTIR:** An ester group (–COO–) is present. This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in all the formula options.\n        *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This implies a C6H4 core. The presence of only two aromatic-H signals strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern. This fragment is C6H4.\n        *   **Vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3). The proton coupled to both another vinyl proton and a methyl group gives the doublet of quartets. This fragment is C3H5.\n        *   **Two –CH3 signals:** One methyl signal comes from the propenyl group (–CH=CH–**CH3**). The second methyl signal must belong to the ester group.\n        *   **No –CH2– signals:** This is a critical constraint. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (–COOCH2CH3) or a propanoate (–CH2COO–), for example.\n\n    2.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n        *   We have a para-substituted benzene ring (C6H4).\n        *   One substituent is the propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3).\n        *   The other substituent must be an ester containing a methyl group, with no methylene (–CH2–) groups. This leaves two possibilities for this substituent:\n            *   An acetate group: –O–CO–CH3\n            *   A methoxycarbonyl group (methyl ester): –COO–CH3\n\n    3.  **Determine the Molecular Formula:**\n        *   **Possibility 1:** The molecule is 4-propenylphenyl acetate.\n            *   Fragments: C6H4 (ring) + C3H5 (propenyl) + C2H3O2 (acetate group)\n            *   Total Carbons: 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n            *   Total Hydrogens: 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n            *   Total Oxygens: 2\n            *   Formula: **C11H12O2**\n\n        *   **Possibility 2:** The molecule is methyl 4-propenylbenzoate.\n            *   Fragments: C6H4 (ring) + C3H5 (propenyl) + C2H3O2 (methoxycarbonyl group)\n            *   Total Carbons: 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n            *   Total Hydrogens: 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n            *   Total Oxygens: 2\n            *   Formula: **C11H12O2**\n\n    Both plausible structures that fit all the spectroscopic data have the same molecular formula: C11H12O2. This formula corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** An absorption peak for an ester group (-COO-) is present. This functional group contains one carbon and two oxygen atoms.\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The base structure is a benzene ring with two substituents, which corresponds to a C₆H₄ fragment.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** The presence of two signals for the four aromatic protons suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern on the benzene ring, which results in a symmetrical structure.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals):** There are two hydrogens on a carbon-carbon double bond. The splitting patterns are key:\n        *   A **doublet of quartets (dq)** indicates a hydrogen that is split by one adjacent hydrogen (doublet) and by a group of three hydrogens, like a methyl group (quartet).\n        *   A **doublet (d)** indicates a hydrogen that is split by only one adjacent hydrogen.\n        *   This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). The hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group appears as a doublet of quartets, and the other vinyl hydrogen appears as a doublet.\n    *   **-CH₃ Groups (2 signals):** There are two distinct methyl groups. One belongs to the propenyl group identified above. The other must be part of the ester group (e.g., a methyl ester or an acetate).\n    *   **No -CH₂ Groups:** The absence of any methylene (-CH₂) signals is a crucial constraint for the final structure.\n\n### 2. Assemble the Molecular Fragments\n\nBased on the analysis, we can identify the following pieces of the molecule:\n\n1.  **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄\n2.  **Substituent 1 (from vinyl and one CH₃ signal):** A propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH₃. This fragment has the formula C₃H₅.\n3.  **Substituent 2 (from FTIR and the second CH₃ signal):** An ester group containing a methyl group. To avoid having a -CH₂- group, this must be either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate group (-OCOCH₃). Both of these fragments have the formula C₂H₃O₂.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Chemical Formula\n\nNow, we add up the atoms from all the identified fragments to determine the molecular formula:\n\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **11 carbons**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **12 hydrogens**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **2 oxygens**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ matches the spectral data perfectly. It accounts for the di-substituted aromatic ring, the ester group, the propenyl group with its specific NMR splitting pattern, two distinct methyl groups, and the absence of any methylene groups. Comparing this to the given options, it corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\nBased on the provided spectroscopic information, the chemical formula of the unknown compound can be determined by systematically analyzing each piece of data.\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum**: The presence of absorption peaks for an ester group indicates the molecule contains a -COO- functional group, which accounts for two oxygen atoms. All the proposed formulas (C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2) are consistent with this, as they each contain two oxygen atoms.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum**: The proton NMR spectrum provides the most detailed information for identifying the molecular structure's components and, subsequently, its formula.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons**: Two signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.0 ppm) correspond to the protons on a di-substituted benzene ring. A benzene ring with two substituents has the formula C₆H₄, meaning there are 4 aromatic hydrogens.\n    *   **Vinyl Protons**: Two signals for vinyl protons indicate the presence of a -CH=CH- group. The splitting patterns are key: one signal is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. A doublet of quartets for a vinyl proton strongly suggests it is coupled to another vinyl proton (giving the doublet) and to a methyl (-CH₃) group (giving the quartet). This points to a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃) as a fragment. This fragment contains 2 vinyl hydrogens.\n    *   **Methyl Protons**: The spectrum shows two distinct signals for methyl (-CH₃) groups. One of these is part of the propenyl group identified above. The other must be located elsewhere in the molecule. In total, these two methyl groups account for 2 x 3 = 6 hydrogens.\n    *   **Absence of -CH₂ Groups**: The lack of any signals corresponding to methylene (-CH₂) groups is a crucial constraint on the possible structure.\n\n### Assembling the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, the molecular formula can be calculated.\n\n*   **Hydrogen Count**:\n    *   From the di-substituted aromatic ring (C₆H₄): 4 hydrogens\n    *   From the vinyl group (-CH=CH-): 2 hydrogens\n    *   From the two methyl groups (2 x -CH₃): 6 hydrogens\n    *   **Total Hydrogens = 4 + 2 + 6 = 12 hydrogens.**\n    This hydrogen count immediately eliminates options B (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) and C (C₁₁H₁₄O₂).\n\n*   **Carbon Count**:\n    *   From the benzene ring: 6 carbons\n    *   From the ester carbonyl group (-**C**OO-): 1 carbon\n    *   From the vinyl group (-**C**H=**C**H-): 2 carbons\n    *   From the two methyl groups (2 x -**C**H₃): 2 carbons\n    *   **Total Carbons = 6 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 11 carbons.**\n    This carbon count eliminates option D (C₁₂H₁₂O₂).\n\n*   **Oxygen Count**:\n    *   From the ester group (-C**O****O**-): 2 oxygens\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the counts for each element gives a final molecular formula of **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This formula is consistent with a structure such as methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate, which would exhibit all the described spectroscopic features: a di-substituted aromatic ring, an ester, a propenyl group giving rise to a doublet and a doublet of quartets for the vinyl protons, two distinct methyl signals, and no methylene groups.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula for the unknown compound is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe user wants me to identify the correct chemical formula for an unknown compound based on its spectral data.\n\n### Analysis of the Provided Information:\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This implies a C6H4 core.\n2.  **FTIR shows an ester group:** This indicates the presence of a -COO- functional group, which contains two oxygen atoms.\n3.  **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 protons. The presence of only two signals suggests a para (1,4) or ortho (1,2) substitution pattern with electronically similar substituents or symmetry.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This strongly suggests a `-CH=CH-CH3` (propenyl) group. The H on the carbon adjacent to the ring would be a doublet (split by the other vinyl H). The other vinyl H would be a doublet of quartets (split by the first vinyl H and the three protons of the methyl group).\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** This indicates two distinct methyl groups.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** Confirms the absence of any methylene (-CH2-) bridges.\n\n### Assembling the Structure:\n\nBased on the fragments identified from the spectral data, we can propose a plausible structure.\n*   **Core:** A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4).\n*   **Functional Groups/Substituents:**\n    *   An ester group (-COO-).\n    *   A propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n    *   A methyl group (-CH3).\n\nLet's combine these pieces. The ester group must be one of the substituents on the ring, and it incorporates one of the methyl groups. The other substituent is the propenyl group.\n\n**Plausible Structure:** Methyl propenylbenzoate. For example, methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n\n*   The aromatic ring is substituted with a `-COOCH3` group and a `-CH=CH-CH3` group.\n*   This structure fits all the NMR data:\n    *   Two aromatic signals (from the para-substituted ring).\n    *   Two vinyl signals with the described splitting pattern.\n    *   Two methyl signals (one from the ester, one from the propenyl group).\n    *   No -CH2- groups.\n\n### Calculating the Chemical Formula:\n\nNow, let's determine the chemical formula for this proposed structure.\n*   **Benzene ring part:** C6H4\n*   **Ester group part:** -COOCH3 -> adds C2, H3, O2\n*   **Propenyl group part:** -CH=CH-CH3 -> adds C3, H5\n*   **Total Carbon atoms:** 6 (from ring) + 1 (from C=O) + 1 (from O-CH3) + 3 (from propenyl) = 11 carbons.\n*   **Total Hydrogen atoms:** 4 (from ring) + 3 (from O-CH3) + 5 (from propenyl) = 12 hydrogens.\n*   **Total Oxygen atoms:** 2 (from ester).\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n### Verifying with Degree of Unsaturation:\n\nThe degree of unsaturation for C11H12O2 is calculated as:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n*   Benzene ring = 4 units of unsaturation.\n*   C=O bond in ester = 1 unit of unsaturation.\n*   C=C bond in vinyl group = 1 unit of unsaturation.\n*   Total = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\nThe calculated degree of unsaturation matches the proposed structure.\n\n### Comparing with the Options:\n\n*   A) C11H14O2 (DoU = 5) - Incorrect DoU.\n*   B) C12H12O2 (DoU = 7) - Incorrect DoU.\n*   C) C11H12O2 (DoU = 6) - Matches the analysis.\n*   D) C12H14O2 (DoU = 6) - While the DoU is correct, this formula does not match the fragments identified from the NMR data. Building a C12H14O2 molecule consistent with the NMR data (especially the absence of -CH2- groups) is not feasible.\n\nThe analysis of the provided FTIR and 1H NMR data strongly and consistently points to a molecular formula of C11H12O2.

The proton on the carbon adjacent to the ring is split by the other vinyl proton (doublet), and the other vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n    *   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):** One of these is the methyl group from the propenyl (-CH=CH-CH3). The other must be part of the ester functionality, as there are no other places for it.\n    *   **No -CH2 groups:** This is a critical constraint. For the ester group not to have a -CH2- group, it must be either a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate group (-OCOCH3). An ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3), for example, is ruled out.\n\n3.  **Assembling the Structure and Formula:**\n    *   We have a benzene ring fragment: C6H4.\n    *   We have a propenyl group substituent: -C3H5.\n    *   We have an ester-related substituent that also contains a methyl group. This can be either:\n        *   A methyl ester group: -COOCH3, which has the formula -C2H3O2.\n        *   An acetate group: -OCOCH3, which also has the formula -C2H3O2.\n    *   Combining these fragments gives the total molecular formula:\n        *   Carbons: 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 2 (ester part) = 11 carbons.\n        *   Hydrogens: 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (methyl of ester) = 12 hydrogens.\n        *   Oxygens: 2 (ester).\n    *   The resulting formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Proposed Action:** The logical deduction seems complete. To be certain, I will perform a search to confirm that the proposed structures (like methyl p-propenylbenzoate or p-propenylphenyl acetate) are consistent with the given data and that no other possibilities for the other formulas exist.\n\n**Skeptic's Cross-Examination:**\n\nThe initial deduction to C11H12O2 is strong. The search results provide spectra for related compounds. Let's analyze them to see if they support or contradict the conclusion.\n*   The search did not yield spectra for the exact proposed structures (methyl propenylbenzoate or propenylphenyl acetate).\n*   However, it provided spectra for similar molecules. For example, 3-phenylpropyl acetate (C11H14O2) shows the presence of -CH2- groups in its NMR spectrum, confirming that adding hydrogens to C11H12O2 would introduce these signals, which contradicts the problem statement.\n*   Spectra for methyl benzoate (C8H8O2) and other simple esters are available, but don't directly help confirm the vinyl group signals.\n*   The search on C12H14O2 and C12H12O2 did not reveal any common structures that would fit all the NMR constraints (di-substituted, propenyl group, ester, no -CH2-). For instance, many isomers of C12H14O2 contain -CH2- groups.\n\nThe core of the argument remains the logical deduction from the spectral data:\n*   **Aromatic Ring (C6H4) + Propenyl Group (C3H5) + Ester with a Methyl Group (C2H3O2) = C11H12O2.**\n*   **C11H14O2:** This formula has two more hydrogens. To add two hydrogens to C11H12O2, one would typically saturate the propenyl's double bond, creating a propyl group (-CH2CH2CH3). This introduces -CH2- signals, which are explicitly absent. Thus, C11H14O2 is incorrect.\n*   **C12H14O2:** This formula has an extra CH2 group compared to C11H12O2. This is directly ruled out by the \"no -CH2- signals\" constraint.\n*   **C12H12O2:** This formula has an extra C and the same number of hydrogens as C11H12O2. It is impossible to add a carbon atom without either adding hydrogens (which would change the formula), creating a forbidden -CH2- group (e.g., by making an ethyl ester, -COOCH2CH3), or violating another rule (e.g., adding a methyl to the ring would make it tri-substituted; adding a vinyl group to the ester, -COOCH=CH2, would create four vinyl signals instead of two).\n\nThe initial deduction is robust and withstands scrutiny. The constraints provided are very specific and point to a single molecular formula.\n\n**Convergence and Final Decision:**\n\nThe proposer's initial analysis is correct. The combination of a di-substituted benzene ring, an ester group, a propenyl group, a second methyl group, and the absence of any methylene groups can only be satisfied by the molecular formula C11H12O2. The other options are systematically ruled out by the given constraints.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "To determine the correct chemical formula, we will systematically analyze the provided spectroscopic data by breaking it down into structural fragments and then assembling them to find the total number of atoms.\n\n**1. Analysis of Structural Fragments from Spectroscopic Data:**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by substituents. The core fragment is therefore **C₆H₄**. This accounts for 6 carbon atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms. The two aromatic-H signals in the ¹H NMR are consistent with this.\n\n*   **Ester group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the **two oxygen atoms** present in all the candidate formulas.\n\n*   **Vinyl and Methyl groups (from ¹H NMR):**\n    *   The spectrum shows two signals for vinyl hydrogens (-CH=CH-) with a specific splitting pattern: one doublet (d) and one doublet of quartets (dq). This is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. In this group, one vinyl proton is split by the other (doublet), and the second vinyl proton is split by both the first vinyl proton (doublet) and the adjacent methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. This fragment's formula is **C₃H₅**. It accounts for 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens.\n    *   The spectrum shows two distinct signals for methyl (-CH₃) groups. One of these is part of the propenyl group identified above. The other methyl group must be part of the ester.\n\n*   **Absence of -CH₂ groups:** This is a critical piece of information. Since the second methyl group is part of the ester and there are no -CH₂- groups, the ester must be a **methyl ester (-COOCH₃)**. An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃), for example, is ruled out. This methyl ester fragment accounts for the second -CH₃ signal and the ester's carbonyl carbon.\n\n**2. Assembling the Fragments and Calculating the Molecular Formula:**\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from all the identified fragments:\n*   **From the aromatic ring:** C₆H₄\n*   **From the propenyl group:** C₃H₅\n*   **From the methyl ester group:** -COOCH₃ (This adds the C=O carbon, the -O-CH₃ group, and the two oxygens).\n\nLet's count the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 1 (from the ester C=O) + 1 (from the ester -OCH₃) = **11 carbons**.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from the ester -OCH₃) = **12 hydrogens**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from the ester -COO-) = **2 oxygens**.\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**3.

The other methyl signal, combined with the ester information from FTIR and the constraint of having no -CH2 groups, points to a methyl ester (-COOCH3).\n    *   **No -CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information that eliminates other possible structures, such as those containing an ethyl ester or an allyl group.\n\n### Assembling the Structure\n\nBased on the fragments identified from the spectral data, the molecule consists of:\n*   A para-substituted benzene ring (C6H4)\n*   A methyl ester group (-COOCH3)\n*   A propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)\n\n### Determining the Chemical Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from each fragment, we can determine the overall chemical formula:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from the ring) + 1 (from the C=O) + 1 (from the -OCH3) + 3 (from the propenyl group) = 11\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from the ring) + 3 (from the -OCH3) + 5 (from the propenyl group) = 12\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group)\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**. This corresponds to a structure such as methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n\nComparing this calculated formula with the given options:\nA) C12H14O2\nB) C11H12O2\nC) C11H14O2\nD) C12H12O2\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThe detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic data allows for a definitive identification of the unknown compound's chemical formula.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring (C₆) with two substituents, which means there are four hydrogens directly attached to the ring (C₆H₄). The 1H NMR spectrum confirms this with two signals corresponding to these aromatic hydrogens.\n\n2.  **FTIR Spectrum:** The presence of an ester group (-COO-) is confirmed. This functional group contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n3.  **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** Corresponds to the four protons on the di-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals):** The presence of two vinyl hydrogen signals, one a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets, is a classic pattern for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). The doublet arises from the vinyl proton adjacent to the ring, split by the other vinyl proton. The doublet of quartets arises from the second vinyl proton, which is split into a doublet by the first vinyl proton and into a quartet by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group.\n    *   **-CH₃ groups (2 signals):** One methyl signal corresponds to the propenyl group (-CH=CH-**CH₃**). The second methyl signal must belong to the ester group. To avoid having any -CH₂- groups (which are explicitly stated as absent), this must be either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetoxy group (-OCOCH₃).\n    *   **No -CH₂ groups:** This is a crucial piece of information that rules out other possibilities like an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n### Structure Determination and Formula Calculation\n\nBased on the fragments identified from the spectra, we can construct the molecule. The two substituents on the C₆H₄ ring are a propenyl group and an ester-containing group.\n\n*   **Fragment 1:** C₆H₄ (di-substituted benzene ring)\n*   **Fragment 2:** -CH=CH-CH₃ (propenyl group)\n*   **Fragment 3:** An ester group with a methyl group and no methylene groups. This can be either a methyl ester group (-COOCH₃) or an acetoxy group (-OCOCH₃).\n\nLet's calculate the molecular formula for a structure composed of these fragments:\n\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from the ring) + 3 (from the propenyl group) + 2 (from an acetoxy group, -OCOCH₃) OR 6 (from the ring) + 3 (from the propenyl group) + 1 (from a carbonyl, -**C**O) + 1 (from a methyl ester, -O**C**H₃). Both possibilities sum to **11 carbons**.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from the ring) + 5 (from the propenyl group, H+H+H₃) + 3 (from the methyl/acetoxy group). This sums to **12 hydrogens**.\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group).\n\nCombining these atoms gives the molecular formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\nThis formula is consistent with all the provided spectral data. Comparing this to the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nTo determine the correct chemical formula, we must systematically analyze the structural fragments indicated by the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This implies a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by other groups. The core of this structure is therefore a C6H4 fragment. The ¹H NMR spectrum confirms this with signals for aromatic protons.\n2.  **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum shows the presence of an ester functional group, which has the chemical structure -COO-. This adds two oxygen atoms to the molecule.\n3.  **Vinyl-H and -CH3 Groups (¹H NMR):**\n    *   There are two signals for vinyl protons (-CH=CH-). The splitting pattern described as \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\" is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). In this group, one vinyl proton is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet), and the second vinyl proton is split by both the first vinyl proton and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (creating a doublet of quartets). This fragment has a formula of C3H5.\n    *   The spectrum shows two distinct signals for methyl (-CH3) groups. One of these belongs to the propenyl group identified above. The second methyl group must be part of the ester. Given that an ester has the structure R-COO-R', and the main body of the molecule is the substituted aromatic ring, the most logical structure for the ester is a methyl ester (-COOCH3).\n4.  **No -CH2 Groups:** The explicit absence of signals for methylene (-CH2-) groups is a crucial constraint that helps eliminate other possible structures.\n\n### Assembling the Molecular Structure\n\nBased on the analysis, the unknown compound is composed of the following fragments:\n*   A di-substituted benzene ring: **C6H4**\n*   A propenyl group substituent: **-CH=CH-CH3** (Formula: C3H5)\n*   A methyl ester substituent: **-COOCH3** (Formula: COOCH3)\n\nCombining these fragments gives a structure such as methyl propenylbenzoate (the exact substitution pattern—ortho, meta, or para—does not affect the overall formula).\n\n### Calculating the Chemical Formula\n\nNow, we can sum the atoms from each fragment to determine the total chemical formula:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 1 (from -COOCH3) = 11 carbons\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from -COOCH3) = 12 hydrogens\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from -COOCH3) = 2 oxygens\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n### Verification\n\nThis formula corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of 6 (calculated as C + 1 - H/2). This matches the structure perfectly: 4 for the benzene ring (one ring and three double bonds), 1 for the vinyl C=C double bond, and 1 for the carbonyl C=O double bond. The proposed structure is fully consistent with all the provided spectral information. Other formulas, such as C12H14O2, would require adding a -CH2- group (for example, in an ethyl ester), which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula for the unknown compound is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the information from the problem statement.**\n\n1.  **Molecular Framework:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogens replaced by substituents. The core formula for this part is C6H4. The degree of unsaturation for the ring itself is 4 (one ring and three double bonds).\n2.  **Functional Group (FTIR):** The FTIR spectrum indicates an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for one carbon and two oxygen atoms (C, O2) and adds one degree of unsaturation due to the C=O double bond.\n3.  **Proton NMR (1H NMR) Data:**\n    *   **Six total signals:** This means there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring has four protons (C6H4). Having only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely para (1,4-substitution). In a para-substituted ring with two different substituents, the four protons form two chemically distinct sets (an AA'BB' system), which often appears as two signals (two doublets).\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals:** This indicates the presence of a C=C double bond with a proton on each carbon. Let's call them Ha and Hb.\n        *   One signal is a **doublet (d)**. This means the corresponding proton (e.g., Ha) is coupled to only one other proton (Hb).\n        *   The other signal is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. This means the corresponding proton (e.g., Hb) is coupled to two different groups of protons: one single proton (giving the doublet, which must be Ha) and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet, which must be a -CH3 group).\n        *   This splitting pattern is characteristic of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. The proton on the carbon next to the methyl group would be the doublet of quartets, and the other vinyl proton would be the doublet.\n    *   **Two -CH3 signals:** This means there are two distinct methyl groups in the molecule.\n        *   One -CH3 group is already identified as part of the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n        *   The second -CH3 group must be located elsewhere. Given the presence of an ester group, a methyl ester (-COOCH3) is a very common and plausible structure. A methyl group in this position would be a singlet, as it's not adjacent to any protons.\n    *   **No -CH2 signals:** This is a critical piece of information. It rules out structures containing ethyl (-CH2CH3), propyl (-CH2CH2CH3), or other alkyl chains with methylene groups.\n\n**Step 2: Assemble the structural fragments.**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we have the following pieces:\n*   A para-substituted benzene ring: -C6H4-\n*   A propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3\n*   A methyl ester group: -COOCH3\n\nLet's combine these to form the complete molecule. The two substituents on the benzene ring are the propenyl group and the methyl ester group.\n\nThe proposed structure is: **methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**.\n\n**Structure:**\n```\n      CH3\n       |\n      (O=)C-O\n       |\n      / \\\n     |   |\n    // \\\\ //\n   |     |\n    \\\\ // \\\\\n     |   |\n      \\ /\n       |\n      CH=CH-CH3\n```\n\nLet's verify this structure against the data:\n*   **Di-substituted aromatic ring:** Yes.\n*   **Ester group:** Yes (-COOCH3).\n*   **Aromatic-H:** Yes, 4 protons in a para arrangement, giving 2 signals.\n*   **Vinyl-H:** Yes, the -CH=CH- part gives 2 signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets).\n*   **-CH3 groups:** Yes, two of them. One in the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) and one in the methyl ester (-COOCH3). They are in different chemical environments, so they will give two separate signals.\n*   **No -CH2 groups:** Yes, the structure contains no -CH2- groups.\n\nThe proposed structure is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the chemical formula from the proposed structure.**\n\nNow, we count the atoms in the structure CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-COOCH3.\n*   **Carbon (C):** 1 (from propenyl CH3) + 2 (from -CH=CH-) + 6 (from benzene ring) + 1 (from -COO-) + 1 (from ester CH3) = **11 Carbons**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 3 (from propenyl CH3) + 2 (from -CH=CH-) + 4 (from benzene ring) + 3 (from ester CH3) = **12 Hydrogens**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester -COO-) = **2 Oxygens**\n\nThe chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**Step 4: Match the calculated formula with the given options.**\n\nThe calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option C.\n\n*   A) C11H14O2\n*   B) C12H12O2\n*   C) C11H12O2\n*   D) C12H14O2\n\nThe correct formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic information allows for the identification of the unknown compound's chemical formula.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two attached groups.\n2.  **FTIR - Ester group:** The presence of an ester group (-COO-) is confirmed, which contains two oxygen atoms.\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** This suggests a para-substituted benzene ring, which would have two sets of chemically equivalent protons.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the other vinyl proton and the methyl group is split into a doublet of quartets, while the other vinyl proton is split into a doublet.\n    *   **Two –CH₃ signals:** The molecule contains two distinct methyl groups. One is part of the propenyl group, and the other is consistent with a methyl ester (-COOCH₃).\n    *   **No –CH₂ signals:** The absence of any methylene (-CH₂-) groups is a crucial constraint for the final structure.\n\n### Assembling the Structure:\n\nBased on the fragments identified from the spectroscopic data, the molecule consists of:\n*   A di-substituted benzene ring (C₆H₄)\n*   A methyl ester group (-COOCH₃)\n*   A propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)\n\nA plausible structure is methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate. This structure is consistent with all the provided NMR data: a para-substituted ring, a propenyl group, two different methyl groups, and no methylene groups.\n\n### Determining the Chemical Formula:\n\nTo find the chemical formula, we sum the atoms from each part of the proposed structure:\n*   **Benzene ring:** C₆H₄\n*   **Propenyl group:** C₃H₅\n*   **Methyl ester group:** C₂H₃O₂\n\n**Total Calculation:**\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This corresponds to a molecule with a degree of unsaturation of 6 (one ring, four double bonds), which matches the proposed structure (1 ring + 3 aromatic C=C + 1 vinyl C=C + 1 C=O).\n\n### Evaluating Other Options:\n\n*   **C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** This formula would have a degree of unsaturation of 5. It would require removing a double bond, likely resulting in a propyl group instead of a propenyl group, which would introduce -CH₂- signals, contradicting the data.\n*   **C₁₂H₁₂O₂:** This formula has a degree of unsaturation of 7. Constructing a molecule with this formula that fits all the NMR constraints (especially the absence of -CH₂- groups and the specific vinyl and methyl signals) is not feasible.\n*   **C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** This formula has a degree of unsaturation of 6. A possible structure would be ethyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate. However, the ethyl group contains a -CH₂- group, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical formula that perfectly matches the detailed spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe user has provided the output from the code execution. I will now complete the reasoning process and provide the final answer.\n\n### Analysis of Code Output and Further Reasoning\n\nThe Python code calculated the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for each of the possible chemical formulas. The DBE represents the number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n\n1.  **DBE from Structural Fragments:**\n    *   A 6-membered aromatic ring has 1 ring and 3 double bonds, contributing 4 to the DBE.\n    *   An ester group has a C=O double bond, contributing 1 to the DBE.\n    *   The presence of vinyl-H signals indicates a C=C double bond, contributing 1 to the DBE.\n    *   **Total required DBE = 4 (ring) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = 6.**\n\n2.  **DBE from Provided Formulas (Code Output):**\n    *   A) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DBE = 5 (Incorrect)\n    *   B) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DBE = 6 (Possible)\n    *   C) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DBE = 6 (Possible)\n    *   D) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DBE = 7 (Incorrect)\n\nThe DBE calculation narrows down the possibilities to **B (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) and C (C₁₂H₁₄O₂)**.\n\n### Distinguishing Between B and C using NMR Data\n\nNow, we must use the specific fragment information from the ¹H NMR spectrum to determine the exact number of carbons and hydrogens.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄ (6 carbons, 4 hydrogens)\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The \"doublet\" and \"doublet of quartets\" pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group, **-CH=CH-CH₃**. This fragment contains 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens (1+1+3).\n*   **Methyl Groups:** There are two -CH₃ signals. One belongs to the propenyl group. The other must be part of the ester. Since there are **no -CH₂ signals**, the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃). It must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OOCCH₃). In either case, this second methyl group adds 1 carbon and 3 hydrogens.\n*   **Ester Carbonyl:** The C=O part of the ester adds 1 carbon.\n\nLet's sum the atoms from these identified fragments:\n*   **Carbons:** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from propenyl) + 1 (from the second CH₃) + 1 (from the ester C=O) = **11 Carbons**\n*   **Hydrogens:** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from the second CH₃) = **12 Hydrogens**\n*   **Oxygens:** 2 (from the ester group) = **2 Oxygens**\n\nThe molecular formula assembled from all the spectroscopic evidence is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This matches option B.\n\nTo confirm, let's consider why option C (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) is incorrect. The difference between our derived formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) and option C (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) is one carbon and two hydrogens (a CH₂ group). The problem statement explicitly says, \"**There are no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**.\" Therefore, option C is inconsistent with the provided data.\n\nThe only formula that fits all the evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on the detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data, we can deduce the structure and subsequently the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Aromatic Ring and Ester:** The compound is a di-substituted benzene ring (`-C6H4-`) and contains an ester group (`-COO-`). The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, 4 hydrogens, and a degree of unsaturation (DoU) of 4. The ester's C=O bond adds another degree of unsaturation.\n\n2.  **NMR Signal Analysis:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** This strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern on the benzene ring, which has a plane of symmetry, resulting in two sets of chemically equivalent aromatic protons. This accounts for 4 hydrogens.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals, d & dq):** This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The `CH` adjacent to the ring is split by the other vinyl proton into a doublet (d). The other vinyl `CH` is split by the first vinyl proton (doublet) and the methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq). This group adds 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens (`-C3H5`) and one C=C double bond (1 DoU).\n    *   **-CH3 Groups (2 signals):** One methyl group is from the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The other methyl group must be part of the ester.\n    *   **No -CH2 Groups:** This is a critical constraint. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (`-COOCH2CH3`) or have any other alkyl chain with a -CH2- unit. Therefore, the second methyl group must be either from a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate group (`-O-CO-CH3`).\n\n3.  **Assembling the Structure and Formula:**\n    Let's assemble the pieces: a para-substituted benzene ring (`-C6H4-`), a propenyl group (`-C3H5`), an ester group (`-COO-`), and a methyl group (`-CH3`).\n\n    *   **Carbons:** 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (ester CH3) = **11 Carbons**\n    *   **Hydrogens:** 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (ester CH3) = **12 Hydrogens**\n    *   **Oxygens:** 2 (ester) = **2 Oxygens**\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The structure contains one benzene ring (4 DoU), one C=C double bond (1 DoU), and one C=O double bond (1 DoU). The total DoU is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    *   Let's check the DoU for the formula C11H12O2: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   This matches perfectly. The other options either have the wrong DoU (A and D) or imply the presence of a -CH2- group (C), which is contradicted by the NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Deduce the structural fragments of the unknown compound from the provided FTIR and 1H NMR data.\n    2.

Calculate the molecular formula of the deduced structure and match it with the given options.\n\n*   **Action (Execution of Plan):**\n\n    1.  **Analyze the Spectroscopic Data:**\n        *   **FTIR:** An ester group (–COO–) is present. This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in all the formula options.\n        *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This implies a C6H4 core. The presence of only two aromatic-H signals strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern. This fragment is C6H4.\n        *   **Vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3). The proton coupled to both another vinyl proton and a methyl group gives the doublet of quartets. This fragment is C3H5.\n        *   **Two –CH3 signals:** One methyl signal comes from the propenyl group (–CH=CH–**CH3**). The second methyl signal must belong to the ester group.\n        *   **No –CH2– signals:** This is a critical constraint. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (–COOCH2CH3) or a propanoate (–CH2COO–), for example.\n\n    2.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n        *   We have a para-substituted benzene ring (C6H4).\n        *   One substituent is the propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3).\n        *   The other substituent must be an ester containing a methyl group, with no methylene (–CH2–) groups.

This functional group contains one carbon and two oxygen atoms.\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The base structure is a benzene ring with two substituents, which corresponds to a C₆H₄ fragment.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** The presence of two signals for the four aromatic protons suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern on the benzene ring, which results in a symmetrical structure.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals):** There are two hydrogens on a carbon-carbon double bond. The splitting patterns are key:\n        *   A **doublet of quartets (dq)** indicates a hydrogen that is split by one adjacent hydrogen (doublet) and by a group of three hydrogens, like a methyl group (quartet).\n        *   A **doublet (d)** indicates a hydrogen that is split by only one adjacent hydrogen.\n        *   This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). The hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group appears as a doublet of quartets, and the other vinyl hydrogen appears as a doublet.\n    *   **-CH₃ Groups (2 signals):** There are two distinct methyl groups.

This fragment has the formula C₃H₅.\n3.  **Substituent 2 (from FTIR and the second CH₃ signal):** An ester group containing a methyl group. To avoid having a -CH₂- group, this must be either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate group (-OCOCH₃). Both of these fragments have the formula C₂H₃O₂.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Chemical Formula\n\nNow, we add up the atoms from all the identified fragments to determine the molecular formula:\n\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **11 carbons**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **12 hydrogens**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **2 oxygens**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ matches the spectral data perfectly. It accounts for the di-substituted aromatic ring, the ester group, the propenyl group with its specific NMR splitting pattern, two distinct methyl groups, and the absence of any methylene groups. Comparing this to the given options, it corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\nBased on the provided spectroscopic information, the chemical formula of the unknown compound can be determined by systematically analyzing each piece of data.\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum**: The presence of absorption peaks for an ester group indicates the molecule contains a -COO- functional group, which accounts for two oxygen atoms. All the proposed formulas (C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2) are consistent with this, as they each contain two oxygen atoms.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum**: The proton NMR spectrum provides the most detailed information for identifying the molecular structure's components and, subsequently, its formula.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons**: Two signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.0 ppm) correspond to the protons on a di-substituted benzene ring. A benzene ring with two substituents has the formula C₆H₄, meaning there are 4 aromatic hydrogens.\n    *   **Vinyl Protons**: Two signals for vinyl protons indicate the presence of a -CH=CH- group. The splitting patterns are key: one signal is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. A doublet of quartets for a vinyl proton strongly suggests it is coupled to another vinyl proton (giving the doublet) and to a methyl (-CH₃) group (giving the quartet). This points to a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃) as a fragment. This fragment contains 2 vinyl hydrogens.\n    *   **Methyl Protons**: The spectrum shows two distinct signals for methyl (-CH₃) groups. One of these is part of the propenyl group identified above. The other must be located elsewhere in the molecule. In total, these two methyl groups account for 2 x 3 = 6 hydrogens.\n    *   **Absence of -CH₂ Groups**: The lack of any signals corresponding to methylene (-CH₂) groups is a crucial constraint on the possible structure.\n\n### Assembling the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, the molecular formula can be calculated.\n\n*   **Hydrogen Count**:\n    *   From the di-substituted aromatic ring (C₆H₄): 4 hydrogens\n    *   From the vinyl group (-CH=CH-): 2 hydrogens\n    *   From the two methyl groups (2 x -CH₃): 6 hydrogens\n    *   **Total Hydrogens = 4 + 2 + 6 = 12 hydrogens.**\n    This hydrogen count immediately eliminates options B (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) and C (C₁₁H₁₄O₂).\n\n*   **Carbon Count**:\n    *   From the benzene ring: 6 carbons\n    *   From the ester carbonyl group (-**C**OO-): 1 carbon\n    *   From the vinyl group (-**C**H=**C**H-): 2 carbons\n    *   From the two methyl groups (2 x -**C**H₃): 2 carbons\n    *   **Total Carbons = 6 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 11 carbons.**\n    This carbon count eliminates option D (C₁₂H₁₂O₂).\n\n*   **Oxygen Count**:\n    *   From the ester group (-C**O****O**-): 2 oxygens\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the counts for each element gives a final molecular formula of **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This formula is consistent with a structure such as methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate, which would exhibit all the described spectroscopic features: a di-substituted aromatic ring, an ester, a propenyl group giving rise to a doublet and a doublet of quartets for the vinyl protons, two distinct methyl signals, and no methylene groups.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula for the unknown compound is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe user wants me to identify the correct chemical formula for an unknown compound based on its spectral data.\n\n### Analysis of the Provided Information:\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This implies a C6H4 core.\n2.  **FTIR shows an ester group:** This indicates the presence of a -COO- functional group, which contains two oxygen atoms.\n3.  **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 protons. The presence of only two signals suggests a para (1,4) or ortho (1,2) substitution pattern with electronically similar substituents or symmetry.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This strongly suggests a `-CH=CH-CH3` (propenyl) group. The H on the carbon adjacent to the ring would be a doublet (split by the other vinyl H). The other vinyl H would be a doublet of quartets (split by the first vinyl H and the three protons of the methyl group).\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** This indicates two distinct methyl groups.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** Confirms the absence of any methylene (-CH2-) bridges.\n\n### Assembling the Structure:\n\nBased on the fragments identified from the spectral data, we can propose a plausible structure.\n*   **Core:** A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4).\n*   **Functional Groups/Substituents:**\n    *   An ester group (-COO-).\n    *   A propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n    *   A methyl group (-CH3).\n\nLet's combine these pieces. The ester group must be one of the substituents on the ring, and it incorporates one of the methyl groups. The other substituent is the propenyl group.\n\n**Plausible Structure:** Methyl propenylbenzoate. For example, methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n\n*   The aromatic ring is substituted with a `-COOCH3` group and a `-CH=CH-CH3` group.\n*   This structure fits all the NMR data:\n    *   Two aromatic signals (from the para-substituted ring).\n    *   Two vinyl signals with the described splitting pattern.\n    *   Two methyl signals (one from the ester, one from the propenyl group).\n    *   No -CH2- groups.\n\n### Calculating the Chemical Formula:\n\nNow, let's determine the chemical formula for this proposed structure.\n*   **Benzene ring part:** C6H4\n*   **Ester group part:** -COOCH3 -> adds C2, H3, O2\n*   **Propenyl group part:** -CH=CH-CH3 -> adds C3, H5\n*   **Total Carbon atoms:** 6 (from ring) + 1 (from C=O) + 1 (from O-CH3) + 3 (from propenyl) = 11 carbons.\n*   **Total Hydrogen atoms:** 4 (from ring) + 3 (from O-CH3) + 5 (from propenyl) = 12 hydrogens.\n*   **Total Oxygen atoms:** 2 (from ester).\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n### Verifying with Degree of Unsaturation:\n\nThe degree of unsaturation for C11H12O2 is calculated as:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n*   Benzene ring = 4 units of unsaturation.\n*   C=O bond in ester = 1 unit of unsaturation.\n*   C=C bond in vinyl group = 1 unit of unsaturation.\n*   Total = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\nThe calculated degree of unsaturation matches the proposed structure.\n\n### Comparing with the Options:\n\n*   A) C11H14O2 (DoU = 5) - Incorrect DoU.\n*   B) C12H12O2 (DoU = 7) - Incorrect DoU.\n*   C) C11H12O2 (DoU = 6) - Matches the analysis.\n*   D) C12H14O2 (DoU = 6) - While the DoU is correct, this formula does not match the fragments identified from the NMR data. Building a C12H14O2 molecule consistent with the NMR data (especially the absence of -CH2- groups) is not feasible.\n\nThe analysis of the provided FTIR and 1H NMR data strongly and consistently points to a molecular formula of C11H12O2. This is supported by constructing a plausible chemical structure that fits all the spectral details.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nInitial candidates: {'A': 'C12H12O2', 'B': 'C11H12O2', 'C': 'C12H14O2', 'D': 'C11H14O2'}\n\n--- Constraint 1: Degree of Unsaturation must be 6 ---\nCandidate A (C12H12O2): DoU = 7.0.

The proton on the carbon adjacent to the ring is split by the other vinyl proton (doublet), and the other vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n    *   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):** One of these is the methyl group from the propenyl (-CH=CH-CH3). The other must be part of the ester functionality, as there are no other places for it.\n    *   **No -CH2 groups:** This is a critical constraint. For the ester group not to have a -CH2- group, it must be either a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate group (-OCOCH3). An ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3), for example, is ruled out.\n\n3.  **Assembling the Structure and Formula:**\n    *   We have a benzene ring fragment: C6H4.\n    *   We have a propenyl group substituent: -C3H5.\n    *   We have an ester-related substituent that also contains a methyl group. This can be either:\n        *   A methyl ester group: -COOCH3, which has the formula -C2H3O2.\n        *   An acetate group: -OCOCH3, which also has the formula -C2H3O2.\n    *   Combining these fragments gives the total molecular formula:\n        *   Carbons: 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 2 (ester part) = 11 carbons.\n        *   Hydrogens: 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (methyl of ester) = 12 hydrogens.\n        *   Oxygens: 2 (ester).\n    *   The resulting formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Proposed Action:** The logical deduction seems complete. To be certain, I will perform a search to confirm that the proposed structures (like methyl p-propenylbenzoate or p-propenylphenyl acetate) are consistent with the given data and that no other possibilities for the other formulas exist.\n\n**Skeptic's Cross-Examination:**\n\nThe initial deduction to C11H12O2 is strong. The search results provide spectra for related compounds. Let's analyze them to see if they support or contradict the conclusion.\n*   The search did not yield spectra for the exact proposed structures (methyl propenylbenzoate or propenylphenyl acetate).\n*   However, it provided spectra for similar molecules. For example, 3-phenylpropyl acetate (C11H14O2) shows the presence of -CH2- groups in its NMR spectrum, confirming that adding hydrogens to C11H12O2 would introduce these signals, which contradicts the problem statement.\n*   Spectra for methyl benzoate (C8H8O2) and other simple esters are available, but don't directly help confirm the vinyl group signals.\n*   The search on C12H14O2 and C12H12O2 did not reveal any common structures that would fit all the NMR constraints (di-substituted, propenyl group, ester, no -CH2-). For instance, many isomers of C12H14O2 contain -CH2- groups.\n\nThe core of the argument remains the logical deduction from the spectral data:\n*   **Aromatic Ring (C6H4) + Propenyl Group (C3H5) + Ester with a Methyl Group (C2H3O2) = C11H12O2.**\n*   **C11H14O2:** This formula has two more hydrogens. To add two hydrogens to C11H12O2, one would typically saturate the propenyl's double bond, creating a propyl group (-CH2CH2CH3). This introduces -CH2- signals, which are explicitly absent. Thus, C11H14O2 is incorrect.\n*   **C12H14O2:** This formula has an extra CH2 group compared to C11H12O2. This is directly ruled out by the \"no -CH2- signals\" constraint.\n*   **C12H12O2:** This formula has an extra C and the same number of hydrogens as C11H12O2. It is impossible to add a carbon atom without either adding hydrogens (which would change the formula), creating a forbidden -CH2- group (e.g., by making an ethyl ester, -COOCH2CH3), or violating another rule (e.g., adding a methyl to the ring would make it tri-substituted; adding a vinyl group to the ester, -COOCH=CH2, would create four vinyl signals instead of two).\n\nThe initial deduction is robust and withstands scrutiny. The constraints provided are very specific and point to a single molecular formula.\n\n**Convergence and Final Decision:**\n\nThe proposer's initial analysis is correct. The combination of a di-substituted benzene ring, an ester group, a propenyl group, a second methyl group, and the absence of any methylene groups can only be satisfied by the molecular formula C11H12O2. The other options are systematically ruled out by the given constraints.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
