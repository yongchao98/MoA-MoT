  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nFive binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known. The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (ɷF=31,96%) and fluorine. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine. By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained. In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances. Indicate the range in which the molecular weight of the substance A4 falls.\n\nA) 140-160\nB) 220-240\nC) 110-130\nD) 160-180\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nThe Python script successfully identified the unknown element Y and its compounds by systematically applying the constraints from the problem description.\n\n1.  **Hypothesis Generation:** The script first used the mass percentage of fluorine in compound A2 (31.96%) to calculate a relationship between the molar mass of element Y and the number of fluorine atoms in A2 (`M_Y ≈ 40.45 * n`). This led to the consideration of elements like Krypton (Kr), Antimony (Sb), and Plutonium (Pu) as potential candidates for Y.\n\n2.  **Constraint Application & Pruning:**\n    *   The script evaluated Krypton (Y=Kr). If A2 is KrF2, its fluorine mass percentage is 31.2%, which is reasonably close to the given value.\n    *   The decomposition `A1 -> A2 + F2` corresponds to the known reaction `KrF4 -> KrF2 + F2`. This identifies A1 as KrF4.\n    *   The 1:1 molar reaction `Y + A4 -> A5` strongly suggests the comproportionation reaction `Kr + KrF4 -> 2 KrF2`. This identifies A4 as KrF4 and A5 as KrF2.\n    *   Other candidates like Sb and Pu were eliminated because their fluoride chemistry did not match the reaction constraints (e.g., SbF5 is too stable, PuF8 is unknown).\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The only viable candidate was Krypton. The compound A4 was identified as Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF4). The molecular weight of KrF4 is calculated as 83.80 (for Kr) + 4 * 18.998 (for F) = 159.79 g/mol. This value falls squarely within the 140-160 range.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical puzzle to determine the molecular weight range of substance A4.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from Substance A2:**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine, with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. We can determine the identity of Y by testing plausible chemical formulas (YFₙ) against this percentage.\n\n    *   The formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n × Molar Mass of F) / (Molar Mass of Y + n × Molar Mass of F)\n    *   Let's test the formula SbF₃ (Antimony trifluoride).\n        *   Molar Mass of Sb ≈ 121.76 g/mol\n        *   Molar Mass of F ≈ 18.998 g/mol\n        *   ɷF in SbF₃ = (3 × 18.998) / (121.76 + 3 × 18.998) = 56.994 / 178.754 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%.\n    *   This value (31.88%) is extremely close to the given value of 31.96%. This strong correlation suggests that **Element Y is Antimony (Sb)** and **Substance A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Possible Binary Compounds of Antimony:**\n    Antimony primarily forms two stable binary fluorides:\n    *   **Antimony trifluoride (SbF₃)**\n    *   **Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅)**\n\n3.  **Determine Substance A4 by its Molecular Weight:**\n    The question asks for the range in which the molecular weight of substance A4 falls. A4 is one of the binary compounds of antimony and fluorine. Let's calculate the molecular weights of the two main candidates:\n\n    *   **Molecular Weight of SbF₃:** 121.76 + (3 × 18.998) = **178.75 g/mol**.\n    *   **Molecular Weight of SbF₅:** 121.76 + (5 × 18.998) = **216.75 g/mol**.\n\n    Now, let's compare these molecular weights to the given ranges:\n    *   A) 160-180\n    *   B) 220-240\n    *   C) 110-130\n    *   D) 140-160\n\n    The molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.75 g/mol) fits perfectly within range **A) 160-180**. The molecular weight of SbF₅ (216.75 g/mol) does not fall into any of the provided ranges.\n\n4.  **Conclusion on A4:**\n    Based on the numerical evidence, substance A4 must be SbF₃. The other descriptive clues in the problem (the color of A1, the 1:1 reaction stoichiometry) contain inconsistencies with standard chemical properties but are not needed to solve for the molecular weight of A4. The mass percentage of A2 and the provided molecular weight ranges are sufficient to identify A4.\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 (SbF₃) is approximately 179 g/mol, which falls into the 160-180 range.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThe search results point towards Krypton (Kr) as element Y. Let's verify this with the given information.\n\n*   **Element Y:** Krypton (Kr), a noble gas. Its atomic weight is ~83.8 g/mol.\n*   **Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known:** The search results mention KrF2 and KrF4. Theoretical calculations also predict the existence of KrF6 and other species like KrF+, KrF-, KrF3+, and KrF5+. This makes the \"five binary compounds\" plausible in the context of a chemistry problem.\n\nLet's re-evaluate A2 with Y=Kr.\n*   **A2 (ɷF=31,96%):** Let's calculate the mass percentage of fluorine in the known krypton fluorides.\n    *   **KrF2:** Molar mass = 83.8 + 2 * 19.0 = 121.8 g/mol.\n        *   Mass % F = (2 * 19.0) / 121.8 * 100% = 38 / 121.8 * 100% ≈ 31.2%. This is very close to the given 31.96%. Let's assume A2 is KrF2.\n    *   **KrF4:** Molar mass = 83.8 + 4 * 19.0 = 159.8 g/mol.\n        *   Mass % F = (4 * 19.0) / 159.8 * 100% = 76 / 159.8 * 100% ≈ 47.6%.\n\nSo, **A2 is KrF2**.\n\nNow let's decipher the other compounds based on the clues:\n\n*   **The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (KrF2) and fluorine.**\n    *   Reaction: A1 -> KrF2 + F2.\n    *   This means A1 must be KrF4.\n    *   Is KrF4 a \"bright-red substance\"? The search results describe it as a white crystalline solid. However, another highly reactive fluorine compound, dioxygen difluoride (O2F2), is described as an orange-red solid. There might be an inaccuracy in the problem's description, or it refers to an impurity or a specific state.\n    *   Does KrF4 decompose at 293 K (20 °C)? Yes, it is reported to be thermodynamically unstable and decomposes rapidly at room temperature.\n    *   So, **A1 is KrF4**.\n\n*   **A1 (KrF4) oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.** KrF4 is a powerful fluorinating agent, so it's plausible it would oxidize xenon. KrF2 is also known to oxidize xenon to XeF6.\n\n*   **A3 can also interact with xenon.** This points to another krypton fluoride. Given that KrF2 and KrF4 are A2 and A1, A3 is likely another fluoride.\n\n*   **A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y (Kr) with fluorine.**\n    *   Reaction: Kr + F2 -> A3.\n    *   This is the synthesis for krypton fluorides. KrF2 is formed by reacting Kr and F2 with an electric discharge or X-rays. KrF4 was claimed to be synthesized by passing an electric discharge through a krypton-fluorine mixture. It's reasonable to assume A3 is one of these common fluorides.\n\n*   **By adding Y (Kr) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.**\n    *   Reaction: Kr + A4 -> A5.\n    *   This is a strange reaction. It's unlikely that krypton would be added to a solution to react. This clue might be interpreted differently. Perhaps it's not a reaction in a solution but a high-energy process.\n    *   Let's reconsider the compounds. We have identified A1=KrF4 and A2=KrF2. The problem mentions five compounds. Let's call them KrF, KrF2, KrF3, KrF4, KrF5 for now.\n    *   The search results mention salts of the KrF+ cation. These are formed when KrF2 reacts with strong Lewis acids (e.g., SbF5).\n    *   Example: KrF2 + SbF5 -> [KrF]+[SbF6]-.\n    *   Here, [KrF]+[SbF6]- could be considered a compound. Let's explore this path.\n\nLet's re-examine the clue: **\"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"**\n*   This sounds like the formation of a complex.\n*   What if A4 is a Lewis acid fluoride, and A5 is the resulting salt?\n*   Let's assume **A4 is a strong Lewis acid like SbF5 or AsF5**. These are known to react with KrF2.\n*   The reaction would be KrF2 + A4 -> [KrF]+[A4F]-.\n*   But the clue says Y (Kr) is added, not KrF2. This is a major inconsistency.\n\nLet's pause and rethink the whole sequence.\n\n1.  **Y = Kr**.\n2.  **A2 = KrF2** (ωF ≈ 31.2%, close to 31.96%).\n3.  **A1 = KrF4** (Decomposes to KrF2 + F2).\n4.  **A1 (KrF4) and A3 oxidize Xe.** KrF2 also oxidizes Xe. So A3 could be KrF2, but A2 is already KrF2. Let's assume A3 is just another reactive fluoride of Krypton.\n5.  **A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y (Kr).** Both KrF2 and KrF4 are made this way.\n6.  **In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.**\n    *   Let's check the reaction of krypton fluorides with water.\n    *   2KrF2 + 2H2O → 2Kr + O2 + 4HF. This produces three substances (if you count Kr and O2 as separate). The problem says two. Maybe HF in water is considered one substance (hydrofluoric acid). But that still leaves Kr and O2.\n7.  **By adding Y (Kr) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.**\n    *   This clue is the most difficult. Let's reconsider the reaction. What if A4 is not a simple binary fluoride?\n    *   What if the problem is from a specific context where \"five binary compounds\" includes complex salts?\n    *   Let's look at the reaction again: Kr + A4 -> A5. This implies A5 contains Krypton.\n    *   What if A4 is a compound that can trap or react with Krypton atoms?\n    *   This seems very exotic. Let's reconsider the possibility of an error in the problem statement. What if it's not Y (Kr) being added, but A2 (KrF2)?\n    *   If the reaction is **A2 (KrF2) + A4 -> A5 (1:1 molar ratio)**.\n    *   And A4 is a strong Lewis acid fluoride. Let's assume **A4 = SbF5**.\n    *   Then **A5 = KrF2·SbF5**, which is better written as **[KrF]+[SbF6]-**.\n    *   Let's check if this fits.\n        *   A4 = SbF5. It's a colorless liquid/solid, can form concentrated solutions.\n        *   A5 = [KrF]+[SbF6]-.\n        *   **In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.** The [KrF]+ cation is highly reactive and would decompose in water. The [SbF6]- anion would also react. The overall reaction is complex, but it would certainly decompose.\n        *   This interpretation seems much more chemically sound.\n\nLet's proceed with this assumption:\n*   **Y = Kr** (Krypton)\n*   **A1 = KrF4** (Krypton tetrafluoride)\n*   **A2 = KrF2** (Krypton difluoride)\n*   **A3 =** Another krypton fluoride, likely one of the above.\n*   **A4 = SbF5** (Antimony pentafluoride) - A strong Lewis acid.\n*   **A5 = [KrF]+[SbF6]-** (Fluoro(krypton) hexafluoroantimonate)\n\nNow, the question asks for the **molecular weight range of substance A4**.\n*   We have identified A4 as Antimony pentafluoride (SbF5).\n*   Let's calculate its molecular weight.\n    *   Atomic weight of Antimony (Sb) ≈ 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol.\n    *   Molecular weight of SbF5 = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 121.76 + 95.00 = 216.76 g/mol.\n\nThis molecular weight (216.76 g/mol) does not fall into any of the provided ranges.\nA) 160-180\nB) 220-240\nC) 140-160\nD) 110-130\n\nLet's re-check my assumptions.\n*   Is Y=Kr correct? The mass percentage for A2=KrF2 (31.2%) is close to 31.96%. Let's recalculate M(Y) from the given percentage, assuming A2 is YF2.\n    *   (2 * 19) / (M(Y) + 2 * 19) = 0.3196\n    *   38 = 0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * 38\n    *   38 = 0.3196 * M(Y) + 12.1448\n    *   25.8552 = 0.3196 * M(Y)\n    *   M(Y) = 25.8552 / 0.3196 ≈ 80.9 g/mol.\n*   This atomic weight (80.9 g/mol) is extremely close to Bromine (Br, 79.9 g/mol).\n\nLet's re-evaluate everything with **Y = Bromine (Br)**.\n*   **Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.** Bromine forms BrF, BrF3, BrF5, and other less stable species like BrF2 radical, BrF4 cation/anion. This is plausible.\n*   **A2 (ɷF=31,96%).** If Y=Br, then A2 is BrF2. This is not a stable, isolable compound. It's a radical. This seems unlikely to be A2.\n*   Let's check the mass percentages for stable bromine fluorides:\n    *   BrF: 19 / (79.9 + 19) = 19.2%\n    *   BrF3: (3 * 19) / (79.9 + 57) = 41.6%\n    *   BrF5: (5 * 19) / (79.9 + 95) = 54.3%\n*   None of these match 31.96%. The calculation points strongly to a YF2 compound where Y has a mass of ~80.9. Krypton (83.8) is a better fit than Bromine (79.9) if we allow for some error in the percentage. The difference for Kr is (31.96-31.20)/31.96 = 2.4%. The difference for Br is (31.96-32.35)/31.96 = 1.2% (using M(Br)=79.9 and A2=BrF2). Bromine is actually a closer fit mathematically, but BrF2 is not a stable compound you'd get from decomposition.\n\nLet's go back to **Y = Krypton (Kr)** and reconsider A4.\n*   A1 = KrF4\n*   A2 = KrF2\n*   Reaction: A2 + A4 -> A5 (assuming the typo)\n*   A4 must be a strong Lewis acid fluoride. We tried SbF5 (MW=216.8) and it didn't fit the ranges.\n*   What are other strong Lewis acid fluorides?\n    *   AsF5 (Arsenic pentafluoride): MW = 69.92 + 5 * 19.00 = 164.92 g/mol.\n    *   PF5 (Phosphorus pentafluoride): MW = 30.97 + 5 * 19.00 = 125.97 g/mol.\n    *   BF3 (Boron trifluoride): MW = 10.81 + 3 * 19.00 = 67.81 g/mol.\n    *   XeF6 (Xenon hexafluoride): MW = 131.29 + 6 * 19.00 = 245.29 g/mol.\n\nLet's check the molecular weights against the options:\n*   AsF5: 164.92 g/mol. This falls squarely in range **A) 160-180**.\n*   PF5: 125.97 g/mol. This falls squarely in range **D) 110-130**.\n*   XeF6: 245.29 g/mol. This is outside range B.\n\nSo, A4 could be AsF5 or PF5. Both are strong Lewis acids known to react with fluorides.\n*   If A4 = AsF5, the answer is A.\n*   If A4 = PF5, the answer is D.\n\nIs there any clue to distinguish between them?\n*   \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\".\n    *   AsF5 is a colorless gas at STP, boils at -53.2 °C.\n    *   PF5 is a colorless gas at STP, boils at -84.6 °C.\n    *   Both can be handled as liquids under pressure or at low temperatures. The term \"solution\" might be used loosely, perhaps referring to the pure liquid or a solution in an inert solvent like anhydrous HF.\n*   The problem seems to have multiple ambiguities (the red color of A1, the \"Y + A4\" reaction, the number of decomposition products of A5 in water).\n\nHowever, the core chemical logic seems to be:\n1.  Identify Y from the mass percentage of F in A2. Krypton is the most plausible candidate despite a small discrepancy in the percentage, as it forms the necessary range of unstable/reactive fluorides.\n2.  Identify A1 and A2 based on the decomposition reaction. A1=KrF4, A2=KrF2.\n3.  Identify the reaction to form A5 as a Lewis acid-base reaction between a krypton fluoride (likely A2=KrF2) and a fluoride Lewis acid (A4).\n4.  Identify A4 as a common strong Lewis acid fluoride whose molecular weight fits one of the ranges.\n\nLet's re-examine the reaction: **Kr + A4 -> A5**.\nCould this be correct? Is there any reaction where Krypton gas is bubbled through a solution of A4 to make A5? This is highly unconventional.\nWhat if A4 is not the Lewis acid, but something else?\nExample: PtF6. It's a dark red solid, a powerful oxidizing agent. It famously oxidized O2 and Xe.\nPtF6 + Xe -> [Xe]+[PtF6]-.\nCould the reaction be **PtF6 + Kr -> [Kr]+[PtF6]-**? This is chemically plausible.\n*   Let's check the properties.\n    *   A4 = PtF6. It is a \"hot...solution\"? PtF6 is a low-melting solid (m.p. 61.3 °C), so a \"hot...solution\" could be molten PtF6. It is dark red, not colorless. This contradicts the \"colorless\" description.\n    *   A5 = [Kr]+[PtF6]-.\n    *   Does A5 decompose in water? Yes, violently.\n*   What is the molecular weight of PtF6?\n    *   MW = 195.08 + 6 * 19.00 = 195.08 + 114 = 309.08 g/mol. This doesn't fit any range.\n\nThe assumption of a typo in the reaction (A2 + A4 -> A5 instead of Y + A4 -> A5) seems the most likely way to resolve the puzzle.\nIf we accept this assumption, A4 is a strong Lewis acid fluoride.\nThe candidates are AsF5 (MW ≈ 165) and PF5 (MW ≈ 126).\n\n*   **Option A) 160-180:** Corresponds to A4 = AsF5.\n*   **Option D) 110-130:** Corresponds to A4 = PF5.\n\nBoth are chemically plausible. Without further information, it's hard to distinguish. However, in problems of this nature, often a very common or representative example is used. Both AsF5 and SbF5 are classic examples of very strong Lewis acids used in noble gas and halogen fluoride chemistry. PF5 is also a Lewis acid, but perhaps less commonly cited in the context of reacting with KrF2. The reaction between KrF2 and AsF5 to form [KrF]+[AsF6]- is well-documented.\n\nLet's reconsider the \"bright-red substance A1\". This is a strong clue that is being ignored.\n*   A1 = KrF4, which is a white solid.\n*   What if A1 is not KrF4?\n*   A1 -> A2 + F2. A1 has more fluorine than A2.\n*   A2 has ɷF=31,96%. We identified this as likely KrF2.\n*   So A1 -> KrF2 + F2. This still points to A1 = KrF4.\n*   Is there any other \"bright-red\" substance that could be A1?\n    *   Dioxygen difluoride (O2F2) is orange-red.\n    *   Platinum hexafluoride (PtF6) is dark red.\n    *   Rhodium hexafluoride (RhF6) is black.\n    *   Ruthenium pentafluoride (RuF5) is dark green.\n*   If A1 were PtF6, it doesn't contain element Y (Kr).\n*   The description of A1 as \"bright-red\" seems to be a major inconsistency or a red herring. If we ignore it and focus on the other clues, the path Y=Kr, A2=KrF2, A1=KrF4, A4=AsF5 seems the most consistent.\n\nLet's check the molecular weight of KrF4 (A1).\nMW = 83.8 + 4 * 19 = 159.8 g/mol. This falls in range C) 140-160. But the question asks for A4.\n\nLet's check the molecular weight of KrF2 (A2).\nMW = 83.8 + 2 * 19 = 121.8 g/mol. This falls in range D) 110-130. But the question asks for A4.\n\nLet's assume the question is flawed and asks for the MW of A1 or A2.\nIf it asks for A1 (KrF4), the answer is C.\nIf it asks for A2 (KrF2), the answer is D.\n\nLet's assume the question is correct as stated and our identification of A4 is correct.\nA4 = AsF5, MW = 164.92 g/mol -> Range A.\nA4 = PF5, MW = 125.97 g/mol -> Range D.\n\nHow to decide between AsF5 and PF5? There are no further clues. Let's re-read carefully.\n\"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nLet's stick to the typo theory: A2 + A4 -> A5.\nKrF2 + AsF5 -> [KrF]+[AsF6]-\nKrF2 + PF5 -> [KrF]+[PF6]-\nBoth reactions are known.\n\nLet's reconsider the original reaction: Kr + A4 -> A5.\nCould A4 be something that reacts with Kr? Maybe A4 is not a stable molecule but a radical species in solution? This seems too complex.\nWhat if A4 is an excited state molecule?\nWhat if A4 is an oxidant that can form a compound with Kr? We already discussed PtF6. What about O2F2? It's red, not colorless.\n\nLet's go back to the most plausible path:\nY = Kr\nA2 = KrF2\nA1 = KrF4\nA4 = Lewis Acid Fluoride (AsF5 or PF5)\nTypo in reaction: should be A2 + A4 -> A5\n\nLet's assume A4 is Arsenic Pentafluoride (AsF5).\nMW = 164.92 g/mol.\nThis falls in the range 160-180.\n\nLet's assume A4 is Phosphorus Pentafluoride (PF5).\nMW = 125.97 g/mol.\nThis falls in the range 110-130.\n\nIs there any reason to prefer AsF5? Arsenic is in the same group as Antimony, and SbF5 is the archetypal superacid-forming fluoride. AsF5 is also extremely strong. PF5 is a weaker Lewis acid than AsF5 and SbF5. Given the extreme nature of Krypton chemistry, reacting with a very strong Lewis acid like AsF5 seems more likely to be the intended answer than reacting with the somewhat weaker PF5.\n\nLet's finalize the identification:\n*   Element Y: Krypton (Kr).\n*   A1: KrF4 (Krypton tetrafluoride). Described as \"bright-red\" (inaccuracy in problem), decomposes at 293 K to A2 and F2. Oxidizes xenon.\n*   A2: KrF2 (Krypton difluoride). Mass % of F is ~31.2%, close to the given 31.96%.\n*   A3: Another krypton fluoride, likely KrF2 or KrF4, which also oxidizes xenon.\n*   A4: AsF5 (Arsenic pentafluoride). A colorless substance (gas, liquid at low temp) and a very strong Lewis acid.\n*   A5: [KrF]+[AsF6]-. Formed from the reaction of KrF2 and AsF5 (assuming typo in problem statement). Decomposes in water.\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 (AsF5) is approximately 165 g/mol.\nThis value falls within the range of 160-180.\n\nFinal check of the logic. The identification of Y as Kr is the crucial first step. The mass percentage calculation points to an element with M ≈ 80.9 if the fluoride is YF2. Krypton (83.8) is a reasonable fit, and its chemistry aligns with the clues about unstable, highly oxidizing fluorides. The decomposition of A1 to A2+F2 points to A1=KrF4 and A2=KrF2. The reaction to form A5 is best explained as a Lewis acid-base reaction, which requires assuming a typo in the reactants (A2 instead of Y). With this assumption, A4 is a strong fluoride Lewis acid. Checking the molecular weights of common Lewis acids, AsF5 (165 g/mol) fits perfectly into range A. This seems to be the most coherent solution despite the minor inconsistencies in the problem description.\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of substance A4 falls in the range of 160-180.\n\nFinal Answer is A.\n\nLet's write down the final reasoning.\n1.  From the mass percentage of fluorine in A2 (ɷF=31.96%), we can determine the molar mass of element Y. Assuming the formula is YFn, the molar mass M(Y) is given by M(Y) = (19n / 0.3196) - 19n. A more direct calculation: M(Y) ≈ 40.45n.\n2.  Testing values of n, if n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic mass of Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol) and Bromine (Br, 79.9 g/mol).\n3.  Krypton is a noble gas known to form several unstable, highly reactive fluorides, which fits the description. Let's assume Y is Kr. Then A2 would be KrF2. The theoretical mass percentage of F in KrF2 is (2 * 19) / (83.8 + 38) * 100% ≈ 31.2%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n4.  Substance A1 decomposes into A2 (KrF2) and fluorine. This means A1 must be a higher fluoride of krypton, which is KrF4. The reaction is KrF4 → KrF2 + F2. KrF4 is known to be unstable at room temperature (293 K).\n5.  A1 (KrF4) and A3 are described as oxidizing xenon, which is characteristic of these powerful fluorinating agents. KrF2 also reacts with Xenon.\n6.  The clue \"By adding Y (Kr) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained\" is chemically problematic. It is highly likely a typo and should read \"By adding A2 (KrF2)...\". This would describe a classic Lewis acid-base reaction.\n7.  The reaction is A2 + A4 → A5, where A4 is a strong Lewis acid. A5 is the resulting salt. For example: KrF2 + A4 → [KrF]+[A4F]-.\n8.  A4 is described as a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". We need to find a strong Lewis acid fluoride that fits this and one of the molecular weight ranges.\n9.  Let's examine potential Lewis acids:\n    *   PF5: MW ≈ 126 g/mol (Range D)\n    *   AsF5: MW ≈ 165 g/mol (Range A)\n    *   SbF5: MW ≈ 217 g/mol (Outside the ranges)\n10. Both PF5 and AsF5 are colorless gases that can be liquefied. The reaction of KrF2 with AsF5 to form [KrF]+[AsF6]- is well-established in noble gas chemistry. Given the extreme reactivity involved, the stronger Lewis acid AsF5 is a very fitting candidate.\n11. The molecular weight of AsF5 is approximately 165 g/mol, which falls into the range of 160-180.\n12. The final clue, \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances,\" is consistent, as these complex fluoride salts react vigorously with water.\n\nBased on this deductive process, A4 is Arsenic pentafluoride (AsF5). Its molecular weight is ~165 g/mol. This falls in the range 160-180.Based on the information provided, we can deduce the identity of element Y and the five fluorine compounds through a step-by-step analysis.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2:**\n    The problem states that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YF_n, where Y is the unknown element and n is the number of fluorine atoms. The atomic mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 19.0 g/mol.\n\n    The formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.0) / (M(Y) + n * 19.0)\n\n    Rearranging for the molar mass of Y, M(Y):\n    M(Y) = (19.0 * n / 0.3196) - (19.0 * n)\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    We can test integer values for 'n':\n    *   If n = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (closest is Calcium, but its fluoride chemistry doesn't fit).\n    *   If n = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic masses of Bromine (Br, 79.9 g/mol) and Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol).\n\n    The problem describes highly reactive compounds, some of which can oxidize xenon. This is characteristic of noble gas compounds. Krypton (Kr) is known to form several binary fluorides. Let's assume **Y is Krypton (Kr)**.\n    If Y is Kr, then A2 would be KrF2. Let's check the mass percentage:\n    M(KrF2) = 83.8 + 2 * 19.0 = 121.8 g/mol.\n    ɷF in KrF2 = (2 * 19.0) / 121.8 * 100% ≈ 31.2%. This value is very close to the 31.96% given in the problem. Thus, we can confidently identify **A2 as KrF2** (Krypton difluoride).\n\n2.  **Identify Compound A1:**\n    A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (20 °C) into A2 (KrF2) and fluorine (F2). The reaction is A1 → KrF2 + F2. This implies A1 has more fluorine than A2, making **A1 Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF4)**. KrF4 is known to be thermally unstable and decomposes at room temperature. While it is typically described as a white solid, the \"bright-red\" color might be an inaccuracy in the problem statement or refer to an impurity, as other highly reactive fluorides like O2F2 are red.\n\n3.  **Identify Compounds A3, A4, and A5:**\n    *   A1 (KrF4) and A3 are said to oxidize xenon. This is a known property of krypton fluorides. A3 is obtained by the fluorination of Krypton.\n    *   The most challenging clue is: \"By adding Y (Kr) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" A direct reaction with elemental krypton in this manner is highly unusual. It is very likely that this is a typo and the reaction should involve the reactive krypton compound A2 (KrF2) instead of Y (Kr).\n    *   The corrected reaction would be: A2 + A4 → A5. This describes a classic Lewis acid-base reaction where the fluoride A2 acts as a Lewis base (fluoride donor) and A4 is a strong Lewis acid (fluoride acceptor).\n    *   The product A5 would be a salt of the form [KrF]+[A4F]−. These complex salts are known to decompose in water.\n    *   A4 must therefore be a strong Lewis acid fluoride. Common examples include PF5, AsF5, and SbF5.\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4:**\n    We need to find which Lewis acid's molecular weight fits the given options.\n    *   PF5 (Phosphorus pentafluoride): MW = 31.0 + 5 * 19.0 = 126.0 g/mol.\n    *   **AsF5 (Arsenic pentafluoride): MW = 74.9 + 5 * 19.0 = 169.9 g/mol.**\n    *   SbF5 (Antimony pentafluoride): MW = 121.8 + 5 * 19.0 = 216.8 g/mol.\n\n    Now we check these molecular weights against the provided ranges:\n    *   A) 160-180\n    *   B) 220-240\n    *   C) 140-160\n    *   D) 110-130\n\n    The molecular weight of AsF5 (169.9 g/mol) falls directly into the range of 160-180. The reaction KrF2 + AsF5 → [KrF]+[AsF6]− is a known reaction in noble gas chemistry.\n\nTherefore, the substance A4 is Arsenic pentafluoride (AsF5), and its molecular weight is within the 160-180 range.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis is a complex problem with several clues that appear contradictory under standard chemical knowledge. A step-by-step analysis is required to identify the most plausible answer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the mass percentage of fluorine (F) in compound A2.**\n    The mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in A2 is given as 31.96%. The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F), where M_Y is the molecular weight of element Y, M_F is the molecular weight of fluorine (~19 g/mol), and n is the number of fluorine atoms.\n    Rearranging the formula gives: M_Y ≈ 40.44 * n.\n    Testing integer values for 'n':\n    *   n=2: M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol (closest to Bromine, but its fluorides don't match).\n    *   n=3: M_Y ≈ 121.3 g/mol (very close to Antimony, Sb, M=121.76 g/mol). Checking the mass % of F in SbF3: (3 * 19) / (121.76 + 57) ≈ 31.88%. This is a very strong match.\n    *   n=6: M_Y ≈ 242.6 g/mol (very close to Plutonium, Pu, M≈244 g/mol). Checking the mass % of F in PuF6: (6 * 19) / (244 + 114) ≈ 31.84%. This is also a very strong match.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the candidates based on other clues.**\n    *   **Plutonium (Pu):** While the mass percentage for PuF6 fits well, several other clues create contradictions. Plutonium compounds in solution are colored, but the problem states A4 is in a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". Furthermore, none of the molecular weights of plutonium fluorides (PuF3, PuF4, PuF6) fit into the provided answer ranges.\n    *   **Antimony (Sb):** The mass percentage for SbF3 is an excellent fit. However, other clues are problematic. Antimony is only known to form two stable binary fluorides (SbF3 and SbF5), not five. The \"bright-red substance A1\" that decomposes to A2 (SbF3) would have to be SbF5, but SbF5 is a colorless liquid.\n    *   **Krypton (Kr):** This is another possibility. The mass percentage of fluorine in KrF2 is about 31.2% (using M_Kr ≈ 83.8 g/mol), which is a less accurate match than for Sb or Pu. However, let's examine the other clues.\n\n3.  **Re-evaluate the problem with Krypton (Y=Kr) as the element.**\n    This problem is known to be a flawed chemistry olympiad question, where Krypton is the intended answer despite several inaccuracies in the problem statement.\n    *   **A2 = KrF2**: We accept the slight discrepancy in the fluorine mass percentage.\n    *   **Five binary compounds**: This is a known error in the problem; only KrF2 is well-established.\n    *   **A1**: The \"bright-red substance\" A1 that decomposes into A2 (KrF2) and fluorine would be KrF4. This is another error, as KrF4 is not red and its existence is disputed.\n    *   **A3**: A3 is formed by fluorinating Krypton, so A3 is KrF2. KrF2 is a powerful fluorinating agent and can interact with Xenon. This fits.\n    *   **A4**: The crucial clue is that A4 is in a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". KrF2 is a colorless solid and can be dissolved. Therefore, it is plausible that **A4 is KrF2**. The subsequent reaction clue involving adding Krypton gas to this solution is nonsensical and likely another flaw in the problem design.\n\n4.  **Determine the molecular weight of A4.**\n    Assuming A4 is Krypton difluoride (KrF2), we calculate its molecular weight.\n    *   M(KrF2) = M(Kr) + 2 * M(F)\n    *   M(KrF2) ≈ 83.8 g/mol + 2 * 19.0 g/mol = 121.8 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Match the molecular weight to the given ranges.**\n    The calculated molecular weight of 121.8 g/mol falls within the range:\n    B) 110-130\n\nDespite the numerous inconsistencies in the problem description, identifying Krypton as the intended element Y and KrF2 as compound A4 provides a clear answer from the given options.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemistry problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the mass fraction of fluorine in A2.**\nThe problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine, with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ, where Mᵧ is the molar mass of Y and n is the number of fluorine atoms. The molar mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n\nThe formula for the mass fraction of fluorine is:\nɷF = (n × M_F) / (Mᵧ + n × M_F)\n0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (Mᵧ + n × 19.00)\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for Mᵧ:\nMᵧ = (n × 19.00 / 0.3196) - (n × 19.00)\nMᵧ = n × (59.449 - 19.00)\nMᵧ ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe can now test integer values for n to find a plausible element Y:\n*   n=1: Mᵧ ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Ca, Ar, K - unlikely to form five binary fluorides).\n*   n=2: Mᵧ ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Br, Se - let's check BrF₂. M(BrF₂) = 79.9 + 38 = 117.9. ɷF = 38/117.9 = 32.2%. This is a possibility. However, BrF₂ is a radical). Let's check KrF₂. M(Kr) = 83.8 g/mol. M(KrF₂) = 83.8 + 38 = 121.8. ɷF = 38/121.8 = 31.2%. This is also a possibility.\n*   n=3: Mᵧ ≈ 121.35 g/mol (close to Sb). Let's check SbF₃. M(Sb) = 121.76 g/mol. M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 57 = 178.76. ɷF = 57/178.76 = 31.88%. This is a very close match.\n*   n=4: Mᵧ ≈ 161.8 g/mol (close to Tb, Dy - unlikely).\n*   n=5: Mᵧ ≈ 202.25 g/mol (close to Bi, Pb, Hg - let's check BiF₅. M(Bi)=209. ɷF = 95/(209+95) = 31.25%).\n*   n=6: Mᵧ ≈ 242.7 g/mol (close to Pu, Am). Let's check PuF₆. M(Pu)=244. ɷF = 114/(244+114) = 31.84%. This is also a very close match.\n\nThe best candidates for (Y, A2) based on mass fraction are (Sb, SbF₃), (Pu, PuF₆), and (Kr, KrF₂).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the chemical reactions to identify the correct element and compounds.**\n\nLet's analyze the given reactions for each candidate. The most restrictive clue is the 1:1 comproportionation reaction: Y + A4 → A5.\n\n*   **Case 1: Y = Antimony (Sb)**\n    *   A2 = SbF₃.\n    *   The decomposition A1 → A2 + F₂ implies A1 = SbF₅.\n    *   The comproportionation reaction would be Sb + A4 → A5. For this to be a comproportionation, A4 must be SbF₅. The known reaction is 2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃. The molar ratio of reactants is 2:3, not 1:1. This hypothesis fails.\n\n*   **Case 2: Y = Plutonium (Pu)**\n    *   The decomposition A1 → A2 + F₂ and the fact that PuF₆ is the highest known fluoride suggests a possible error in the problem statement. If we assume A1=PuF₆ decomposes to A2=PuF₄, the mass fraction of A2 is wrong. If we assume A2=PuF₆, then A1 is a hypothetical PuF₈.\n    *   Let's check the comproportionation. Known reactions are 2Pu + PuF₆ → 3PuF₄ and Pu + 3PuF₄ → 4PuF₃. Neither has a 1:1 molar ratio of reactants. This hypothesis fails.\n\n*   **Case 3: Y = Krypton (Kr)**\n    *   A2 = KrF₂ (ɷF = 31.2%, which is reasonably close to 31.96%).\n    *   The decomposition A1 → A2 + F₂ implies A1 = KrF₄. The reaction KrF₄ → KrF₂ + F₂ is known; KrF₄ is highly unstable. This fits.\n    *   A1 (KrF₄) is a powerful oxidizer and can oxidize xenon. This fits.\n    *   A3 is obtained by fluorination of Kr (Y). Kr + F₂ → KrF₂. So A3 = KrF₂. This fits.\n    *   Now, the key reaction: Y + A4 → A5 in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n        *   Let's test this: Kr + A4 → A5. For a comproportionation, A4 must be a higher fluoride. The only other known fluoride is KrF₄.\n        *   The reaction is: Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂.\n        *   This reaction proceeds with a 1:1 molar ratio of Krypton (Y) and Krypton tetrafluoride (A4). This is a perfect match for the description.\n    *   Therefore, we can identify A4 = KrF₄ and A5 = KrF₂.\n    *   The problem states A4 is in a \"colorless concentrated solution\". KrF₄ is a white solid, and its solution in a solvent like anhydrous HF would likely be colorless. This is plausible.\n    *   The final clue: A5 (KrF₂) decomposes in water. KrF₂ + H₂O → Kr + ½O₂ + 2HF. This produces two gaseous substances (Kr and O₂), fitting the description.\n\n**Step 3: Conclude and calculate the molecular weight of A4.**\n\nThe Krypton hypothesis is the only one that provides a consistent explanation for the chemical reactions described, especially the unique 1:1 comproportionation. The discrepancies in the problem (the \"five compounds\", the \"bright-red\" color of A1, and the slight error in mass fraction for A2) are likely errors or red herrings.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   Element Y is Krypton (Kr).\n*   Substance A4 is Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n\nNow, we calculate the molecular weight of A4 (KrF₄):\nM(KrF₄) = M(Kr) + 4 × M(F)\nM(KrF₄) ≈ 83.80 g/mol + 4 × 19.00 g/mol\nM(KrF₄) ≈ 83.80 + 76.00\nM(KrF₄) ≈ 159.80 g/mol\n\n**Step 4: Match the calculated molecular weight to the given ranges.**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 is 159.80 g/mol. We check which range this value falls into:\nA) 140-160\nB) 110-130\nC) 220-240\nD) 160-180\n\nThe value 159.80 is within the range of 140-160.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Substance A2:**\n    The problem states that substance A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine, with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. The general formula for A2 is YF_n.\n\n    The mass percentage of fluorine is given by the formula:\n    ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n\n    Using the approximate atomic mass of fluorine M(F) ≈ 19 g/mol:\n    0.3196 = (19n) / (M(Y) + 19n)\n    Solving for M(Y), we get:\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\n    We can test integer values for 'n' to find a plausible atomic mass for element Y:\n    *   If n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium)\n    *   If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Bromine/Selenium)\n    *   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (very close to Antimony, Sb, with M ≈ 121.76 g/mol)\n    *   If n=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (close to Dysprosium)\n\n    Let's verify the fluorine percentage for Antimony(III) fluoride, SbF₃:\n    M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 × 18.998 = 178.754 g/mol.\n    ɷF = (3 × 18.998) / 178.754 ≈ 0.3188, or 31.89%.\n    This value is extremely close to the given 31.96%, making it highly probable that **Y is Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n2.  **Identify Substances A1 and A3:**\n    *   Substance A1 decomposes into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine (F₂). This means A1 must have a higher oxidation state than Sb(III). The next stable fluoride is Antimony(V) fluoride, SbF₅. The reaction is SbF₅ → SbF₃ + F₂. Thus, **A1 is SbF₅**. The description of A1 as a \"bright-red\" substance that decomposes at room temperature (293 K) is unusual, as pure SbF₅ is a colorless liquid stable at that temperature, but we proceed with this identification based on the chemical reaction.\n    *   Substance A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y (Sb) and it oxidizes xenon. The direct fluorination of antimony yields SbF₃ or SbF₅, and SbF₅ is a powerful oxidizing agent known to react with xenon. Therefore, **A3 is also SbF₅**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substances A4 and A5:**\n    *   The problem describes the formation of A5 by adding element Y (Sb) to a solution of A4. The reaction is: Sb + A4 → A5.\n    *   This is a classic comproportionation reaction, where an element in its zero oxidation state reacts with a compound of the same element in a higher oxidation state to form a product with an intermediate oxidation state.\n    *   For this to occur, A4 must be the higher oxidation state compound, SbF₅, and the product A5 must be the lower oxidation state compound, SbF₃. The balanced reaction is 2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃.\n    *   So, we identify **A4 as SbF₅** and **A5 as SbF₃**.\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4 and Select the Range:**\n    *   The question asks for the range in which the molecular weight of substance **A4** falls.\n    *   Based on our deduction, A4 is Antimony Pentafluoride (SbF₅).\n    *   Let's calculate its molecular weight:\n        M(SbF₅) = M(Sb) + 5 × M(F) = 121.76 + 5 × 18.998 = **216.75 g/mol**.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Options:**\n    The given ranges are:\n    A) 140-160\n    B) 220-240\n    C) 110-130\n    D) 160-180\n\n    Our calculated molecular weight for A4 (216.75 g/mol) does not fall into any of the provided ranges. This indicates a likely flaw in the problem statement or the options. Let's re-evaluate:\n\n    *   The identification of Y=Sb and the compounds SbF₃ and SbF₅ is chemically very sound and consistent with most of the clues.\n    *   The molecular weight of A4 (SbF₅) is 216.75 g/mol.\n    *   The molecular weight of A2 and A5 (both SbF₃) is 178.76 g/mol. This value falls perfectly within range **D) 160-180**.\n\n    Given that one of the options must be correct, the most probable error in the question is asking for the molecular weight of A4 when it intended to ask for A2 or A5. Alternatively, the problem assumes a non-standard reaction where A4 is SbF₃. In either of these likely error scenarios, the compound whose molecular weight lies within the options is SbF₃.\n\n    Assuming the question intended to point to the molecular weight of SbF₃:\n    MW(SbF₃) = 178.76 g/mol.\n    This value is in the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the mass fraction of Fluorine in A2.**\n\nThe problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with a formula YFₙ. The mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) in A2 is 31.96% (or 0.3196).\n\nThe formula for mass fraction is:\nɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\nWhere:\n*   M(F) is the molar mass of Fluorine (≈ 19.00 g/mol).\n*   M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n*   n is the number of fluorine atoms in the molecule.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for M(Y):\nM(Y) = n * [M(F) / ɷF - M(F)]\nM(Y) = n * [19.00 / 0.3196 - 19.00]\nM(Y) ≈ n * [59.45 - 19.00]\nM(Y) ≈ n * 40.45\n\nWe need to find an integer `n` that results in a realistic atomic mass for an element Y. Let's test integer values for `n`:\n*   n = 1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (closest is Ca, but its chemistry doesn't fit).\n*   n = 2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (closest is Br, but it only forms 3 binary fluorides).\n*   n = 3: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol (closest is Sb, but it only forms 2 binary fluorides).\n*   n = 4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (closest is Dy, doesn't fit chemistry).\n*   n = 5: M(Y) ≈ 202.3 g/mol (no element fits well with the other clues).\n*   n = 6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This value is in the range of the actinide elements.\n\nLet's check the actinides around this mass:\n*   Plutonium (Pu), M ≈ 244 g/mol\n*   Americium (Am), M ≈ 243 g/mol\n\nLet's calculate the theoretical ɷF for PuF₆ and AmF₆ to see which is a better match for the given 31.96%.\n*   For PuF₆: M(PuF₆) = 244 + 6 * 19 = 358 g/mol. ɷF = (6 * 19) / 358 = 114 / 358 ≈ 0.3184 (31.84%).\n*   For AmF₆: M(AmF₆) = 243 + 6 * 19 = 357 g/mol. ɷF = (6 * 19) / 357 = 114 / 357 ≈ 0.3193 (31.93%).\n\nThe mass fraction for AmF₆ (31.93%) is an excellent match for the given value of 31.96%. Therefore, it is highly probable that **Y is Americium (Am)** and **A2 is AmF₆**.\n\n**Step 2: Verify the other clues with Y = Americium.**\n\n*   **\"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"** Americium is known to form five binary fluorides: AmF₂, AmF₃, AmF₄, AmF₅, and AmF₆. This fits perfectly.\n*   **\"A1 is a bright-red substance.\"**\n*   **\"A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (AmF₆) and fluorine.\"** This implies the reaction: A1 → AmF₆ + F₂. For this to be balanced, A1 must be a higher fluoride of americium (e.g., AmF₇ or AmF₈). While these are not listed as stable compounds, the problem describes A1 as unstable at 293 K (20 °C). It's plausible that a highly unstable, higher fluoride exists and decomposes as described.\n*   **\"A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\"** and **\"A3 can also interact with xenon.\"** Higher fluorides of actinides are extremely powerful oxidizing agents, capable of oxidizing xenon. This is consistent with A1 being a higher fluoride (like AmF₇) and A3 being another high-oxidation-state fluoride (like AmF₅ or AmF₄).\n*   **\"A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine.\"** This is a standard method for producing metal fluorides. For example: Am + 2F₂ → AmF₄. So, A3 could be AmF₄ or AmF₅.\n*   **\"By adding Y (Am) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"** This describes a comproportionation reaction, where an element in its elemental state (oxidation state 0) reacts with a compound of the same element in a higher oxidation state to form a compound with an intermediate oxidation state. The reaction is: Am(0) + A4 → A5.\n*   **\"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\"** This is characteristic of compounds with an element in an unstable intermediate oxidation state, which would disproportionate in water.\n\n**Step 3: Identify A4 and A5.**\n\nThe reaction is: Am + A4 → A5 (1:1 molar ratio).\nLet A4 = AmFₙ. The reaction is: Am + AmFₙ → 2AmFₙ/₂.\nFor the product A5 (AmFₙ/₂) to be a stable binary fluoride of americium, n/2 must be an integer. This means n must be an even integer.\n\nThe possible binary fluorides of Americium are AmF₂, AmF₃, AmF₄, AmF₅, AmF₆.\nThe possible candidates for A4 (AmFₙ) with an even `n` are AmF₂, AmF₄, and AmF₆.\n\nLet's test these possibilities:\n*   If A4 = AmF₂ (n=2): Am + AmF₂ → 2AmF. AmF is not one of the known stable fluorides.\n*   If A4 = AmF₄ (n=4): Am + AmF₄ → 2AmF₂. A5 would be AmF₂. This is a known, stable fluoride of americium.\n*   If A4 = AmF₆ (n=6): Am + AmF₆ → 2AmF₃. A5 would be AmF₃. This is also a known, stable fluoride.\n\nWe have two possibilities for the (A4, A5) pair: (AmF₄, AmF₂) or (AmF₆, AmF₃).\n\nThe clue \"A5 decomposes in water with the formation of two substances\" helps us distinguish. This suggests A5 is unstable in water and disproportionates.\n*   AmF₃ is the most stable fluoride of americium and is stable in water.\n*   AmF₂ contains Am in the +2 oxidation state, which is unstable in aqueous solution and would disproportionate into Am(0) and Am(III). The reaction is: 3Am²⁺(aq) → Am(s) + 2Am³⁺(aq). This fits the description.\n\nTherefore, A5 must be AmF₂, and A4 must be AmF₄.\n\nThe reaction is:\nAm + AmF₄ → 2AmF₂\n(Y) + (A4) → (A5)\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the molecular weight of A4.**\n\nWe have identified A4 as Americium(IV) fluoride, AmF₄.\nLet's calculate its molecular weight.\n*   Molar mass of Americium (Am) ≈ 243 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19 g/mol.\n\nMolecular Weight (M) of AmF₄ = M(Am) + 4 * M(F)\nM(AmF₄) = 243 + 4 * 19\nM(AmF₄) = 243 + 76\nM(AmF₄) = 319 g/mol\n\nThis value does not fall into any of the given ranges. Let's re-examine the problem. There might be a misunderstanding of the reaction to form A5.\n\nLet's reconsider the reaction: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nThe reaction is Am + A4 -> A5. This implies the coefficients are 1:1:1, not 1:1:2 as in the comproportionation assumption.\nIf the stoichiometry is 1:1:1, then A5 must be an adduct or a cluster.\nAm + AmFₙ → Am₂(Fₙ). This is not a simple binary compound.\n\nLet's re-read the question carefully. It's a Russian chemistry olympiad problem, which are known for being tricky. Let's reconsider the element. What if it's not an actinide? What if it's Krypton (Kr)?\n*   Y = Kr. M(Kr) = 83.8 g/mol.\n*   Let's check the mass fraction. M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n. 83.8 ≈ 40.45 * n -> n ≈ 2.07.\n*   So A2 could be KrF₂. Let's check ɷF in KrF₂. M(KrF₂) = 83.8 + 2*19 = 121.8. ɷF = 38 / 121.8 = 0.312. This is close to 31.96%.\n*   Known binary fluorides of Kr: KrF₂, KrF₄ (unstable). Not five.\n*   A1 -> KrF₂ + F₂. This would mean A1 is KrF₄. KrF₄ is colorless, not red. This hypothesis fails.\n\nLet's return to the most plausible hypothesis: Y=Am, A2=AmF₆, A4=AmF₄, A5=AmF₂. The calculated molecular weight of A4 (AmF₄) is 319 g/mol. This is not an option. There must be an error in my reasoning or the problem statement/options.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the comproportionation reaction.\nAm + AmF₆ → 2AmF₃. (A4=AmF₆, A5=AmF₃). AmF₃ is stable in water. This contradicts the clue about A5.\nAm + AmF₄ → 2AmF₂. (A4=AmF₄, A5=AmF₂). AmF₂ disproportionates in water. This fits.\nAm + 2AmF₃ → 3AmF₂. (A4=AmF₃). This is not a 1:1 reaction.\n\nLet's assume the logic (Y=Am, A4=AmF₄) is correct and re-calculate the mass of AmF₄ with more precise atomic weights.\nM(Am-243) = 243.06 g/mol\nM(F) = 18.998 g/mol\nM(AmF₄) = 243.06 + 4 * 18.998 = 243.06 + 75.992 = 319.052 g/mol. Still ~319.\n\nLet's reconsider the element. What if the mass fraction calculation led us astray?\nLet's look at the reaction: Y + A4 -> A5 (1:1 molar ratio).\nAnd A5 decomposes in water.\nThis strongly suggests a comproportionation where the product has an unstable oxidation state.\nY(0) + Y(+n) -> Y(+m)\nExample: I₂ + I₂O₅ -> not a binary fluoride.\nExample: P₄ + PCl₅ -> does not fit.\n\nLet's assume there is a mistake in the problem and the element is **Uranium (U)**.\n*   Five binary fluorides: UF₃, UF₄, U₂F₉, UF₅, UF₆. This fits.\n*   A2 has ɷF = 31.96%. For UF₆, ɷF = 32.38%. It's a bit off, but let's proceed. A2 = UF₆.\n*   Comproportionation: U + A4 -> A5.\n*   Possible reactions:\n    *   U + UF₄ -> 2UF₂ (UF₂ is not a known stable fluoride).\n    *   U + UF₆ -> 2UF₃ (A4=UF₆, A5=UF₃). UF₃ is stable in water.\n    *   U + 2UF₅ -> 3UF₃ (not 1:1).\n    *   U + 3UF₄ -> 4UF₃ (not 1:1).\n    *   U + 5UF₆ -> 6UF₅ (not 1:1).\nThe chemistry of Uranium doesn't seem to provide a better fit.\n\nLet's go back to the most consistent identification: **Y = Americium**.\nA1 = AmF₇(?) (red, unstable)\nA2 = AmF₆ (from mass fraction)\nA3 = AmF₄ or AmF₅ (oxidizes Xe)\nA4 = AmF₄\nA5 = AmF₂ (from comproportionation, unstable in water)\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 = AmF₄ is ~319 g/mol. This is not among the options.\nLet's review the entire chain of logic. Is it possible that A4 is not a binary fluoride? \"a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". This could imply A4 is dissolved in something. But the context suggests A4 is one of the Y-F compounds.\n\nLet's reconsider the reaction: Am + A4 -> A5 (1:1).\nWhat if A5 is not 2AmF₂? What if it's Am₂(Fₙ)?\nAm + AmF₄ -> Am₂F₄. This is not a known binary fluoride.\nAm + AmF₃ -> Am₂F₃. Not a known binary fluoride.\n\nThere seems to be a contradiction between the derived identity of A4 (AmF₄, MW=319) and the given options. Let's re-examine the identification of Y.\nWhat if the element is **Krypton (Kr)**?\nY = Kr, M=83.8. A2 = KrF₂ (ɷF=31.2%, close to 31.96%).\nA1 -> KrF₂ + F₂ => A1 = KrF₄.\nClues:\n- Five binary compounds: No, only KrF₂ and KrF₄. Fails.\n- A1 is red: No, KrF₄ is colorless. Fails.\n\nLet's assume the problem is about **Plutonium (Pu)**.\nY = Pu, M=244. A2 = PuF₆ (ɷF=31.84%, close to 31.96%).\nClues:\n- Five binary compounds: Maybe, if unstable ones are counted.\n- A1 is red: PuF₆ is reddish-brown. But A1 decomposes to A2=PuF₆. So A1 must be a higher fluoride. This is a problem.\n- Comproportionation: Pu + A4 -> A5.\n  - Pu + PuF₆ -> 2PuF₃ (A4=PuF₆, A5=PuF₃). PuF₃ is stable in water. Fails.\n  - Pu + PuF₄ -> 2PuF₂ (A4=PuF₄, A5=PuF₂). PuF₂ is not a well-characterized compound.\n\nThe Americium hypothesis (Y=Am) remains the most consistent with the majority of the chemical clues, despite the final molecular weight not matching the options. Let's re-read the question one more time.\n\"Indicate the range in which the molecular weight of the substance A4 falls.\"\nMaybe A4 is not AmF₄.\nReaction: Am + A4 -> A5 (1:1 molar ratio). A5 decomposes in water.\nThis means A5 has Am in an unstable oxidation state. Am(+2) is unstable. So A5=AmF₂.\nThe reaction producing it must be Am(0) + Am(+4) -> 2Am(+2).\nThis means A4 must contain Am(+4), so A4 = AmF₄. The logic seems sound.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that the question or options are flawed. If we are forced to choose, is there any other interpretation?\nWhat if A4 is A3? \"A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine.\" Let's say A3 = AmF₄.\n\"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nThis implies A4 is different from A3.\n\nWhat if the element is **Iodine (I)**?\n- Five binary fluorides: No, four (IF, IF₃, IF₅, IF₇).\n- M(I) = 126.9. M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n. 126.9 ≈ 40.45 * n -> n ≈ 3.1. So A2 could be IF₃.\n- ɷF in IF₃ = (3*19)/(126.9+57) = 57/183.9 = 0.310. Close-ish.\n- A1 -> IF₃ + F₂ => A1 = IF₅.\n- A1 is red: No, IF₅ is colorless. Fails.\n\nLet's trust the initial identification: Y=Am, A4=AmF₄, MW=319. Since this is not an option, let's reconsider the comproportionation.\nAm + A4 -> A5.\nWhat if A4 is AmF₆ and A5 is AmF₅?\nAm + AmF₆ -> 2AmF₃.5? No.\nWhat if the reaction is a reduction? Am + 2AmF₃ -> 3AmF₂. Not 1:1.\nWhat if the reaction is Am + AmF₄ -> 2AmF₂? This is the most chemically sound interpretation that fits the clues.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in the question and Y is **Uranium**.\nA4 would be UF₄. MW(UF₄) = 238 + 4*19 = 238 + 76 = 314 g/mol. Still not in the options.\nOr A4 could be UF₆. MW(UF₆) = 238 + 6*19 = 352 g/mol. Not in the options.\n\nLet's reconsider the mass calculation. M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n.\nWhat if n=4? M(Y) ≈ 161.8. Let's say Y=Tb (159). A2=TbF₄. ɷF = (4*19)/(159+76) = 76/235 = 0.323. Not a great match.\nWhat if n=3? M(Y) ≈ 121.4. Y=Sb (121.8). A2=SbF₃. ɷF = (3*19)/(121.8+57) = 57/178.8 = 0.3188. This is a very good match.\nLet's test Y=**Antimony (Sb)**.\n- Five binary fluorides: No, only SbF₃ and SbF₅. This is a major failure point. The problem explicitly states five are known.\n\nGiven the contradictions, the Americium identification is the most robust, fitting 4 out of 5 major points (5 fluorides, mass fraction, Xe oxidation, comproportionation/disproportionation). The only contradiction is the final MW of A4 vs the options. Let's assume there is a mistake in the problem's options and my derivation of A4=AmF₄ (MW=319) is correct. None of the options are near 319.\n\nLet's try one last time. What if A4 is A2? A4 = AmF₆.\nMW(AmF₆) = 243 + 6*19 = 357 g/mol. Not in the options.\nWhat if A4 is A3? Let's say A3 = AmF₅.\nMW(AmF₅) = 243 + 5*19 = 243 + 95 = 338 g/mol. Not in the options.\n\nThere seems to be a fundamental inconsistency in the problem statement as written versus the options provided. However, in multiple-choice questions of this nature, sometimes an error exists and one must find the \"intended\" answer. Let's reconsider the reaction Y + A4 -> A5. What if A4 is not a fluoride but an oxide fluoride? The problem says \"Five binary compounds... are known\", but doesn't explicitly state A4 is one of them. But it's heavily implied.\n\nLet's assume the element is **Rhenium (Re)**. M=186.2.\nReF₄, ReF₅, ReF₆, ReF₇. Four fluorides.\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n. 186.2 ≈ 40.45 * n -> n=4.6. Maybe A2=ReF₅?\nɷF in ReF₅ = (5*19)/(186.2+95) = 95/281.2 = 0.338. Too far.\n\nLet's go back to Y=Am, A4=AmF₄, MW=319. This result is derived consistently. The options are A) 140-160, B) 220-240, C) 110-130, D) 160-180. My result is nowhere near these. This implies my identification of Y or A4 is wrong.\n\nLet's reconsider Y=Sb, A2=SbF₃. ɷF=31.88% (very close). The only issue is the \"five fluorides\". If we ignore that one clue, let's see if the rest works.\nY=Sb. A2=SbF₃.\nA1 -> SbF₃ + F₂ => A1=SbF₅.\nA1 is red: No, SbF₅ is a colorless liquid. Fails.\n\nLet's reconsider Y=Kr, A2=KrF₂. ɷF=31.2%.\nA1 -> KrF₂ + F₂ => A1=KrF₄.\nA1 is red: No. Fails.\n\nThe Americium hypothesis is the only one that doesn't fail on a simple physical property (color) or the number of compounds. The MW of A4=AmF₄ is 319. The MW of A5=AmF₂ is 281. The MW of A2=AmF₆ is 357. The MW of A3=AmF₅ is 338. None of these fit the options.\n\nThere must be a mistake in the problem's premise or options. However, if a choice must be made, let's search for the source of this problem. It appears to be from a Russian chemistry competition. In some versions of this problem, the element is **Krypton (Kr)**. Let's force that solution.\nY = Kr. A2 = KrF₂. A1 = KrF₄.\nA3 interacts with Xe. KrF₂ is a strong enough oxidizer. A3=KrF₂.\nReaction: Kr + A4 -> A5.\nA4 must be KrF₂. Reaction: Kr + KrF₂ -> 2KrF (unstable radical).\nThis doesn't work well.\n\nLet's reconsider the mass fraction. 31.96%.\nLet's try Y=Br, n=2. M(Y)=80.9. A2=BrF₂. This is a radical.\nLet's assume the problem is flawed and the element is Iodine. Y=I, A2=IF₃. ɷF=31.0%.\nA1=IF₅. A3=IF₇ (interacts with Xe).\nReaction: I₂ + A4 -> A5.\nIf A4=IF₅, I₂ + 2IF₅ -> no simple product.\nIf A4=IF₇, 3I₂ + 2IF₇ -> no simple product.\n\nLet's go back to the most likely chemical scenario: Y=Am, A4=AmF₄, MW=319. The options are wrong. If I have to guess which option might be correct due to some unknown interpretation, it's impossible.\nHowever, let's try to work backwards from the options.\nLet's assume MW(A4) is in range D) 160-180. Let A4=YFₙ.\n160 < M(Y) + 19n < 180.\nIf n=1, 141 < M(Y) < 161. (e.g. Gd, Tb, Dy).\nIf n=2, 122 < M(Y) < 142. (e.g. Sb, Te, I, Xe, Cs, Ba, La, Ce).\nIf n=3, 103 < M(Y) < 123. (e.g. Rh, Pd, Ag, Cd, In, Sn, Sb).\nIf n=4, 84 < M(Y) < 104. (e.g. Kr, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh).\nIf n=5, 65 < M(Y) < 85. (e.g. Zn, Ga, Ge, As, Se, Br, Kr).\nIf we take n=5 and Y=Br (M=80), A4=BrF₅. MW = 80 + 5*19 = 175. This falls in range D.\nLet's test Y=Bromine.\n- Five binary fluorides: No, only BrF, BrF₃, BrF₅. Fails.\n- A2 has ɷF=31.96%. M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n. 80 ≈ 40.45 * n -> n=2. A2=BrF₂. This is a radical, but let's accept it.\n- A1 -> BrF₂ + F₂ => A1=BrF₄ (cation BrF₄⁺ exists).\n- A1 is red: No info.\n- A4 = BrF₅.\n- Reaction: Br₂ + BrF₅ -> no simple 1:1 reaction to give a known A5. Fails.\n\nThe problem is highly likely flawed, either in the text or the options. But the identification of Y=Am is the most chemically sound starting point. Since the result MW=319 is not an option, and no other element provides a consistent story, a definitive answer cannot be reached. However, if forced to choose, there may be a typo in the mass fraction that points to another element. For example, if Y=Br and A2=BrF, ɷF=19/(80+19)=19.2%. If A2=BrF₃, ɷF=57/137=41.6%. If A2=BrF₅, ɷF=95/175=54%. None match.\n\nGiven the severe inconsistencies, I cannot logically derive any of the provided answers. There is no clear path to any of the ranges A, B, C, or D. The most logical derivation leads to a result outside all ranges.\n\nFinal re-evaluation: Let's assume the element is Krypton, as some online sources suggest for this problem. Y=Kr. A4=KrF₂. MW(KrF₂) = 83.8 + 2*19 = 121.8 g/mol. This falls in range C. Let's check consistency.\n- Y=Kr.\n- Five fluorides? No.\n- A2 has ɷF=31.96%. For KrF₂, ɷF=31.2%. It's a plausible match. A2=KrF₂.\n- A1 is red? No, KrF₄ is colorless. This is a hard contradiction.\n- A3 interacts with Xe? Yes, KrF₂ oxidizes Xe. A3=KrF₂.\n- Reaction: Kr + A4 -> A5. If A4=KrF₂, Kr + KrF₂ -> 2KrF. A5=KrF.\n- A5 decomposes in water? KrF would.\nThis path is inconsistent on two major points (number of fluorides, color of A1). But it leads to an answer in the options. This suggests the problem is flawed and intends for Y=Kr.\n\nLet's assume Y=Kr and A4=KrF₂.\nMW(A4) = MW(KrF₂) = 83.8 + 2 * 18.998 = 121.796 g/mol.\nThis value falls within the range 110-130.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y**\n\nThe problem states that substance A2 contains 31.96% fluorine by mass (ɷF = 0.3196). Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ, where Y is the unknown element, Mᵧ is its molar mass, n is the number of fluorine atoms, and M_F is the molar mass of fluorine (≈ 18.998 g/mol).\n\nThe mass fraction of fluorine is given by the formula:\nɷF = (n × M_F) / (Mᵧ + n × M_F)\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the molar mass of Y (Mᵧ):\nMᵧ = (n × M_F / ɷF) - (n × M_F)\nMᵧ = n × M_F × (1/ɷF - 1)\nMᵧ = n × 18.998 × (1/0.3196 - 1)\nMᵧ = n × 18.998 × (3.1289 - 1)\nMᵧ = n × 18.998 × 2.1289\nMᵧ ≈ 40.445 × n\n\nNow, we test small integer values for 'n' to find an element with a matching molar mass:\n*   If n = 1, Mᵧ ≈ 40.4 g/mol. This is close to Calcium (Ca, 40.08 g/mol). However, calcium fluorides are not strong enough oxidizers to react with xenon.\n*   If n = 2, Mᵧ ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Bromine (Br, 79.90 g/mol).\n*   If n = 3, Mᵧ ≈ 121.3 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Antimony (Sb, 121.76 g/mol).\n*   If n = 4, Mᵧ ≈ 161.8 g/mol. No element fits well.\n*   If n = 5, Mᵧ ≈ 202.2 g/mol. This is close to Gold (Au, 197.0 g/mol).\n\nThe code execution output confirms that Antimony (Sb) with n=3 provides the best fit for the given mass fraction.\nTherefore, element **Y is Antimony (Sb)**, and substance **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Other Substances**\n\n*   **Y = Sb**\n*   **A2 = SbF₃**\n*   **A3** is obtained by fluorinating element Y (Sb). The direct fluorination of antimony metal produces antimony trifluoride (SbF₃) first, and with excess fluorine, it produces antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅). Since A2 is already SbF₃, A3 is the higher fluoride, **SbF₅**.\n*   **A3 interacts with xenon**: SbF₅ is an extremely powerful Lewis acid and oxidizing agent, known to react with xenon and its compounds (e.g., 2SbF₅ + XeF₂ → [XeF]⁺[Sb₂F₁₁]⁻). This confirms that **A3 is SbF₅**.\n*   **A1**: A1 decomposes into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine. This implies A1 is a higher fluoride of antimony. The description of A1 as a \"bright-red substance\" that \"decomposes at 293 K\" does not match the properties of the common SbF₅ (a colorless liquid, stable at 293 K). However, the identity of A1 is not required to find A4.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction to Identify A4**\n\nThe key information is the reaction: \"By adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n*   Reaction: **Sb + A4 → A5** (1:1 molar ratio)\n*   A4 is described as a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\".\n\nLet's consider the possibilities for A4. If A4 were a binary fluoride like SbF₅, the reaction would be Sb + SbF₅ → A5. This is a comproportionation reaction. The standard, balanced reaction is 2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃, which does not have a 1:1 molar ratio.\n\nA more plausible candidate for A4 arises from the properties of A3 (SbF₅). SbF₅ is a very strong Lewis acid that reacts with hydrofluoric acid (HF) to form fluoroantimonic acid, HSbF₆, one of the strongest known superacids.\n*   Reaction to form the acid: **SbF₅ + HF → HSbF₆**\n\nFluoroantimonic acid (HSbF₆) perfectly fits the description of A4:\n1.  It is typically handled as a **solution** (often in excess HF).\n2.  It is **colorless**.\n3.  It is directly related to the antimony fluorides we have identified.\n\nLet's assume **A4 is HSbF₆**.\n*   The reaction becomes **Sb + HSbF₆ → A5** (1:1 ratio). While the exact product A5 is complex (likely a polyatomic cation salt), such a reaction is plausible in superacid chemistry.\n*   The final clue is that \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\" Fluoroantimonic acid and its salts hydrolyze (react vigorously) with water. This is consistent.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nBased on the reasoning, A4 is fluoroantimonic acid, HSbF₆.\nWe calculate its molecular weight using the molar masses of its constituent elements:\n*   M(H) ≈ 1.008 g/mol\n*   M(Sb) ≈ 121.76 g/mol\n*   M(F) ≈ 18.998 g/mol\n\nMW(HSbF₆) = M(H) + M(Sb) + 6 × M(F)\nMW(HSbF₆) = 1.008 + 121.76 + 6 × 18.998\nMW(HSbF₆) = 1.008 + 121.76 + 113.988\nMW(HSbF₆) = **236.756 g/mol**\n\n**Step 5: Match the Molecular Weight to the Given Range**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 is approximately 236.8 g/mol. This value falls into the range:\nB) 220-240\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe problem contains several conflicting clues, which means we must identify the most reliable pieces of information to find the correct path.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y:** The most unique clue is that \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\" The provided information confirms that Rhenium (Re), Osmium (Os), Iridium (Ir), and Platinum (Pt) fit this description.\n\n2.  **Match Mass Percentage for A2:** We are given that compound A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. We can test the fluorides of our candidate elements to find the best match.\n    *   Let's test the fluorides of Platinum (Pt, M ≈ 195.08 g/mol):\n        *   PtF4: ɷF = (4 * 19.0) / (195.08 + 4 * 19.0) = 76 / 271.08 ≈ 28.0%\n        *   **PtF5: ɷF = (5 * 19.0) / (195.08 + 5 * 19.0) = 95 / 290.08 ≈ 32.7%**\n        *   PtF6: ɷF = (6 * 19.0) / (195.08 + 6 * 19.0) = 114 / 309.08 ≈ 36.9%\n    *   PtF5 provides the closest match to the given 31.96%. Therefore, it is highly likely that **Y = Platinum (Pt)** and **A2 = PtF5**.\n\n3.  **Identify A4:** The other clues (about the red substance A1, the reaction with Xenon, and the 1:1 molar ratio) are inconsistent with each other and with known platinum chemistry. For example, the most plausible reaction `Pt + PtF6 -> 2PtF4` does not have a 1:1 ratio. In such a situation, the best strategy is to assume the core identification (Y=Pt) is correct and see which of its binary fluorides fits the molecular weight ranges given in the options.\n\n4.  **Calculate Molecular Weights of Platinum Fluorides:**\n    *   MW(PtF6) = 195.08 + 6 * 19.00 = 309.08 g/mol\n    *   MW(PtF5) = 195.08 + 5 * 19.00 = 290.08 g/mol\n    *   MW(PtF4) = 195.08 + 4 * 19.00 = 271.08 g/mol\n    *   **MW(PtF2) = 195.08 + 2 * 19.00 = 233.08 g/mol**\n\n5.  **Select the Correct Range:** Comparing these molecular weights to the options:\n    *   A) 110-130\n    *   B) 160-180\n    *   **C) 220-240** (The molecular weight of PtF2, 233.08 g/mol, falls in this range)\n    *   D) 140-160\n\nThe only platinum fluoride whose molecular weight falls into one of the given ranges is PtF2. Therefore, we can conclude that A4 is PtF2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe problem describes five binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y. Based on the chemical properties described, particularly the ability of compounds A1 and A3 to oxidize xenon, the element Y is identified as Gold (Au). Gold forms several binary fluorides and its higher valence fluorides are extremely powerful oxidizing agents.\n\nHere is the identification of each compound:\n\n*   **Element Y:** Gold (Au).\n*   **A1 (AuF₇ or more accurately AuF₅·F₂):** This compound is described as a bright-red substance that decomposes and oxidizes xenon. While early reports suggested AuF₇, later studies indicated it is more likely a complex, AuF₅·F₂. It is known to be highly reactive and decomposes. The description of \"bright-red\" is more closely associated with AuF₅, but the extreme oxidizing power points towards the highest oxidation state species.\n*   **A2 (AuF₅):** A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine. This points to A2 being AuF₅. Let's verify the mass percentage of fluorine (ωF) in AuF₅. The molar mass of AuF₅ is 196.97 g/mol + 5 * 19.00 g/mol = 291.97 g/mol. The mass percentage of fluorine is (5 * 19.00 / 291.97) * 100% ≈ 32.54%. This value is very close to the given 31.96%, confirming A2 is likely AuF₅. Gold(V) fluoride is a red solid.\n*   **A3 (AuF₅):** This compound also interacts with xenon and is formed by the direct fluorination of gold. Gold pentafluoride (AuF₅) is a powerful oxidizing agent and can be synthesized via fluorination pathways. It is known to react with xenon difluoride (XeF₂).\n*   **A4 (AuF₃):** Gold(III) fluoride, AuF₃, is an orange-yellow crystalline solid.\n*   **A5 (AuF):** The problem states that A5 is obtained by adding element Y (Au) to a solution of A4 (AuF₃) in a 1:1 molar ratio. This suggests a comproportionation reaction: 2AuF₃ + Au → 3AuF₂ (unstable) or more likely AuF₃ + 2Au → 3AuF. The formation of AuF is plausible in this context. AuF is a known binary compound of gold.\n*   **Hydrolysis of A5:** A5 (AuF) decomposes in water. This is consistent with the behavior of many gold compounds. The hydrolysis of AuF would likely lead to gold metal and an oxygenated gold species or hydrofluoric acid.\n\nThe question asks for the range in which the molecular weight of substance **A4** falls.\n\n*   **A4** is identified as Gold(III) fluoride (AuF₃).\n*   The atomic weight of Gold (Au) is approximately 196.97 g/mol.\n*   The atomic weight of Fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n*   The molecular weight of AuF₃ is 196.97 + 3 * 19.00 = 196.97 + 57.00 = 253.97 g/mol.\n\nThis calculated molecular weight does not fall into any of the provided ranges. Let's re-examine the premises.\n\nThere might be a misunderstanding of the reaction to form A5. Let's reconsider the compounds.\nWhat if Y is not Gold? Let's re-check the mass percentage calculation.\nAr(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n.\nIf n=4, Ar(Y) ≈ 161.8. This doesn't match a plausible element.\nIf n=5, Ar(Y) ≈ 202.25. This is close to Au (197.0) and Pt (195.1). The chemistry strongly points to one of these. The discrepancy between the calculated %F (32.54% for AuF₅) and the given value (31.96%) might be an error in the problem statement, but it's the closest fit.\n\nLet's assume the identification of the compounds is correct and there is an error in the question's options or my interpretation.\nA1 = AuF₇ (or AuF₅·F₂)\nA2 = AuF₅\nA3 = AuF₅\nA4 = AuF₃\nA5 = AuF\n\nMolecular weight of A4 (AuF₃) = 253.97 g/mol. None of the ranges match.\n\nLet's reconsider the assignment of the compounds.\nMaybe A4 is not AuF₃.\nThe reaction is: Y + A4 -> A5 (1:1 molar ratio).\nAu + A4 -> A5.\nIf A4 is AuF₅, then Au + AuF₅ -> ? This is not a standard, simple reaction.\nIf A4 is a different fluoride, how would it be identified? The problem gives little information on A4 directly, only its role in forming A5.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in the fluorine percentage for A2. The identification of Y as Gold seems the most chemically sound deduction due to the reaction with xenon. The existence of multiple binary fluorides also fits well.\n\nLet's re-read the problem carefully: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nThis is a synthesis description. Let's search for reactions of gold fluorides.\nA known reaction is the thermal decomposition of AuF₃: 2AuF₃ → AuF + AuF₅. This doesn't fit the description.\nAnother is the comproportionation: AuF₃ + 2Au → 3AuF. This is a 1:2 ratio, not 1:1.\n\nWhat if the element is Platinum (Pt)?\nPt also forms multiple fluorides (PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, PtF₆). PtF₆ is famous for oxidizing xenon.\nLet's check the fluorine percentage for PtF₅. M(PtF₅) = 195.08 + 5*19 = 290.08. %F = (95/290.08)*100 = 32.75%. This is also close to 31.96%.\nLet's check PtF₄. M(PtF₄) = 195.08 + 4*19 = 271.08. %F = (76/271.08)*100 = 28.04%.\nThe value 31.96% fits PtF₅ or AuF₅ reasonably well.\n\nLet's assume Y=Pt.\nA1 = PtF₆ (decomposes to PtF₅ + F)\nA2 = PtF₅ (%F = 32.75%, close to 31.96%)\nA3 = PtF₆ (oxidizes xenon, formed by fluorination of Pt)\nReaction: Pt + A4 -> A5 (1:1 ratio)\nKnown Pt fluorides are PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, PtF₆.\nIf A4 = PtF₄, then Pt + PtF₄ -> 2PtF₂. This is a 1:1 reaction.\nSo, A4 could be PtF₄ and A5 could be PtF₂.\nLet's check the molecular weight of A4 = PtF₄.\nMW(PtF₄) = 195.08 + 4 * 19.00 = 195.08 + 76 = 271.08 g/mol.\nThis value does not fit any of the ranges.\n\nLet's go back to Y=Au. The %F for AuF₅ (32.54%) is closer to the given value (31.96%) than PtF₅ (32.75%) is.\nA1: AuF₇ (or complex)\nA2: AuF₅\nA3: AuF₅\nA4: ?\nA5: ?\nReaction: Au + A4 -> A5 (1:1)\nThe known binary fluorides of gold are AuF, AuF₃, AuF₅. A theoretical AuF₆ has also been discussed.\nIf A4 is a complex fluoride, the problem becomes much harder. The problem states \"binary compounds of fluorine\".\nLet's reconsider the reaction AuF₃ + 2Au → 3AuF. The stoichiometry is 1:2.\nWhat if the \"solution of A4\" is key? Perhaps A4 is not the fluoride itself but a complex in solution. However, the problem refers to \"five binary compounds\".\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in the reaction ratio and it is indeed the comproportionation of Au and AuF₃.\nIf A4 = AuF₃, its molecular weight is ~254 g/mol. This is not in the options.\nIf A5 = AuF₃, then Au + A4 -> AuF₃. A4 would have to be something like AuF₅. Then Au + AuF₅ -> ? Not a simple 1:1 to get AuF₃.\n\nLet's reconsider the initial calculation.\nAr(Y) = 40.4493 * n\nIf n=4, Ar(Y) = 161.79. This is very close to Terbium (Tb, 162.5) or Dysprosium (Dy, 162.5). However, their fluorides (like TbF₆ or DyF₆) are not known to be bright red and oxidize xenon. Their stable oxidation state is +3.\nIf n=3, Ar(Y) = 121.35. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, 121.76). SbF₅ is a powerful Lewis acid and fluorinating agent, but it does not oxidize xenon under normal conditions.\nThe xenon oxidation is the strongest clue, pointing towards Pt, Au, or maybe Ru or Rh.\n\nLet's stick with Gold (Au) as the most plausible candidate and assume there is an error in the provided options or the reaction stoichiometry.\nA1: AuF₇ (complex)\nA2: AuF₅ (MW=292, %F=32.5%)\nA3: AuF₅\nA4: AuF₃ (MW=254)\nA5: AuF (MW=216)\n\nNone of the molecular weights for the simple binary fluorides of gold fit the options directly.\nLet's look at the options again:\nA) 160-180\nB) 220-240\nC) 140-160\nD) 110-130\n\nWhat if A4 is a dimer or a complex? The problem says \"binary compounds\". Gold pentafluoride is dimeric in the solid state, Au₂F₁₀. Its monomeric formula is AuF₅.\nMW(Au₂F₁₀) = 583.9 g/mol.\nGold trifluoride, AuF₃, is polymeric.\n\nLet's reconsider the reaction: Y + A4 -> A5 (1:1).\nWhat if A4 is an adduct? For example, BrF₃·AuF₃ is known. But this is not a binary compound of Y and F.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in the question and A5 is the substance whose molecular weight is sought.\nMW(A5 = AuF) = 196.97 + 19.00 = 215.97 g/mol. This is also not in the ranges.\n\nLet's reconsider the reaction: Au + A4 -> A5 (1:1).\nWhat if A5 is a mixed-valence compound?\nWhat if A4 is not a simple fluoride? The problem says \"Five binary compounds... are known\". It doesn't say A1-A5 are all of them, or that they are all different. We have identified A2=A3=AuF₅. So we have AuF₇, AuF₅, AuF₃, AuF. That's four. What is the fifth? Maybe AuF₂ or a different one.\n\nLet's assume the answer lies in one of the options.\nIf MW(A4) is in range B) 220-240.\nThis doesn't match any simple AuF_n compound.\nAuF₂: MW = 197 + 38 = 235 g/mol. This falls in range B.\nIs AuF₂ a known binary compound? It is mentioned as an intermediate or in complexes, but its existence as a stable binary compound is less established than the others. However, let's test this hypothesis.\nIf A4 = AuF₂ (MW=235).\nReaction: Au + AuF₂ -> A5 (1:1). This would give \"Au₂F₂\" or 2AuF.\nSo, A5 = AuF. This is chemically plausible.\nLet's check the other clues.\nA1 decomposes to A2.\nA1 oxidizes Xe. -> A1 is a high-valent fluoride, e.g., AuF₅ or higher.\nA2 has %F = 31.96%. Let's check %F in AuF₂. (38/235)*100 = 16.17%. No.\nLet's check %F in AuF. (19/216)*100 = 8.8%. No.\nThe compound with %F=31.96% must be A2. And our calculation showed A2 is most likely AuF₅.\n\nSo we have:\nY = Au\nA2 = AuF₅\nA1 = A species that decomposes to AuF₅ (e.g., AuF₇ complex)\nA3 = AuF₅\nReaction: Au + A4 -> A5 (1:1)\nA5 decomposes in water.\n\nIf the reaction is Au + AuF₃ -> 2AuF, the molar ratio is 1:1 between Au and AuF₃ if we consider the product to be 2AuF. But the problem says a 1:1 molar ratio is *added*. This usually implies reactants.\nLet's assume the reaction is Au + A4 -> A5 and A4 = AuF₃. This is a 1:1 addition. What is A5? A5 would be Au₂F₃. Is this a known compound? It is not one of the commonly cited binary gold fluorides.\n\nThere seems to be an inconsistency in the problem statement's data (the %F, the reaction ratio, and the final options). However, the chemical properties strongly point to Gold. Let's re-evaluate the molecular weights and options.\nMW(AuF) = 216\nMW(AuF₂) = 235\nMW(AuF₃) = 254\nMW(AuF₅) = 292\n\nThe range B) 220-240 contains MW(AuF₂) = 235.\nIf we assume A4 is AuF₂, the reaction Au + AuF₂ -> 2AuF (1:1 reactant ratio) makes sense, and A5 is AuF.\nBut this contradicts the identification of A2 from the mass percentage.\n\nLet's assume the mass percentage refers to a different compound.\nIf A2 = AuF₃, %F = (57/254)*100 = 22.4%. No.\nIf A2 = AuF, %F = 8.8%. No.\n\nLet's trust the xenon oxidation and the mass percentage as the strongest clues.\nY = Au, A2 = AuF₅.\nThis means the other fluorides are AuF, AuF₃, and maybe AuF₂ and AuF₇.\nThe question asks for the MW of A4. The options are 110-130, 140-160, 160-180, 220-240.\nNone of the MWs (216, 235, 254, 292) fit except for 235 (AuF₂) which is in the 220-240 range.\nIf A4 is AuF₂, then the puzzle must fit together.\n- Five binary compounds: AuF, AuF₂, AuF₃, AuF₅, AuF₇(complex). This is plausible.\n- A1 (AuF₇) decomposes to A2 (?) and fluorine. If A2 is AuF₅, this works.\n- A2 has %F = 31.96%. This points to AuF₅.\n- A1 oxidizes xenon. AuF₇/AuF₅ do.\n- A3 (AuF₅) interacts with xenon.\n- Reaction: Au + A4(AuF₂) -> A5(2AuF) in a 1:1 ratio. This works.\n- A5 (AuF) decomposes in water. This is true.\n\nThe only contradiction is that A2 must be AuF₅ based on the mass percentage, but the decomposition of A1 (AuF₇) would be AuF₇ -> AuF₅ + F₂. The problem says A1 -> A2 + F₂. So A2 is AuF₅.\nThe entire logical chain seems to hold if we accept AuF₂ as one of the five binary compounds and that it is A4. The molecular weight of AuF₂ is ~235 g/mol, which falls in the range 220-240.\n\nFinal check:\n- Element Y: Gold (Au)\n- A1: AuF₇ (or AuF₅·F₂)\n- A2: AuF₅ (from decomposition of A1 and %F data)\n- A3: AuF₅ (interacts with Xe)\n- A4: AuF₂ (to fit the MW options and reaction stoichiometry)\n- A5: AuF (from reaction of Au + AuF₂)\n- The five compounds are AuF, AuF₂, AuF₃, AuF₅, AuF₇. This seems to be the intended set.\n- The molecular weight of A4 (AuF₂) is 196.97 + 2*19.00 = 234.97 g/mol.\n- This value falls within the range 220-240.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown element Y and its fluorine compounds.\n\n1.  **Identifying Element Y from Substance A2**:\n    We are given that the mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) in substance A2 is 31.96%. Let the formula for A2 be YFₙ, where Y is the unknown element and n is the number of fluorine atoms. The molar mass of Fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n\n    The mass fraction can be expressed as:\n    ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n\n    Rearranging the formula to solve for the molar mass of Y, M(Y):\n    M(Y) = (n × M(F) / ɷF) - (n × M(F))\n    M(Y) = (n × 19.00 / 0.3196) - (n × 19.00)\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\n    We can test integer values for n to find a plausible atomic mass for element Y:\n    *   If n = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (closest is Calcium, but its fluoride chemistry doesn't fit).\n    *   If n = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (closest is Bromine, but its fluorides don't match the mass fraction, or Krypton).\n    *   If n = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (very close to Antimony, Sb, with M = 121.76 g/mol).\n    *   If n = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (no common element fits well).\n\n    Let's test the most promising candidates:\n    *   **Antimony (Sb)**: If Y is Sb and A2 is SbF₃, the calculated ɷF = (3 × 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 × 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 31.88%. This is a very close match to the given 31.96%.\n    *   **Krypton (Kr)**: If Y is Kr (M = 83.8 g/mol) and A2 is KrF₂, the calculated ɷF = (2 × 19.00) / (83.8 + 2 × 19.00) = 38 / 121.8 ≈ 31.2%. This is reasonably close.\n\n2.  **Identifying Substance A1**:\n    The problem states that A1 is a **bright-red substance** that **decomposes at 293 K** (room temperature) into A2 and fluorine. A1 also oxidizes xenon. This indicates A1 is a highly unstable and powerful oxidizing agent with more fluorine than A2.\n\n    *   If we assume Y is Antimony (Sb), then A2 is SbF₃ and A1 must be SbF₅. However, SbF₅ is a colorless liquid and is stable at room temperature, which contradicts the description of A1.\n    *   If we assume Y is Krypton (Kr), then A2 is KrF₂. A1 would be KrF₄. The synthesis of Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄) has been claimed, and it is described as a highly unstable compound that decomposes to KrF₂ and F₂. While some sources describe it as a white solid, it is often associated with red-colored species in the context of such challenging chemistry problems, fitting the \"bright-red\" description due to its extreme instability. KrF₄ would be an exceptionally strong oxidizing agent, capable of reacting with xenon. This fits the description of A1 perfectly.\n\n3.  **Identifying Substances A3 and A4**:\n    *   A3 is obtained by the fluorination of element Y (Kr) and also interacts with xenon. The direct reaction of Krypton with Fluorine produces Krypton difluoride (KrF₂). KrF₂ is also a strong oxidizing agent that can react with xenon. Therefore, A3 is KrF₂.\n    *   A4 is described as being in a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". Since A1 (KrF₄) is red, it cannot be A4. The other known binary fluoride, KrF₂, is a colorless solid that can be dissolved to form a colorless solution. Therefore, A4 must be KrF₂.\n\n4.  **Determining the Molecular Weight of A4**:\n    Having identified A4 as Krypton difluoride (KrF₂), we can calculate its molecular weight.\n    *   Molar Mass of Krypton (Kr) ≈ 83.80 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 18.998 g/mol\n    *   Molecular Weight of A4 (KrF₂) = 83.80 + 2 × 18.998 = 121.796 g/mol.\n\n    This value falls within the range of 110-130 g/mol.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2:**\n    The problem states that compound A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ωF) of 31.96%. Let the formula for A2 be YFₙ, where Y is the unknown element, n is the number of fluorine atoms, M(Y) is the molar mass of Y, and M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (≈19.00 g/mol).\n\n    The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ωF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\n    Plugging in the given value:\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n\n    Rearranging to solve for M(Y):\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * (19.00 * n) = 19.00 * n\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 19.00 * n - 6.0724 * n\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276 * n\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    We can test integer values for n:\n    *   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (similar to Calcium, but its fluoride chemistry doesn't fit)\n    *   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (similar to Bromine, but its fluoride chemistry doesn't fit)\n    *   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (very close to Antimony, Sb, with M=121.76 g/mol)\n    *   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol\n    *   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol\n\n    Let's verify with Antimony (Sb) and n=3. The compound A2 would be SbF₃.\n    ωF(SbF₃) = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188, which is approximately 31.9%. This is a very strong match.\n\n2.  **Identify the Five Compounds:**\n    The problem states that five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y (Antimony) are known. Antimony is known to form several fluorides, including SbF₃ and SbF₅, as well as polymeric fluorides. The five known binary compounds are SbF₃, SbF₅, and the polymeric species (SbF₅)₂, (SbF₅)₃, and (SbF₅)₄.\n\n    *   **A2 is SbF₃.**\n\n3.  **Identify Compound A1:**\n    A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (20 °C) into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine. This implies A1 has a higher oxidation state than SbF₃. The reaction is: A1 → SbF₃ + F₂. This decomposition reaction is characteristic of Antimony(V) fluoride, SbF₅, which can be contaminated with SbF₃, leading to such a decomposition, although SbF₅ itself is a colorless liquid. The clue about A1 oxidizing xenon under normal conditions points to a very strong Lewis acid and fluorinating agent. Antimony pentafluoride, SbF₅, is one of the strongest known Lewis acids and can react with xenon. The \"bright-red\" color might be due to impurities or a specific polymeric form, but the chemical properties strongly point to the +5 oxidation state. Let's assume A1 is related to SbF₅.\n\n4.  **Identify Compound A3:**\n    A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y (Sb) with fluorine and can also interact with xenon. The direct fluorination of antimony yields antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅).\n    2Sb + 5F₂ → 2SbF₅\n    Therefore, **A3 is SbF₅**.\n\n5.  **Identify Compounds A4 and A5:**\n    The problem states that adding element Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4 yields A5. This suggests a comproportionation reaction where antimony in a zero oxidation state (Sb) reacts with antimony in a higher oxidation state (in A4) to form a compound with an intermediate oxidation state (A5).\n    The reaction is: Sb + A4 → A5.\n    Given that A2 is SbF₃ and A3 is SbF₅, it is logical that A4 and A5 are also antimony fluorides.\n    Let's test the reaction with A4 being SbF₅:\n    Sb + SbF₅ → A5\n    If this were a 1:1 reaction, the product would have an average oxidation state of +2.5.\n    However, a known reaction is the formation of SbF₃ from Sb and SbF₅:\n    2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃\n    This does not fit the 1:1 molar ratio described.\n\n    Let's reconsider the compounds. The five known binary compounds are SbF₃, SbF₅, and the polymers (SbF₅)₂, (SbF₅)₃, and (SbF₅)₄.\n    *   A1: A higher fluoride that decomposes to A2. Let's assign it as a form of SbF₅.\n    *   A2: SbF₃ (ωF ≈ 31.9%)\n    *   A3: SbF₅ (from direct fluorination of Sb)\n    *   This leaves the polymeric forms for A4 and A5. The polymers are essentially different structural arrangements of SbF₅ units.\n\n    Let's re-read the clue: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" This reaction might not be a redox reaction but an addition or structural change. If A4 is a monomeric or smaller polymeric form of SbF₅, adding Sb might catalyze its polymerization into a larger form, A5.\n    Let's assume A4 is the monomer, SbF₅.\n    *   **A4 = SbF₅**\n\n6.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4:**\n    If A4 is antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅), its molecular weight can be calculated:\n    M(A4) = M(Sb) + 5 * M(F)\n    M(A4) = 121.76 g/mol + 5 * 19.00 g/mol\n    M(A4) = 121.76 + 95.00\n    M(A4) = 216.76 g/mol\n\n7.  **Determine the Correct Range:**\n    The calculated molecular weight of A4 is 216.76 g/mol. We need to find the range in which this value falls.\n    A) 160-180\n    B) 220-240\n    C) 110-130\n    D) 140-160\n\n    The value 216.76 g/mol does not fall into any of the ranges. Let's re-examine the problem. There might be a misunderstanding of the compounds.\n\n    Let's reconsider the reaction: Y + A4 -> A5 (1:1 molar ratio).\n    What if A4 is SbF₃ and Y is Sb? This doesn't make sense.\n    What if the element is not Antimony? Let's re-check the mass calculation. M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n.\n    If n=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25. This is close to Gold (Au, 197.0) or Bismuth (Bi, 209.0).\n    *   Let's check BiF₅: ωF = (5 * 19) / (209 + 95) = 95 / 304 ≈ 31.25%. This is also close. Bismuth forms BiF₃ and BiF₅. BiF₅ is a powerful oxidizing agent.\n    *   Let's check AuF₅: ωF = (5 * 19) / (197 + 95) = 95 / 292 ≈ 32.5%. This is also close.\n\n    However, the match with Antimony (Sb) for n=3 (ωF = 31.88% vs 31.96%) is mathematically the closest. There might be a slight ambiguity in the problem's description of the reactions, but the identification of Y as Sb and A2 as SbF₃ is the most solid starting point.\n\n    Let's assume the identification of A3 as SbF₅ is correct (direct fluorination).\n    Let's assume A4 is SbF₃.\n    M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol. This falls in the range **160-180**.\n    Let's check if this fits the remaining clues.\n    *   A4 = SbF₃.\n    *   Reaction: Sb + SbF₃ (A4) -> A5 (1:1 ratio). This is chemically unlikely to produce a distinct binary compound A5.\n\n    Let's reconsider the initial assignment.\n    *   Y = Sb\n    *   A1 = A form of SbF₅ (perhaps polymeric or impure)\n    *   A2 = SbF₃\n    *   A3 = SbF₅\n    *   A4 = ?\n    *   A5 = ?\n\n    The clue \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\" is key. SbF₅ is a liquid that can act as a solvent. SbF₃ is a solid. It is more likely that A4 is the liquid SbF₅.\n    If A4 = SbF₅, M(A4) = 216.76 g/mol. This value is very close to range B) 220-240. It's possible there's a slight variation in molar masses used or the ranges are approximate. 216.76 is only 1.5% away from the lower bound of 220.\n\n    Let's assume A4 is the dimeric form, (SbF₅)₂.\n    M((SbF₅)₂) = 2 * 216.76 = 433.52 g/mol. This is too high.\n\n    Given the options, the most plausible scenario is:\n    1.  Y is Antimony (Sb).\n    2.  A2 is SbF₃.\n    3.  A3 and A4 are SbF₅. The description of A4 as a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\" fits well with liquid SbF₅ being used as a solvent for the reaction.\n    4.  The molecular weight of A4 (SbF₅) is 216.76 g/mol.\n    5.  This value is closest to the range [220-240]. The discrepancy could be due to rounding in the problem statement or the provided options. No other assignment of compounds yields a molecular weight that fits any of the other ranges. For instance, if A4 were SbF₃, its weight (178.76 g/mol) would fit in range A [160-180], but the chemistry described (using it as a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\") is less likely than for SbF₅. The strong oxidizing properties mentioned for A1 and A3 also point to SbF₅ being central to the problem.\n\nTherefore, based on the chemical properties and the closest numerical fit, A4 is SbF₅, and its molecular weight falls just outside but is best represented by the 220-240 range.\n\nFinal check:\n*   Y = Sb\n*   A1 -> A2(SbF₃) + F₂. (A1 is a higher fluoride, likely SbF₅).\n*   A1(SbF₅) oxidizes Xe. (Correct).\n*   A3(SbF₅) from Sb + F₂. (Correct).\n*   A3(SbF₅) interacts with Xe. (Correct).\n*   A4 = SbF₅. M.W. = 216.76 g/mol.\n*   The range is 220-240. This is the most plausible option.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe analysis was successful. The constraints provided by the quantitative data were prioritized to identify the correct substances, even in the presence of conflicting qualitative descriptions.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y:** The mass percentage of fluorine in A2 (31.96%) was used to calculate the relationship between the atomic mass of element Y (M_Y) and its oxidation state (n): M_Y ≈ 40.45 * n. Testing integer values for n, Antimony (Sb, M=121.76 g/mol) with n=3 was identified as a prime candidate.\n    *   For A2 = SbF3, the calculated mass percentage of F is (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 31.89%, which is an excellent match.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance A4:** Assuming Y is Sb, the common binary fluorides are SbF3 and SbF5. These are the candidates for A4.\n    *   Molecular Weight of SbF3 = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    *   Molecular Weight of SbF5 = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 216.76 g/mol.\n\n3.  **Apply Final Constraint:** The calculated molecular weights were compared against the given ranges.\n    *   The molecular weight of SbF3 (178.76 g/mol) falls within the range **C) 160-180**.\n    *   The molecular weight of SbF5 (216.76 g/mol) does not fit any of the provided ranges.\n\nThis confirms that substance A4 is SbF3, and its molecular weight is in the range of 160-180 g/mol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a self-debate to determine the molecular weight range of substance A4.\n\n**Proposer:** My initial goal is to identify element Y by using the mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in compound A2, which is 31.96%. The formula for mass percentage is ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F)), where n is the number of fluorine atoms, M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (~19 g/mol), and M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n\nBy rearranging the formula, I get M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n.\n\nI will now test integer values for 'n':\n*   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (similar to Calcium)\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (similar to Bromine)\n*   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (similar to Antimony)\n*   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (no stable element)\n*   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (near Gold, Mercury)\n\nThe most promising candidates are Bromine (Br) and Antimony (Sb). I will start by investigating Bromine.\n\nMy first action is to perform a search to verify the known binary fluorides of Bromine and Antimony and their properties to see how they match the clues.\n\n**Skeptic:** The search results provide good information. For Antimony (Y=Sb), the main fluorides are SbF₃ and SbF₅. The mass percentage of fluorine in SbF₃ is 31.88%, which is an excellent match for A2 (31.96%). However, the properties of A1 don't match. A1 is \"bright-red\" and decomposes at room temperature (293 K). If A1 is SbF₅, it is described as a colorless liquid and is relatively stable. This is a major contradiction.\n\nFor Bromine (Y=Br), the main fluorides are BrF, BrF₃, and BrF₅. The clue about \"five binary compounds\" is plausible if we include ions or radicals like BrF₂, BrF₄. If we test the stable fluorides for the mass percentage of A2 (31.96%), none are a good match. However, the radical BrF₂ would have a fluorine percentage of ~32.2%, which is a very close match. This path involves unstable species but seems numerically possible.\n\n**Proposer:** The Skeptic has raised valid points. The antimony hypothesis has a perfect numerical fit for A2 but fails on the qualitative description of A1. The bromine hypothesis requires considering A2 as a radical (BrF₂) to fit the numbers, which is unconventional but possible.\n\nLet's explore the bromine hypothesis further, as it might resolve all the clues. If Y=Br and A2=BrF₂, then A1 (which decomposes to A2+F₂) would be the BrF₄ radical. The reaction Y + A4 -> A5 becomes Br₂ + A4 -> A5. The other known fluorides are BrF, BrF₃, and BrF₅. A4 must be the oxidant, so it could be BrF₃ or BrF₅. Let's check their molecular weights against the options.\n*   M(BrF₃) ≈ 136.9 g/mol.\n*   M(BrF₅) ≈ 174.9 g/mol.\n\nThe range for option A is 160-180. The molecular weight of BrF₅ (174.9 g/mol) falls squarely in this range. This makes A4 = BrF₅ a very strong candidate.\n\nMy next action is to verify the remaining clues with this assignment.\n\n**Skeptic:** This path looks promising because it leads to one of the options. However, we are assuming A1 and A2 are radicals. We also need to check the final clue: \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\" If Y=Br, A4=BrF₅, the reaction is Br₂ + BrF₅ -> A5. This would be a comproportionation reaction, so A5 would likely be BrF₃. Does BrF₃ decompose in water to form two substances? The search results confirm this: BrF₃ reacts with water to form acids like HBrO₃ and HF. This fits. The main weaknesses are the radical nature of A1/A2 and the \"bright-red\" color, which is unknown for the BrF₄ radical.\n\n**Proposer:** The Bromine hypothesis (Y=Br) provides a consistent explanation for all the clues, assuming A2 is the BrF₂ radical.\n1.  **Y = Bromine (Br)**.\n2.  **A2 = BrF₂** (radical). Its calculated fluorine percentage (~32.2%) is very close to the given 31.96%.\n3.  **A1 = BrF₄** (radical). It decomposes to A2 (BrF₂) and fluorine. As a highly unstable radical, it would be a powerful oxidizing agent, capable of reacting with xenon. The \"bright-red\" color is the only unconfirmed property.\n4.  **A3** is a fluoride of bromine (e.g., BrF₃ or BrF₅), which are known strong fluorinating agents that can react with xenon.\n5.  **A4 = BrF₅**. Its molecular weight is ~174.9 g/mol, which fits the range 160-180.\n6.  **A5 = BrF₃**. It is obtained from the reaction of Br₂ (Y) and BrF₅ (A4). It decomposes in water to form two substances (e.g., bromic acid and hydrofluoric acid), which fits the final clue.\n\nThis path successfully identifies all compounds and leads to a molecular weight for A4 that matches one of the options.\n\n**Decision:** The next action is to finalize the answer based on this coherent hypothesis.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "This is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which appear to be contradictory or contain errors, a common feature in advanced chemistry problems. The most robust method to solve this is to prioritize the quantitative clues (mass percentage, reaction stoichiometry) and use the qualitative clues to select the most plausible candidate.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y from the Mass Percentage of A2**\n\nThe problem states that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ.\nThe molar mass of Y, M(Y), can be related to the number of fluorine atoms, n, by the formula:\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nLet's test integer values for n:\n*   n = 1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (e.g., Ca, Ar) - Unlikely chemistry.\n*   n = 2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (e.g., Br, Se, Kr) - Plausible.\n*   n = 3: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol (e.g., Sb) - Plausible.\n*   n = 4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (e.g., Dy) - Unlikely chemistry.\n*   n = 5: M(Y) ≈ 202.3 g/mol (e.g., Au, Pt, Bi) - Plausible.\n*   n = 6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (e.g., Pu, Am) - Plausible.\n\nThe strongest candidates based on their known fluoride chemistry (forming multiple binary compounds, high reactivity) are Krypton (Kr), Antimony (Sb), Gold (Au), Platinum (Pt), and the actinides like Americium (Am).\n\n**Step 2: Use the Reaction Stoichiometry to Identify A4**\n\nThe most specific and unusual clue is the reaction: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nThis describes a reaction: **Y + A4 → A5** where the reactants are in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n\nThis is a perfect description of a comproportionation reaction where an element in its elemental state (Y) reacts with a higher-valent compound of the same element (A4) to form a compound of intermediate valence (A5). The most common form of this reaction is:\n**Y + YF₂ₙ → 2YFₙ**\n\nThis reaction has a 1:1 molar ratio of reactants (Y and YF₂ₙ). This provides a direct link between the compounds.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Krypton (Kr) Hypothesis**\n\nLet's test this hypothesis, as it provides the most self-consistent solution that matches the given options.\n1.  **Identify Y and A2:** If Y = Krypton (Kr, M ≈ 83.8 g/mol), then for n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is a reasonable fit. So, let's assume **A2 = KrF₂**. The theoretical ɷF in KrF₂ is ~31.2%, which is acceptably close to the given 31.96%.\n2.  **Identify A1:** A1 decomposes into A2 (KrF₂) and F₂. This means **A1 = KrF₄**. The fact that A1 is unstable at room temperature (293 K) and oxidizes xenon fits the known properties of KrF₄. The \"bright-red\" color is likely an error in the problem statement, as KrF₄ is a white solid.\n3.  **Apply the Comproportionation Reaction:** The reaction is Y + A4 → A5. Using our model `Y + YF₂ₙ → 2YFₙ`, and knowing the krypton fluorides are KrF₂ and KrF₄, the only possible reaction is:\n    **Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂**\n4.  **Identify A4 and A5:** Comparing this to `Y + A4 → A5`, we can identify:\n    *   **Y = Kr**\n    *   **A4 = KrF₄**\n    *   **A5 = KrF₂** (The product is two molecules of KrF₂)\n5.  **Final Check of Clues:** This assignment is consistent. A2 and A5 are the same substance (KrF₂). A1 and A4 are the same substance (KrF₄). The clue about A5 decomposing in water is also true for KrF₂. The main inconsistencies are the \"five compounds\" and \"bright-red\" color, which must be assumed to be errors.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nWe have identified A4 as Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n*   Molar Mass of Krypton (Kr) ≈ 83.80 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (KrF₄) = 83.80 + 4 × 19.00 = 83.80 + 76.00 = **159.80 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 5: Select the Correct Range**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 159.80 g/mol falls within the range of **140-160**.\n\n<<<A>>>"

This led to the consideration of elements like Krypton (Kr), Antimony (Sb), and Plutonium (Pu) as potential candidates for Y.\n\n2.  **Constraint Application & Pruning:**\n    *   The script evaluated Krypton (Y=Kr). If A2 is KrF2, its fluorine mass percentage is 31.2%, which is reasonably close to the given value.\n    *   The decomposition `A1 -> A2 + F2` corresponds to the known reaction `KrF4 -> KrF2 + F2`. This identifies A1 as KrF4.\n    *   The 1:1 molar reaction `Y + A4 -> A5` strongly suggests the comproportionation reaction `Kr + KrF4 -> 2 KrF2`. This identifies A4 as KrF4 and A5 as KrF2.\n    *   Other candidates like Sb and Pu were eliminated because their fluoride chemistry did not match the reaction constraints (e.g., SbF5 is too stable, PuF8 is unknown).\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The only viable candidate was Krypton. The compound A4 was identified as Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF4). The molecular weight of KrF4 is calculated as 83.80 (for Kr) + 4 * 18.998 (for F) = 159.79 g/mol. This value falls squarely within the 140-160 range.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical puzzle to determine the molecular weight range of substance A4.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from Substance A2:**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine, with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. We can determine the identity of Y by testing plausible chemical formulas (YFₙ) against this percentage.\n\n    *   The formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n × Molar Mass of F) / (Molar Mass of Y + n × Molar Mass of F)\n    *   Let's test the formula SbF₃ (Antimony trifluoride).\n        *   Molar Mass of Sb ≈ 121.76 g/mol\n        *   Molar Mass of F ≈ 18.998 g/mol\n        *   ɷF in SbF₃ = (3 × 18.998) / (121.76 + 3 × 18.998) = 56.994 / 178.754 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%.\n    *   This value (31.88%) is extremely close to the given value of 31.96%. This strong correlation suggests that **Element Y is Antimony (Sb)** and **Substance A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Possible Binary Compounds of Antimony:**\n    Antimony primarily forms two stable binary fluorides:\n    *   **Antimony trifluoride (SbF₃)**\n    *   **Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅)**\n\n3.  **Determine Substance A4 by its Molecular Weight:**\n    The question asks for the range in which the molecular weight of substance A4 falls. A4 is one of the binary compounds of antimony and fluorine. Let's calculate the molecular weights of the two main candidates:\n\n    *   **Molecular Weight of SbF₃:** 121.76 + (3 × 18.998) = **178.75 g/mol**.\n    *   **Molecular Weight of SbF₅:** 121.76 + (5 × 18.998) = **216.75 g/mol**.\n\n    Now, let's compare these molecular weights to the given ranges:\n    *   A) 160-180\n    *   B) 220-240\n    *   C) 110-130\n    *   D) 140-160\n\n    The molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.75 g/mol) fits perfectly within range **A) 160-180**. The molecular weight of SbF₅ (216.75 g/mol) does not fall into any of the provided ranges.\n\n4.  **Conclusion on A4:**\n    Based on the numerical evidence, substance A4 must be SbF₃. The other descriptive clues in the problem (the color of A1, the 1:1 reaction stoichiometry) contain inconsistencies with standard chemical properties but are not needed to solve for the molecular weight of A4. The mass percentage of A2 and the provided molecular weight ranges are sufficient to identify A4.\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 (SbF₃) is approximately 179 g/mol, which falls into the 160-180 range.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThe search results point towards Krypton (Kr) as element Y. Let's verify this with the given information.\n\n*   **Element Y:** Krypton (Kr), a noble gas. Its atomic weight is ~83.8 g/mol.\n*   **Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known:** The search results mention KrF2 and KrF4. Theoretical calculations also predict the existence of KrF6 and other species like KrF+, KrF-, KrF3+, and KrF5+. This makes the \"five binary compounds\" plausible in the context of a chemistry problem.\n\nLet's re-evaluate A2 with Y=Kr.\n*   **A2 (ɷF=31,96%):** Let's calculate the mass percentage of fluorine in the known krypton fluorides.\n    *   **KrF2:** Molar mass = 83.8 + 2 * 19.0 = 121.8 g/mol.\n        *   Mass % F = (2 * 19.0) / 121.8 * 100% = 38 / 121.8 * 100% ≈ 31.2%. This is very close to the given 31.96%. Let's assume A2 is KrF2.\n    *   **KrF4:** Molar mass = 83.8 + 4 * 19.0 = 159.8 g/mol.\n        *   Mass % F = (4 * 19.0) / 159.8 * 100% = 76 / 159.8 * 100% ≈ 47.6%.\n\nSo, **A2 is KrF2**.\n\nNow let's decipher the other compounds based on the clues:\n\n*   **The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (KrF2) and fluorine.**\n    *   Reaction: A1 -> KrF2 + F2.\n    *   This means A1 must be KrF4.\n    *   Is KrF4 a \"bright-red substance\"? The search results describe it as a white crystalline solid. However, another highly reactive fluorine compound, dioxygen difluoride (O2F2), is described as an orange-red solid. There might be an inaccuracy in the problem's description, or it refers to an impurity or a specific state.\n    *   Does KrF4 decompose at 293 K (20 °C)? Yes, it is reported to be thermodynamically unstable and decomposes rapidly at room temperature.\n    *   So, **A1 is KrF4**.\n\n*   **A1 (KrF4) oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.** KrF4 is a powerful fluorinating agent, so it's plausible it would oxidize xenon. KrF2 is also known to oxidize xenon to XeF6.\n\n*   **A3 can also interact with xenon.** This points to another krypton fluoride. Given that KrF2 and KrF4 are A2 and A1, A3 is likely another fluoride.\n\n*   **A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y (Kr) with fluorine.**\n    *   Reaction: Kr + F2 -> A3.\n    *   This is the synthesis for krypton fluorides. KrF2 is formed by reacting Kr and F2 with an electric discharge or X-rays. KrF4 was claimed to be synthesized by passing an electric discharge through a krypton-fluorine mixture. It's reasonable to assume A3 is one of these common fluorides.\n\n*   **By adding Y (Kr) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.**\n    *   Reaction: Kr + A4 -> A5.\n    *   This is a strange reaction. It's unlikely that krypton would be added to a solution to react. This clue might be interpreted differently. Perhaps it's not a reaction in a solution but a high-energy process.\n    *   Let's reconsider the compounds. We have identified A1=KrF4 and A2=KrF2. The problem mentions five compounds. Let's call them KrF, KrF2, KrF3, KrF4, KrF5 for now.\n    *   The search results mention salts of the KrF+ cation. These are formed when KrF2 reacts with strong Lewis acids (e.g., SbF5).\n    *   Example: KrF2 + SbF5 -> [KrF]+[SbF6]-.\n    *   Here, [KrF]+[SbF6]- could be considered a compound. Let's explore this path.\n\nLet's re-examine the clue: **\"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"**\n*   This sounds like the formation of a complex.\n*   What if A4 is a Lewis acid fluoride, and A5 is the resulting salt?\n*   Let's assume **A4 is a strong Lewis acid like SbF5 or AsF5**. These are known to react with KrF2.\n*   The reaction would be KrF2 + A4 -> [KrF]+[A4F]-.\n*   But the clue says Y (Kr) is added, not KrF2. This is a major inconsistency.\n\nLet's pause and rethink the whole sequence.\n\n1.  **Y = Kr**.\n2.  **A2 = KrF2** (ωF ≈ 31.2%, close to 31.96%).\n3.  **A1 = KrF4** (Decomposes to KrF2 + F2).\n4.  **A1 (KrF4) and A3 oxidize Xe.** KrF2 also oxidizes Xe. So A3 could be KrF2, but A2 is already KrF2. Let's assume A3 is just another reactive fluoride of Krypton.\n5.  **A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y (Kr).** Both KrF2 and KrF4 are made this way.\n6.  **In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.**\n    *   Let's check the reaction of krypton fluorides with water.\n    *   2KrF2 + 2H2O → 2Kr + O2 + 4HF. This produces three substances (if you count Kr and O2 as separate). The problem says two. Maybe HF in water is considered one substance (hydrofluoric acid). But that still leaves Kr and O2.\n7.  **By adding Y (Kr) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.**\n    *   This clue is the most difficult. Let's reconsider the reaction. What if A4 is not a simple binary fluoride?\n    *   What if the problem is from a specific context where \"five binary compounds\" includes complex salts?\n    *   Let's look at the reaction again: Kr + A4 -> A5. This implies A5 contains Krypton.\n    *   What if A4 is a compound that can trap or react with Krypton atoms?\n    *   This seems very exotic. Let's reconsider the possibility of an error in the problem statement. What if it's not Y (Kr) being added, but A2 (KrF2)?\n    *   If the reaction is **A2 (KrF2) + A4 -> A5 (1:1 molar ratio)**.\n    *   And A4 is a strong Lewis acid fluoride. Let's assume **A4 = SbF5**.\n    *   Then **A5 = KrF2·SbF5**, which is better written as **[KrF]+[SbF6]-**.\n    *   Let's check if this fits.\n        *   A4 = SbF5. It's a colorless liquid/solid, can form concentrated solutions.\n        *   A5 = [KrF]+[SbF6]-.\n        *   **In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.** The [KrF]+ cation is highly reactive and would decompose in water. The [SbF6]- anion would also react. The overall reaction is complex, but it would certainly decompose.\n        *   This interpretation seems much more chemically sound.\n\nLet's proceed with this assumption:\n*   **Y = Kr** (Krypton)\n*   **A1 = KrF4** (Krypton tetrafluoride)\n*   **A2 = KrF2** (Krypton difluoride)\n*   **A3 =** Another krypton fluoride, likely one of the above.\n*   **A4 = SbF5** (Antimony pentafluoride) - A strong Lewis acid.\n*   **A5 = [KrF]+[SbF6]-** (Fluoro(krypton) hexafluoroantimonate)\n\nNow, the question asks for the **molecular weight range of substance A4**.\n*   We have identified A4 as Antimony pentafluoride (SbF5).\n*   Let's calculate its molecular weight.\n    *   Atomic weight of Antimony (Sb) ≈ 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol.\n    *   Molecular weight of SbF5 = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 121.76 + 95.00 = 216.76 g/mol.\n\nThis molecular weight (216.76 g/mol) does not fall into any of the provided ranges.\nA) 160-180\nB) 220-240\nC) 140-160\nD) 110-130\n\nLet's re-check my assumptions.\n*   Is Y=Kr correct? The mass percentage for A2=KrF2 (31.2%) is close to 31.96%. Let's recalculate M(Y) from the given percentage, assuming A2 is YF2.\n    *   (2 * 19) / (M(Y) + 2 * 19) = 0.3196\n    *   38 = 0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * 38\n    *   38 = 0.3196 * M(Y) + 12.1448\n    *   25.8552 = 0.3196 * M(Y)\n    *   M(Y) = 25.8552 / 0.3196 ≈ 80.9 g/mol.\n*   This atomic weight (80.9 g/mol) is extremely close to Bromine (Br, 79.9 g/mol).\n\nLet's re-evaluate everything with **Y = Bromine (Br)**.\n*   **Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.** Bromine forms BrF, BrF3, BrF5, and other less stable species like BrF2 radical, BrF4 cation/anion. This is plausible.\n*   **A2 (ɷF=31,96%).** If Y=Br, then A2 is BrF2. This is not a stable, isolable compound. It's a radical. This seems unlikely to be A2.\n*   Let's check the mass percentages for stable bromine fluorides:\n    *   BrF: 19 / (79.9 + 19) = 19.2%\n    *   BrF3: (3 * 19) / (79.9 + 57) = 41.6%\n    *   BrF5: (5 * 19) / (79.9 + 95) = 54.3%\n*   None of these match 31.96%. The calculation points strongly to a YF2 compound where Y has a mass of ~80.9. Krypton (83.8) is a better fit than Bromine (79.9) if we allow for some error in the percentage. The difference for Kr is (31.96-31.20)/31.96 = 2.4%. The difference for Br is (31.96-32.35)/31.96 = 1.2% (using M(Br)=79.9 and A2=BrF2). Bromine is actually a closer fit mathematically, but BrF2 is not a stable compound you'd get from decomposition.\n\nLet's go back to **Y = Krypton (Kr)** and reconsider A4.\n*   A1 = KrF4\n*   A2 = KrF2\n*   Reaction: A2 + A4 -> A5 (assuming the typo)\n*   A4 must be a strong Lewis acid fluoride. We tried SbF5 (MW=216.8) and it didn't fit the ranges.\n*   What are other strong Lewis acid fluorides?\n    *   AsF5 (Arsenic pentafluoride): MW = 69.92 + 5 * 19.00 = 164.92 g/mol.\n    *   PF5 (Phosphorus pentafluoride): MW = 30.97 + 5 * 19.00 = 125.97 g/mol.\n    *   BF3 (Boron trifluoride): MW = 10.81 + 3 * 19.00 = 67.81 g/mol.\n    *   XeF6 (Xenon hexafluoride): MW = 131.29 + 6 * 19.00 = 245.29 g/mol.\n\nLet's check the molecular weights against the options:\n*   AsF5: 164.92 g/mol. This falls squarely in range **A) 160-180**.\n*   PF5: 125.97 g/mol. This falls squarely in range **D) 110-130**.\n*   XeF6: 245.29 g/mol. This is outside range B.\n\nSo, A4 could be AsF5 or PF5. Both are strong Lewis acids known to react with fluorides.\n*   If A4 = AsF5, the answer is A.\n*   If A4 = PF5, the answer is D.\n\nIs there any clue to distinguish between them?\n*   \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\".\n    *   AsF5 is a colorless gas at STP, boils at -53.2 °C.\n    *   PF5 is a colorless gas at STP, boils at -84.6 °C.\n    *   Both can be handled as liquids under pressure or at low temperatures. The term \"solution\" might be used loosely, perhaps referring to the pure liquid or a solution in an inert solvent like anhydrous HF.\n*   The problem seems to have multiple ambiguities (the red color of A1, the \"Y + A4\" reaction, the number of decomposition products of A5 in water).\n\nHowever, the core chemical logic seems to be:\n1.  Identify Y from the mass percentage of F in A2. Krypton is the most plausible candidate despite a small discrepancy in the percentage, as it forms the necessary range of unstable/reactive fluorides.\n2.  Identify A1 and A2 based on the decomposition reaction. A1=KrF4, A2=KrF2.\n3.  Identify the reaction to form A5 as a Lewis acid-base reaction between a krypton fluoride (likely A2=KrF2) and a fluoride Lewis acid (A4).\n4.  Identify A4 as a common strong Lewis acid fluoride whose molecular weight fits one of the ranges.\n\nLet's re-examine the reaction: **Kr + A4 -> A5**.\nCould this be correct? Is there any reaction where Krypton gas is bubbled through a solution of A4 to make A5? This is highly unconventional.\nWhat if A4 is not the Lewis acid, but something else?\nExample: PtF6. It's a dark red solid, a powerful oxidizing agent. It famously oxidized O2 and Xe.\nPtF6 + Xe -> [Xe]+[PtF6]-.\nCould the reaction be **PtF6 + Kr -> [Kr]+[PtF6]-**? This is chemically plausible.\n*   Let's check the properties.\n    *   A4 = PtF6. It is a \"hot...solution\"? PtF6 is a low-melting solid (m.p. 61.3 °C), so a \"hot...solution\" could be molten PtF6. It is dark red, not colorless. This contradicts the \"colorless\" description.\n    *   A5 = [Kr]+[PtF6]-.\n    *   Does A5 decompose in water? Yes, violently.\n*   What is the molecular weight of PtF6?\n    *   MW = 195.08 + 6 * 19.00 = 195.08 + 114 = 309.08 g/mol. This doesn't fit any range.\n\nThe assumption of a typo in the reaction (A2 + A4 -> A5 instead of Y + A4 -> A5) seems the most likely way to resolve the puzzle.\nIf we accept this assumption, A4 is a strong Lewis acid fluoride.\nThe candidates are AsF5 (MW ≈ 165) and PF5 (MW ≈ 126).\n\n*   **Option A) 160-180:** Corresponds to A4 = AsF5.\n*   **Option D) 110-130:** Corresponds to A4 = PF5.\n\nBoth are chemically plausible. Without further information, it's hard to distinguish. However, in problems of this nature, often a very common or representative example is used. Both AsF5 and SbF5 are classic examples of very strong Lewis acids used in noble gas and halogen fluoride chemistry. PF5 is also a Lewis acid, but perhaps less commonly cited in the context of reacting with KrF2. The reaction between KrF2 and AsF5 to form [KrF]+[AsF6]- is well-documented.\n\nLet's reconsider the \"bright-red substance A1\". This is a strong clue that is being ignored.\n*   A1 = KrF4, which is a white solid.\n*   What if A1 is not KrF4?\n*   A1 -> A2 + F2. A1 has more fluorine than A2.\n*   A2 has ɷF=31,96%. We identified this as likely KrF2.\n*   So A1 -> KrF2 + F2. This still points to A1 = KrF4.\n*   Is there any other \"bright-red\" substance that could be A1?\n    *   Dioxygen difluoride (O2F2) is orange-red.\n    *   Platinum hexafluoride (PtF6) is dark red.\n    *   Rhodium hexafluoride (RhF6) is black.\n    *   Ruthenium pentafluoride (RuF5) is dark green.\n*   If A1 were PtF6, it doesn't contain element Y (Kr).\n*   The description of A1 as \"bright-red\" seems to be a major inconsistency or a red herring. If we ignore it and focus on the other clues, the path Y=Kr, A2=KrF2, A1=KrF4, A4=AsF5 seems the most consistent.\n\nLet's check the molecular weight of KrF4 (A1).\nMW = 83.8 + 4 * 19 = 159.8 g/mol. This falls in range C) 140-160. But the question asks for A4.\n\nLet's check the molecular weight of KrF2 (A2).\nMW = 83.8 + 2 * 19 = 121.8 g/mol. This falls in range D) 110-130. But the question asks for A4.\n\nLet's assume the question is flawed and asks for the MW of A1 or A2.\nIf it asks for A1 (KrF4), the answer is C.\nIf it asks for A2 (KrF2), the answer is D.\n\nLet's assume the question is correct as stated and our identification of A4 is correct.\nA4 = AsF5, MW = 164.92 g/mol -> Range A.\nA4 = PF5, MW = 125.97 g/mol -> Range D.\n\nHow to decide between AsF5 and PF5? There are no further clues. Let's re-read carefully.\n\"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nLet's stick to the typo theory: A2 + A4 -> A5.\nKrF2 + AsF5 -> [KrF]+[AsF6]-\nKrF2 + PF5 -> [KrF]+[PF6]-\nBoth reactions are known.\n\nLet's reconsider the original reaction: Kr + A4 -> A5.\nCould A4 be something that reacts with Kr? Maybe A4 is not a stable molecule but a radical species in solution? This seems too complex.\nWhat if A4 is an excited state molecule?\nWhat if A4 is an oxidant that can form a compound with Kr? We already discussed PtF6. What about O2F2? It's red, not colorless.\n\nLet's go back to the most plausible path:\nY = Kr\nA2 = KrF2\nA1 = KrF4\nA4 = Lewis Acid Fluoride (AsF5 or PF5)\nTypo in reaction: should be A2 + A4 -> A5\n\nLet's assume A4 is Arsenic Pentafluoride (AsF5).\nMW = 164.92 g/mol.\nThis falls in the range 160-180.\n\nLet's assume A4 is Phosphorus Pentafluoride (PF5).\nMW = 125.97 g/mol.\nThis falls in the range 110-130.\n\nIs there any reason to prefer AsF5? Arsenic is in the same group as Antimony, and SbF5 is the archetypal superacid-forming fluoride. AsF5 is also extremely strong. PF5 is a weaker Lewis acid than AsF5 and SbF5. Given the extreme nature of Krypton chemistry, reacting with a very strong Lewis acid like AsF5 seems more likely to be the intended answer than reacting with the somewhat weaker PF5.\n\nLet's finalize the identification:\n*   Element Y: Krypton (Kr).\n*   A1: KrF4 (Krypton tetrafluoride). Described as \"bright-red\" (inaccuracy in problem), decomposes at 293 K to A2 and F2. Oxidizes xenon.\n*   A2: KrF2 (Krypton difluoride). Mass % of F is ~31.2%, close to the given 31.96%.\n*   A3: Another krypton fluoride, likely KrF2 or KrF4, which also oxidizes xenon.\n*   A4: AsF5 (Arsenic pentafluoride). A colorless substance (gas, liquid at low temp) and a very strong Lewis acid.\n*   A5: [KrF]+[AsF6]-. Formed from the reaction of KrF2 and AsF5 (assuming typo in problem statement). Decomposes in water.\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 (AsF5) is approximately 165 g/mol.\nThis value falls within the range of 160-180.\n\nFinal check of the logic. The identification of Y as Kr is the crucial first step. The mass percentage calculation points to an element with M ≈ 80.9 if the fluoride is YF2. Krypton (83.8) is a reasonable fit, and its chemistry aligns with the clues about unstable, highly oxidizing fluorides. The decomposition of A1 to A2+F2 points to A1=KrF4 and A2=KrF2. The reaction to form A5 is best explained as a Lewis acid-base reaction, which requires assuming a typo in the reactants (A2 instead of Y). With this assumption, A4 is a strong fluoride Lewis acid. Checking the molecular weights of common Lewis acids, AsF5 (165 g/mol) fits perfectly into range A. This seems to be the most coherent solution despite the minor inconsistencies in the problem description.\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of substance A4 falls in the range of 160-180.\n\nFinal Answer is A.\n\nLet's write down the final reasoning.\n1.  From the mass percentage of fluorine in A2 (ɷF=31.96%), we can determine the molar mass of element Y. Assuming the formula is YFn, the molar mass M(Y) is given by M(Y) = (19n / 0.3196) - 19n. A more direct calculation: M(Y) ≈ 40.45n.\n2.  Testing values of n, if n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic mass of Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol) and Bromine (Br, 79.9 g/mol).\n3.  Krypton is a noble gas known to form several unstable, highly reactive fluorides, which fits the description. Let's assume Y is Kr. Then A2 would be KrF2. The theoretical mass percentage of F in KrF2 is (2 * 19) / (83.8 + 38) * 100% ≈ 31.2%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n4.  Substance A1 decomposes into A2 (KrF2) and fluorine. This means A1 must be a higher fluoride of krypton, which is KrF4. The reaction is KrF4 → KrF2 + F2. KrF4 is known to be unstable at room temperature (293 K).\n5.  A1 (KrF4) and A3 are described as oxidizing xenon, which is characteristic of these powerful fluorinating agents. KrF2 also reacts with Xenon.\n6.  The clue \"By adding Y (Kr) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained\" is chemically problematic. It is highly likely a typo and should read \"By adding A2 (KrF2)...\". This would describe a classic Lewis acid-base reaction.\n7.  The reaction is A2 + A4 → A5, where A4 is a strong Lewis acid. A5 is the resulting salt. For example: KrF2 + A4 → [KrF]+[A4F]-.\n8.  A4 is described as a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". We need to find a strong Lewis acid fluoride that fits this and one of the molecular weight ranges.\n9.  Let's examine potential Lewis acids:\n    *   PF5: MW ≈ 126 g/mol (Range D)\n    *   AsF5: MW ≈ 165 g/mol (Range A)\n    *   SbF5: MW ≈ 217 g/mol (Outside the ranges)\n10. Both PF5 and AsF5 are colorless gases that can be liquefied. The reaction of KrF2 with AsF5 to form [KrF]+[AsF6]- is well-established in noble gas chemistry. Given the extreme reactivity involved, the stronger Lewis acid AsF5 is a very fitting candidate.\n11. The molecular weight of AsF5 is approximately 165 g/mol, which falls into the range of 160-180.\n12. The final clue, \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances,\" is consistent, as these complex fluoride salts react vigorously with water.\n\nBased on this deductive process, A4 is Arsenic pentafluoride (AsF5). Its molecular weight is ~165 g/mol. This falls in the range 160-180.Based on the information provided, we can deduce the identity of element Y and the five fluorine compounds through a step-by-step analysis.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2:**\n    The problem states that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YF_n, where Y is the unknown element and n is the number of fluorine atoms. The atomic mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 19.0 g/mol.\n\n    The formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.0) / (M(Y) + n * 19.0)\n\n    Rearranging for the molar mass of Y, M(Y):\n    M(Y) = (19.0 * n / 0.3196) - (19.0 * n)\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    We can test integer values for 'n':\n    *   If n = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (closest is Calcium, but its fluoride chemistry doesn't fit).\n    *   If n = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic masses of Bromine (Br, 79.9 g/mol) and Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol).\n\n    The problem describes highly reactive compounds, some of which can oxidize xenon. This is characteristic of noble gas compounds. Krypton (Kr) is known to form several binary fluorides. Let's assume **Y is Krypton (Kr)**.\n    If Y is Kr, then A2 would be KrF2. Let's check the mass percentage:\n    M(KrF2) = 83.8 + 2 * 19.0 = 121.8 g/mol.\n    ɷF in KrF2 = (2 * 19.0) / 121.8 * 100% ≈ 31.2%. This value is very close to the 31.96% given in the problem. Thus, we can confidently identify **A2 as KrF2** (Krypton difluoride).\n\n2.  **Identify Compound A1:**\n    A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (20 °C) into A2 (KrF2) and fluorine (F2). The reaction is A1 → KrF2 + F2. This implies A1 has more fluorine than A2, making **A1 Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF4)**. KrF4 is known to be thermally unstable and decomposes at room temperature. While it is typically described as a white solid, the \"bright-red\" color might be an inaccuracy in the problem statement or refer to an impurity, as other highly reactive fluorides like O2F2 are red.\n\n3.  **Identify Compounds A3, A4, and A5:**\n    *   A1 (KrF4) and A3 are said to oxidize xenon. This is a known property of krypton fluorides. A3 is obtained by the fluorination of Krypton.\n    *   The most challenging clue is: \"By adding Y (Kr) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" A direct reaction with elemental krypton in this manner is highly unusual. It is very likely that this is a typo and the reaction should involve the reactive krypton compound A2 (KrF2) instead of Y (Kr).\n    *   The corrected reaction would be: A2 + A4 → A5. This describes a classic Lewis acid-base reaction where the fluoride A2 acts as a Lewis base (fluoride donor) and A4 is a strong Lewis acid (fluoride acceptor).\n    *   The product A5 would be a salt of the form [KrF]+[A4F]−. These complex salts are known to decompose in water.\n    *   A4 must therefore be a strong Lewis acid fluoride. Common examples include PF5, AsF5, and SbF5.\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4:**\n    We need to find which Lewis acid's molecular weight fits the given options.\n    *   PF5 (Phosphorus pentafluoride): MW = 31.0 + 5 * 19.0 = 126.0 g/mol.\n    *   **AsF5 (Arsenic pentafluoride): MW = 74.9 + 5 * 19.0 = 169.9 g/mol.**\n    *   SbF5 (Antimony pentafluoride): MW = 121.8 + 5 * 19.0 = 216.8 g/mol.\n\n    Now we check these molecular weights against the provided ranges:\n    *   A) 160-180\n    *   B) 220-240\n    *   C) 140-160\n    *   D) 110-130\n\n    The molecular weight of AsF5 (169.9 g/mol) falls directly into the range of 160-180. The reaction KrF2 + AsF5 → [KrF]+[AsF6]− is a known reaction in noble gas chemistry.\n\nTherefore, the substance A4 is Arsenic pentafluoride (AsF5), and its molecular weight is within the 160-180 range.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis is a complex problem with several clues that appear contradictory under standard chemical knowledge. A step-by-step analysis is required to identify the most plausible answer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the mass percentage of fluorine (F) in compound A2.**\n    The mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in A2 is given as 31.96%. The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F), where M_Y is the molecular weight of element Y, M_F is the molecular weight of fluorine (~19 g/mol), and n is the number of fluorine atoms.\n    Rearranging the formula gives: M_Y ≈ 40.44 * n.\n    Testing integer values for 'n':\n    *   n=2: M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol (closest to Bromine, but its fluorides don't match).\n    *   n=3: M_Y ≈ 121.3 g/mol (very close to Antimony, Sb, M=121.76 g/mol). Checking the mass % of F in SbF3: (3 * 19) / (121.76 + 57) ≈ 31.88%. This is a very strong match.\n    *   n=6: M_Y ≈ 242.6 g/mol (very close to Plutonium, Pu, M≈244 g/mol). Checking the mass % of F in PuF6: (6 * 19) / (244 + 114) ≈ 31.84%. This is also a very strong match.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the candidates based on other clues.**\n    *   **Plutonium (Pu):** While the mass percentage for PuF6 fits well, several other clues create contradictions. Plutonium compounds in solution are colored, but the problem states A4 is in a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". Furthermore, none of the molecular weights of plutonium fluorides (PuF3, PuF4, PuF6) fit into the provided answer ranges.\n    *   **Antimony (Sb):** The mass percentage for SbF3 is an excellent fit. However, other clues are problematic. Antimony is only known to form two stable binary fluorides (SbF3 and SbF5), not five. The \"bright-red substance A1\" that decomposes to A2 (SbF3) would have to be SbF5, but SbF5 is a colorless liquid.\n    *   **Krypton (Kr):** This is another possibility. The mass percentage of fluorine in KrF2 is about 31.2% (using M_Kr ≈ 83.8 g/mol), which is a less accurate match than for Sb or Pu. However, let's examine the other clues.\n\n3.  **Re-evaluate the problem with Krypton (Y=Kr) as the element.**\n    This problem is known to be a flawed chemistry olympiad question, where Krypton is the intended answer despite several inaccuracies in the problem statement.\n    *   **A2 = KrF2**: We accept the slight discrepancy in the fluorine mass percentage.\n    *   **Five binary compounds**: This is a known error in the problem; only KrF2 is well-established.\n    *   **A1**: The \"bright-red substance\" A1 that decomposes into A2 (KrF2) and fluorine would be KrF4. This is another error, as KrF4 is not red and its existence is disputed.\n    *   **A3**: A3 is formed by fluorinating Krypton, so A3 is KrF2. KrF2 is a powerful fluorinating agent and can interact with Xenon. This fits.\n    *   **A4**: The crucial clue is that A4 is in a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". KrF2 is a colorless solid and can be dissolved. Therefore, it is plausible that **A4 is KrF2**. The subsequent reaction clue involving adding Krypton gas to this solution is nonsensical and likely another flaw in the problem design.\n\n4.  **Determine the molecular weight of A4.**\n    Assuming A4 is Krypton difluoride (KrF2), we calculate its molecular weight.\n    *   M(KrF2) = M(Kr) + 2 * M(F)\n    *   M(KrF2) ≈ 83.8 g/mol + 2 * 19.0 g/mol = 121.8 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Match the molecular weight to the given ranges.**\n    The calculated molecular weight of 121.8 g/mol falls within the range:\n    B) 110-130\n\nDespite the numerous inconsistencies in the problem description, identifying Krypton as the intended element Y and KrF2 as compound A4 provides a clear answer from the given options.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemistry problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the mass fraction of fluorine in A2.**\nThe problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine, with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ, where Mᵧ is the molar mass of Y and n is the number of fluorine atoms. The molar mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n\nThe formula for the mass fraction of fluorine is:\nɷF = (n × M_F) / (Mᵧ + n × M_F)\n0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (Mᵧ + n × 19.00)\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for Mᵧ:\nMᵧ = (n × 19.00 / 0.3196) - (n × 19.00)\nMᵧ = n × (59.449 - 19.00)\nMᵧ ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe can now test integer values for n to find a plausible element Y:\n*   n=1: Mᵧ ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Ca, Ar, K - unlikely to form five binary fluorides).\n*   n=2: Mᵧ ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Br, Se - let's check BrF₂. M(BrF₂) = 79.9 + 38 = 117.9. ɷF = 38/117.9 = 32.2%. This is a possibility. However, BrF₂ is a radical). Let's check KrF₂. M(Kr) = 83.8 g/mol. M(KrF₂) = 83.8 + 38 = 121.8. ɷF = 38/121.8 = 31.2%. This is also a possibility.\n*   n=3: Mᵧ ≈ 121.35 g/mol (close to Sb). Let's check SbF₃. M(Sb) = 121.76 g/mol. M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 57 = 178.76. ɷF = 57/178.76 = 31.88%. This is a very close match.\n*   n=4: Mᵧ ≈ 161.8 g/mol (close to Tb, Dy - unlikely).\n*   n=5: Mᵧ ≈ 202.25 g/mol (close to Bi, Pb, Hg - let's check BiF₅. M(Bi)=209. ɷF = 95/(209+95) = 31.25%).\n*   n=6: Mᵧ ≈ 242.7 g/mol (close to Pu, Am). Let's check PuF₆. M(Pu)=244. ɷF = 114/(244+114) = 31.84%. This is also a very close match.\n\nThe best candidates for (Y, A2) based on mass fraction are (Sb, SbF₃), (Pu, PuF₆), and (Kr, KrF₂).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the chemical reactions to identify the correct element and compounds.**\n\nLet's analyze the given reactions for each candidate. The most restrictive clue is the 1:1 comproportionation reaction: Y + A4 → A5.\n\n*   **Case 1: Y = Antimony (Sb)**\n    *   A2 = SbF₃.\n    *   The decomposition A1 → A2 + F₂ implies A1 = SbF₅.\n    *   The comproportionation reaction would be Sb + A4 → A5. For this to be a comproportionation, A4 must be SbF₅. The known reaction is 2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃. The molar ratio of reactants is 2:3, not 1:1. This hypothesis fails.\n\n*   **Case 2: Y = Plutonium (Pu)**\n    *   The decomposition A1 → A2 + F₂ and the fact that PuF₆ is the highest known fluoride suggests a possible error in the problem statement. If we assume A1=PuF₆ decomposes to A2=PuF₄, the mass fraction of A2 is wrong. If we assume A2=PuF₆, then A1 is a hypothetical PuF₈.\n    *   Let's check the comproportionation. Known reactions are 2Pu + PuF₆ → 3PuF₄ and Pu + 3PuF₄ → 4PuF₃. Neither has a 1:1 molar ratio of reactants. This hypothesis fails.\n\n*   **Case 3: Y = Krypton (Kr)**\n    *   A2 = KrF₂ (ɷF = 31.2%, which is reasonably close to 31.96%).\n    *   The decomposition A1 → A2 + F₂ implies A1 = KrF₄. The reaction KrF₄ → KrF₂ + F₂ is known; KrF₄ is highly unstable. This fits.\n    *   A1 (KrF₄) is a powerful oxidizer and can oxidize xenon. This fits.\n    *   A3 is obtained by fluorination of Kr (Y). Kr + F₂ → KrF₂. So A3 = KrF₂. This fits.\n    *   Now, the key reaction: Y + A4 → A5 in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n        *   Let's test this: Kr + A4 → A5. For a comproportionation, A4 must be a higher fluoride. The only other known fluoride is KrF₄.\n        *   The reaction is: Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂.\n        *   This reaction proceeds with a 1:1 molar ratio of Krypton (Y) and Krypton tetrafluoride (A4). This is a perfect match for the description.\n    *   Therefore, we can identify A4 = KrF₄ and A5 = KrF₂.\n    *   The problem states A4 is in a \"colorless concentrated solution\". KrF₄ is a white solid, and its solution in a solvent like anhydrous HF would likely be colorless. This is plausible.\n    *   The final clue: A5 (KrF₂) decomposes in water. KrF₂ + H₂O → Kr + ½O₂ + 2HF. This produces two gaseous substances (Kr and O₂), fitting the description.\n\n**Step 3: Conclude and calculate the molecular weight of A4.**\n\nThe Krypton hypothesis is the only one that provides a consistent explanation for the chemical reactions described, especially the unique 1:1 comproportionation. The discrepancies in the problem (the \"five compounds\", the \"bright-red\" color of A1, and the slight error in mass fraction for A2) are likely errors or red herrings.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   Element Y is Krypton (Kr).\n*   Substance A4 is Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n\nNow, we calculate the molecular weight of A4 (KrF₄):\nM(KrF₄) = M(Kr) + 4 × M(F)\nM(KrF₄) ≈ 83.80 g/mol + 4 × 19.00 g/mol\nM(KrF₄) ≈ 83.80 + 76.00\nM(KrF₄) ≈ 159.80 g/mol\n\n**Step 4: Match the calculated molecular weight to the given ranges.**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 is 159.80 g/mol. We check which range this value falls into:\nA) 140-160\nB) 110-130\nC) 220-240\nD) 160-180\n\nThe value 159.80 is within the range of 140-160.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Substance A2:**\n    The problem states that substance A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine, with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. The general formula for A2 is YF_n.\n\n    The mass percentage of fluorine is given by the formula:\n    ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n\n    Using the approximate atomic mass of fluorine M(F) ≈ 19 g/mol:\n    0.3196 = (19n) / (M(Y) + 19n)\n    Solving for M(Y), we get:\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\n    We can test integer values for 'n' to find a plausible atomic mass for element Y:\n    *   If n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium)\n    *   If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Bromine/Selenium)\n    *   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (very close to Antimony, Sb, with M ≈ 121.76 g/mol)\n    *   If n=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (close to Dysprosium)\n\n    Let's verify the fluorine percentage for Antimony(III) fluoride, SbF₃:\n    M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 × 18.998 = 178.754 g/mol.\n    ɷF = (3 × 18.998) / 178.754 ≈ 0.3188, or 31.89%.\n    This value is extremely close to the given 31.96%, making it highly probable that **Y is Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n2.  **Identify Substances A1 and A3:**\n    *   Substance A1 decomposes into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine (F₂). This means A1 must have a higher oxidation state than Sb(III). The next stable fluoride is Antimony(V) fluoride, SbF₅. The reaction is SbF₅ → SbF₃ + F₂. Thus, **A1 is SbF₅**. The description of A1 as a \"bright-red\" substance that decomposes at room temperature (293 K) is unusual, as pure SbF₅ is a colorless liquid stable at that temperature, but we proceed with this identification based on the chemical reaction.\n    *   Substance A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y (Sb) and it oxidizes xenon. The direct fluorination of antimony yields SbF₃ or SbF₅, and SbF₅ is a powerful oxidizing agent known to react with xenon. Therefore, **A3 is also SbF₅**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substances A4 and A5:**\n    *   The problem describes the formation of A5 by adding element Y (Sb) to a solution of A4. The reaction is: Sb + A4 → A5.\n    *   This is a classic comproportionation reaction, where an element in its zero oxidation state reacts with a compound of the same element in a higher oxidation state to form a product with an intermediate oxidation state.\n    *   For this to occur, A4 must be the higher oxidation state compound, SbF₅, and the product A5 must be the lower oxidation state compound, SbF₃. The balanced reaction is 2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃.\n    *   So, we identify **A4 as SbF₅** and **A5 as SbF₃**.\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4 and Select the Range:**\n    *   The question asks for the range in which the molecular weight of substance **A4** falls.\n    *   Based on our deduction, A4 is Antimony Pentafluoride (SbF₅).\n    *   Let's calculate its molecular weight:\n        M(SbF₅) = M(Sb) + 5 × M(F) = 121.76 + 5 × 18.998 = **216.75 g/mol**.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Options:**\n    The given ranges are:\n    A) 140-160\n    B) 220-240\n    C) 110-130\n    D) 160-180\n\n    Our calculated molecular weight for A4 (216.75 g/mol) does not fall into any of the provided ranges. This indicates a likely flaw in the problem statement or the options. Let's re-evaluate:\n\n    *   The identification of Y=Sb and the compounds SbF₃ and SbF₅ is chemically very sound and consistent with most of the clues.\n    *   The molecular weight of A4 (SbF₅) is 216.75 g/mol.\n    *   The molecular weight of A2 and A5 (both SbF₃) is 178.76 g/mol. This value falls perfectly within range **D) 160-180**.\n\n    Given that one of the options must be correct, the most probable error in the question is asking for the molecular weight of A4 when it intended to ask for A2 or A5. Alternatively, the problem assumes a non-standard reaction where A4 is SbF₃. In either of these likely error scenarios, the compound whose molecular weight lies within the options is SbF₃.\n\n    Assuming the question intended to point to the molecular weight of SbF₃:\n    MW(SbF₃) = 178.76 g/mol.\n    This value is in the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the mass fraction of Fluorine in A2.**\n\nThe problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with a formula YFₙ. The mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) in A2 is 31.96% (or 0.3196).\n\nThe formula for mass fraction is:\nɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\nWhere:\n*   M(F) is the molar mass of Fluorine (≈ 19.00 g/mol).\n*   M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n*   n is the number of fluorine atoms in the molecule.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for M(Y):\nM(Y) = n * [M(F) / ɷF - M(F)]\nM(Y) = n * [19.00 / 0.3196 - 19.00]\nM(Y) ≈ n * [59.45 - 19.00]\nM(Y) ≈ n * 40.45\n\nWe need to find an integer `n` that results in a realistic atomic mass for an element Y. Let's test integer values for `n`:\n*   n = 1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (closest is Ca, but its chemistry doesn't fit).\n*   n = 2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (closest is Br, but it only forms 3 binary fluorides).\n*   n = 3: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol (closest is Sb, but it only forms 2 binary fluorides).\n*   n = 4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (closest is Dy, doesn't fit chemistry).\n*   n = 5: M(Y) ≈ 202.3 g/mol (no element fits well with the other clues).\n*   n = 6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This value is in the range of the actinide elements.\n\nLet's check the actinides around this mass:\n*   Plutonium (Pu), M ≈ 244 g/mol\n*   Americium (Am), M ≈ 243 g/mol\n\nLet's calculate the theoretical ɷF for PuF₆ and AmF₆ to see which is a better match for the given 31.96%.\n*   For PuF₆: M(PuF₆) = 244 + 6 * 19 = 358 g/mol. ɷF = (6 * 19) / 358 = 114 / 358 ≈ 0.3184 (31.84%).\n*   For AmF₆: M(AmF₆) = 243 + 6 * 19 = 357 g/mol. ɷF = (6 * 19) / 357 = 114 / 357 ≈ 0.3193 (31.93%).\n\nThe mass fraction for AmF₆ (31.93%) is an excellent match for the given value of 31.96%. Therefore, it is highly probable that **Y is Americium (Am)** and **A2 is AmF₆**.\n\n**Step 2: Verify the other clues with Y = Americium.**\n\n*   **\"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"** Americium is known to form five binary fluorides: AmF₂, AmF₃, AmF₄, AmF₅, and AmF₆. This fits perfectly.\n*   **\"A1 is a bright-red substance.\"**\n*   **\"A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (AmF₆) and fluorine.\"** This implies the reaction: A1 → AmF₆ + F₂. For this to be balanced, A1 must be a higher fluoride of americium (e.g., AmF₇ or AmF₈). While these are not listed as stable compounds, the problem describes A1 as unstable at 293 K (20 °C). It's plausible that a highly unstable, higher fluoride exists and decomposes as described.\n*   **\"A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\"** and **\"A3 can also interact with xenon.\"** Higher fluorides of actinides are extremely powerful oxidizing agents, capable of oxidizing xenon. This is consistent with A1 being a higher fluoride (like AmF₇) and A3 being another high-oxidation-state fluoride (like AmF₅ or AmF₄).\n*   **\"A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine.\"** This is a standard method for producing metal fluorides. For example: Am + 2F₂ → AmF₄. So, A3 could be AmF₄ or AmF₅.\n*   **\"By adding Y (Am) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"** This describes a comproportionation reaction, where an element in its elemental state (oxidation state 0) reacts with a compound of the same element in a higher oxidation state to form a compound with an intermediate oxidation state. The reaction is: Am(0) + A4 → A5.\n*   **\"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\"** This is characteristic of compounds with an element in an unstable intermediate oxidation state, which would disproportionate in water.\n\n**Step 3: Identify A4 and A5.**\n\nThe reaction is: Am + A4 → A5 (1:1 molar ratio).\nLet A4 = AmFₙ. The reaction is: Am + AmFₙ → 2AmFₙ/₂.\nFor the product A5 (AmFₙ/₂) to be a stable binary fluoride of americium, n/2 must be an integer. This means n must be an even integer.\n\nThe possible binary fluorides of Americium are AmF₂, AmF₃, AmF₄, AmF₅, AmF₆.\nThe possible candidates for A4 (AmFₙ) with an even `n` are AmF₂, AmF₄, and AmF₆.\n\nLet's test these possibilities:\n*   If A4 = AmF₂ (n=2): Am + AmF₂ → 2AmF. AmF is not one of the known stable fluorides.\n*   If A4 = AmF₄ (n=4): Am + AmF₄ → 2AmF₂. A5 would be AmF₂. This is a known, stable fluoride of americium.\n*   If A4 = AmF₆ (n=6): Am + AmF₆ → 2AmF₃. A5 would be AmF₃. This is also a known, stable fluoride.\n\nWe have two possibilities for the (A4, A5) pair: (AmF₄, AmF₂) or (AmF₆, AmF₃).\n\nThe clue \"A5 decomposes in water with the formation of two substances\" helps us distinguish. This suggests A5 is unstable in water and disproportionates.\n*   AmF₃ is the most stable fluoride of americium and is stable in water.\n*   AmF₂ contains Am in the +2 oxidation state, which is unstable in aqueous solution and would disproportionate into Am(0) and Am(III). The reaction is: 3Am²⁺(aq) → Am(s) + 2Am³⁺(aq). This fits the description.\n\nTherefore, A5 must be AmF₂, and A4 must be AmF₄.\n\nThe reaction is:\nAm + AmF₄ → 2AmF₂\n(Y) + (A4) → (A5)\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the molecular weight of A4.**\n\nWe have identified A4 as Americium(IV) fluoride, AmF₄.\nLet's calculate its molecular weight.\n*   Molar mass of Americium (Am) ≈ 243 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19 g/mol.\n\nMolecular Weight (M) of AmF₄ = M(Am) + 4 * M(F)\nM(AmF₄) = 243 + 4 * 19\nM(AmF₄) = 243 + 76\nM(AmF₄) = 319 g/mol\n\nThis value does not fall into any of the given ranges. Let's re-examine the problem. There might be a misunderstanding of the reaction to form A5.\n\nLet's reconsider the reaction: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nThe reaction is Am + A4 -> A5. This implies the coefficients are 1:1:1, not 1:1:2 as in the comproportionation assumption.\nIf the stoichiometry is 1:1:1, then A5 must be an adduct or a cluster.\nAm + AmFₙ → Am₂(Fₙ). This is not a simple binary compound.\n\nLet's re-read the question carefully. It's a Russian chemistry olympiad problem, which are known for being tricky. Let's reconsider the element. What if it's not an actinide? What if it's Krypton (Kr)?\n*   Y = Kr. M(Kr) = 83.8 g/mol.\n*   Let's check the mass fraction. M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n. 83.8 ≈ 40.45 * n -> n ≈ 2.07.\n*   So A2 could be KrF₂. Let's check ɷF in KrF₂. M(KrF₂) = 83.8 + 2*19 = 121.8. ɷF = 38 / 121.8 = 0.312. This is close to 31.96%.\n*   Known binary fluorides of Kr: KrF₂, KrF₄ (unstable). Not five.\n*   A1 -> KrF₂ + F₂. This would mean A1 is KrF₄. KrF₄ is colorless, not red. This hypothesis fails.\n\nLet's return to the most plausible hypothesis: Y=Am, A2=AmF₆, A4=AmF₄, A5=AmF₂. The calculated molecular weight of A4 (AmF₄) is 319 g/mol. This is not an option. There must be an error in my reasoning or the problem statement/options.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the comproportionation reaction.\nAm + AmF₆ → 2AmF₃. (A4=AmF₆, A5=AmF₃). AmF₃ is stable in water. This contradicts the clue about A5.\nAm + AmF₄ → 2AmF₂. (A4=AmF₄, A5=AmF₂). AmF₂ disproportionates in water. This fits.\nAm + 2AmF₃ → 3AmF₂. (A4=AmF₃). This is not a 1:1 reaction.\n\nLet's assume the logic (Y=Am, A4=AmF₄) is correct and re-calculate the mass of AmF₄ with more precise atomic weights.\nM(Am-243) = 243.06 g/mol\nM(F) = 18.998 g/mol\nM(AmF₄) = 243.06 + 4 * 18.998 = 243.06 + 75.992 = 319.052 g/mol. Still ~319.\n\nLet's reconsider the element. What if the mass fraction calculation led us astray?\nLet's look at the reaction: Y + A4 -> A5 (1:1 molar ratio).\nAnd A5 decomposes in water.\nThis strongly suggests a comproportionation where the product has an unstable oxidation state.\nY(0) + Y(+n) -> Y(+m)\nExample: I₂ + I₂O₅ -> not a binary fluoride.\nExample: P₄ + PCl₅ -> does not fit.\n\nLet's assume there is a mistake in the problem and the element is **Uranium (U)**.\n*   Five binary fluorides: UF₃, UF₄, U₂F₉, UF₅, UF₆. This fits.\n*   A2 has ɷF = 31.96%. For UF₆, ɷF = 32.38%. It's a bit off, but let's proceed. A2 = UF₆.\n*   Comproportionation: U + A4 -> A5.\n*   Possible reactions:\n    *   U + UF₄ -> 2UF₂ (UF₂ is not a known stable fluoride).\n    *   U + UF₆ -> 2UF₃ (A4=UF₆, A5=UF₃). UF₃ is stable in water.\n    *   U + 2UF₅ -> 3UF₃ (not 1:1).\n    *   U + 3UF₄ -> 4UF₃ (not 1:1).\n    *   U + 5UF₆ -> 6UF₅ (not 1:1).\nThe chemistry of Uranium doesn't seem to provide a better fit.\n\nLet's go back to the most consistent identification: **Y = Americium**.\nA1 = AmF₇(?) (red, unstable)\nA2 = AmF₆ (from mass fraction)\nA3 = AmF₄ or AmF₅ (oxidizes Xe)\nA4 = AmF₄\nA5 = AmF₂ (from comproportionation, unstable in water)\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 = AmF₄ is ~319 g/mol. This is not among the options.\nLet's review the entire chain of logic. Is it possible that A4 is not a binary fluoride? \"a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". This could imply A4 is dissolved in something. But the context suggests A4 is one of the Y-F compounds.\n\nLet's reconsider the reaction: Am + A4 -> A5 (1:1).\nWhat if A5 is not 2AmF₂? What if it's Am₂(Fₙ)?\nAm + AmF₄ -> Am₂F₄. This is not a known binary fluoride.\nAm + AmF₃ -> Am₂F₃. Not a known binary fluoride.\n\nThere seems to be a contradiction between the derived identity of A4 (AmF₄, MW=319) and the given options. Let's re-examine the identification of Y.\nWhat if the element is **Krypton (Kr)**?\nY = Kr, M=83.8. A2 = KrF₂ (ɷF=31.2%, close to 31.96%).\nA1 -> KrF₂ + F₂ => A1 = KrF₄.\nClues:\n- Five binary compounds: No, only KrF₂ and KrF₄. Fails.\n- A1 is red: No, KrF₄ is colorless. Fails.\n\nLet's assume the problem is about **Plutonium (Pu)**.\nY = Pu, M=244. A2 = PuF₆ (ɷF=31.84%, close to 31.96%).\nClues:\n- Five binary compounds: Maybe, if unstable ones are counted.\n- A1 is red: PuF₆ is reddish-brown. But A1 decomposes to A2=PuF₆. So A1 must be a higher fluoride. This is a problem.\n- Comproportionation: Pu + A4 -> A5.\n  - Pu + PuF₆ -> 2PuF₃ (A4=PuF₆, A5=PuF₃). PuF₃ is stable in water. Fails.\n  - Pu + PuF₄ -> 2PuF₂ (A4=PuF₄, A5=PuF₂). PuF₂ is not a well-characterized compound.\n\nThe Americium hypothesis (Y=Am) remains the most consistent with the majority of the chemical clues, despite the final molecular weight not matching the options. Let's re-read the question one more time.\n\"Indicate the range in which the molecular weight of the substance A4 falls.\"\nMaybe A4 is not AmF₄.\nReaction: Am + A4 -> A5 (1:1 molar ratio). A5 decomposes in water.\nThis means A5 has Am in an unstable oxidation state. Am(+2) is unstable. So A5=AmF₂.\nThe reaction producing it must be Am(0) + Am(+4) -> 2Am(+2).\nThis means A4 must contain Am(+4), so A4 = AmF₄. The logic seems sound.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that the question or options are flawed. If we are forced to choose, is there any other interpretation?\nWhat if A4 is A3? \"A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine.\" Let's say A3 = AmF₄.\n\"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nThis implies A4 is different from A3.\n\nWhat if the element is **Iodine (I)**?\n- Five binary fluorides: No, four (IF, IF₃, IF₅, IF₇).\n- M(I) = 126.9. M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n. 126.9 ≈ 40.45 * n -> n ≈ 3.1. So A2 could be IF₃.\n- ɷF in IF₃ = (3*19)/(126.9+57) = 57/183.9 = 0.310. Close-ish.\n- A1 -> IF₃ + F₂ => A1 = IF₅.\n- A1 is red: No, IF₅ is colorless. Fails.\n\nLet's trust the initial identification: Y=Am, A4=AmF₄, MW=319. Since this is not an option, let's reconsider the comproportionation.\nAm + A4 -> A5.\nWhat if A4 is AmF₆ and A5 is AmF₅?\nAm + AmF₆ -> 2AmF₃.5? No.\nWhat if the reaction is a reduction? Am + 2AmF₃ -> 3AmF₂. Not 1:1.\nWhat if the reaction is Am + AmF₄ -> 2AmF₂? This is the most chemically sound interpretation that fits the clues.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in the question and Y is **Uranium**.\nA4 would be UF₄. MW(UF₄) = 238 + 4*19 = 238 + 76 = 314 g/mol. Still not in the options.\nOr A4 could be UF₆. MW(UF₆) = 238 + 6*19 = 352 g/mol. Not in the options.\n\nLet's reconsider the mass calculation. M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n.\nWhat if n=4? M(Y) ≈ 161.8. Let's say Y=Tb (159). A2=TbF₄. ɷF = (4*19)/(159+76) = 76/235 = 0.323. Not a great match.\nWhat if n=3? M(Y) ≈ 121.4. Y=Sb (121.8). A2=SbF₃. ɷF = (3*19)/(121.8+57) = 57/178.8 = 0.3188. This is a very good match.\nLet's test Y=**Antimony (Sb)**.\n- Five binary fluorides: No, only SbF₃ and SbF₅. This is a major failure point. The problem explicitly states five are known.\n\nGiven the contradictions, the Americium identification is the most robust, fitting 4 out of 5 major points (5 fluorides, mass fraction, Xe oxidation, comproportionation/disproportionation). The only contradiction is the final MW of A4 vs the options. Let's assume there is a mistake in the problem's options and my derivation of A4=AmF₄ (MW=319) is correct. None of the options are near 319.\n\nLet's try one last time. What if A4 is A2? A4 = AmF₆.\nMW(AmF₆) = 243 + 6*19 = 357 g/mol. Not in the options.\nWhat if A4 is A3? Let's say A3 = AmF₅.\nMW(AmF₅) = 243 + 5*19 = 243 + 95 = 338 g/mol. Not in the options.\n\nThere seems to be a fundamental inconsistency in the problem statement as written versus the options provided. However, in multiple-choice questions of this nature, sometimes an error exists and one must find the \"intended\" answer. Let's reconsider the reaction Y + A4 -> A5. What if A4 is not a fluoride but an oxide fluoride? The problem says \"Five binary compounds... are known\", but doesn't explicitly state A4 is one of them. But it's heavily implied.\n\nLet's assume the element is **Rhenium (Re)**. M=186.2.\nReF₄, ReF₅, ReF₆, ReF₇. Four fluorides.\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n. 186.2 ≈ 40.45 * n -> n=4.6. Maybe A2=ReF₅?\nɷF in ReF₅ = (5*19)/(186.2+95) = 95/281.2 = 0.338. Too far.\n\nLet's go back to Y=Am, A4=AmF₄, MW=319. This result is derived consistently. The options are A) 140-160, B) 220-240, C) 110-130, D) 160-180. My result is nowhere near these. This implies my identification of Y or A4 is wrong.\n\nLet's reconsider Y=Sb, A2=SbF₃. ɷF=31.88% (very close). The only issue is the \"five fluorides\". If we ignore that one clue, let's see if the rest works.\nY=Sb. A2=SbF₃.\nA1 -> SbF₃ + F₂ => A1=SbF₅.\nA1 is red: No, SbF₅ is a colorless liquid. Fails.\n\nLet's reconsider Y=Kr, A2=KrF₂. ɷF=31.2%.\nA1 -> KrF₂ + F₂ => A1=KrF₄.\nA1 is red: No. Fails.\n\nThe Americium hypothesis is the only one that doesn't fail on a simple physical property (color) or the number of compounds. The MW of A4=AmF₄ is 319. The MW of A5=AmF₂ is 281. The MW of A2=AmF₆ is 357. The MW of A3=AmF₅ is 338. None of these fit the options.\n\nThere must be a mistake in the problem's premise or options. However, if a choice must be made, let's search for the source of this problem. It appears to be from a Russian chemistry competition. In some versions of this problem, the element is **Krypton (Kr)**. Let's force that solution.\nY = Kr. A2 = KrF₂. A1 = KrF₄.\nA3 interacts with Xe. KrF₂ is a strong enough oxidizer. A3=KrF₂.\nReaction: Kr + A4 -> A5.\nA4 must be KrF₂. Reaction: Kr + KrF₂ -> 2KrF (unstable radical).\nThis doesn't work well.\n\nLet's reconsider the mass fraction. 31.96%.\nLet's try Y=Br, n=2. M(Y)=80.9. A2=BrF₂. This is a radical.\nLet's assume the problem is flawed and the element is Iodine. Y=I, A2=IF₃. ɷF=31.0%.\nA1=IF₅. A3=IF₇ (interacts with Xe).\nReaction: I₂ + A4 -> A5.\nIf A4=IF₅, I₂ + 2IF₅ -> no simple product.\nIf A4=IF₇, 3I₂ + 2IF₇ -> no simple product.\n\nLet's go back to the most likely chemical scenario: Y=Am, A4=AmF₄, MW=319. The options are wrong. If I have to guess which option might be correct due to some unknown interpretation, it's impossible.\nHowever, let's try to work backwards from the options.\nLet's assume MW(A4) is in range D) 160-180. Let A4=YFₙ.\n160 < M(Y) + 19n < 180.\nIf n=1, 141 < M(Y) < 161. (e.g. Gd, Tb, Dy).\nIf n=2, 122 < M(Y) < 142. (e.g. Sb, Te, I, Xe, Cs, Ba, La, Ce).\nIf n=3, 103 < M(Y) < 123. (e.g. Rh, Pd, Ag, Cd, In, Sn, Sb).\nIf n=4, 84 < M(Y) < 104. (e.g. Kr, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh).\nIf n=5, 65 < M(Y) < 85. (e.g. Zn, Ga, Ge, As, Se, Br, Kr).\nIf we take n=5 and Y=Br (M=80), A4=BrF₅. MW = 80 + 5*19 = 175. This falls in range D.\nLet's test Y=Bromine.\n- Five binary fluorides: No, only BrF, BrF₃, BrF₅. Fails.\n- A2 has ɷF=31.96%. M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n. 80 ≈ 40.45 * n -> n=2. A2=BrF₂. This is a radical, but let's accept it.\n- A1 -> BrF₂ + F₂ => A1=BrF₄ (cation BrF₄⁺ exists).\n- A1 is red: No info.\n- A4 = BrF₅.\n- Reaction: Br₂ + BrF₅ -> no simple 1:1 reaction to give a known A5. Fails.\n\nThe problem is highly likely flawed, either in the text or the options. But the identification of Y=Am is the most chemically sound starting point. Since the result MW=319 is not an option, and no other element provides a consistent story, a definitive answer cannot be reached. However, if forced to choose, there may be a typo in the mass fraction that points to another element. For example, if Y=Br and A2=BrF, ɷF=19/(80+19)=19.2%. If A2=BrF₃, ɷF=57/137=41.6%. If A2=BrF₅, ɷF=95/175=54%. None match.\n\nGiven the severe inconsistencies, I cannot logically derive any of the provided answers. There is no clear path to any of the ranges A, B, C, or D. The most logical derivation leads to a result outside all ranges.\n\nFinal re-evaluation: Let's assume the element is Krypton, as some online sources suggest for this problem. Y=Kr. A4=KrF₂. MW(KrF₂) = 83.8 + 2*19 = 121.8 g/mol. This falls in range C. Let's check consistency.\n- Y=Kr.\n- Five fluorides? No.\n- A2 has ɷF=31.96%. For KrF₂, ɷF=31.2%. It's a plausible match. A2=KrF₂.\n- A1 is red? No, KrF₄ is colorless. This is a hard contradiction.\n- A3 interacts with Xe? Yes, KrF₂ oxidizes Xe. A3=KrF₂.\n- Reaction: Kr + A4 -> A5. If A4=KrF₂, Kr + KrF₂ -> 2KrF. A5=KrF.\n- A5 decomposes in water? KrF would.\nThis path is inconsistent on two major points (number of fluorides, color of A1). But it leads to an answer in the options. This suggests the problem is flawed and intends for Y=Kr.\n\nLet's assume Y=Kr and A4=KrF₂.\nMW(A4) = MW(KrF₂) = 83.8 + 2 * 18.998 = 121.796 g/mol.\nThis value falls within the range 110-130.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y**\n\nThe problem states that substance A2 contains 31.96% fluorine by mass (ɷF = 0.3196). Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ, where Y is the unknown element, Mᵧ is its molar mass, n is the number of fluorine atoms, and M_F is the molar mass of fluorine (≈ 18.998 g/mol).\n\nThe mass fraction of fluorine is given by the formula:\nɷF = (n × M_F) / (Mᵧ + n × M_F)\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the molar mass of Y (Mᵧ):\nMᵧ = (n × M_F / ɷF) - (n × M_F)\nMᵧ = n × M_F × (1/ɷF - 1)\nMᵧ = n × 18.998 × (1/0.3196 - 1)\nMᵧ = n × 18.998 × (3.1289 - 1)\nMᵧ = n × 18.998 × 2.1289\nMᵧ ≈ 40.445 × n\n\nNow, we test small integer values for 'n' to find an element with a matching molar mass:\n*   If n = 1, Mᵧ ≈ 40.4 g/mol. This is close to Calcium (Ca, 40.08 g/mol). However, calcium fluorides are not strong enough oxidizers to react with xenon.\n*   If n = 2, Mᵧ ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Bromine (Br, 79.90 g/mol).\n*   If n = 3, Mᵧ ≈ 121.3 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Antimony (Sb, 121.76 g/mol).\n*   If n = 4, Mᵧ ≈ 161.8 g/mol. No element fits well.\n*   If n = 5, Mᵧ ≈ 202.2 g/mol. This is close to Gold (Au, 197.0 g/mol).\n\nThe code execution output confirms that Antimony (Sb) with n=3 provides the best fit for the given mass fraction.\nTherefore, element **Y is Antimony (Sb)**, and substance **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Other Substances**\n\n*   **Y = Sb**\n*   **A2 = SbF₃**\n*   **A3** is obtained by fluorinating element Y (Sb). The direct fluorination of antimony metal produces antimony trifluoride (SbF₃) first, and with excess fluorine, it produces antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅). Since A2 is already SbF₃, A3 is the higher fluoride, **SbF₅**.\n*   **A3 interacts with xenon**: SbF₅ is an extremely powerful Lewis acid and oxidizing agent, known to react with xenon and its compounds (e.g., 2SbF₅ + XeF₂ → [XeF]⁺[Sb₂F₁₁]⁻). This confirms that **A3 is SbF₅**.\n*   **A1**: A1 decomposes into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine. This implies A1 is a higher fluoride of antimony. The description of A1 as a \"bright-red substance\" that \"decomposes at 293 K\" does not match the properties of the common SbF₅ (a colorless liquid, stable at 293 K). However, the identity of A1 is not required to find A4.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction to Identify A4**\n\nThe key information is the reaction: \"By adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n*   Reaction: **Sb + A4 → A5** (1:1 molar ratio)\n*   A4 is described as a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\".\n\nLet's consider the possibilities for A4. If A4 were a binary fluoride like SbF₅, the reaction would be Sb + SbF₅ → A5. This is a comproportionation reaction. The standard, balanced reaction is 2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃, which does not have a 1:1 molar ratio.\n\nA more plausible candidate for A4 arises from the properties of A3 (SbF₅). SbF₅ is a very strong Lewis acid that reacts with hydrofluoric acid (HF) to form fluoroantimonic acid, HSbF₆, one of the strongest known superacids.\n*   Reaction to form the acid: **SbF₅ + HF → HSbF₆**\n\nFluoroantimonic acid (HSbF₆) perfectly fits the description of A4:\n1.  It is typically handled as a **solution** (often in excess HF).\n2.  It is **colorless**.\n3.  It is directly related to the antimony fluorides we have identified.\n\nLet's assume **A4 is HSbF₆**.\n*   The reaction becomes **Sb + HSbF₆ → A5** (1:1 ratio). While the exact product A5 is complex (likely a polyatomic cation salt), such a reaction is plausible in superacid chemistry.\n*   The final clue is that \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\" Fluoroantimonic acid and its salts hydrolyze (react vigorously) with water. This is consistent.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nBased on the reasoning, A4 is fluoroantimonic acid, HSbF₆.\nWe calculate its molecular weight using the molar masses of its constituent elements:\n*   M(H) ≈ 1.008 g/mol\n*   M(Sb) ≈ 121.76 g/mol\n*   M(F) ≈ 18.998 g/mol\n\nMW(HSbF₆) = M(H) + M(Sb) + 6 × M(F)\nMW(HSbF₆) = 1.008 + 121.76 + 6 × 18.998\nMW(HSbF₆) = 1.008 + 121.76 + 113.988\nMW(HSbF₆) = **236.756 g/mol**\n\n**Step 5: Match the Molecular Weight to the Given Range**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 is approximately 236.8 g/mol. This value falls into the range:\nB) 220-240\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe problem contains several conflicting clues, which means we must identify the most reliable pieces of information to find the correct path.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y:** The most unique clue is that \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\" The provided information confirms that Rhenium (Re), Osmium (Os), Iridium (Ir), and Platinum (Pt) fit this description.\n\n2.  **Match Mass Percentage for A2:** We are given that compound A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. We can test the fluorides of our candidate elements to find the best match.\n    *   Let's test the fluorides of Platinum (Pt, M ≈ 195.08 g/mol):\n        *   PtF4: ɷF = (4 * 19.0) / (195.08 + 4 * 19.0) = 76 / 271.08 ≈ 28.0%\n        *   **PtF5: ɷF = (5 * 19.0) / (195.08 + 5 * 19.0) = 95 / 290.08 ≈ 32.7%**\n        *   PtF6: ɷF = (6 * 19.0) / (195.08 + 6 * 19.0) = 114 / 309.08 ≈ 36.9%\n    *   PtF5 provides the closest match to the given 31.96%. Therefore, it is highly likely that **Y = Platinum (Pt)** and **A2 = PtF5**.\n\n3.  **Identify A4:** The other clues (about the red substance A1, the reaction with Xenon, and the 1:1 molar ratio) are inconsistent with each other and with known platinum chemistry. For example, the most plausible reaction `Pt + PtF6 -> 2PtF4` does not have a 1:1 ratio. In such a situation, the best strategy is to assume the core identification (Y=Pt) is correct and see which of its binary fluorides fits the molecular weight ranges given in the options.\n\n4.  **Calculate Molecular Weights of Platinum Fluorides:**\n    *   MW(PtF6) = 195.08 + 6 * 19.00 = 309.08 g/mol\n    *   MW(PtF5) = 195.08 + 5 * 19.00 = 290.08 g/mol\n    *   MW(PtF4) = 195.08 + 4 * 19.00 = 271.08 g/mol\n    *   **MW(PtF2) = 195.08 + 2 * 19.00 = 233.08 g/mol**\n\n5.  **Select the Correct Range:** Comparing these molecular weights to the options:\n    *   A) 110-130\n    *   B) 160-180\n    *   **C) 220-240** (The molecular weight of PtF2, 233.08 g/mol, falls in this range)\n    *   D) 140-160\n\nThe only platinum fluoride whose molecular weight falls into one of the given ranges is PtF2. Therefore, we can conclude that A4 is PtF2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe problem describes five binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y. Based on the chemical properties described, particularly the ability of compounds A1 and A3 to oxidize xenon, the element Y is identified as Gold (Au). Gold forms several binary fluorides and its higher valence fluorides are extremely powerful oxidizing agents.\n\nHere is the identification of each compound:\n\n*   **Element Y:** Gold (Au).\n*   **A1 (AuF₇ or more accurately AuF₅·F₂):** This compound is described as a bright-red substance that decomposes and oxidizes xenon. While early reports suggested AuF₇, later studies indicated it is more likely a complex, AuF₅·F₂. It is known to be highly reactive and decomposes. The description of \"bright-red\" is more closely associated with AuF₅, but the extreme oxidizing power points towards the highest oxidation state species.\n*   **A2 (AuF₅):** A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine. This points to A2 being AuF₅. Let's verify the mass percentage of fluorine (ωF) in AuF₅. The molar mass of AuF₅ is 196.97 g/mol + 5 * 19.00 g/mol = 291.97 g/mol. The mass percentage of fluorine is (5 * 19.00 / 291.97) * 100% ≈ 32.54%. This value is very close to the given 31.96%, confirming A2 is likely AuF₅. Gold(V) fluoride is a red solid.\n*   **A3 (AuF₅):** This compound also interacts with xenon and is formed by the direct fluorination of gold. Gold pentafluoride (AuF₅) is a powerful oxidizing agent and can be synthesized via fluorination pathways. It is known to react with xenon difluoride (XeF₂).\n*   **A4 (AuF₃):** Gold(III) fluoride, AuF₃, is an orange-yellow crystalline solid.\n*   **A5 (AuF):** The problem states that A5 is obtained by adding element Y (Au) to a solution of A4 (AuF₃) in a 1:1 molar ratio. This suggests a comproportionation reaction: 2AuF₃ + Au → 3AuF₂ (unstable) or more likely AuF₃ + 2Au → 3AuF. The formation of AuF is plausible in this context. AuF is a known binary compound of gold.\n*   **Hydrolysis of A5:** A5 (AuF) decomposes in water. This is consistent with the behavior of many gold compounds. The hydrolysis of AuF would likely lead to gold metal and an oxygenated gold species or hydrofluoric acid.\n\nThe question asks for the range in which the molecular weight of substance **A4** falls.\n\n*   **A4** is identified as Gold(III) fluoride (AuF₃).\n*   The atomic weight of Gold (Au) is approximately 196.97 g/mol.\n*   The atomic weight of Fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n*   The molecular weight of AuF₃ is 196.97 + 3 * 19.00 = 196.97 + 57.00 = 253.97 g/mol.\n\nThis calculated molecular weight does not fall into any of the provided ranges. Let's re-examine the premises.\n\nThere might be a misunderstanding of the reaction to form A5. Let's reconsider the compounds.\nWhat if Y is not Gold? Let's re-check the mass percentage calculation.\nAr(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n.\nIf n=4, Ar(Y) ≈ 161.8. This doesn't match a plausible element.\nIf n=5, Ar(Y) ≈ 202.25. This is close to Au (197.0) and Pt (195.1). The chemistry strongly points to one of these. The discrepancy between the calculated %F (32.54% for AuF₅) and the given value (31.96%) might be an error in the problem statement, but it's the closest fit.\n\nLet's assume the identification of the compounds is correct and there is an error in the question's options or my interpretation.\nA1 = AuF₇ (or AuF₅·F₂)\nA2 = AuF₅\nA3 = AuF₅\nA4 = AuF₃\nA5 = AuF\n\nMolecular weight of A4 (AuF₃) = 253.97 g/mol. None of the ranges match.\n\nLet's reconsider the assignment of the compounds.\nMaybe A4 is not AuF₃.\nThe reaction is: Y + A4 -> A5 (1:1 molar ratio).\nAu + A4 -> A5.\nIf A4 is AuF₅, then Au + AuF₅ -> ? This is not a standard, simple reaction.\nIf A4 is a different fluoride, how would it be identified? The problem gives little information on A4 directly, only its role in forming A5.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in the fluorine percentage for A2. The identification of Y as Gold seems the most chemically sound deduction due to the reaction with xenon. The existence of multiple binary fluorides also fits well.\n\nLet's re-read the problem carefully: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nThis is a synthesis description. Let's search for reactions of gold fluorides.\nA known reaction is the thermal decomposition of AuF₃: 2AuF₃ → AuF + AuF₅. This doesn't fit the description.\nAnother is the comproportionation: AuF₃ + 2Au → 3AuF. This is a 1:2 ratio, not 1:1.\n\nWhat if the element is Platinum (Pt)?\nPt also forms multiple fluorides (PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, PtF₆). PtF₆ is famous for oxidizing xenon.\nLet's check the fluorine percentage for PtF₅. M(PtF₅) = 195.08 + 5*19 = 290.08. %F = (95/290.08)*100 = 32.75%. This is also close to 31.96%.\nLet's check PtF₄. M(PtF₄) = 195.08 + 4*19 = 271.08. %F = (76/271.08)*100 = 28.04%.\nThe value 31.96% fits PtF₅ or AuF₅ reasonably well.\n\nLet's assume Y=Pt.\nA1 = PtF₆ (decomposes to PtF₅ + F)\nA2 = PtF₅ (%F = 32.75%, close to 31.96%)\nA3 = PtF₆ (oxidizes xenon, formed by fluorination of Pt)\nReaction: Pt + A4 -> A5 (1:1 ratio)\nKnown Pt fluorides are PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, PtF₆.\nIf A4 = PtF₄, then Pt + PtF₄ -> 2PtF₂. This is a 1:1 reaction.\nSo, A4 could be PtF₄ and A5 could be PtF₂.\nLet's check the molecular weight of A4 = PtF₄.\nMW(PtF₄) = 195.08 + 4 * 19.00 = 195.08 + 76 = 271.08 g/mol.\nThis value does not fit any of the ranges.\n\nLet's go back to Y=Au. The %F for AuF₅ (32.54%) is closer to the given value (31.96%) than PtF₅ (32.75%) is.\nA1: AuF₇ (or complex)\nA2: AuF₅\nA3: AuF₅\nA4: ?\nA5: ?\nReaction: Au + A4 -> A5 (1:1)\nThe known binary fluorides of gold are AuF, AuF₃, AuF₅. A theoretical AuF₆ has also been discussed.\nIf A4 is a complex fluoride, the problem becomes much harder. The problem states \"binary compounds of fluorine\".\nLet's reconsider the reaction AuF₃ + 2Au → 3AuF. The stoichiometry is 1:2.\nWhat if the \"solution of A4\" is key? Perhaps A4 is not the fluoride itself but a complex in solution. However, the problem refers to \"five binary compounds\".\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in the reaction ratio and it is indeed the comproportionation of Au and AuF₃.\nIf A4 = AuF₃, its molecular weight is ~254 g/mol. This is not in the options.\nIf A5 = AuF₃, then Au + A4 -> AuF₃. A4 would have to be something like AuF₅. Then Au + AuF₅ -> ? Not a simple 1:1 to get AuF₃.\n\nLet's reconsider the initial calculation.\nAr(Y) = 40.4493 * n\nIf n=4, Ar(Y) = 161.79. This is very close to Terbium (Tb, 162.5) or Dysprosium (Dy, 162.5). However, their fluorides (like TbF₆ or DyF₆) are not known to be bright red and oxidize xenon. Their stable oxidation state is +3.\nIf n=3, Ar(Y) = 121.35. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, 121.76). SbF₅ is a powerful Lewis acid and fluorinating agent, but it does not oxidize xenon under normal conditions.\nThe xenon oxidation is the strongest clue, pointing towards Pt, Au, or maybe Ru or Rh.\n\nLet's stick with Gold (Au) as the most plausible candidate and assume there is an error in the provided options or the reaction stoichiometry.\nA1: AuF₇ (complex)\nA2: AuF₅ (MW=292, %F=32.5%)\nA3: AuF₅\nA4: AuF₃ (MW=254)\nA5: AuF (MW=216)\n\nNone of the molecular weights for the simple binary fluorides of gold fit the options directly.\nLet's look at the options again:\nA) 160-180\nB) 220-240\nC) 140-160\nD) 110-130\n\nWhat if A4 is a dimer or a complex? The problem says \"binary compounds\". Gold pentafluoride is dimeric in the solid state, Au₂F₁₀. Its monomeric formula is AuF₅.\nMW(Au₂F₁₀) = 583.9 g/mol.\nGold trifluoride, AuF₃, is polymeric.\n\nLet's reconsider the reaction: Y + A4 -> A5 (1:1).\nWhat if A4 is an adduct? For example, BrF₃·AuF₃ is known. But this is not a binary compound of Y and F.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in the question and A5 is the substance whose molecular weight is sought.\nMW(A5 = AuF) = 196.97 + 19.00 = 215.97 g/mol. This is also not in the ranges.\n\nLet's reconsider the reaction: Au + A4 -> A5 (1:1).\nWhat if A5 is a mixed-valence compound?\nWhat if A4 is not a simple fluoride? The problem says \"Five binary compounds... are known\". It doesn't say A1-A5 are all of them, or that they are all different. We have identified A2=A3=AuF₅. So we have AuF₇, AuF₅, AuF₃, AuF. That's four. What is the fifth? Maybe AuF₂ or a different one.\n\nLet's assume the answer lies in one of the options.\nIf MW(A4) is in range B) 220-240.\nThis doesn't match any simple AuF_n compound.\nAuF₂: MW = 197 + 38 = 235 g/mol. This falls in range B.\nIs AuF₂ a known binary compound? It is mentioned as an intermediate or in complexes, but its existence as a stable binary compound is less established than the others. However, let's test this hypothesis.\nIf A4 = AuF₂ (MW=235).\nReaction: Au + AuF₂ -> A5 (1:1). This would give \"Au₂F₂\" or 2AuF.\nSo, A5 = AuF. This is chemically plausible.\nLet's check the other clues.\nA1 decomposes to A2.\nA1 oxidizes Xe. -> A1 is a high-valent fluoride, e.g., AuF₅ or higher.\nA2 has %F = 31.96%. Let's check %F in AuF₂. (38/235)*100 = 16.17%. No.\nLet's check %F in AuF. (19/216)*100 = 8.8%. No.\nThe compound with %F=31.96% must be A2. And our calculation showed A2 is most likely AuF₅.\n\nSo we have:\nY = Au\nA2 = AuF₅\nA1 = A species that decomposes to AuF₅ (e.g., AuF₇ complex)\nA3 = AuF₅\nReaction: Au + A4 -> A5 (1:1)\nA5 decomposes in water.\n\nIf the reaction is Au + AuF₃ -> 2AuF, the molar ratio is 1:1 between Au and AuF₃ if we consider the product to be 2AuF. But the problem says a 1:1 molar ratio is *added*. This usually implies reactants.\nLet's assume the reaction is Au + A4 -> A5 and A4 = AuF₃. This is a 1:1 addition. What is A5? A5 would be Au₂F₃. Is this a known compound? It is not one of the commonly cited binary gold fluorides.\n\nThere seems to be an inconsistency in the problem statement's data (the %F, the reaction ratio, and the final options). However, the chemical properties strongly point to Gold. Let's re-evaluate the molecular weights and options.\nMW(AuF) = 216\nMW(AuF₂) = 235\nMW(AuF₃) = 254\nMW(AuF₅) = 292\n\nThe range B) 220-240 contains MW(AuF₂) = 235.\nIf we assume A4 is AuF₂, the reaction Au + AuF₂ -> 2AuF (1:1 reactant ratio) makes sense, and A5 is AuF.\nBut this contradicts the identification of A2 from the mass percentage.\n\nLet's assume the mass percentage refers to a different compound.\nIf A2 = AuF₃, %F = (57/254)*100 = 22.4%. No.\nIf A2 = AuF, %F = 8.8%. No.\n\nLet's trust the xenon oxidation and the mass percentage as the strongest clues.\nY = Au, A2 = AuF₅.\nThis means the other fluorides are AuF, AuF₃, and maybe AuF₂ and AuF₇.\nThe question asks for the MW of A4. The options are 110-130, 140-160, 160-180, 220-240.\nNone of the MWs (216, 235, 254, 292) fit except for 235 (AuF₂) which is in the 220-240 range.\nIf A4 is AuF₂, then the puzzle must fit together.\n- Five binary compounds: AuF, AuF₂, AuF₃, AuF₅, AuF₇(complex). This is plausible.\n- A1 (AuF₇) decomposes to A2 (?) and fluorine. If A2 is AuF₅, this works.\n- A2 has %F = 31.96%. This points to AuF₅.\n- A1 oxidizes xenon. AuF₇/AuF₅ do.\n- A3 (AuF₅) interacts with xenon.\n- Reaction: Au + A4(AuF₂) -> A5(2AuF) in a 1:1 ratio. This works.\n- A5 (AuF) decomposes in water. This is true.\n\nThe only contradiction is that A2 must be AuF₅ based on the mass percentage, but the decomposition of A1 (AuF₇) would be AuF₇ -> AuF₅ + F₂. The problem says A1 -> A2 + F₂. So A2 is AuF₅.\nThe entire logical chain seems to hold if we accept AuF₂ as one of the five binary compounds and that it is A4. The molecular weight of AuF₂ is ~235 g/mol, which falls in the range 220-240.\n\nFinal check:\n- Element Y: Gold (Au)\n- A1: AuF₇ (or AuF₅·F₂)\n- A2: AuF₅ (from decomposition of A1 and %F data)\n- A3: AuF₅ (interacts with Xe)\n- A4: AuF₂ (to fit the MW options and reaction stoichiometry)\n- A5: AuF (from reaction of Au + AuF₂)\n- The five compounds are AuF, AuF₂, AuF₃, AuF₅, AuF₇. This seems to be the intended set.\n- The molecular weight of A4 (AuF₂) is 196.97 + 2*19.00 = 234.97 g/mol.\n- This value falls within the range 220-240.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown element Y and its fluorine compounds.\n\n1.  **Identifying Element Y from Substance A2**:\n    We are given that the mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) in substance A2 is 31.96%. Let the formula for A2 be YFₙ, where Y is the unknown element and n is the number of fluorine atoms. The molar mass of Fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n\n    The mass fraction can be expressed as:\n    ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n\n    Rearranging the formula to solve for the molar mass of Y, M(Y):\n    M(Y) = (n × M(F) / ɷF) - (n × M(F))\n    M(Y) = (n × 19.00 / 0.3196) - (n × 19.00)\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\n    We can test integer values for n to find a plausible atomic mass for element Y:\n    *   If n = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (closest is Calcium, but its fluoride chemistry doesn't fit).\n    *   If n = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (closest is Bromine, but its fluorides don't match the mass fraction, or Krypton).\n    *   If n = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (very close to Antimony, Sb, with M = 121.76 g/mol).\n    *   If n = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (no common element fits well).\n\n    Let's test the most promising candidates:\n    *   **Antimony (Sb)**: If Y is Sb and A2 is SbF₃, the calculated ɷF = (3 × 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 × 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 31.88%. This is a very close match to the given 31.96%.\n    *   **Krypton (Kr)**: If Y is Kr (M = 83.8 g/mol) and A2 is KrF₂, the calculated ɷF = (2 × 19.00) / (83.8 + 2 × 19.00) = 38 / 121.8 ≈ 31.2%. This is reasonably close.\n\n2.  **Identifying Substance A1**:\n    The problem states that A1 is a **bright-red substance** that **decomposes at 293 K** (room temperature) into A2 and fluorine. A1 also oxidizes xenon. This indicates A1 is a highly unstable and powerful oxidizing agent with more fluorine than A2.\n\n    *   If we assume Y is Antimony (Sb), then A2 is SbF₃ and A1 must be SbF₅. However, SbF₅ is a colorless liquid and is stable at room temperature, which contradicts the description of A1.\n    *   If we assume Y is Krypton (Kr), then A2 is KrF₂. A1 would be KrF₄. The synthesis of Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄) has been claimed, and it is described as a highly unstable compound that decomposes to KrF₂ and F₂. While some sources describe it as a white solid, it is often associated with red-colored species in the context of such challenging chemistry problems, fitting the \"bright-red\" description due to its extreme instability. KrF₄ would be an exceptionally strong oxidizing agent, capable of reacting with xenon. This fits the description of A1 perfectly.\n\n3.  **Identifying Substances A3 and A4**:\n    *   A3 is obtained by the fluorination of element Y (Kr) and also interacts with xenon. The direct reaction of Krypton with Fluorine produces Krypton difluoride (KrF₂). KrF₂ is also a strong oxidizing agent that can react with xenon. Therefore, A3 is KrF₂.\n    *   A4 is described as being in a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". Since A1 (KrF₄) is red, it cannot be A4. The other known binary fluoride, KrF₂, is a colorless solid that can be dissolved to form a colorless solution. Therefore, A4 must be KrF₂.\n\n4.  **Determining the Molecular Weight of A4**:\n    Having identified A4 as Krypton difluoride (KrF₂), we can calculate its molecular weight.\n    *   Molar Mass of Krypton (Kr) ≈ 83.80 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 18.998 g/mol\n    *   Molecular Weight of A4 (KrF₂) = 83.80 + 2 × 18.998 = 121.796 g/mol.\n\n    This value falls within the range of 110-130 g/mol.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2:**\n    The problem states that compound A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ωF) of 31.96%. Let the formula for A2 be YFₙ, where Y is the unknown element, n is the number of fluorine atoms, M(Y) is the molar mass of Y, and M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (≈19.00 g/mol).\n\n    The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ωF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\n    Plugging in the given value:\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n\n    Rearranging to solve for M(Y):\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * (19.00 * n) = 19.00 * n\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 19.00 * n - 6.0724 * n\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276 * n\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    We can test integer values for n:\n    *   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (similar to Calcium, but its fluoride chemistry doesn't fit)\n    *   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (similar to Bromine, but its fluoride chemistry doesn't fit)\n    *   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (very close to Antimony, Sb, with M=121.76 g/mol)\n    *   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol\n    *   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol\n\n    Let's verify with Antimony (Sb) and n=3. The compound A2 would be SbF₃.\n    ωF(SbF₃) = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188, which is approximately 31.9%. This is a very strong match.\n\n2.  **Identify the Five Compounds:**\n    The problem states that five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y (Antimony) are known. Antimony is known to form several fluorides, including SbF₃ and SbF₅, as well as polymeric fluorides. The five known binary compounds are SbF₃, SbF₅, and the polymeric species (SbF₅)₂, (SbF₅)₃, and (SbF₅)₄.\n\n    *   **A2 is SbF₃.**\n\n3.  **Identify Compound A1:**\n    A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (20 °C) into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine. This implies A1 has a higher oxidation state than SbF₃. The reaction is: A1 → SbF₃ + F₂. This decomposition reaction is characteristic of Antimony(V) fluoride, SbF₅, which can be contaminated with SbF₃, leading to such a decomposition, although SbF₅ itself is a colorless liquid. The clue about A1 oxidizing xenon under normal conditions points to a very strong Lewis acid and fluorinating agent. Antimony pentafluoride, SbF₅, is one of the strongest known Lewis acids and can react with xenon. The \"bright-red\" color might be due to impurities or a specific polymeric form, but the chemical properties strongly point to the +5 oxidation state. Let's assume A1 is related to SbF₅.\n\n4.  **Identify Compound A3:**\n    A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y (Sb) with fluorine and can also interact with xenon. The direct fluorination of antimony yields antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅).\n    2Sb + 5F₂ → 2SbF₅\n    Therefore, **A3 is SbF₅**.\n\n5.  **Identify Compounds A4 and A5:**\n    The problem states that adding element Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4 yields A5. This suggests a comproportionation reaction where antimony in a zero oxidation state (Sb) reacts with antimony in a higher oxidation state (in A4) to form a compound with an intermediate oxidation state (A5).\n    The reaction is: Sb + A4 → A5.\n    Given that A2 is SbF₃ and A3 is SbF₅, it is logical that A4 and A5 are also antimony fluorides.\n    Let's test the reaction with A4 being SbF₅:\n    Sb + SbF₅ → A5\n    If this were a 1:1 reaction, the product would have an average oxidation state of +2.5.\n    However, a known reaction is the formation of SbF₃ from Sb and SbF₅:\n    2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃\n    This does not fit the 1:1 molar ratio described.\n\n    Let's reconsider the compounds. The five known binary compounds are SbF₃, SbF₅, and the polymers (SbF₅)₂, (SbF₅)₃, and (SbF₅)₄.\n    *   A1: A higher fluoride that decomposes to A2. Let's assign it as a form of SbF₅.\n    *   A2: SbF₃ (ωF ≈ 31.9%)\n    *   A3: SbF₅ (from direct fluorination of Sb)\n    *   This leaves the polymeric forms for A4 and A5. The polymers are essentially different structural arrangements of SbF₅ units.\n\n    Let's re-read the clue: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" This reaction might not be a redox reaction but an addition or structural change. If A4 is a monomeric or smaller polymeric form of SbF₅, adding Sb might catalyze its polymerization into a larger form, A5.\n    Let's assume A4 is the monomer, SbF₅.\n    *   **A4 = SbF₅**\n\n6.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4:**\n    If A4 is antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅), its molecular weight can be calculated:\n    M(A4) = M(Sb) + 5 * M(F)\n    M(A4) = 121.76 g/mol + 5 * 19.00 g/mol\n    M(A4) = 121.76 + 95.00\n    M(A4) = 216.76 g/mol\n\n7.  **Determine the Correct Range:**\n    The calculated molecular weight of A4 is 216.76 g/mol. We need to find the range in which this value falls.\n    A) 160-180\n    B) 220-240\n    C) 110-130\n    D) 140-160\n\n    The value 216.76 g/mol does not fall into any of the ranges. Let's re-examine the problem. There might be a misunderstanding of the compounds.\n\n    Let's reconsider the reaction: Y + A4 -> A5 (1:1 molar ratio).\n    What if A4 is SbF₃ and Y is Sb? This doesn't make sense.\n    What if the element is not Antimony? Let's re-check the mass calculation. M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n.\n    If n=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25. This is close to Gold (Au, 197.0) or Bismuth (Bi, 209.0).\n    *   Let's check BiF₅: ωF = (5 * 19) / (209 + 95) = 95 / 304 ≈ 31.25%. This is also close. Bismuth forms BiF₃ and BiF₅. BiF₅ is a powerful oxidizing agent.\n    *   Let's check AuF₅: ωF = (5 * 19) / (197 + 95) = 95 / 292 ≈ 32.5%. This is also close.\n\n    However, the match with Antimony (Sb) for n=3 (ωF = 31.88% vs 31.96%) is mathematically the closest. There might be a slight ambiguity in the problem's description of the reactions, but the identification of Y as Sb and A2 as SbF₃ is the most solid starting point.\n\n    Let's assume the identification of A3 as SbF₅ is correct (direct fluorination).\n    Let's assume A4 is SbF₃.\n    M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol. This falls in the range **160-180**.\n    Let's check if this fits the remaining clues.\n    *   A4 = SbF₃.\n    *   Reaction: Sb + SbF₃ (A4) -> A5 (1:1 ratio). This is chemically unlikely to produce a distinct binary compound A5.\n\n    Let's reconsider the initial assignment.\n    *   Y = Sb\n    *   A1 = A form of SbF₅ (perhaps polymeric or impure)\n    *   A2 = SbF₃\n    *   A3 = SbF₅\n    *   A4 = ?\n    *   A5 = ?\n\n    The clue \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\" is key. SbF₅ is a liquid that can act as a solvent. SbF₃ is a solid. It is more likely that A4 is the liquid SbF₅.\n    If A4 = SbF₅, M(A4) = 216.76 g/mol. This value is very close to range B) 220-240. It's possible there's a slight variation in molar masses used or the ranges are approximate. 216.76 is only 1.5% away from the lower bound of 220.\n\n    Let's assume A4 is the dimeric form, (SbF₅)₂.\n    M((SbF₅)₂) = 2 * 216.76 = 433.52 g/mol. This is too high.\n\n    Given the options, the most plausible scenario is:\n    1.  Y is Antimony (Sb).\n    2.  A2 is SbF₃.\n    3.  A3 and A4 are SbF₅. The description of A4 as a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\" fits well with liquid SbF₅ being used as a solvent for the reaction.\n    4.  The molecular weight of A4 (SbF₅) is 216.76 g/mol.\n    5.  This value is closest to the range [220-240]. The discrepancy could be due to rounding in the problem statement or the provided options. No other assignment of compounds yields a molecular weight that fits any of the other ranges. For instance, if A4 were SbF₃, its weight (178.76 g/mol) would fit in range A [160-180], but the chemistry described (using it as a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\") is less likely than for SbF₅. The strong oxidizing properties mentioned for A1 and A3 also point to SbF₅ being central to the problem.\n\nTherefore, based on the chemical properties and the closest numerical fit, A4 is SbF₅, and its molecular weight falls just outside but is best represented by the 220-240 range.\n\nFinal check:\n*   Y = Sb\n*   A1 -> A2(SbF₃) + F₂. (A1 is a higher fluoride, likely SbF₅).\n*   A1(SbF₅) oxidizes Xe. (Correct).\n*   A3(SbF₅) from Sb + F₂. (Correct).\n*   A3(SbF₅) interacts with Xe. (Correct).\n*   A4 = SbF₅. M.W. = 216.76 g/mol.\n*   The range is 220-240. This is the most plausible option.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe analysis was successful. The constraints provided by the quantitative data were prioritized to identify the correct substances, even in the presence of conflicting qualitative descriptions.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y:** The mass percentage of fluorine in A2 (31.96%) was used to calculate the relationship between the atomic mass of element Y (M_Y) and its oxidation state (n): M_Y ≈ 40.45 * n. Testing integer values for n, Antimony (Sb, M=121.76 g/mol) with n=3 was identified as a prime candidate.\n    *   For A2 = SbF3, the calculated mass percentage of F is (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 31.89%, which is an excellent match.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance A4:** Assuming Y is Sb, the common binary fluorides are SbF3 and SbF5. These are the candidates for A4.\n    *   Molecular Weight of SbF3 = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    *   Molecular Weight of SbF5 = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 216.76 g/mol.\n\n3.  **Apply Final Constraint:** The calculated molecular weights were compared against the given ranges.\n    *   The molecular weight of SbF3 (178.76 g/mol) falls within the range **C) 160-180**.\n    *   The molecular weight of SbF5 (216.76 g/mol) does not fit any of the provided ranges.\n\nThis confirms that substance A4 is SbF3, and its molecular weight is in the range of 160-180 g/mol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a self-debate to determine the molecular weight range of substance A4.\n\n**Proposer:** My initial goal is to identify element Y by using the mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in compound A2, which is 31.96%. The formula for mass percentage is ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F)), where n is the number of fluorine atoms, M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (~19 g/mol), and M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n\nBy rearranging the formula, I get M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n.\n\nI will now test integer values for 'n':\n*   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (similar to Calcium)\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (similar to Bromine)\n*   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (similar to Antimony)\n*   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (no stable element)\n*   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (near Gold, Mercury)\n\nThe most promising candidates are Bromine (Br) and Antimony (Sb). I will start by investigating Bromine.\n\nMy first action is to perform a search to verify the known binary fluorides of Bromine and Antimony and their properties to see how they match the clues.\n\n**Skeptic:** The search results provide good information. For Antimony (Y=Sb), the main fluorides are SbF₃ and SbF₅. The mass percentage of fluorine in SbF₃ is 31.88%, which is an excellent match for A2 (31.96%). However, the properties of A1 don't match. A1 is \"bright-red\" and decomposes at room temperature (293 K). If A1 is SbF₅, it is described as a colorless liquid and is relatively stable. This is a major contradiction.\n\nFor Bromine (Y=Br), the main fluorides are BrF, BrF₃, and BrF₅. The clue about \"five binary compounds\" is plausible if we include ions or radicals like BrF₂, BrF₄. If we test the stable fluorides for the mass percentage of A2 (31.96%), none are a good match. However, the radical BrF₂ would have a fluorine percentage of ~32.2%, which is a very close match. This path involves unstable species but seems numerically possible.\n\n**Proposer:** The Skeptic has raised valid points. The antimony hypothesis has a perfect numerical fit for A2 but fails on the qualitative description of A1. The bromine hypothesis requires considering A2 as a radical (BrF₂) to fit the numbers, which is unconventional but possible.\n\nLet's explore the bromine hypothesis further, as it might resolve all the clues. If Y=Br and A2=BrF₂, then A1 (which decomposes to A2+F₂) would be the BrF₄ radical. The reaction Y + A4 -> A5 becomes Br₂ + A4 -> A5. The other known fluorides are BrF, BrF₃, and BrF₅. A4 must be the oxidant, so it could be BrF₃ or BrF₅. Let's check their molecular weights against the options.\n*   M(BrF₃) ≈ 136.9 g/mol.\n*   M(BrF₅) ≈ 174.9 g/mol.\n\nThe range for option A is 160-180. The molecular weight of BrF₅ (174.9 g/mol) falls squarely in this range. This makes A4 = BrF₅ a very strong candidate.\n\nMy next action is to verify the remaining clues with this assignment.\n\n**Skeptic:** This path looks promising because it leads to one of the options. However, we are assuming A1 and A2 are radicals. We also need to check the final clue: \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\" If Y=Br, A4=BrF₅, the reaction is Br₂ + BrF₅ -> A5. This would be a comproportionation reaction, so A5 would likely be BrF₃. Does BrF₃ decompose in water to form two substances? The search results confirm this: BrF₃ reacts with water to form acids like HBrO₃ and HF. This fits. The main weaknesses are the radical nature of A1/A2 and the \"bright-red\" color, which is unknown for the BrF₄ radical.\n\n**Proposer:** The Bromine hypothesis (Y=Br) provides a consistent explanation for all the clues, assuming A2 is the BrF₂ radical.\n1.  **Y = Bromine (Br)**.\n2.  **A2 = BrF₂** (radical). Its calculated fluorine percentage (~32.2%) is very close to the given 31.96%.\n3.  **A1 = BrF₄** (radical). It decomposes to A2 (BrF₂) and fluorine. As a highly unstable radical, it would be a powerful oxidizing agent, capable of reacting with xenon. The \"bright-red\" color is the only unconfirmed property.\n4.  **A3** is a fluoride of bromine (e.g., BrF₃ or BrF₅), which are known strong fluorinating agents that can react with xenon.\n5.  **A4 = BrF₅**. Its molecular weight is ~174.9 g/mol, which fits the range 160-180.\n6.  **A5 = BrF₃**. It is obtained from the reaction of Br₂ (Y) and BrF₅ (A4). It decomposes in water to form two substances (e.g., bromic acid and hydrofluoric acid), which fits the final clue.\n\nThis path successfully identifies all compounds and leads to a molecular weight for A4 that matches one of the options.\n\n**Decision:** The next action is to finalize the answer based on this coherent hypothesis.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
