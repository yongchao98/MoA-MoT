The unanimous consensus from the candidate answers points to a single, chemically sound pathway.\n\n### Step-by-Step Breakdown of the Reaction Sequence\n\n**Step 1: In-situ Diene Generation and Double Diels-Alder Reaction**\n*   **Careful Point 1: Diene Generation.** The first reaction involves treating `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` with sodium iodide (NaI). This is a reductive dehalogenation. The two `-CHBr₂` groups on the sp³-hybridized C5 and C6 atoms of the ring undergo elimination to form two new exocyclic double bonds (`=CH₂`). The reactive diene generated *in situ* is **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Cycloaddition.** The problem specifies that 2 equivalents of the diene precursor are reacted with `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene` (the dienophile). Since the dienophile has two double bonds, two successive [4+2] Diels-Alder reactions occur. This forms a large, complex polycyclic ether, which is **Product 1**.\n\n**Step 2: Hydrolysis (Deprotection)**\n*   **Careful Point 3: Protecting Group Cleavage.** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard protocol for the acid-catalyzed cleavage of an acid-labile tert-butyl ether protecting group. The `tert-butoxy` (-OtBu) group at the C7 bridge position is converted to a hydroxyl (-OH) group, forming **Product 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Oxidation**\n*   **Careful Point 4: Alcohol to Ketone.** Product 2 is treated with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃/pyridine in DMSO). This is a mild oxidation procedure specific for converting the secondary alcohol (-OH) into a ketone (C=O). The C7 hydroxyl group is thus oxidized to a carbonyl group, yielding **Product 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Thermal Decomposition**\n*   **Careful Point 5: Retro-Diels-Alder Reaction.** Product 3, the double Diels-Alder adduct, is heated to 150°C. Diels-Alder reactions are thermally reversible. Heating the adduct favors the reverse reaction, a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**. This is an entropically driven process that breaks the large molecule back into smaller components.\n*   **Careful Point 6: Fragmentation and Subsequent Elimination.** The fragmentation regenerates the constituent molecules:\n    1.  Two molecules of the original diene: **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**.\n    2.  One molecule of the oxidized dienophile core: **`bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`**.\n    The bicyclic ketone intermediate is itself thermally unstable. It readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination, releasing a stable molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the highly stable aromatic molecule, **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Identifying the Final Product (\"4\") and Counting Distinct Hydrogens\n\n*   **Careful Point 7: Final Organic Products.** The final stable organic products in the mixture are benzene and `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens on \"final product 4.\" We must check which product corresponds to one of the given multiple-choice options (10, 8, 4, 7).\n*   **Analysis of Benzene:** Benzene (C₆H₆) is highly symmetric, and all six of its hydrogen atoms are chemically identical. It has only **1** type of distinct hydrogen. This is not among the options.\n*   **Analysis of `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`:** Since benzene is not an option, \"Product 4\" must be this molecule (C₈H₈).\n*   **Careful Point 8: Symmetry Analysis.** To count the distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. It possesses a **C₂ axis of rotation** that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n*   **Counting Hydrogens:** This C₂ symmetry makes pairs of hydrogen atoms equivalent:\n    1.  The hydrogen on C1 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C4. (**Set 1**)\n    2.  The hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C3. (**Set 2**)\n    3.  The C₂ axis exchanges the two exocyclic methylene groups (=CH₂). Within each group, the two protons are diastereotopic (in different environments). The two \"inner\" protons are equivalent to each other via the C₂ axis. (**Set 3**)\n    4.  Similarly, the two \"outer\" protons are equivalent to each other. (**Set 4**)\n*   This analysis reveals a total of **4** chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms. This would correspond to 4 signals in a proton NMR spectrum.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on Product 4 is 4. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction sequence, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers and highlighting the careful points required to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis and Careful Points\n\n1.  **Careful Point 1: Diene Generation and Cycloaddition (Step 1)**\n    The reaction between `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` and sodium iodide (NaI) is a reductive elimination. The four bromine atoms from the two `-CHBr₂` groups are removed to form two new exocyclic double bonds (`=CH₂`). This generates the highly reactive diene `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene` *in situ*. Since two equivalents are used, they undergo a double [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition with the two double bonds of the dienophile, `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene`, to form the large adduct, **Product 1**.\n\n2.  **Careful Point 2: Ether Deprotection (Step 2)**\n    Treatment of Product 1 with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) is a standard acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy (`-OtBu`) protecting group on the C7 bridge of the central framework is cleaved to give a hydroxyl group (`-OH`), forming **Product 2**.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 3: Alcohol Oxidation (Step 3)**\n    Treatment of Product 2 with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃•pyridine in DMSO) is a mild oxidation specific for converting alcohols to ketones. The secondary alcohol at the C7 position is oxidized to a ketone (C=O), forming **Product 3**.\n\n4.  **Careful Point 4: Thermal Decomposition (Step 4)**\n    This is the most critical step. Heating Product 3 to 150°C favors the reverse of the Diels-Alder reaction. This **retro-Diels-Alder reaction** is entropically favorable and breaks Product 3 down into its constituent parts: two molecules of the regenerated diene (`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`) and one molecule of the oxidized dienophile core (`bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`). This latter product is known to be thermally unstable and immediately undergoes a **cheletropic elimination**, extruding a stable molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the very stable aromatic molecule **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n5.  **Careful Point 5: Identification of the Final Product (\"4\")**\n    The final stable organic products are benzene and `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`. We must identify which one is \"Product 4\" by comparing the number of their distinct hydrogens to the given options: `A) 4, B) 10, C) 7, D) 8`.\n    *   **Benzene:** Has only **1** type of chemically distinct hydrogen due to its high symmetry. \"1\" is not an option.\n    *   **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`:** This must be the intended \"Product 4\".\n\n6.  **Careful Point 6: Symmetry Analysis and Counting of Distinct Hydrogens**\n    We must analyze the symmetry of `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene` to count its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a C₂ axis of rotation that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Equivalence:** This C₂ symmetry makes several pairs of hydrogen atoms equivalent:\n        1.  The hydrogen on C1 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C4. (**Set 1**)\n        2.  The hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C3. (**Set 2**)\n        3.  The two exocyclic methylene groups (=CH₂) are equivalent. Within each group, the two protons are diastereotopic (\"inner\" vs \"outer\"). The C₂ axis makes the two \"inner\" protons equivalent. (**Set 3**)\n        4.  The C₂ axis also makes the two \"outer\" protons equivalent. (**Set 4**)\n    *   **Conclusion:** There are a total of **4** chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe number 4 matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem requires a multi-step analysis of an organic reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product and then analyze its symmetry to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. Based on the provided candidate answers, there is a strong consensus on the chemical pathway. The discrepancies arise only from matching the final numerical answer to the correct letter option.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nHere are the key points and steps in the logical chain, synthesized from the provided analyses:\n\n1.  **Step 1: Generation of Reactive Diene and Double Diels-Alder Reaction**\n    *   **Careful Point**: The first key transformation is the reaction of `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` with sodium iodide (NaI). This is a reductive dehalogenation reaction. The four bromine atoms from the two `-CHBr₂` groups are eliminated to form two new exocyclic double bonds (`=CH₂`).\n    *   **Reactive Intermediate**: The diene generated *in situ* is **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`** (also known as isotoluene).\n    *   **Cycloaddition**: Two equivalents of this newly formed diene react with the two double bonds of the dienophile (`7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene`) in successive [4+2] Diels-Alder reactions to form a large polycyclic adduct, **Product 1**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Deprotection of the Ether**\n    *   **Careful Point**: Treating **Product 1** with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) performs a standard acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the tert-butyl ether protecting group.\n    *   **Transformation**: The tert-butoxy group (`-OtBu`) is converted to a hydroxyl group (`-OH`), yielding the corresponding alcohol, **Product 2**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Oxidation of the Alcohol**\n    *   **Careful Point**: **Product 2** is treated with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃/pyridine in DMSO), a well-known system for mild oxidation.\n    *   **Transformation**: The secondary alcohol at the C7 position is oxidized to a ketone (`C=O`), forming **Product 3**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Thermal Decomposition (Retro-Diels-Alder Reaction)**\n    *   **Careful Point**: This is the crucial final step. Heating the large Diels-Alder adduct **Product 3** to 150°C favors the reverse reaction, a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**. This fragmentation is driven by a large increase in entropy and the formation of highly stable final products.\n    *   **Fragmentation Products**: Product 3 decomposes back into its constituent parts: two molecules of the regenerated diene (**`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**) and one molecule of the oxidized dienophile core (`bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`).\n    *   **Further Decomposition**: The `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` intermediate is itself thermally unstable and readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination, extruding a stable molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the very stable aromatic molecule **benzene**.\n\n### Identification of Final Product \"4\" and Symmetry Analysis\n\nThe stable organic products from the entire sequence are benzene and `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens on \"final product 4.\"\n\n*   **Elimination of Benzene**: Benzene has only **1** type of chemically distinct hydrogen due to its high symmetry. Since '1' is not among the options (10, 8, 7, 4), benzene cannot be Product 4.\n*   **Identification of Product 4**: Therefore, \"Product 4\" must be **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**: To count the distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n    *   The molecule possesses a C₂ axis of rotation that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   This symmetry makes pairs of hydrogen atoms chemically equivalent:\n        1.  The hydrogen on C1 and the hydrogen on C4 are equivalent. **(Set 1)**\n        2.  The hydrogen on C2 and the hydrogen on C3 are equivalent. **(Set 2)**\n        3.  The two exocyclic methylene groups (`=CH₂`) are interchanged by the C₂ rotation. Within each group, the two protons are in different chemical environments (diastereotopic). The two \"inner\" protons are equivalent to each other. **(Set 3)**\n        4.  Similarly, the two \"outer\" protons are equivalent to each other. **(Set 4)**\n\nCounting these unique sets gives a total of **4** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. This would correspond to 4 signals in a proton NMR spectrum. This numerical answer matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis problem requires a careful, step-by-step analysis of a four-step reaction sequence to identify the structure of the final product (\"4\") and then determine the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms by analyzing its molecular symmetry.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the chemical transformations and key analysis points, synthesizing the consensus from the provided answers:\n\n### **Step 1: Diene Generation and Double Diels-Alder Reaction**\n*   **Careful Point 1 (Identifying the Reactive Diene):** The starting material `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` reacts with sodium iodide (NaI).

(**Set 4**)\n\nThis analysis reveals a total of **4** chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms. This number matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem requires a careful, step-by-step analysis of a four-step organic synthesis to determine the structure of the final product. Subsequently, an analysis of the product's symmetry is needed to find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. An evaluation of the provided candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the chemical pathway and the final product's identity, but some confusion in matching the result to the correct multiple-choice letter.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis and Careful Points\n\n1.  **Step 1: In-situ Diene Generation and Double Diels-Alder Reaction**\n    *   **Careful Point 1 (Identifying the Reactive Diene):** The reaction of `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` with sodium iodide (NaI) is a reductive elimination. The two `-CHBr₂` groups on the C5 and C6 carbons of the ring undergo elimination of four bromine atoms to form two new exocyclic double bonds (`=CH₂`). The resulting reactive diene is **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**. This interpretation is the most chemically sound and is agreed upon by all candidate solutions.\n    *   **Cycloaddition:** With 2 equivalents of this diene available, it reacts with the two double bonds of the dienophile, `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene`, in two sequential [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloadditions, forming a large, complex polycyclic adduct, **Product 1**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Deprotection (Formation of Product 2)**\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Identifying the Reaction):** Treatment of **Product 1** with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) is a standard method for the acid-catalyzed cleavage of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy (`-OtBu`) protecting group is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl (`-OH`) group, yielding **Product 2**. This is a straightforward and undisputed step.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Oxidation (Formation of Product 3)**\n    *   **Careful Point 3 (Identifying the Reagent):** The SO₃-pyridine complex in DMSO (Parikh-Doering oxidation) is a mild reagent that specifically oxidizes the secondary alcohol in **Product 2** to a ketone. The C7 hydroxyl group is converted to a carbonyl (`C=O`), yielding **Product 3**. This step is also undisputed.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Thermal Decomposition (Formation of Product 4)**\n    *   **Careful Point 4 (The Critical Thermal Step):** Heating the complex Diels-Alder adduct **Product 3** to 150°C strongly favors a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**. This is thermodynamically driven by an increase in entropy and the formation of highly stable molecules.\n    *   **Fragmentation and Further Reaction:** Product 3 breaks down into its constituent parts: two molecules of the regenerated diene (`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`) and one molecule of the oxidized dienophile core (`bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`). This bicyclic ketone is itself thermally unstable and rapidly undergoes a cheletropic elimination, extruding a stable molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form another highly stable product, **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Identifying the Final Product and Counting its Distinct Hydrogens\n\n*   **Careful Point 5 (Identifying \"Product 4\"):** The stable organic products in the final mixture are **benzene** and **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**. We must check which of these matches the options provided: A) 10, B) 7, C) 4, D) 8.\n    *   Benzene is highly symmetric, and all six of its hydrogens are chemically equivalent. It has **1** type of distinct hydrogen. Since 1 is not an option, benzene cannot be \"Product 4\".\n    *   Therefore, \"Product 4\" must be the other major organic product: **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 6 (Symmetry Analysis):** We now analyze the structure of `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene` to count its chemically non-equivalent hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a C₂ rotational axis that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 bond and the C5-C6 bond.\n    *   **Hydrogen Equivalence:** This C₂ symmetry makes pairs of hydrogen atoms chemically equivalent.\n        1.  The hydrogen on C1 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C4. (**Set 1**)\n        2.  The hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C3. (**Set 2**)\n        3.  The two exocyclic methylene groups (`=CH₂`) are interchanged by the C₂ rotation. Within each group, the two protons are in different chemical environments (diastereotopic). The C₂ axis relates the two \"inner\" protons, making them equivalent. (**Set 3**)\n        4.  Similarly, the C₂ axis relates the two \"outer\" protons, making them equivalent. (**Set 4**)\n\nThis analysis leads to the conclusion that there are exactly **4** chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms in Product 4.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion:** The number of distinct hydrogen atoms is 4. Matching this result with the given options:\n    A) 10\n    B) 7\n    C) 4\n    D) 8\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the provided candidate answers, the solution is determined as follows.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nAll the candidate answers correctly and consistently describe the following four-step chemical process:\n\n1.  **Step 1: In-situ Diene Generation and Double Diels-Alder Reaction.**\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Diene Generation.** The reaction of `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` with sodium iodide (NaI) is a well-established reductive elimination. This process removes the four bromine atoms to form two new exocyclic double bonds (`=CH₂`).\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Reactive Intermediate.** The reactive diene generated *in situ* is `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`.\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Cycloaddition.** Since two equivalents of the diene are formed, they react with the two double bonds of the dienophile (`7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene`) in two successive [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloadditions to form the large, polycyclic **Product 1**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Deprotection of the Ether.**\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Hydrolysis.** Treatment with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) causes the standard acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the tert-butyl ether group, converting the `-O-tBu` at the C7 bridge to a hydroxyl group `-OH`. This forms **Product 2**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Oxidation of the Alcohol.**\n    *   **Careful Point 5: Oxidation.** Treatment with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃-pyridine in DMSO) is a mild oxidation protocol that converts the secondary alcohol in Product 2 into a ketone. This yields **Product 3**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Thermal Decomposition.**\n    *   **Careful Point 6: Retro-Diels-Alder.** Heating **Product 3** to 150°C provides sufficient energy to reverse the Diels-Alder reactions. This retro-Diels-Alder reaction is entropically favored and is the most critical step in simplifying the molecule.\n    *   **Careful Point 7: Fragmentation.** The molecule fragments back into its constituents: two molecules of the regenerated diene (`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`) and one molecule of the oxidized dienophile core (`bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`).\n    *   **Careful Point 8: Subsequent Decomposition.** The bicyclic ketone intermediate is known to be thermally unstable and readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination to extrude a stable molecule of carbon monoxide (CO), forming the highly stable aromatic molecule **benzene**.\n\n### **Identification of the Final Product and Symmetry Analysis**\n\nThe final mixture contains two stable organic products: **benzene** and **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on \"final product 4\".\n\n*   **Eliminating Benzene:** Benzene (C₆H₆) has a high degree of symmetry, making all six of its hydrogen atoms chemically identical. It has only **1** distinct type of hydrogen. This value is not among the multiple-choice options (A=7, B=10, C=4, D=8), so benzene cannot be \"Product 4\".\n*   **Identifying Product 4:** \"Product 4\" must therefore be `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** We must analyze the structure of this molecule to count its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The molecule possesses a C₂ rotational axis of symmetry that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 single bonds.\n    *   This symmetry operation creates sets of equivalent hydrogen atoms:\n        1.  The hydrogen on C1 and the hydrogen on C4 are equivalent.\n        2.  The hydrogen on C2 and the hydrogen on C3 are equivalent.\n        3.  The two exocyclic methylene groups (`=CH₂`) are interchanged by rotation. Within each group, the two protons are in different chemical environments (diastereotopic). The C₂ axis makes the two \"inner\" hydrogens equivalent to each other.\n        4.  Similarly, the C₂ axis makes the two \"outer\" hydrogens equivalent to each other.\n    *   This gives a total of **4** chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe number 4 corresponds to option C. While many of the candidate answers made a clerical error in selecting the final letter, their underlying chemical reasoning is sound and unanimously points to 4 as the correct number.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem, synthesizing the consensus view from the provided candidate answers and highlighting the key points of the reasoning.\n\n### **Step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence**\n\nThe solution requires a correct deduction of a four-step chemical synthesis to identify the final product, \"4\", and then an analysis of its molecular symmetry to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. All provided answers follow the same logical and chemically sound pathway.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The Initial Reaction (In-situ Diene Formation)**\n*   The reaction begins with `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` and sodium iodide (NaI). All analyses correctly identify this as a reductive elimination reaction. The two `-CHBr₂` groups on the sp³-hybridized C5 and C6 atoms of the ring react with NaI, removing the four bromine atoms and forming two new exocyclic double bonds (`=CH₂`).\n*   The key reactive species formed *in situ* is **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`** (also known as isotoluene). This species acts as the diene in the subsequent step.\n\n**Careful Point 2: The Double Diels-Alder Reaction**\n*   The dienophile, `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene`, has two double bonds. Since the problem specifies two equivalents of the diene precursor, two molecules of the generated diene react in successive [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloadditions.\n*   This forms a large, complex, polycyclic adduct, **Product 1**.\n\n**Careful Point 3: The Deprotection**\n*   Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is correctly identified by all agents as a standard acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the tert-butyl ether protecting group.\n*   The `-OtBu` group at the C7 bridge position is converted to a hydroxyl group `(-OH)`, yielding **Product 2**.\n\n**Careful Point 4: The Oxidation**\n*   Product 2 is treated with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃·pyridine in DMSO). This is unanimously recognized as a mild oxidation procedure specific for converting the secondary alcohol at C7 into a ketone (`C=O`).\n*   The resulting molecule is **Product 3**.\n\n**Careful Point 5: The Thermal Decomposition**\n*   Product 3, the large double Diels-Alder adduct, is heated to 150 °C. At this temperature, the reversible Diels-Alder reaction proceeds in the reverse direction, a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**. This step is favored by a large positive change in entropy and the formation of very stable final products.\n*   The fragmentation correctly breaks Product 3 down into two types of molecules:\n    1.  Two molecules of the regenerated diene: **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**.\n    2.  One molecule of the oxidized dienophile core: **`bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`**.\n\n**Careful Point 6: Subsequent Decomposition**\n*   A crucial subsequent reaction is the decomposition of the `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` intermediate. It is thermally unstable and readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination to extrude a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) and form the highly stable aromatic molecule, **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### **Final Analysis: Identifying \"Product 4\" and Counting Distinct Hydrogens**\n\nThe final mixture contains two stable organic products: **benzene** and **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**. We must determine which of these is \"Product 4\" by comparing the number of its distinct hydrogen atoms with the given options (A: 8, B: 7, C: 4, D: 10).\n\n1.  **Benzene (C₆H₆):** Due to its high D₆h symmetry, all six of its hydrogen atoms are chemically identical.

This number is not among the options.\n2.  **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene` (C₈H₈):** Since benzene is not a possible answer, \"Product 4\" must be this molecule. We analyze its structure for symmetry to count its distinct hydrogens.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a C₂ rotational axis of symmetry that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Hydrogen Equivalence:** This C₂ symmetry makes pairs of hydrogen atoms chemically equivalent.\n        *   **Set 1:** The hydrogens on the ring carbons C1 and C4 are equivalent.\n        *   **Set 2:** The hydrogens on the ring carbons C2 and C3 are equivalent.\n        *   **Set 3:** The C₂ axis exchanges the two exocyclic methylene groups (=CH₂). Within each methylene group, the two protons are diastereotopic (in different chemical environments, \"inner\" vs \"outer\"). The two \"inner\" protons are made equivalent by the C₂ axis.\n        *   **Set 4:** Similarly, the two \"outer\" protons are made equivalent by the C₂ axis.\n    *   **Conclusion:** There are a total of **4** chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms. This would lead to four signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe number of chemically distinct hydrogens is 4. According to the question's provided options (A) 8, (B) 7, (C) 4, (D) 10, this corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires a careful, step-by-step analysis of a four-step reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product (\"4\") and then find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms by analyzing its molecular symmetry.

The four bromine atoms are eliminated from the two `-CHBr₂` groups, creating two exocyclic double bonds (`=CH₂`). The diene generated *in situ* is **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: The Cycloaddition Reaction.** Two equivalents of this reactive diene react with the dienophile, `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene`, which has two double bonds. This occurs via two sequential [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloadditions, forming a large, polycyclic molecule, **Product 1**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Deprotection of the Ether**\n    *   Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).

High temperatures favor the reverse of the Diels-Alder reaction, a process known as a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**. This is an entropically driven fragmentation.\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Fragmentation and Subsequent Reactions.** Product 3 decomposes back into its building blocks: two molecules of the regenerated diene (`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`) and one molecule of the oxidized dienophile core (`bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`). The latter is itself thermally unstable and readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination to lose a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) and form the highly stable aromatic molecule, **benzene**.\n\n### Analysis of the Final Product \"4\"\n\n*   **Careful Point 5: Identifying the Correct Final Product.** The final mixture of stable organic products contains benzene and `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`.

This number corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nAn analysis of the provided candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the chemical transformations and the final structure. The reasoning can be broken down into the following key steps:\n\n### **Step-by-step analysis**\n\n1.  **Step 1: In-situ Diene Generation and Diels-Alder Cycloaddition**\n    *   **Reaction:** All agents correctly identify that `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` reacts with sodium iodide (NaI) in a reductive dehalogenation.\n    *   **Diene Formed:** The product of this reaction is `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`. This highly reactive molecule acts as the diene in the subsequent step.\n    *   **Cycloaddition:** This generated diene (2 equivalents) reacts with the two double bonds of the dienophile, `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene`, via two sequential [4+2] Diels-Alder reactions to form the large polycyclic molecule, **Product 1**. There is unanimous agreement on this pathway.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Acidic Deprotection**\n    *   **Reaction:** All agents agree that treating **Product 1** with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) performs a standard acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the tert-butyl ether.\n    *   **Transformation:** The tert-butoxy (`-OtBu`) group is converted to a hydroxyl (`-OH`) group, yielding **Product 2**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Oxidation**\n    *   **Reaction:** All agents correctly identify the `SO₃/pyridine/DMSO` reagent system as the Parikh-Doering oxidant.\n    *   **Transformation:** This reagent converts the secondary alcohol in **Product 2** into a ketone (C=O), forming **Product 3**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Thermal Decomposition**\n    *   **Reaction:** All agents agree that heating the complex Diels-Alder adduct **Product 3** to 150°C will induce a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**. This is the most crucial and logical step.\n    *   **Fragmentation Products:** The decomposition of **Product 3** regenerates the starting components (in their final forms):\n        1.  Two molecules of the diene: `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`.\n        2.  One molecule of the oxidized dienophile core: `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`.\n    *   **Further Reaction:** All agents also correctly identify that the `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` intermediate is thermally unstable and will undergo a cheletropic elimination to extrude a stable molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) and form **benzene**.\n\n### **Analysis of the Final Product (\"4\")**\n\n*   **Identifying \"Product 4\"**: The stable organic products in the final mixture are benzene and `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`. All agents correctly deduce that since benzene has only **1** chemically distinct hydrogen atom (a number not available in the options), \"Product 4\" must be `5,6-dimethylidenecylcohexa-1,3-diene`.\n\n*   **Symmetry and Hydrogen Count**: All agents correctly analyze the symmetry of `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`. The molecule possesses a C₂ rotational axis that renders pairs of hydrogen atoms chemically equivalent. This analysis unanimously leads to the conclusion that there are **4** sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms:\n    1.  The two hydrogens on C1 and C4.\n    2.

Once the structure of product 4 is known, its molecular symmetry must be analyzed to find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. All 15 candidate answers show a remarkable consensus on the chemical pathway and the final result.\n\nHere is a consolidated, step-by-step analysis based on the reasoning from the candidate answers:\n\n### **Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n**Step 1: Diene Generation and Double Diels-Alder Reaction**\n*   **Careful Point 1: Diene Generation.** The reaction between `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` and sodium iodide (NaI) is a reductive dehalogenation. The four bromine atoms are eliminated from the two `-CHBr₂` groups, creating two new exocyclic double bonds.\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Reactive Intermediate.** The diene formed *in situ* is **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`** (an isomer of o-xylylene).\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Cycloaddition.** The problem specifies 2 equivalents of the diene precursor are reacted with `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene`, which has two reactive double bonds. This results in two successive [4+2] Diels-Alder reactions, forming a large polycyclic molecule, **Product 1**.\n\n**Step 2: Acidic Deprotection (Formation of Product 2)**\n*   **Careful Point 4: Hydrolysis.** Treating Product 1 with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) is a standard method for cleaving an acid-labile tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy (`-OtBu`) group is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl (`-OH`) group, yielding **Product 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Oxidation (Formation of Product 3)**\n*   **Careful Point 5: Oxidation Reagent.** Product 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO, which is the Parikh-Doering oxidation. This is a mild and specific method for oxidizing a secondary alcohol to a ketone.\n*   **Careful Point 6: Transformation.** The secondary alcohol at the C7 position of the central bicyclic core is oxidized to a ketone (C=O), yielding **Product 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Thermal Decomposition (Formation of Product 4)**\n*   **Careful Point 7: The Key Reaction.** Heating a complex Diels-Alder adduct like Product 3 to 150°C strongly favors the reverse reaction, known as a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**. This is an entropically driven process.\n*   **Careful Point 8: Fragmentation.** Product 3 decomposes back into its constituent parts: two molecules of the regenerated diene (`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`) and one molecule of the oxidized dienophile core (`bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`).\n*   **Careful Point 9: Further Decomposition.** The `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` intermediate is thermally unstable and readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination, releasing a stable molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the highly stable aromatic molecule **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### **Identifying \"Product 4\" and Counting Distinct Hydrogens**\n\nThe final mixture contains two stable organic products: **benzene** and **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**. We must determine which of these is \"Product 4\" by comparing the number of their distinct hydrogen atoms to the given options.\n\n*   **Benzene:** Due to its high symmetry, all six of its hydrogen atoms are chemically equivalent. Therefore, benzene has only **1** type of distinct hydrogen. This is not among the options (8, 10, 4, 7).\n*   **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`:** This must be \"Product 4\". Now, we must analyze its symmetry.\n    *   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a six-membered ring with a 1,3-diene system and two exocyclic double bonds on the adjacent sp³-hybridized carbons.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a C₂ rotational axis of symmetry that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 bond and the C5-C6 bond.\n    *   **Hydrogen Equivalence:** This C₂ symmetry makes pairs of hydrogen atoms chemically equivalent:\n        1.

To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on the final product, we must first determine the structure of that product by analyzing each reaction step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: In-situ Diene Generation and Double Diels-Alder Reaction**\n*   **Careful Point 1 (Identifying the reaction):** The reaction of `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` with sodium iodide (NaI) is a reductive dehalogenation. The two `-CHBr₂` groups on the sp³-hybridized carbons of the ring are eliminated to form two new exocyclic double bonds (`=CH₂`).\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Identifying the diene):** The diene formed *in situ* is **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**. This is a highly reactive diene that will participate in the subsequent cycloaddition.\n*   **Careful Point 3 (The cycloaddition):** The dienophile, `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene`, has two double bonds. As two equivalents of the diene are generated, they react in two sequential [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloadditions, forming a large, complex polycyclic ether, **Product 1**.\n\n**Step 2: Hydrolysis (Deprotection)**\n*   **Careful Point 4 (Identifying the reaction type):** Treatment of Product 1 with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) is a standard method for the acid-catalyzed cleavage of a tert-butyl ether, which is an acid-labile protecting group.\n*   **Careful Point 5 (The transformation):** The `tert-butoxy` group (`-OtBu`) at the bridge position is converted to a `hydroxyl` group (`-OH`), yielding the corresponding alcohol, **Product 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Oxidation**\n*   **Careful Point 6 (Identifying the reagents):** Product 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO. This is correctly identified as a Parikh-Doering oxidation.\n*   **Careful Point 7 (The transformation):** This is a mild oxidation protocol specific for converting the secondary alcohol at the C7 position into a ketone (`C=O`). The resulting molecule is **Product 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Thermal Decomposition**\n*   **Careful Point 8 (Identifying the thermal reaction):** When Product 3, a large Diels-Alder adduct, is heated, the most favorable reaction is the reverse of its formation, known as a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**. This is driven by an increase in entropy and the formation of highly stable product molecules.\n*   **Careful Point 9 (Fragmentation and subsequent decomposition):**\n    1.  The retro-Diels-Alder reaction fragments Product 3 back into its constituent building blocks: two molecules of the diene, **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**, and one molecule of the oxidized dienophile core, **`bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`**.\n    2.  The `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` intermediate is thermally unstable and readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination, losing a stable molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the highly stable aromatic molecule **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Final Analysis: Identifying Product 4 and Counting its Hydrogens**\n*   **Careful Point 10 (Identifying the final organic products):** The final stable organic products in the mixture are benzene and `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens on \"Product 4.\"\n*   **Careful Point 11 (Eliminating one possibility):** Benzene has 6 hydrogen atoms, but due to its high symmetry, they are all chemically identical. It has only **1** type of distinct hydrogen. This is not among the options (8, 10, 4, 7).\n*   **Careful Point 12 (Symmetry analysis of the correct product):** Therefore, \"Product 4\" must be **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**. To count its distinct hydrogens, we must analyze its symmetry.\n    *   The molecule has a C₂ rotational axis of symmetry that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 single bonds.\n    *   This symmetry makes pairs of hydrogen atoms chemically equivalent:\n        1.  The hydrogen on C1 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C4. (**Set 1**)\n        2.  The hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C3. (**Set 2**)\n        3.  The two exocyclic methylene groups (`=CH₂`) are interchanged by the C₂ axis. Within each methylene group, the two protons are in different chemical environments (diastereotopic). The C₂ axis makes the two \"inner\" protons equivalent. (**Set 3**)\n        4.  Similarly, the C₂ axis makes the two \"outer\" protons equivalent. (**Set 4**)\n    *   Counting these sets reveals a total of **4** chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms. This would give rise to 4 signals in a proton NMR spectrum.\n\nThis number, 4, corresponds to option C in the question.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires a multi-step analysis of a chemical reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product (\"4\") and then count its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n### **Detailed Step-by-Step Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n**Careful Point 1: Step 1 - Diene Generation and Cycloaddition**\n*   The first step involves reacting `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene` (the dienophile) with `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` and sodium iodide (NaI).\n*   The NaI reagent causes a reductive elimination of the bromine atoms from the two `-CHBr₂` groups on the diene precursor. This is a known chemical transformation that forms double bonds.\n*   The reactive species generated *in situ* is `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`. This molecule acts as the diene in the subsequent reaction.\n*   Since two equivalents of this diene are generated and the dienophile has two double bonds, two successive [4+2] Diels-Alder reactions occur, forming a large, polycyclic ether, which is **Product 1**.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Step 2 - Deprotection**\n*   Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of an acid-labile tert-butyl ether.\n*   The tert-butoxy group (`-OtBu`) is cleaved and replaced by a hydroxyl group (`-OH`), yielding the corresponding alcohol, **Product 2**.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Step 3 - Oxidation**\n*   Product 2 is treated with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃/pyridine in DMSO). This is a mild oxidation protocol specific for converting a secondary alcohol into a ketone.\n*   The hydroxyl group at the C7 position of the central bicyclic core is oxidized to a ketone (C=O), yielding **Product 3**.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Step 4 - Thermal Decomposition**\n*   Product 3, the large double Diels-Alder adduct, is heated to 150°C. High temperature favors the reverse of a Diels-Alder reaction, a process known as a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**. This is an entropically driven process, especially when it leads to the formation of highly stable molecules.\n*   Product 3 fragments back into its constituent parts:\n    1.  Two molecules of the regenerated diene: `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`.\n    2.  One molecule of the oxidized dienophile core: `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`.\n*   A subsequent, rapid reaction occurs: the `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` intermediate is thermally unstable. It readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination to release a very stable molecule of carbon monoxide (CO), forming another highly stable product, **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### **Identifying the Final Product and Counting its Hydrogens**\n\n**Careful Point 5: Identifying \"Product 4\"**\n*   The final mixture of stable organic products contains benzene and `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`.\n*   The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens on \"final product 4\". We must evaluate the final products against the given multiple-choice options (A: 8, B: 4, C: 7, D: 10).\n*   Benzene (C₆H₆) has very high symmetry (D₆h point group), which makes all six of its hydrogen atoms chemically identical. It has only **1** distinct type of hydrogen. This number is not among the options.\n*   Therefore, \"final product 4\" must be the other major organic product: **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**.\n\n**Careful Point 6: Symmetry Analysis of Product 4**\n*   We must now analyze the structure of `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene` to count its chemically non-equivalent hydrogen atoms.\n*   The molecule possesses a C₂ axis of rotation that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n*   This C₂ symmetry creates sets of equivalent hydrogen atoms:\n    1.  The hydrogen on C1 is chemically equivalent to the hydrogen on C4. This is **Set 1**.\n    2.  The hydrogen on C2 is chemically equivalent to the hydrogen on C3. This is **Set 2**.\n    3.  The C₂ axis exchanges the two exocyclic methylene groups (=CH₂). The two protons on a single methylene group are not equivalent to each other (they are diastereotopic). The C₂ rotation makes the two \"inner\" protons equivalent to each other. This is **Set 3**.\n    4.  Similarly, the C₂ rotation makes the two \"outer\" protons equivalent to each other. This is **Set 4**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe analysis reveals that there are a total of **4** chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms in `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`. This number matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires a detailed analysis of a four-step chemical reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product (\"4\") and then an analysis of its molecular symmetry to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. All provided candidate answers follow a consistent and chemically sound line of reasoning.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n1.  **Step 1: In-situ Diene Generation and Double Diels-Alder Reaction.**\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Diene Generation.** The reaction begins with `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` and sodium iodide (NaI). The most direct chemical interpretation is a reductive elimination. The two `-CHBr₂` groups on the C5 and C6 carbons of the ring undergo a tetra-dehalogenation, eliminating all four bromine atoms to form two new exocyclic double bonds (`=CH₂`).\n    *   **Generated Diene:** The highly reactive diene formed *in situ* is **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Cycloaddition.** The problem specifies that 2 equivalents of this diene precursor are used with the dienophile, `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene`. Since the dienophile has two reactive double bonds, two sequential [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloadditions occur, forming a large, polycyclic molecule, **Product 1**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Hydrolysis (Deprotection).**\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Identifying the Reaction.** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard protocol for the acid-catalyzed cleavage of a tert-butyl ether protecting group. The `tert-butoxy` (-O*t*Bu) group at the C7 bridge position is converted to a hydroxyl (-OH) group, yielding **Product 2**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Oxidation.**\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Identifying the Reagent.** Product 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO. This is the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild method for oxidizing a secondary alcohol (like the one at C7) into a ketone (C=O). The product is the corresponding ketone, **Product 3**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Thermal Decomposition.**\n    *   **Careful Point 5: The Key Thermal Reaction.** Product 3 is heated to 150°C. Diels-Alder reactions are thermally reversible, and at high temperatures, the reverse reaction, a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**, is favored. This fragmentation is driven by a large increase in entropy and the formation of highly stable products.\n    *   **Careful Point 6: Fragmentation and Subsequent Decomposition.**\n        1.  Product 3 fragments back into its constituent parts: two molecules of the regenerated diene, **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**, and one molecule of the oxidized dienophile core, **`bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`**.\n        2.  The `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` intermediate is known to be thermally unstable and rapidly undergoes a cheletropic elimination, losing a stable molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the highly stable aromatic molecule **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### **Analysis of the Final Product \"4\"**\n\n*   **Careful Point 7: Identifying the Correct Product.** The final stable organic products in the mixture are benzene and `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens on \"final product 4.\" We must check which product corresponds to the given multiple-choice options.\n    *   **Benzene:** Has only **1** chemically distinct type of hydrogen due to its high symmetry. This number is not among the options (10, 7, 8, 4).\n    *   Therefore, \"final product 4\" must be the other major organic product: **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 8: Symmetry Analysis and Counting.** We must analyze the symmetry of `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene` (C₈H₈) to count its non-equivalent hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The molecule possesses a **C₂ axis of rotation** that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   This symmetry operation creates four distinct sets of equivalent hydrogens:\n        1.  The hydrogen on C1 and the hydrogen on C4 are equivalent. (**Set 1**)\n        2.  The hydrogen on C2 and the hydrogen on C3 are equivalent. (**Set 2**)\n        3.

This reaction removes the four bromine atoms to create two exocyclic double bonds (`=CH₂`), forming the reactive diene `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`.\n2.  **Careful Point 2: The Double Diels-Alder Reaction.** Since two equivalents of the diene are generated and the dienophile `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene` has two double bonds, two sequential [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloadditions occur.

This is a mild oxidation procedure specific for converting the secondary alcohol at the bridge position into a ketone (C=O), yielding **Product 3**.\n5.  **Careful Point 5: Step 4 - Thermal Decomposition.** Heating the complex adduct **Product 3** to 150°C provides enough energy to drive the reaction in reverse. This is a retro-Diels-Alder reaction, which is favored at high temperatures due to an increase in entropy.\n6.  **Careful Point 6: Fragmentation and Subsequent Elimination.** The retro-Diels-Alder reaction breaks Product 3 down into its original building blocks: two molecules of the diene, `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`, and one molecule of the oxidized dienophile core, `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`.

The unanimous consensus from the candidate answers points to a single, chemically sound pathway.\n\n### Step-by-Step Breakdown of the Reaction Sequence\n\n**Step 1: In-situ Diene Generation and Double Diels-Alder Reaction**\n*   **Careful Point 1: Diene Generation.** The first reaction involves treating `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` with sodium iodide (NaI). This is a reductive dehalogenation. The two `-CHBr₂` groups on the sp³-hybridized C5 and C6 atoms of the ring undergo elimination to form two new exocyclic double bonds (`=CH₂`). The reactive diene generated *in situ* is **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Cycloaddition.** The problem specifies that 2 equivalents of the diene precursor are reacted with `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene` (the dienophile). Since the dienophile has two double bonds, two successive [4+2] Diels-Alder reactions occur. This forms a large, complex polycyclic ether, which is **Product 1**.\n\n**Step 2: Hydrolysis (Deprotection)**\n*   **Careful Point 3: Protecting Group Cleavage.** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard protocol for the acid-catalyzed cleavage of an acid-labile tert-butyl ether protecting group. The `tert-butoxy` (-OtBu) group at the C7 bridge position is converted to a hydroxyl (-OH) group, forming **Product 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Oxidation**\n*   **Careful Point 4: Alcohol to Ketone.** Product 2 is treated with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃/pyridine in DMSO). This is a mild oxidation procedure specific for converting the secondary alcohol (-OH) into a ketone (C=O). The C7 hydroxyl group is thus oxidized to a carbonyl group, yielding **Product 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Thermal Decomposition**\n*   **Careful Point 5: Retro-Diels-Alder Reaction.** Product 3, the double Diels-Alder adduct, is heated to 150°C. Diels-Alder reactions are thermally reversible. Heating the adduct favors the reverse reaction, a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**. This is an entropically driven process that breaks the large molecule back into smaller components.\n*   **Careful Point 6: Fragmentation and Subsequent Elimination.** The fragmentation regenerates the constituent molecules:\n    1.  Two molecules of the original diene: **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**.\n    2.  One molecule of the oxidized dienophile core: **`bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`**.\n    The bicyclic ketone intermediate is itself thermally unstable. It readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination, releasing a stable molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the highly stable aromatic molecule, **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Identifying the Final Product (\"4\") and Counting Distinct Hydrogens\n\n*   **Careful Point 7: Final Organic Products.** The final stable organic products in the mixture are benzene and `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens on \"final product 4.\" We must check which product corresponds to one of the given multiple-choice options (10, 8, 4, 7).\n*   **Analysis of Benzene:** Benzene (C₆H₆) is highly symmetric, and all six of its hydrogen atoms are chemically identical. It has only **1** type of distinct hydrogen. This is not among the options.\n*   **Analysis of `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`:** Since benzene is not an option, \"Product 4\" must be this molecule (C₈H₈).\n*   **Careful Point 8: Symmetry Analysis.** To count the distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. It possesses a **C₂ axis of rotation** that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n*   **Counting Hydrogens:** This C₂ symmetry makes pairs of hydrogen atoms equivalent:\n    1.  The hydrogen on C1 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C4. (**Set 1**)\n    2.  The hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C3. (**Set 2**)\n    3.  The C₂ axis exchanges the two exocyclic methylene groups (=CH₂). Within each group, the two protons are diastereotopic (in different environments). The two \"inner\" protons are equivalent to each other via the C₂ axis. (**Set 3**)\n    4.  Similarly, the two \"outer\" protons are equivalent to each other. (**Set 4**)\n*   This analysis reveals a total of **4** chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms. This would correspond to 4 signals in a proton NMR spectrum.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on Product 4 is 4. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction sequence, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers and highlighting the careful points required to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis and Careful Points\n\n1.  **Careful Point 1: Diene Generation and Cycloaddition (Step 1)**\n    The reaction between `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` and sodium iodide (NaI) is a reductive elimination. The four bromine atoms from the two `-CHBr₂` groups are removed to form two new exocyclic double bonds (`=CH₂`). This generates the highly reactive diene `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene` *in situ*. Since two equivalents are used, they undergo a double [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition with the two double bonds of the dienophile, `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene`, to form the large adduct, **Product 1**.\n\n2.  **Careful Point 2: Ether Deprotection (Step 2)**\n    Treatment of Product 1 with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) is a standard acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy (`-OtBu`) protecting group on the C7 bridge of the central framework is cleaved to give a hydroxyl group (`-OH`), forming **Product 2**.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 3: Alcohol Oxidation (Step 3)**\n    Treatment of Product 2 with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃•pyridine in DMSO) is a mild oxidation specific for converting alcohols to ketones. The secondary alcohol at the C7 position is oxidized to a ketone (C=O), forming **Product 3**.\n\n4.  **Careful Point 4: Thermal Decomposition (Step 4)**\n    This is the most critical step. Heating Product 3 to 150°C favors the reverse of the Diels-Alder reaction. This **retro-Diels-Alder reaction** is entropically favorable and breaks Product 3 down into its constituent parts: two molecules of the regenerated diene (`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`) and one molecule of the oxidized dienophile core (`bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`). This latter product is known to be thermally unstable and immediately undergoes a **cheletropic elimination**, extruding a stable molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the very stable aromatic molecule **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n5.  **Careful Point 5: Identification of the Final Product (\"4\")**\n    The final stable organic products are benzene and `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`. We must identify which one is \"Product 4\" by comparing the number of their distinct hydrogens to the given options: `A) 4, B) 10, C) 7, D) 8`.\n    *   **Benzene:** Has only **1** type of chemically distinct hydrogen due to its high symmetry. \"1\" is not an option.\n    *   **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`:** This must be the intended \"Product 4\".\n\n6.  **Careful Point 6: Symmetry Analysis and Counting of Distinct Hydrogens**\n    We must analyze the symmetry of `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene` to count its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a C₂ axis of rotation that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Equivalence:** This C₂ symmetry makes several pairs of hydrogen atoms equivalent:\n        1.  The hydrogen on C1 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C4. (**Set 1**)\n        2.  The hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C3. (**Set 2**)\n        3.

Based on the provided candidate answers, there is a strong consensus on the chemical pathway. The discrepancies arise only from matching the final numerical answer to the correct letter option.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nHere are the key points and steps in the logical chain, synthesized from the provided analyses:\n\n1.  **Step 1: Generation of Reactive Diene and Double Diels-Alder Reaction**\n    *   **Careful Point**: The first key transformation is the reaction of `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` with sodium iodide (NaI). This is a reductive dehalogenation reaction. The four bromine atoms from the two `-CHBr₂` groups are eliminated to form two new exocyclic double bonds (`=CH₂`).\n    *   **Reactive Intermediate**: The diene generated *in situ* is **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`** (also known as isotoluene).\n    *   **Cycloaddition**: Two equivalents of this newly formed diene react with the two double bonds of the dienophile (`7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene`) in successive [4+2] Diels-Alder reactions to form a large polycyclic adduct, **Product 1**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Deprotection of the Ether**\n    *   **Careful Point**: Treating **Product 1** with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) performs a standard acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the tert-butyl ether protecting group.\n    *   **Transformation**: The tert-butoxy group (`-OtBu`) is converted to a hydroxyl group (`-OH`), yielding the corresponding alcohol, **Product 2**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Oxidation of the Alcohol**\n    *   **Careful Point**: **Product 2** is treated with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃/pyridine in DMSO), a well-known system for mild oxidation.\n    *   **Transformation**: The secondary alcohol at the C7 position is oxidized to a ketone (`C=O`), forming **Product 3**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Thermal Decomposition (Retro-Diels-Alder Reaction)**\n    *   **Careful Point**: This is the crucial final step. Heating the large Diels-Alder adduct **Product 3** to 150°C favors the reverse reaction, a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**. This fragmentation is driven by a large increase in entropy and the formation of highly stable final products.\n    *   **Fragmentation Products**: Product 3 decomposes back into its constituent parts: two molecules of the regenerated diene (**`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**) and one molecule of the oxidized dienophile core (`bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`).\n    *   **Further Decomposition**: The `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` intermediate is itself thermally unstable and readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination, extruding a stable molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the very stable aromatic molecule **benzene**.\n\n### Identification of Final Product \"4\" and Symmetry Analysis\n\nThe stable organic products from the entire sequence are benzene and `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens on \"final product 4.\"\n\n*   **Elimination of Benzene**: Benzene has only **1** type of chemically distinct hydrogen due to its high symmetry. Since '1' is not among the options (10, 8, 7, 4), benzene cannot be Product 4.\n*   **Identification of Product 4**: Therefore, \"Product 4\" must be **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**: To count the distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n    *   The molecule possesses a C₂ axis of rotation that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   This symmetry makes pairs of hydrogen atoms chemically equivalent:\n        1.  The hydrogen on C1 and the hydrogen on C4 are equivalent. **(Set 1)**\n        2.  The hydrogen on C2 and the hydrogen on C3 are equivalent. **(Set 2)**\n        3.  The two exocyclic methylene groups (`=CH₂`) are interchanged by the C₂ rotation. Within each group, the two protons are in different chemical environments (diastereotopic). The two \"inner\" protons are equivalent to each other. **(Set 3)**\n        4.  Similarly, the two \"outer\" protons are equivalent to each other. **(Set 4)**\n\nCounting these unique sets gives a total of **4** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. This would correspond to 4 signals in a proton NMR spectrum. This numerical answer matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis problem requires a careful, step-by-step analysis of a four-step reaction sequence to identify the structure of the final product (\"4\") and then determine the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms by analyzing its molecular symmetry.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the chemical transformations and key analysis points, synthesizing the consensus from the provided answers:\n\n### **Step 1: Diene Generation and Double Diels-Alder Reaction**\n*   **Careful Point 1 (Identifying the Reactive Diene):** The starting material `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` reacts with sodium iodide (NaI).

This intermediate, `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`, is known to be thermally unstable and rapidly undergoes a cheletropic elimination to lose a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO), forming the highly stable aromatic molecule **benzene**.\n\n### **Step 5: Identifying the Final Product and Counting Hydrogens**\n*   **Careful Point 7 (Choosing the Correct Product):** The final stable organic products in the mixture are benzene and `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens on \"final product 4.\" We must check which of the products corresponds to the given multiple-choice options (10, 8, 4, 7).\n    *   **Benzene (C₆H₆):** Is highly symmetric, and all six hydrogens are chemically equivalent. It has **1** distinct type of hydrogen. This number is not among the options.\n    *   **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene` (C₈H₈):** Therefore, \"final product 4\" must be this other major organic product.\n*   **Careful Point 8 (Symmetry Analysis):** We must analyze the symmetry of `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene` to count the non-equivalent hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The molecule possesses a **C₂ axis of rotation** that passes through the centers of the C2-C3 bond and the C5-C6 bond.\n    *   This symmetry operation creates sets of equivalent hydrogens:\n        1.

The C₂ axis relates the two \"inner\" hydrogens, making them equivalent to each other. (**Set 3**)\n        4.  Similarly, the C₂ axis relates the two \"outer\" hydrogens, making them equivalent to each other. (**Set 4**)\n*   **Conclusion:** There are a total of **4** chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms. This number matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires a careful, step-by-step analysis of a four-step organic reaction sequence.

This retro-Diels-Alder reaction is entropically favored and is the most critical step in simplifying the molecule.\n    *   **Careful Point 7: Fragmentation.** The molecule fragments back into its constituents: two molecules of the regenerated diene (`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`) and one molecule of the oxidized dienophile core (`bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`).\n    *   **Careful Point 8: Subsequent Decomposition.** The bicyclic ketone intermediate is known to be thermally unstable and readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination to extrude a stable molecule of carbon monoxide (CO), forming the highly stable aromatic molecule **benzene**.\n\n### **Identification of the Final Product and Symmetry Analysis**\n\nThe final mixture contains two stable organic products: **benzene** and **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on \"final product 4\".\n\n*   **Eliminating Benzene:** Benzene (C₆H₆) has a high degree of symmetry, making all six of its hydrogen atoms chemically identical. It has only **1** distinct type of hydrogen. This value is not among the multiple-choice options (A=7, B=10, C=4, D=8), so benzene cannot be \"Product 4\".\n*   **Identifying Product 4:** \"Product 4\" must therefore be `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** We must analyze the structure of this molecule to count its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The molecule possesses a C₂ rotational axis of symmetry that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 single bonds.\n    *   This symmetry operation creates sets of equivalent hydrogen atoms:\n        1.  The hydrogen on C1 and the hydrogen on C4 are equivalent.\n        2.  The hydrogen on C2 and the hydrogen on C3 are equivalent.\n        3.  The two exocyclic methylene groups (`=CH₂`) are interchanged by rotation. Within each group, the two protons are in different chemical environments (diastereotopic).

All provided answers follow the same logical and chemically sound pathway.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The Initial Reaction (In-situ Diene Formation)**\n*   The reaction begins with `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` and sodium iodide (NaI). All analyses correctly identify this as a reductive elimination reaction. The two `-CHBr₂` groups on the sp³-hybridized C5 and C6 atoms of the ring react with NaI, removing the four bromine atoms and forming two new exocyclic double bonds (`=CH₂`).\n*   The key reactive species formed *in situ* is **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`** (also known as isotoluene). This species acts as the diene in the subsequent step.\n\n**Careful Point 2: The Double Diels-Alder Reaction**\n*   The dienophile, `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene`, has two double bonds. Since the problem specifies two equivalents of the diene precursor, two molecules of the generated diene react in successive [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloadditions.\n*   This forms a large, complex, polycyclic adduct, **Product 1**.\n\n**Careful Point 3: The Deprotection**\n*   Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).

This is unanimously recognized as a mild oxidation procedure specific for converting the secondary alcohol at C7 into a ketone (`C=O`).\n*   The resulting molecule is **Product 3**.\n\n**Careful Point 5: The Thermal Decomposition**\n*   Product 3, the large double Diels-Alder adduct, is heated to 150 °C. At this temperature, the reversible Diels-Alder reaction proceeds in the reverse direction, a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**. This step is favored by a large positive change in entropy and the formation of very stable final products.\n*   The fragmentation correctly breaks Product 3 down into two types of molecules:\n    1.  Two molecules of the regenerated diene: **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**.\n    2.  One molecule of the oxidized dienophile core: **`bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`**.\n\n**Careful Point 6: Subsequent Decomposition**\n*   A crucial subsequent reaction is the decomposition of the `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` intermediate. It is thermally unstable and readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination to extrude a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) and form the highly stable aromatic molecule, **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### **Final Analysis: Identifying \"Product 4\" and Counting Distinct Hydrogens**\n\nThe final mixture contains two stable organic products: **benzene** and **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**. We must determine which of these is \"Product 4\" by comparing the number of its distinct hydrogen atoms with the given options (A: 8, B: 7, C: 4, D: 10).\n\n1.  **Benzene (C₆H₆):** Due to its high D₆h symmetry, all six of its hydrogen atoms are chemically identical.

This number is not among the options.\n2.  **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene` (C₈H₈):** Since benzene is not a possible answer, \"Product 4\" must be this molecule. We analyze its structure for symmetry to count its distinct hydrogens.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a C₂ rotational axis of symmetry that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Hydrogen Equivalence:** This C₂ symmetry makes pairs of hydrogen atoms chemically equivalent.\n        *   **Set 1:** The hydrogens on the ring carbons C1 and C4 are equivalent.\n        *   **Set 2:** The hydrogens on the ring carbons C2 and C3 are equivalent.\n        *   **Set 3:** The C₂ axis exchanges the two exocyclic methylene groups (=CH₂). Within each methylene group, the two protons are diastereotopic (in different chemical environments, \"inner\" vs \"outer\"). The two \"inner\" protons are made equivalent by the C₂ axis.\n        *   **Set 4:** Similarly, the two \"outer\" protons are made equivalent by the C₂ axis.\n    *   **Conclusion:** There are a total of **4** chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms. This would lead to four signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe number of chemically distinct hydrogens is 4.

The four bromine atoms are eliminated from the two `-CHBr₂` groups, creating two exocyclic double bonds (`=CH₂`). The diene generated *in situ* is **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: The Cycloaddition Reaction.** Two equivalents of this reactive diene react with the dienophile, `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene`, which has two double bonds. This occurs via two sequential [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloadditions, forming a large, polycyclic molecule, **Product 1**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Deprotection of the Ether**\n    *   Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard acid-catalyzed hydrolysis that cleaves the tert-butyl ether protecting group. The `tert-butoxy` (-O-tBu) group at the C7 position of the central core is replaced with a hydroxyl group (-OH), forming **Product 2**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Oxidation of the Alcohol**\n    *   Product 2 is treated with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃-pyridine complex in DMSO).

High temperatures favor the reverse of the Diels-Alder reaction, a process known as a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**. This is an entropically driven fragmentation.\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Fragmentation and Subsequent Reactions.** Product 3 decomposes back into its building blocks: two molecules of the regenerated diene (`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`) and one molecule of the oxidized dienophile core (`bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`). The latter is itself thermally unstable and readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination to lose a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) and form the highly stable aromatic molecule, **benzene**.\n\n### Analysis of the Final Product \"4\"\n\n*   **Careful Point 5: Identifying the Correct Final Product.** The final mixture of stable organic products contains benzene and `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`. We must determine which of these corresponds to the given options (A=7, B=4, C=10, D=8).\n    *   **Benzene (C₆H₆)** is highly symmetric and has only **1** chemically distinct type of hydrogen. This number is not among the options.\n    *   Therefore, \"final product 4\" must be **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 6: Symmetry of the Final Product.** To count the distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the symmetry of `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`. The molecule possesses a **C₂ rotational axis of symmetry** that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n\n*   **Careful Point 7: Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Environments.** This C₂ symmetry makes several pairs of hydrogen atoms chemically equivalent:\n    1.  The hydrogen on C1 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C4. (**Set 1**)\n    2.  The hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C3. (**Set 2**)\n    3.  The two exocyclic methylene groups (=CH₂) are equivalent. Within each methylene group, the two hydrogens are in different chemical environments (diastereotopic). The C₂ axis relates the two \"inner\" hydrogens, making them equivalent. (**Set 3**)\n    4.  Similarly, the C₂ axis relates the two \"outer\" hydrogens, making them equivalent. (**Set 4**)\n\nThis analysis reveals a total of **4** chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms. This number corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nAn analysis of the provided candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the chemical transformations and the final structure. The reasoning can be broken down into the following key steps:\n\n### **Step-by-step analysis**\n\n1.  **Step 1: In-situ Diene Generation and Diels-Alder Cycloaddition**\n    *   **Reaction:** All agents correctly identify that `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` reacts with sodium iodide (NaI) in a reductive dehalogenation.\n    *   **Diene Formed:** The product of this reaction is `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`. This highly reactive molecule acts as the diene in the subsequent step.\n    *   **Cycloaddition:** This generated diene (2 equivalents) reacts with the two double bonds of the dienophile, `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene`, via two sequential [4+2] Diels-Alder reactions to form the large polycyclic molecule, **Product 1**. There is unanimous agreement on this pathway.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Acidic Deprotection**\n    *   **Reaction:** All agents agree that treating **Product 1** with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) performs a standard acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the tert-butyl ether.\n    *   **Transformation:** The tert-butoxy (`-OtBu`) group is converted to a hydroxyl (`-OH`) group, yielding **Product 2**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Oxidation**\n    *   **Reaction:** All agents correctly identify the `SO₃/pyridine/DMSO` reagent system as the Parikh-Doering oxidant.\n    *   **Transformation:** This reagent converts the secondary alcohol in **Product 2** into a ketone (C=O), forming **Product 3**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Thermal Decomposition**\n    *   **Reaction:** All agents agree that heating the complex Diels-Alder adduct **Product 3** to 150°C will induce a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**. This is the most crucial and logical step.\n    *   **Fragmentation Products:** The decomposition of **Product 3** regenerates the starting components (in their final forms):\n        1.  Two molecules of the diene: `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`.\n        2.  One molecule of the oxidized dienophile core: `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`.\n    *   **Further Reaction:** All agents also correctly identify that the `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` intermediate is thermally unstable and will undergo a cheletropic elimination to extrude a stable molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) and form **benzene**.\n\n### **Analysis of the Final Product (\"4\")**\n\n*   **Identifying \"Product 4\"**: The stable organic products in the final mixture are benzene and `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`. All agents correctly deduce that since benzene has only **1** chemically distinct hydrogen atom (a number not available in the options), \"Product 4\" must be `5,6-dimethylidenecylcohexa-1,3-diene`.\n\n*   **Symmetry and Hydrogen Count**: All agents correctly analyze the symmetry of `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`. The molecule possesses a C₂ rotational axis that renders pairs of hydrogen atoms chemically equivalent. This analysis unanimously leads to the conclusion that there are **4** sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms:\n    1.  The two hydrogens on C1 and C4.\n    2.  The two hydrogens on C2 and C3.\n    3.  The two \"inner\" hydrogens on the exocyclic methylene (`=CH₂`) groups.\n    4.  The two \"outer\" hydrogens on the exocyclic methylene groups.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe rigorous and unanimous chemical reasoning presented by all candidate answers demonstrates that the final product in question, \"4\", has **4** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. This corresponds to option D in the question.

One molecule of the oxidized dienophile core: `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`.\n*   A subsequent, rapid reaction occurs: the `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` intermediate is thermally unstable. It readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination to release a very stable molecule of carbon monoxide (CO), forming another highly stable product, **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### **Identifying the Final Product and Counting its Hydrogens**\n\n**Careful Point 5: Identifying \"Product 4\"**\n*   The final mixture of stable organic products contains benzene and `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`.\n*   The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens on \"final product 4\". We must evaluate the final products against the given multiple-choice options (A: 8, B: 4, C: 7, D: 10).\n*   Benzene (C₆H₆) has very high symmetry (D₆h point group), which makes all six of its hydrogen atoms chemically identical. It has only **1** distinct type of hydrogen. This number is not among the options.\n*   Therefore, \"final product 4\" must be the other major organic product: **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**.\n\n**Careful Point 6: Symmetry Analysis of Product 4**\n*   We must now analyze the structure of `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene` to count its chemically non-equivalent hydrogen atoms.\n*   The molecule possesses a C₂ axis of rotation that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n*   This C₂ symmetry creates sets of equivalent hydrogen atoms:\n    1.  The hydrogen on C1 is chemically equivalent to the hydrogen on C4. This is **Set 1**.\n    2.  The hydrogen on C2 is chemically equivalent to the hydrogen on C3. This is **Set 2**.\n    3.  The C₂ axis exchanges the two exocyclic methylene groups (=CH₂). The two protons on a single methylene group are not equivalent to each other (they are diastereotopic). The C₂ rotation makes the two \"inner\" protons equivalent to each other. This is **Set 3**.\n    4.  Similarly, the C₂ rotation makes the two \"outer\" protons equivalent to each other. This is **Set 4**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe analysis reveals that there are a total of **4** chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms in `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`. This number matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires a detailed analysis of a four-step chemical reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product (\"4\") and then an analysis of its molecular symmetry to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. All provided candidate answers follow a consistent and chemically sound line of reasoning.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n1.  **Step 1: In-situ Diene Generation and Double Diels-Alder Reaction.**\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Diene Generation.** The reaction begins with `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` and sodium iodide (NaI). The most direct chemical interpretation is a reductive elimination. The two `-CHBr₂` groups on the C5 and C6 carbons of the ring undergo a tetra-dehalogenation, eliminating all four bromine atoms to form two new exocyclic double bonds (`=CH₂`).\n    *   **Generated Diene:** The highly reactive diene formed *in situ* is **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Cycloaddition.** The problem specifies that 2 equivalents of this diene precursor are used with the dienophile, `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene`. Since the dienophile has two reactive double bonds, two sequential [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloadditions occur, forming a large, polycyclic molecule, **Product 1**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Hydrolysis (Deprotection).**\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Identifying the Reaction.** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard protocol for the acid-catalyzed cleavage of a tert-butyl ether protecting group. The `tert-butoxy` (-O*t*Bu) group at the C7 bridge position is converted to a hydroxyl (-OH) group, yielding **Product 2**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Oxidation.**\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Identifying the Reagent.** Product 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO. This is the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild method for oxidizing a secondary alcohol (like the one at C7) into a ketone (C=O). The product is the corresponding ketone, **Product 3**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Thermal Decomposition.**\n    *   **Careful Point 5: The Key Thermal Reaction.** Product 3 is heated to 150°C. Diels-Alder reactions are thermally reversible, and at high temperatures, the reverse reaction, a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**, is favored. This fragmentation is driven by a large increase in entropy and the formation of highly stable products.\n    *   **Careful Point 6: Fragmentation and Subsequent Decomposition.**\n        1.  Product 3 fragments back into its constituent parts: two molecules of the regenerated diene, **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**, and one molecule of the oxidized dienophile core, **`bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`**.\n        2.  The `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` intermediate is known to be thermally unstable and rapidly undergoes a cheletropic elimination, losing a stable molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the highly stable aromatic molecule **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### **Analysis of the Final Product \"4\"**\n\n*   **Careful Point 7: Identifying the Correct Product.** The final stable organic products in the mixture are benzene and `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens on \"final product 4.\" We must check which product corresponds to the given multiple-choice options.\n    *   **Benzene:** Has only **1** chemically distinct type of hydrogen due to its high symmetry. This number is not among the options (10, 7, 8, 4).\n    *   Therefore, \"final product 4\" must be the other major organic product: **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 8: Symmetry Analysis and Counting.** We must analyze the symmetry of `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene` (C₈H₈) to count its non-equivalent hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The molecule possesses a **C₂ axis of rotation** that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   This symmetry operation creates four distinct sets of equivalent hydrogens:\n        1.  The hydrogen on C1 and the hydrogen on C4 are equivalent. (**Set 1**)\n        2.  The hydrogen on C2 and the hydrogen on C3 are equivalent. (**Set 2**)\n        3.  The two exocyclic methylene groups (=CH₂) are equivalent. The two hydrogens on each group are diastereotopic (\"inner\" and \"outer\"). The C₂ axis relates the two \"inner\" hydrogens, making them equivalent. (**Set 3**)\n        4.  Similarly, the C₂ axis relates the two \"outer\" hydrogens, making them equivalent. (**Set 4**)\n    *   This analysis reveals a total of **4** chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms. This number would result in four signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, 4, is 4. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
