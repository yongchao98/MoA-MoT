What is the interplanar distance of the (111) plane of the crystal?\n\nA) 10.05 Angstrom\nB) 9.54 Angstrom\nC) 8.95 Angstrom\nD) 9.08 Angstrom\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the information from the candidate answers and identifying the careful points required to reach the correct solution.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem and Verify Given Information\nThe objective is to calculate the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal.\n*   **Crystal System:** Rhombohedral\n*   **Lattice Parameter (a):** 10 Angstrom\n*   **Interaxial Angles (α=β=γ):** 30°\n*   **Miller Indices (hkl):** (111)\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Candidate Answers and Identify Consensus\nAn analysis of all 15 candidate answers reveals two critical points of agreement:\n1.  **Methodology:** All agents who showed their work correctly identified and used the same physical formula for the interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral crystal.\n2.  **Numerical Result:** All agents correctly calculated the numerical value to be approximately **9.54 Angstrom**.\n\nThe only point of disagreement is the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D). The agents' own analyses correctly conclude that this is due to them being presented with the multiple-choice options in different, randomized orders. Therefore, the core task is to verify the calculation and match the correct numerical result to the option list provided in the original question.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Calculation\nThis verification involves several points that require careful attention to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Choosing the Correct Formula**\nThe general formula for interplanar spacing ($d_{hkl}$) in a rhombohedral crystal system is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d^2_{hkl}} = \\frac{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk + kl + hl)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1 - 3\\cos^2\\alpha + 2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n\n**Careful Point 2: Simplifying the Formula**\nUsing the complex general formula directly is prone to calculation errors. A crucial step for accuracy and simplicity is to simplify the formula for the specific case of the (111) plane, where h=k=l=1. Through algebraic factorization, the complex formula reduces to a much simpler and more robust equation:\n$$ d_{111} = a \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 2\\cos\\alpha}{3}} $$\nThis simplified formula is the most reliable tool for solving this specific problem.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Performing a Precise Calculation**\nNow, substitute the given values into the simplified formula, maintaining precision by using the exact value for `cos(30°)` as long as possible.\n*   `a = 10` Angstrom\n*   `α = 30°`, so `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n\n$$ d_{111} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 2(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})}{3}} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$$ d_{111} \\approx 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.73205}{3}} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{2.73205}{3}} \\approx 10 \\times \\sqrt{0.91068} \\approx 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\nRounding to two decimal places, the result is **9.54 Angstrom**. This confirms the consensus numerical value from the candidate answers.\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer Selection\nThe final and most critical step is to match the verified numerical result to the specific list of options provided in the **Question**.\n\n**Question's Options:**\nA) 9.54 Angstrom\nB) 8.95 Angstrom\nC) 10.05 Angstrom\nD) 9.08 Angstrom\n\nOur calculated and verified value of **9.54 Angstrom** directly matches option **A**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\nThe analysis of the 15 candidate answers reveals a crucial pattern: there is a unanimous consensus on the methodology and the final numerical result, but a discrepancy in the selected letter (A, B, C, or D). This strongly suggests that the calculation is correct, but the options were presented in a different order to each agent. My task is to verify the calculation and match the correct number to the options list provided in the question.\n\n### Step 1: State the Physics Problem and Given Data\nThe goal is to calculate the interplanar distance `d` for the (111) crystal plane in a rhombohedral lattice.\n*   **Crystal System:** Rhombohedral\n*   **Lattice Parameter (a):** 10 Angstrom\n*   **Interaxial Angles (α = β = γ):** 30°\n*   **Miller Indices (hkl):** (111)\n\n### Step 2: Select the Correct Formula\nThe general formula for the interplanar spacing, d_hkl, in a rhombohedral crystal system is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk+kl+lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1 - 3\\cos^2\\alpha + 2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n\n### Step 3: List Careful Points\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Importance of Formula Simplification.** Using the large general formula directly is complex and increases the chance of calculation errors. As noted by the more thorough candidate answers, the formula simplifies significantly for the specific case of the (111) plane, where `h=k=l=1`. After algebraic and trigonometric factorization, the expression elegantly reduces to:\n    $$ d_{111} = a \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 2\\cos\\alpha}{3}} $$\n    Using this simplified version is the most reliable and efficient path to the correct answer.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Maintaining Precision During Calculation.** To avoid rounding errors, it is best practice to substitute the exact value for `cos(30°)`, which is `√3 / 2`, and perform the final numerical calculation at the end. The calculation is as follows:\n    $$ d_{111} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 2(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})}{3}} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n    The executed Python code confirmed the high-precision result of this calculation.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Resolving the Final Answer Discrepancy.** The output from the code is `9.542974392310603`. Rounded to two decimal places, this is **9.54 Angstrom**. This confirms the numerical result agreed upon by all 15 candidate answers. The final and most critical step is to ignore the letter choices made by the agents (as they saw different option orders) and match our confirmed numerical value to the specific option list provided in the question prompt.\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer Selection\nThe provided options are:\nA) 8.95 Angstrom\nB) 10.05 Angstrom\nC) 9.54 Angstrom\nD) 9.08 Angstrom\n\nOur calculated value of **9.54 Angstrom** directly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the candidate answers and a verification of the underlying physics and mathematics, the following step-by-step reasoning determines the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal and Given Information:** The task is to calculate the interplanar distance `d` for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. The given parameters are:\n    *   Crystal System: Rhombohedral\n    *   Lattice Parameter (`a`): 10 Angstrom\n    *   Interaxial Angle (`α`): 30°\n    *   Miller Indices `(hkl)`: (111)\n\n2.  **Verify the Correct Formula:** All candidate agents correctly identified the general formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral lattice.\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d^2_{hkl}} = \\frac{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk + kl + hl)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1 - 3\\cos^2\\alpha + 2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n\n3.  **Perform Simplification (Careful Point #1):** A critical step, noted by the more thorough agents, is to simplify this general formula for the specific case of the (111) plane where `h=k=l=1`. Using the large formula directly is complex and increases the risk of calculation errors. Algebraic factorization and cancellation of terms reduce the expression to a much simpler and more robust formula:\n    $$ d_{111} = a \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 2\\cos\\alpha}{3}} $$\n    The consistent derivation and use of this simplified formula across multiple agents confirm its validity and utility for this specific problem.\n\n4.  **Perform Calculation (Careful Point #2):** The next step is to substitute the given values into the simplified formula. For maximum accuracy, it is best to use the exact value of `cos(30°) = √3 / 2` for as long as possible before performing the final numerical calculation.\n    $$ d_{111} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 2(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})}{3}} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n    Now, calculating the numerical value:\n    $$ d_{111} \\approx 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.73205}{3}} \\approx 10 \\times \\sqrt{0.91068} \\approx 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\n    Rounding to two decimal places gives **9.54 Angstrom**. This numerical result represents a point of overwhelming consensus among all 15 candidate answers. I will confirm this with a simple Python script for high precision.\n    ```python\n    import math\n\n    a = 10.0  # Lattice parameter in Angstrom\n    alpha_deg = 30.0  # Angle in degrees\n    \n    # Convert angle to radians for the math library\n    alpha_rad = math.radians(alpha_deg)\n    \n    # Use the simplified formula for d_111\n    d_111 = a * math.sqrt((1 + 2 * math.cos(alpha_rad)) / 3)\n    \n    print(d_111)\n    ```\n\n5.  **Reconcile Discrepancies (Careful Point #3):** The various candidate answers, despite agreeing on the numerical value of ~9.54, provided different final letter choices (A, B, C, or D). The agents correctly identified that this was because the options were presented to them in a different, randomized order. Therefore, the crucial final step is to map the confirmed numerical result to the specific list of options provided in the **original question prompt**.\n\n    The question's options are:\n    *   A) 10.05 Angstrom\n    *   B) 8.95 Angstrom\n    *   C) 9.08 Angstrom\n    *   D) 9.54 Angstrom\n\n    The calculated value of **9.54 Angstrom** directly matches option **D**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Goal and Given Data**\nThe task is to calculate the interplanar distance for the (111) plane of a rhombohedral crystal. The given information is:\n*   **Crystal System:** Rhombohedral\n*   **Lattice Parameter (a):** 10 Angstrom\n*   **Interaxial Angle ($\\alpha$):** 30°\n*   **Miller Indices (hkl):** (111)\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Candidate Answers and Find the Consensus**\nA review of all 15 candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the key aspects of the solution:\n\n1.  **The Correct Formula:** All agents who show their work correctly identify the formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system.\n2.  **The Numerical Calculation:** Every agent that performs a calculation arrives at the same numerical result. The calculation yields a value of approximately **9.54 Angstrom**.\n3.  **The Source of Disagreement:** The final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) varies among the candidate answers. This is not due to any disagreement in the calculation, but because the multiple-choice options were presented in a different, randomized order to each agent.\n\n### **Step 3: List the Careful Points in the Analysis**\nTo ensure the correct answer, the following careful points must be addressed:\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Use the Correct, Simplified Formula.**\n    While a complex general formula exists, for the specific (111) plane of a rhombohedral crystal, it simplifies significantly. Using this simplified formula is more efficient and less prone to calculation errors. The correct simplified formula, used by the most thorough agents, is:\n    $$ d_{111} = a \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 2\\cos\\alpha}{3}} $$\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Perform an Accurate Calculation.**\n    We must substitute the given values (`a = 10`, `α = 30°`) into this formula.\n    $$ d_{111} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 2\\cos(30^\\circ)}{3}} $$\n    Using the exact value of `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`:\n    $$ d_{111} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 2(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})}{3}} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n    The numerical calculation gives:\n    $$ d_{111} \\approx 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\n    This can be confirmed with a quick calculation.\n    ```python\n    import math\n\n    a = 10.0\n    alpha_deg = 30.0\n    alpha_rad = math.radians(alpha_deg)\n\n    # Simplified formula for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal\n    d_111 = a * math.sqrt((1 + 2 * math.cos(alpha_rad)) / 3)\n\n    print(d_111)\n    ```\n    The output `9.54297...` confirms that the value, when rounded to two decimal places, is **9.54 Angstrom**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Match the Result to the Correct Options.**\n    The most crucial step is to ignore the letter choices made by the candidate agents (as their option lists were different) and match our confirmed numerical result to the specific list of options provided in the original question.\n\n    The question's options are:\n    A) 8.95 Angstrom\n    B) 9.08 Angstrom\n    C) 10.05 Angstrom\n    D) 9.54 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated and verified value of 9.54 Angstrom corresponds directly to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe successful execution of the python code provides a high-precision value for the interplanar distance.\n\n1.  **Code Output Confirmation:** The code returned `9.542974392310603`.

The given parameters are:\n    *   **Crystal System**: Rhombohedral\n    *   **Lattice Parameter (a)**: 10 Angstrom. (The term \"interatomic distance\" is standardly interpreted as the lattice parameter `a` in this context, an assumption unanimously made by all candidate agents).\n    *   **Interaxial Angles (α = β = γ)**: 30°\n    *   **Miller Indices (hkl)**: (111)\n\n2.  **Verify the Correct Formula**: All candidate agents correctly identified the general formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral crystal. However, as noted by the more detailed agents, a direct calculation with the general formula is complex and prone to errors. A crucial step is to simplify this formula for the specific case of the (111) plane. The general formula:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d^2_{hkl}} = \\frac{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk + kl + hl)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1 - 3\\cos^2\\alpha + 2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n    For h=k=l=1, this expression simplifies through algebraic factorization to:\n    $$ d_{111} = a \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 2\\cos\\alpha}{3}} $$\n\n3.  **Perform Independent Calculation**: Using the simplified and more robust formula, we can calculate the numerical value.\n    *   `a = 10` Angstrom\n    *   `α = 30°`\n    *   `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n    \n    Substitute these values into the equation:\n    $$ d_{111} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 2(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})}{3}} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n    Now, calculating the value:\n    $$ d_{111} \\approx 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.73205}{3}} \\approx 10 \\times \\sqrt{0.910683} \\approx 10 \\times 0.954297 $$\n    $$ d_{111} \\approx 9.54 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\n    This calculation confirms the numerical result found by all candidate agents.\n\n4.  **Synthesize Candidate Answers**: There is a clear and strong consensus among all 15 candidate answers that the correct numerical value for the interplanar distance is approximately **9.54 Angstrom**. The discrepancy in their final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) is because they were each presented with the multiple-choice options in a different, randomized order. Their differing final answers do not reflect a disagreement on the correct value.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Selection**: The final task is to map the verified numerical result to the specific list of options provided in the question prompt.\n    The options are:\n    *   **A) 9.54 Angstrom**\n    *   B) 8.95 Angstrom\n    *   C) 10.05 Angstrom\n    *   D) 9.08 Angstrom\n\n    Our calculated value of **9.54 Angstrom** matches option A.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n*   **Formula Simplification**: The key to an accurate and efficient solution is using the simplified formula for the d-spacing of the (111) plane rather than the full general formula, which minimizes the potential for calculation errors.\n*   **Numerical Consensus**: The most valuable insight from the candidate answers is the unanimous agreement on the calculated value of ~9.54 Angstrom, which gives extremely high confidence in the numerical result.\n*   **Discrepancy Source**: It is critical to recognize that the disagreement in the final letter choices among the agents is an artifact of the testing methodology (randomized option order) and not a reflection of different scientific conclusions.\n*   **Mapping to Options**: The final answer must be based on matching the confirmed numerical value to the specific option list provided in this problem, not the lists cited by the various agents.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe code execution has successfully confirmed the numerical value for the interplanar distance.\n\n### Analysis Confirmation\n\n1.  **Formula Verification**: The correct simplified formula, $d_{111} = a \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 2\\cos\\alpha}{3}}$, was used for the calculation.\n2.  **High-Precision Calculation**: The Python script executed this formula with the given parameters (`a = 10` Angstrom, `α = 30°`).\n3.  **Result**: The code returned a high-precision value of `9.542974392310603` Angstrom.\n4.  **Rounding**: When rounded to two decimal places, this result is **9.54 Angstrom**.\n\n### Final Answer Selection\n\nThe final step is to match this confirmed numerical result against the specific options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) 9.08 Angstrom\n*   **B) 9.54 Angstrom**\n*   C) 10.05 Angstrom\n*   D) 8.95 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated value of 9.54 Angstrom perfectly matches option **B**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer, synthesizing the information from the 15 candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points.\n\n### **1.

Analyze the Candidate Answers and Identify Key Insights**\n\n*   **Consensus on Physics and Formula:** There is a unanimous agreement across all candidate answers on the correct physical formula to use. They all start with the general equation for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral crystal system:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d^2_{hkl}} = \\frac{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk + kl + hl)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1 - 3\\cos^2\\alpha + 2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n\n*   **Consensus on Numerical Result:** All 15 candidates who performed a calculation arrived at the same numerical result: approximately **9.54 Angstrom**. This overwhelming consensus strongly confirms the correctness of the calculated value.\n\n*   **Identifying the Source of Discrepancy:** The candidate answers present different final letter choices (A, B, C, or D).

The given parameters are:\n    *   **Crystal System**: Rhombohedral\n    *   **Lattice Parameter (a)**: 10 Angstrom.

Through algebraic factorization of the trigonometric terms, the complex formula reduces to a much simpler and more reliable version:\n$$ d_{111} = a \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 2\\cos\\alpha}{3}} $$\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Numerical Calculation**\nNext, we substitute the given values, `a = 10` Angstrom and `α = 30°`, into the simplified formula. It is best to use the exact value for `cos(30°)`, which is `√3 / 2`.\n$$ d_{111} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 2(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})}{3}} $$\n$$ d_{111} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value using `√3 ≈ 1.73205`:\n$$ d_{111} \\approx 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.73205}{3}} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{2.73205}{3}} $$\n$$ d_{111} \\approx 10 \\times \\sqrt{0.910683} \\approx 10 \\times 0.954297 $$\nRounding to two decimal places, the interplanar distance is **9.54 Angstrom**. This numerical result is the strong consensus across all 15 candidate answers.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize and Select the Final Answer**\nAn analysis of the 15 candidate answers shows universal agreement on the numerical value of approximately 9.54 Angstrom. The disagreement in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) stems from the fact that each was presented with a differently randomized set of options. The final step is to map our confirmed numerical result to the specific list of options provided in the original question.\n\nThe question's options are:\nA) 8.95 Angstrom\nB) 10.05 Angstrom\nC) 9.54 Angstrom\nD) 9.08 Angstrom\n\nOur calculated value of **9.54 Angstrom** directly matches option **C**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Correct Formula for the Crystal System:** The first point of care is to select the correct interplanar spacing formula. The one for a rhombohedral system is distinct from those for cubic, hexagonal, or other systems. All candidate agents passed this check.\n2.  **Formula Simplification:** The simplification of the complex general formula for the specific (111) plane is a critical step that greatly reduces the risk of calculation errors and demonstrates a deeper understanding of the underlying mathematics. This was the most effective strategy used by the candidate agents.\n3.  **Precision in Calculation:** To ensure accuracy, it is best practice to use the exact value for `cos(30°)` (i.e., `√3 / 2`) for as long as possible in the equation, only converting to a decimal for the final numerical answer. This minimizes intermediate rounding errors.\n4.  **Final Answer Mapping:** After confirming the numerical value, the final critical step is to carefully match it against the specific list of multiple-choice options provided in *this* problem prompt, as the unanimous agreement on the numerical result contrasted with the disagreement on the letter choice shows that option ordering is not fixed.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the information from the candidate answers and highlighting the careful points required to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal and Given Information:** The task is to calculate the interplanar distance `d` for the (111) plane of a rhombohedral crystal.\n    *   **Crystal System:** Rhombohedral\n    *   **Lattice Parameter `a`:** 10 Angstrom\n    *   **Interaxial Angles `α = β = γ`:** 30°\n    *   **Miller Indices `(hkl)`:** (111)\n\n2.  **Select the Correct Formula:** The foundation of the calculation is the general formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral lattice. There is a universal consensus among all candidate answers on this formula:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d^2_{hkl}} = \\frac{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk + kl + hl)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1 - 3\\cos^2\\alpha + 2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n\n3.  **Perform Formula Simplification:** This is the first and most critical careful point for solving this problem accurately.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Use the Simplified Formula.** Directly using the large, general formula is prone to calculation errors. For the specific case of the (111) plane, where `h=k=l=1`, the general formula can be simplified through algebraic factorization to a much more robust and manageable form:\n        $$ d_{111} = a \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 2\\cos\\alpha}{3}} $$\n        The consistent use of this simplification by the more thorough candidate answers demonstrates its correctness and utility.\n\n4.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation:** The next step is to substitute the given values into the simplified formula.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Maintain Precision during Calculation.** To avoid rounding errors, it's best to use the exact value for `cos(30°) = √3 / 2` as long as possible before performing the final calculation.\n        $$ d_{111} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 2(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})}{3}} $$\n        $$ d_{111} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n    *   Now, calculate the final numerical value:\n        $$ d_{111} \\approx 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.73205}{3}} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{2.73205}{3}} $$\n        $$ d_{111} \\approx 10 \\times \\sqrt{0.91068} \\approx 10 \\times 0.954297 $$\n        $$ d_{111} \\approx 9.54 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\n\n5.  **Synthesize Results and Resolve Discrepancies:**\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Identify the Source of Disagreement.** There is an overwhelming consensus among all 15 candidate answers on the *numerical result* of approximately **9.54 Angstrom**. The disagreement in their final letter choices (A, B, C, D) is not due to any error in their physics or math, but is an artifact of them being presented with the multiple-choice options in different, randomized orders.\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Map the Correct Value to the Given Options.** The final, definitive step is to ignore the contradictory letter choices from the candidates and map the correct, consensus-based numerical value to the single, official list of options provided in the question.\n\nThe question's options are:\nA) 8.95 Angstrom\nB) 10.05 Angstrom\nC) 9.08 Angstrom\nD) 9.54 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated value of **9.54 Angstrom** directly matches option **D**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe successful execution of the code confirms the numerical result with high precision.\n\n**1. Confirmed Calculation:** The Python script calculated the interplanar distance as `9.542974392310603` Angstrom. Rounding this value to two decimal places gives **9.54 Angstrom**.\n\n**2. Final Answer Selection:** This confirmed value must be matched against the specific options provided in the original question:\n\n*   A) 8.95 Angstrom\n*   B) 10.05 Angstrom\n*   C) 9.08 Angstrom\n*   **D) 9.54 Angstrom**\n\nThe calculated result of 9.54 Angstrom directly corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
