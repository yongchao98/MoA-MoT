Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group. By IUPAC convention, this group is at position C1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO (aldehyde) group at position C2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH₂ group at position C5.\n\nThe structure contains the following features that contribute to the index of hydrogen deficiency:\n*   One ring (the cyclohexane core).\n*   One C=C double bond within the ring.\n*   One C=C double bond in the vinyl group.\n*   One C=O double bond in the formyl group.\n*   One C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group.\n\nThe IHD is the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi bonds.\nIHD (starting material) = 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (C=O in carboxyl) = 5.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent. Its function is to reduce various functional groups completely to their corresponding alkanes. Specifically:\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   It reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n\nThe reaction will proceed as follows:\n*   The **formyl group** (-CHO) at C2 will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **carboxylic acid group** (-COOH) at C1 will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **C=C double bond** in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond, converting the cyclohexene ring into a **cyclohexane ring**.\n*   The **vinyl group** (-CH=CH₂) at C5 will be reduced to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂-CH₃).\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Product**\n\nThe reaction starts with a substituted cyclohexene and reduces all the functional groups and double bonds. The carbon skeleton, including the ring, remains intact.\n*   The cyclohexene ring becomes a **cyclohexane** ring.\n*   The substituents become simple alkyl groups: two methyl groups and one ethyl group.\n\nThe product is a substituted cyclohexane (specifically, 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane, although the exact name is not required).\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe IHD is a count of the rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   **Rings:** The product molecule contains one ring (the cyclohexane ring).\n*   **Pi Bonds:** The reaction with Red P + HI reduces all C=C and C=O double bonds to single bonds. Therefore, the product has zero pi bonds.\n\nIHD (product) = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds)\nIHD (product) = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula of the product. The starting material has 10 carbon atoms (6 in the ring, 1 in COOH, 1 in CHO, 2 in vinyl). The reduction does not change the number of carbons. The product is a substituted cyclohexane with 10 carbon atoms. The general formula for a monocyclic alkane (a saturated compound with one ring) is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   For our product, n = 10.\n*   The molecular formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\nNow, we can use the IHD formula:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2)\nIHD = 11 - 10\nIHD = 1\n\nBoth methods yield an IHD of 1 for the final product.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) 3\nB) 1\nC) 0\nD) 5\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we must first understand the chemical transformation that occurs.\n\n### 1. The Reactant and its Structure\n\nThe starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene:** A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4.\n*   **Carboxylic acid:** A -COOH group, which we'll place at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl:** A -CHO (aldehyde) group at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl:** A -CH=CH₂ group at position 5.\n\nThe molecular formula for this reactant is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\n### 2. The Reaction\n\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. It is known to reduce several functional groups to alkanes:\n*   **Carboxylic acids (-COOH)** are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   **Aldehydes (-CHO)** are also reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   **Alkenes (C=C)** are reduced to alkanes (C-C).\n*   **Alcohols (-OH)** are reduced to alkanes (-H).\n\nIn this reaction, all oxygen-containing functional groups and all carbon-carbon double bonds will be fully reduced.\n\n### 3. The Product\n\nThe reaction will result in the following transformations on the starting molecule:\n*   The **carboxylic acid** group at position 1 becomes a **methyl group**.\n*   The **formyl (aldehyde)** group at position 2 becomes a **methyl group**.\n*   The **carbon-carbon double bond** within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond, converting the ring to a **cyclohexane** skeleton.\n*   The **vinyl group** (-CH=CH₂) at position 5 is reduced to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe carbon skeleton of the molecule, which consists of 10 carbon atoms (6 in the ring, 1 in the carboxyl group, 1 in the formyl group, and 2 in the vinyl group), remains intact. The final product is a saturated cycloalkane, specifically a disubstituted ethyl-dimethyl-cyclohexane. The exact IUPAC name (e.g., 1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane) is not necessary to determine the molecular formula.\n\nSince the product is a saturated monocyclic alkane with 10 carbon atoms, its general formula will be CₙH₂ₙ, which is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n### 4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. It is calculated using the molecular formula:\n\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n\nWhere:\n*   C is the number of carbon atoms.\n*   H is the number of hydrogen atoms.\n\nFor the product with the molecular formula C₁₀H₂₀:\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\nIHD = 11 - 10\nIHD = 1\n\nAn IHD of 1 corresponds to the presence of a single ring in the saturated cycloalkane product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant:** First, we need to understand the structure of the starting material, \"2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\", and determine its key features that contribute to the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD). The IHD (also known as the degree of unsaturation) is the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   **cyclohex**: This indicates one ring structure (IHD = 1).\n    *   **-3-ene**: This indicates one carbon-carbon double bond within the ring (IHD = 1).\n    *   **vinyl**: This is a -CH=CH2 group, which contains one carbon-carbon double bond (IHD = 1).\n    *   **formyl**: This is a -CHO group, which contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (IHD = 1).\n    *   **carboxylic acid**: This is a -COOH group, which contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (IHD = 1).\n    *   The total IHD of the reactant is 1 (ring) + 1 (ene) + 1 (vinyl) + 1 (formyl) + 1 (acid) = 5.\n\n2.  **Understand the Reaction:** The reactant is treated with red phosphorus and an excess of HI. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. Its function is to reduce most oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n    *   The C=C double bond in the ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n    *   The C=C double bond in the vinyl group will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n    *   The C=O double bond in the formyl group will be reduced, and the whole group becomes a methyl (-CH3).\n    *   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group will be reduced, and the whole group becomes a methyl (-CH3).\n    *   Importantly, this reaction does *not* break the ring structure.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product and its IHD:** After the reaction, all the pi bonds (from C=C and C=O) are removed. The only feature contributing to the IHD that remains is the original cyclohexane ring. Therefore, the IHD of the final product is 1.\n\n4.  **Calculate using Molecular Formula (for verification):**\n    *   **Reactant:** The molecular formula is C10H12O3. IHD = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - 12/2 = 5.\n    *   **Product:** The reaction removes all oxygen and saturates all pi bonds, without changing the number of carbons. The resulting product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon. The general formula for a monocyclic alkane is CnH2n. Since the product has 10 carbon atoms, its formula is C10H20.\n    *   **Product IHD Calculation:** Using the formula for the product (C10H20):\n        IHD = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - 20/2 = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nThe code below will perform this final calculation.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the properties of the reactant.\n# The reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n# Let's determine its molecular formula.\n# Carbons (C): 6 (ring) + 1 (COOH) + 1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) = 10\n# The reaction with red P and excess HI is a complete reduction.\n# It reduces all C=C and C=O bonds and removes oxygen atoms, but does not break the ring.\n# The number of carbon atoms in the product remains the same.\nnum_carbons_product = 10\n\n# Step 2: Determine the molecular formula of the product.\n# The product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon (a substituted cycloalkane).\n# The general formula for a monocyclic alkane is C_n H_{2n}.\n# For n=10, the formula is C10H20.\nnum_hydrogens_product = 2 * num_carbons_product\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the product.\n# The formula for IHD is: C + 1 - (H/2)\n# where C is the number of carbon atoms and H is the number of hydrogen atoms.\nihd_product = num_carbons_product + 1 - (num_hydrogens_product / 2)\n\n# Step 4: Print the result and the corresponding choice.\nprint(\"The reaction involves the complete reduction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\")\nprint(\"The reactant has multiple double bonds (C=C and C=O) and a ring.\")\nprint(\"Red P and excess HI reduce all double bonds but do not open the ring.\")\nprint(f\"The number of carbon atoms in the product is {num_carbons_product}.\")\nprint(f\"The product is a saturated cycloalkane with the formula C{num_carbons_product}H{num_hydrogens_product}.\")\nprint(f\"The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is calculated as: C + 1 - H/2\")\nprint(f\"IHD = {num_carbons_product} + 1 - ({num_hydrogens_product}/2) = {int(ihd_product)}\")\nprint(\"\\nThis IHD value of 1 corresponds to the single ring structure remaining in the product.\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this to the given options:\")\nprint(\"A) 3\")\nprint(\"B) 1\")\nprint(\"C) 5\")\nprint(\"D) 0\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe correct choice is B, as the calculated IHD is {int(ihd_product)}.\")\n```\n<<<B>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The reaction involves the complete reduction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\nThe reactant has multiple double bonds (C=C and C=O) and a ring.\nRed P and excess HI reduce all double bonds but do not open the ring.\nThe number of carbon atoms in the product is 10.\nThe product is a saturated cycloalkane with the formula C10H20.\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is calculated as: C + 1 - H/2\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 1\n\nThis IHD value of 1 corresponds to the single ring structure remaining in the product.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) 3\nB) 1\nC) 5\nD) 0\n\nThe correct choice is B, as the calculated IHD is 1.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the starting material.**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n\n*   **Parent structure:** `cyclohex-3-ene`. This is a six-membered carbon ring with one double bond between carbon-3 and carbon-4.\n*   **Principal functional group:** `carboxylic acid` (-COOH). This is at position 1.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   `2-formyl`: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is at position 2.\n    *   `5-vinyl`: A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) is at position 5.\n\nLet's determine the molecular formula by counting the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C):**\n    *   6 carbons in the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   1 carbon in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   1 carbon in the formyl group (-CHO).\n    *   2 carbons in the vinyl group (-CH=CH₂).\n    *   Total Carbons = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   On the ring: C1(H), C2(H), C3(H), C4(H), C5(H), C6(H₂).

(Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation).\nIHD (start) = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5.\nThis IHD of 5 can be accounted for by:\n*   1 for the ring structure.\n*   1 for the C=C double bond in the cyclohexene ring.\n*   1 for the C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group.\n*   1 for the C=O double bond in the formyl group.\n*   1 for the C=C double bond in the vinyl group.\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5. This confirms our structure is correct.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction and determine the structure of the product.**\n\nThe reagent is **Red Phosphorus and excess of HI**.\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a very strong reducing agent. It is known for the complete reduction of most oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n*   **Effect on functional groups:**\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The formyl group (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The vinyl group's double bond (-CH=CH₂) will be saturated to an ethyl group (-CH₂-CH₃).\n    *   The double bond within the cyclohexene ring will be saturated to a single bond, converting the ring to a cyclohexane ring.\n\n**Product Structure:**\nThe product will be a cyclohexane ring with the following substituents:\n*   A methyl group (-CH₃) at position 1.\n*   A methyl group (-CH₃) at position 2.\n*   An ethyl group (-CH₂-CH₃) at position 5.\nThe product is **5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Careful Point 2: The reaction leads to a fully saturated hydrocarbon, except for the ring.**\nThe term \"excess HI\" implies that the reaction goes to completion, reducing all possible sites.

The IHD of a molecule with the formula C₁₀H₂₀ is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's determine its structure and molecular formula.\n*   **Parent structure**: `cyclohex-3-ene` is a six-membered carbon ring with one double bond.\n*   **Functional Groups**:\n    *   A `carboxylic acid` (-COOH) group. By convention, this is at position C1.\n    *   A `formyl` (-CHO) group at position C2.\n    *   A `vinyl` (-CH=CH2) group at position C5.\n\nFrom this structure, we can determine the molecular formula:\n*   **Carbon (C)**: 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in the vinyl group = 10 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: 7 on the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 3 in the vinyl group = 12 hydrogens.\n*   **Oxygen (O)**: 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\nThe molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI (hydroiodic acid)**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It performs the following reductions:\n*   Reduces aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to their corresponding alkanes (-CH3).\n*   Reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   Removes all oxygen atoms from the molecule.\n\nIn essence, the reaction saturates all multiple bonds and removes all heteroatoms, converting the molecule into a saturated hydrocarbon while preserving the carbon skeleton (including the ring).\n\n**3. Determine the Product**\n\nApplying the effects of the reaction to the starting material:\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring is reduced to a `cyclohexane` ring (the C=C bond is saturated).\n*   The `-COOH` group at C1 is reduced to a `-CH3` group.\n*   The `-CHO` group at C2 is reduced to a `-CH3` group.\n*   The `-CH=CH2` (vinyl) group at C5 is reduced to an ethyl group (`-CH2CH3`).\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Since all double bonds and oxygen atoms are removed, the product is a saturated monocyclic alkane. The carbon count remains 10. The general formula for a saturated monocyclic alkane is CnH2n. Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe IHD (also known as the degree of unsaturation) represents the number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule. It can be calculated from the molecular formula or the structure.\n\n*   **Method 1: From the structure**\n    The product is a substituted cyclohexane. It has one ring and zero pi bonds.\n    IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π-bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n*   **Method 2: From the molecular formula (C10H20)**\n    The formula for IHD for a hydrocarbon (CxHy) is: IHD = C - H/2 + 1.\n    IHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 1\n    IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    IHD = 1\n\nBoth methods yield an IHD of 1. This value corresponds to the single ring present in the final saturated molecule.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we must first identify the starting material and the product of the reaction.\n\n### 1.

The Reaction and the Product\n\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (Red P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. It is known to reduce various functional groups completely to their corresponding alkanes.\n\n*   The **carboxylic acid group** (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The **formyl group** (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The **carbon-carbon double bond** in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond.\n*   The **carbon-carbon double bond** in the vinyl group is reduced to a single bond, converting the vinyl group into an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe reaction removes all oxygen atoms and saturates all double bonds, leaving a saturated hydrocarbon with the same carbon skeleton. The starting molecule has a 10-carbon skeleton (a 6-carbon ring with three substituents containing a total of 4 carbons).\n\nThe resulting product is a substituted cyclohexane: **4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane**.\n\n### 3. Molecular Formula of the Product\n\nThe product, 4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane, is a saturated cycloalkane. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ. Since the carbon skeleton has 10 carbon atoms (n=10), the molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n### 4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula for calculating IHD for a hydrocarbon (CₓHᵧ) is:\n\nIHD = (2x + 2 - y) / 2\n\nFor the product C₁₀H₂₀:\n*   x = 10 (number of carbon atoms)\n*   y = 20 (number of hydrogen atoms)\n\nIHD = (2 * 10 + 2 - 20) / 2\nIHD = (20 + 2 - 20) / 2\nIHD = 2 / 2\nIHD = 1\n\nAn IHD of 1 corresponds to the single ring structure of the cyclohexane molecule.\n\nTherefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we first need to understand the starting material and the reaction it undergoes.\n\n**1. The Reactant: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**\n\nLet's break down the structure to determine its molecular formula:\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene:** A six-membered carbon ring with one double bond.\n*   **Carboxylic acid:** A -COOH group is at position 1.\n*   **Formyl:** A -CHO (aldehyde) group is at position 2.\n*   **Vinyl:** A -CH=CH2 group is at position 5.\n\nThe molecular formula of the reactant is C10H12O3. We can calculate its IHD to verify the structure's features:\n*   IHD = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 5.\n*   This corresponds to one ring, one double bond in the ring, one double bond in the vinyl group, one C=O in the formyl group, and one C=O in the carboxylic acid group (1+1+1+1+1 = 5).\n\n**2. The Reaction: Reduction with Red Phosphorus and Excess HI**\n\nThe combination of red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI) is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce a wide range of oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturated bonds to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The carbon-carbon double bond in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a single bond.\n*   The carbon-carbon double bond in the vinyl group will be reduced, converting the vinyl group into an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\n**3. The Product**\n\nThe reaction completely removes all oxygen atoms and saturates all double bonds, without breaking the carbon ring. The carbon skeleton of the reactant (C10) remains intact. The final product is a saturated cycloalkane with the following structure:\n*   A cyclohexane ring.\n*   A methyl group at position 1 (from the original carboxylic acid).\n*   A methyl group at position 2 (from the original formyl group).\n*   An ethyl group at position 5 (from the original vinyl group).\n\nThe resulting molecule is a substituted cyclohexane. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n. Since the product has 10 carbon atoms, its molecular formula will be C10H20.\n\n**4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe IHD, also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated from the molecular formula using the formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2).\n\nFor the product C10H20:\n*   IHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2)\n*   IHD = 11 - 10\n*   IHD = 1\n\nAn IHD of 1 indicates the presence of either one ring or one double bond. Since the product is a fully saturated cycloalkane (1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane, based on IUPAC naming of the product), the IHD of 1 corresponds to the single ring in its structure.\n\nTherefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we must first understand the reaction that takes place.\n\n**1. The Reactant and Reagents:**\n*   **Reactant:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\n**2. The Reaction:**\nThe combination of red phosphorus and excess HI is a powerful reducing agent. This mixture is known to completely reduce several oxygen-containing functional groups to their corresponding alkanes. Specifically:\n*   Carboxylic acid groups (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   Aldehyde groups (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   This reagent also reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (alkenes) to single bonds (alkanes).\n\n**3. Structure and Molecular Formula of the Reactant:**\nLet's break down the name to determine the structure and formula of the starting material:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene:** A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid:** A -COOH group, which by convention is at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl:** A -CHO group at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl:** A -CH=CH2 group at position 5.\n\nFrom this structure, we can deduce the molecular formula:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in the vinyl group = 10 carbons.\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** After accounting for all the bonds, the formula is C10H12O3.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the reactant is 5, calculated as follows:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 5.\nThis corresponds to one ring, one double bond in the ring, one double bond in the vinyl group, one C=O in the carboxylic acid, and one C=O in the formyl group (1+1+1+1+1 = 5).\n\n**4. Structure and Molecular Formula of the Product:**\nThe reaction with red P and excess HI will cause the following reductions:\n*   The carboxylic acid at C1 becomes a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The formyl group at C2 becomes a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is saturated.\n*   The double bond in the vinyl group is saturated, converting it to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\nThe final product is a saturated, substituted cyclohexane ring. The carbon skeleton remains, so the product will have 10 carbon atoms. Since all double bonds are saturated and all oxygen atoms are removed, the resulting molecule is a cycloalkane. The general formula for a monocyclic alkane is CnH2n.\n\nTherefore, the molecular formula of the product is C10H20.\n\n**5. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\nThe IHD is a measure of the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. It can be calculated from the molecular formula:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\nFor the product (C10H20):\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nThe IHD of 1 corresponds to the presence of the single ring in the cyclohexane structure.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe reaction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid with red phosphorus and excess HI is a complete reduction reaction. This powerful reducing agent converts all oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds into their corresponding saturated alkane forms, while preserving the carbon skeleton.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant's Carbon Skeleton:**\n    *   The reactant is named \"2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\".\n    *   The core structure is a 6-carbon ring (`cyclohex`).\n    *   There is a 1-carbon substituent from the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`).\n    *   There is a 1-carbon substituent from the formyl group (`-CHO`).\n    *   There is a 2-carbon substituent from the vinyl group (`-CH=CH₂`).\n    *   Total number of carbon atoms = 6 (ring) + 1 (acid) + 1 (formyl) + 2 (vinyl) = 10 carbons.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Transformation:**\n    *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring (which has one C=C double bond) is reduced to a `cyclohexane` ring (all C-C single bonds).\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) is reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH₃).\n    *   The `formyl` group (-CHO) is reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH₃).\n    *   The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) is reduced to an `ethyl` group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Determine the Product's Structure and Formula:**\n    *   The product is a fully saturated hydrocarbon containing a single ring structure. It is a substituted cyclohexane.\n    *   Since the product is a monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane) with 10 carbon atoms, its molecular formula follows the general formula for cycloalkanes, which is CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or π-bonds in a molecule.\n    *   **Method 1: By Structure:** The product is a substituted cyclohexane. It has one ring and zero π-bonds. Therefore, the IHD = 1.\n    *   **Method 2: By Formula (IHD = C - H/2 + 1):**\n        *   For the product C₁₀H₂₀:\n        *   IHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 1\n        *   IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n        *   IHD = 1\n\nBoth methods yield an IHD of 1. This single degree of unsaturation is due to the presence of the cyclohexane ring.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant Molecule**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to understand its components and calculate its initial index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD), although this is not strictly required to find the answer.\n\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered carbon ring containing one double bond.\n    *   The ring itself contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   The double bond (C=C) within the ring contributes another 1 to the IHD.\n*   **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**: This functional group contains a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   The C=O double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **formyl (-CHO)**: This is an aldehyde group, which also contains a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   The C=O double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **vinyl (-CH=CH2)**: This substituent contains a carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   The C=C double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n\nSo, the total IHD of the reactant is 1 (ring) + 1 (ring C=C) + 1 (acid C=O) + 1 (aldehyde C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = 5.\n\nLet's also determine the molecular formula of the reactant to be thorough.\n*   The carbon skeleton is a 6-membered ring, a carbon in the -COOH group, a carbon in the -CHO group, and two carbons in the vinyl group. Total Carbons (C) = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n*   The product will be a saturated hydrocarbon, so the number of carbons (10) is the most important piece of information from the reactant's structure.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its key functions are:\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) and triple bonds to single bonds (C-C).\n*   It reduces oxygen-containing functional groups completely to the corresponding hydrocarbon.\n    *   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   Ketones (>C=O) are reduced to methylene groups (>CH2).\n    *   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   Alcohols (-OH) are reduced to alkanes (-H).\n*   Crucially, this reaction does not break the carbon skeleton, including any rings.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure and Formula of the Product**\n\nApplying the effects of Red P + HI to our reactant:\n*   The **cyclohex-3-ene** ring will have its double bond reduced, becoming a **cyclohexane** ring. The ring structure itself remains.\n*   The **carboxylic acid** group will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH3).\n*   The **formyl** group will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH3).\n*   The **vinyl** group will have its double bond reduced, becoming an **ethyl group** (-CH2CH3).\n\nThe final product is a saturated hydrocarbon. It consists of the original 10-carbon skeleton but with all double bonds saturated and all oxygen atoms removed. The structure is a substituted cyclohexane.\n\nSince the product is a saturated hydrocarbon with a single ring (a monocyclic alkane or cycloalkane) and has 10 carbon atoms, we can determine its molecular formula. The general formula for a cycloalkane is **CnH2n**.\nFor our product with n=10, the molecular formula is **C10H20**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated in two ways for the product.\n\n*   **Method 1: Using the molecular formula**\n    The formula for IHD for a hydrocarbon C_c H_h is:\n    IHD = c - h/2 + 1\n    For the product C10H20:\n    IHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 1\n    IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    IHD = 1\n\n*   **Method 2: Based on the structure**\n    The IHD is the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi (π) bonds in the molecule.\n    *   Number of rings in the product = 1 (the cyclohexane ring).\n    *   Number of π bonds in the product = 0 (it is a fully saturated hydrocarbon).\n    IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds)\n    IHD = 1 + 0\n    IHD = 1\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant and its Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nFirst, let's determine the structure and the initial degree of unsaturation (IHD) of the starting material: **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The IHD is a count of the number of rings and π (pi) bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This part of the name tells us there is a six-membered ring (which contributes 1 to the IHD) and one carbon-carbon double bond within that ring (which contributes another 1 to the IHD).\n*   **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**: This functional group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which adds 1 to the IHD.\n*   **formyl (-CHO)**: This aldehyde group also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), adding 1 to the IHD.\n*   **vinyl (-CH=CH₂)**: This substituent contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), adding 1 to the IHD.\n\nSumming these contributions, the total IHD of the reactant is:\nIHD_reactant = 1 (for the ring) + 1 (for the C=C in the ring) + 1 (for the C=O in the acid) + 1 (for the C=O in the aldehyde) + 1 (for the C=C in the vinyl group) = **5**.\n\n**2. Understand the Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This reagent combination is known as a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its function is to perform a complete reduction, meaning it:\n*   Reduces all oxygen-containing functional groups (like carboxylic acids, aldehydes, ketones, alcohols) completely to their corresponding alkane parts (e.g., -COOH and -CHO both become -CH₃).\n*   Reduces all carbon-carbon double and triple bonds to single bonds (saturates the molecule).\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Structure**\n\nThe reaction will transform the starting material into a fully saturated hydrocarbon, while keeping the carbon skeleton intact.\n*   The **cyclohexene** ring will be reduced to a **cyclohexane** ring (the C=C bond is saturated).\n*   The **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH) will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **formyl** group (-CHO) will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **vinyl** group (-CH=CH₂) will be reduced to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. It is a **saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe IHD of the final product is calculated based on its structure using the formula:\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds)\n\n*   **Number of rings**: The product still contains the six-membered cyclohexane ring. Therefore, the number of rings is **1**.\n*   **Number of π bonds**: The complete reduction has eliminated all double bonds (both C=C and C=O). Therefore, the number of π bonds is **0**.\n\nSo, the IHD of the product is:\nIHD_product = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\nThe final product has an index of hydrogen deficiency of 1, which is entirely due to the presence of the ring structure.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product is 1.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Reactant:** The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Its molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n2.  **Reagent and Reaction:** The reagent is red phosphorus with an excess of hydroiodic acid (Red P/HI). This is a very powerful reducing agent that performs the following transformations:\n    *   Reduces all oxygen-containing functional groups (like carboxylic acids and aldehydes) completely to alkanes. The -COOH and -CHO groups are both reduced to -CH₃ groups.\n    *   Reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds (alkenes) to single bonds (alkanes). The double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the vinyl group are both saturated.\n    *   The reaction does not break the carbon ring structure.\n3.  **Product:** The reaction removes all double bonds and all oxygen atoms, leaving a saturated hydrocarbon that retains the original ring structure.\n    *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` core becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` group becomes a `methyl` group.\n    *   The `formyl` group becomes a `methyl` group.\n    *   The `vinyl` group becomes an `ethyl` group.\n    *   The final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Since the carbon skeleton is preserved, the product has 10 carbon atoms. As it is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane), its general formula is CₙH₂ₙ. Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is C₁₀H₂₀.\n4.  **Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) Calculation:** The IHD (also known as the degree of unsaturation) represents the number of rings and/or pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n    *   **Method 1: From the structure.** The product is a cyclohexane derivative. It has one ring and no π bonds. Therefore, IHD = 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for π bonds) = 1.\n    *   **Method 2: From the molecular formula (C₁₀H₂₀).** The formula for IHD is `IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n        IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the reactant.\n\nThe reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4.\n*   **Carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group, which we'll place at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO group at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH2 group at position 5.\n\nThe carbon skeleton consists of the 6-carbon ring, 1 carbon in the carboxylic acid, 1 carbon in the formyl group, and 2 carbons in the vinyl group, for a total of 10 carbon atoms.\n\nThe molecular formula for 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the reaction conditions.\n\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI).

The carbon skeleton is C₁₀. Since all double bonds are saturated and all oxygen atoms are removed, the product is a cycloalkane.\n\nThe general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ. For a C₁₀ cycloalkane, the formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated from the molecular formula or by examining the structure.\n\n**Method 1: Using the IHD Formula**\nThe formula for IHD is: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\nFor the product C₁₀H₂₀:\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\nIHD = 11 - 10\nIHD = 1\n\n**Method 2: Analyzing the Structure**\nThe IHD is the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   The product has one ring (the cyclohexane ring).\n*   The product has zero double or triple bonds.\nTherefore, the IHD = 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for pi bonds) = 1.\n\nBoth methods yield an IHD of 1.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we must first identify the reactant and the product of the specified reaction.\n\n### 1.

Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group. By IUPAC convention, this group is at position C1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO (aldehyde) group at position C2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH₂ group at position C5.\n\nThe structure contains the following features that contribute to the index of hydrogen deficiency:\n*   One ring (the cyclohexane core).\n*   One C=C double bond within the ring.\n*   One C=C double bond in the vinyl group.\n*   One C=O double bond in the formyl group.\n*   One C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group.\n\nThe IHD is the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi bonds.\nIHD (starting material) = 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (C=O in carboxyl) = 5.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent. Its function is to reduce various functional groups completely to their corresponding alkanes. Specifically:\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   It reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n\nThe reaction will proceed as follows:\n*   The **formyl group** (-CHO) at C2 will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **carboxylic acid group** (-COOH) at C1 will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **C=C double bond** in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond, converting the cyclohexene ring into a **cyclohexane ring**.\n*   The **vinyl group** (-CH=CH₂) at C5 will be reduced to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂-CH₃).\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Product**\n\nThe reaction starts with a substituted cyclohexene and reduces all the functional groups and double bonds. The carbon skeleton, including the ring, remains intact.\n*   The cyclohexene ring becomes a **cyclohexane** ring.\n*   The substituents become simple alkyl groups: two methyl groups and one ethyl group.\n\nThe product is a substituted cyclohexane (specifically, 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane, although the exact name is not required).\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe IHD is a count of the rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   **Rings:** The product molecule contains one ring (the cyclohexane ring).\n*   **Pi Bonds:** The reaction with Red P + HI reduces all C=C and C=O double bonds to single bonds. Therefore, the product has zero pi bonds.\n\nIHD (product) = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds)\nIHD (product) = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula of the product. The starting material has 10 carbon atoms (6 in the ring, 1 in COOH, 1 in CHO, 2 in vinyl). The reduction does not change the number of carbons. The product is a substituted cyclohexane with 10 carbon atoms. The general formula for a monocyclic alkane (a saturated compound with one ring) is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   For our product, n = 10.\n*   The molecular formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\nNow, we can use the IHD formula:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2)\nIHD = 11 - 10\nIHD = 1\n\nBoth methods yield an IHD of 1 for the final product.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) 3\nB) 1\nC) 0\nD) 5\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we must first understand the chemical transformation that occurs.\n\n### 1. The Reactant and its Structure\n\nThe starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene:** A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4.\n*   **Carboxylic acid:** A -COOH group, which we'll place at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl:** A -CHO (aldehyde) group at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl:** A -CH=CH₂ group at position 5.\n\nThe molecular formula for this reactant is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\n### 2. The Reaction\n\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. It is known to reduce several functional groups to alkanes:\n*   **Carboxylic acids (-COOH)** are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   **Aldehydes (-CHO)** are also reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   **Alkenes (C=C)** are reduced to alkanes (C-C).\n*   **Alcohols (-OH)** are reduced to alkanes (-H).\n\nIn this reaction, all oxygen-containing functional groups and all carbon-carbon double bonds will be fully reduced.\n\n### 3. The Product\n\nThe reaction will result in the following transformations on the starting molecule:\n*   The **carboxylic acid** group at position 1 becomes a **methyl group**.\n*   The **formyl (aldehyde)** group at position 2 becomes a **methyl group**.\n*   The **carbon-carbon double bond** within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond, converting the ring to a **cyclohexane** skeleton.\n*   The **vinyl group** (-CH=CH₂) at position 5 is reduced to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe carbon skeleton of the molecule, which consists of 10 carbon atoms (6 in the ring, 1 in the carboxyl group, 1 in the formyl group, and 2 in the vinyl group), remains intact. The final product is a saturated cycloalkane, specifically a disubstituted ethyl-dimethyl-cyclohexane. The exact IUPAC name (e.g., 1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane) is not necessary to determine the molecular formula.\n\nSince the product is a saturated monocyclic alkane with 10 carbon atoms, its general formula will be CₙH₂ₙ, which is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n### 4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. It is calculated using the molecular formula:\n\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n\nWhere:\n*   C is the number of carbon atoms.\n*   H is the number of hydrogen atoms.\n\nFor the product with the molecular formula C₁₀H₂₀:\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\nIHD = 11 - 10\nIHD = 1\n\nAn IHD of 1 corresponds to the presence of a single ring in the saturated cycloalkane product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant:** First, we need to understand the structure of the starting material, \"2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\", and determine its key features that contribute to the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD). The IHD (also known as the degree of unsaturation) is the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   **cyclohex**: This indicates one ring structure (IHD = 1).\n    *   **-3-ene**: This indicates one carbon-carbon double bond within the ring (IHD = 1).\n    *   **vinyl**: This is a -CH=CH2 group, which contains one carbon-carbon double bond (IHD = 1).\n    *   **formyl**: This is a -CHO group, which contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (IHD = 1).\n    *   **carboxylic acid**: This is a -COOH group, which contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (IHD = 1).\n    *   The total IHD of the reactant is 1 (ring) + 1 (ene) + 1 (vinyl) + 1 (formyl) + 1 (acid) = 5.\n\n2.  **Understand the Reaction:** The reactant is treated with red phosphorus and an excess of HI. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. Its function is to reduce most oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n    *   The C=C double bond in the ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n    *   The C=C double bond in the vinyl group will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n    *   The C=O double bond in the formyl group will be reduced, and the whole group becomes a methyl (-CH3).\n    *   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group will be reduced, and the whole group becomes a methyl (-CH3).\n    *   Importantly, this reaction does *not* break the ring structure.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product and its IHD:** After the reaction, all the pi bonds (from C=C and C=O) are removed. The only feature contributing to the IHD that remains is the original cyclohexane ring. Therefore, the IHD of the final product is 1.\n\n4.  **Calculate using Molecular Formula (for verification):**\n    *   **Reactant:** The molecular formula is C10H12O3. IHD = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - 12/2 = 5.\n    *   **Product:** The reaction removes all oxygen and saturates all pi bonds, without changing the number of carbons. The resulting product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon. The general formula for a monocyclic alkane is CnH2n. Since the product has 10 carbon atoms, its formula is C10H20.\n    *   **Product IHD Calculation:** Using the formula for the product (C10H20):\n        IHD = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - 20/2 = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nThe code below will perform this final calculation.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the properties of the reactant.\n# The reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n# Let's determine its molecular formula.\n# Carbons (C): 6 (ring) + 1 (COOH) + 1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) = 10\n# The reaction with red P and excess HI is a complete reduction.\n# It reduces all C=C and C=O bonds and removes oxygen atoms, but does not break the ring.\n# The number of carbon atoms in the product remains the same.\nnum_carbons_product = 10\n\n# Step 2: Determine the molecular formula of the product.\n# The product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon (a substituted cycloalkane).\n# The general formula for a monocyclic alkane is C_n H_{2n}.\n# For n=10, the formula is C10H20.\nnum_hydrogens_product = 2 * num_carbons_product\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the product.\n# The formula for IHD is: C + 1 - (H/2)\n# where C is the number of carbon atoms and H is the number of hydrogen atoms.\nihd_product = num_carbons_product + 1 - (num_hydrogens_product / 2)\n\n# Step 4: Print the result and the corresponding choice.\nprint(\"The reaction involves the complete reduction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\")\nprint(\"The reactant has multiple double bonds (C=C and C=O) and a ring.\")\nprint(\"Red P and excess HI reduce all double bonds but do not open the ring.\")\nprint(f\"The number of carbon atoms in the product is {num_carbons_product}.\")\nprint(f\"The product is a saturated cycloalkane with the formula C{num_carbons_product}H{num_hydrogens_product}.\")\nprint(f\"The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is calculated as: C + 1 - H/2\")\nprint(f\"IHD = {num_carbons_product} + 1 - ({num_hydrogens_product}/2) = {int(ihd_product)}\")\nprint(\"\\nThis IHD value of 1 corresponds to the single ring structure remaining in the product.\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this to the given options:\")\nprint(\"A) 3\")\nprint(\"B) 1\")\nprint(\"C) 5\")\nprint(\"D) 0\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe correct choice is B, as the calculated IHD is {int(ihd_product)}.\")\n```\n<<<B>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The reaction involves the complete reduction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\nThe reactant has multiple double bonds (C=C and C=O) and a ring.\nRed P and excess HI reduce all double bonds but do not open the ring.\nThe number of carbon atoms in the product is 10.\nThe product is a saturated cycloalkane with the formula C10H20.\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is calculated as: C + 1 - H/2\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 1\n\nThis IHD value of 1 corresponds to the single ring structure remaining in the product.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) 3\nB) 1\nC) 5\nD) 0\n\nThe correct choice is B, as the calculated IHD is 1.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the starting material.**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n\n*   **Parent structure:** `cyclohex-3-ene`. This is a six-membered carbon ring with one double bond between carbon-3 and carbon-4.\n*   **Principal functional group:** `carboxylic acid` (-COOH). This is at position 1.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   `2-formyl`: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is at position 2.\n    *   `5-vinyl`: A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) is at position 5.\n\nLet's determine the molecular formula by counting the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C):**\n    *   6 carbons in the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   1 carbon in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   1 carbon in the formyl group (-CHO).\n    *   2 carbons in the vinyl group (-CH=CH₂).\n    *   Total Carbons = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   On the ring: C1(H), C2(H), C3(H), C4(H), C5(H), C6(H₂).

(Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation).\nIHD (start) = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5.\nThis IHD of 5 can be accounted for by:\n*   1 for the ring structure.\n*   1 for the C=C double bond in the cyclohexene ring.\n*   1 for the C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group.\n*   1 for the C=O double bond in the formyl group.\n*   1 for the C=C double bond in the vinyl group.\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5. This confirms our structure is correct.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction and determine the structure of the product.**\n\nThe reagent is **Red Phosphorus and excess of HI**.\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a very strong reducing agent. It is known for the complete reduction of most oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n*   **Effect on functional groups:**\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The formyl group (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The vinyl group's double bond (-CH=CH₂) will be saturated to an ethyl group (-CH₂-CH₃).\n    *   The double bond within the cyclohexene ring will be saturated to a single bond, converting the ring to a cyclohexane ring.\n\n**Product Structure:**\nThe product will be a cyclohexane ring with the following substituents:\n*   A methyl group (-CH₃) at position 1.\n*   A methyl group (-CH₃) at position 2.\n*   An ethyl group (-CH₂-CH₃) at position 5.\nThe product is **5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Careful Point 2: The reaction leads to a fully saturated hydrocarbon, except for the ring.**\nThe term \"excess HI\" implies that the reaction goes to completion, reducing all possible sites.

The IHD of a molecule with the formula C₁₀H₂₀ is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's determine its structure and molecular formula.\n*   **Parent structure**: `cyclohex-3-ene` is a six-membered carbon ring with one double bond.\n*   **Functional Groups**:\n    *   A `carboxylic acid` (-COOH) group. By convention, this is at position C1.\n    *   A `formyl` (-CHO) group at position C2.\n    *   A `vinyl` (-CH=CH2) group at position C5.\n\nFrom this structure, we can determine the molecular formula:\n*   **Carbon (C)**: 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in the vinyl group = 10 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: 7 on the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 3 in the vinyl group = 12 hydrogens.\n*   **Oxygen (O)**: 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\nThe molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI (hydroiodic acid)**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It performs the following reductions:\n*   Reduces aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to their corresponding alkanes (-CH3).\n*   Reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   Removes all oxygen atoms from the molecule.\n\nIn essence, the reaction saturates all multiple bonds and removes all heteroatoms, converting the molecule into a saturated hydrocarbon while preserving the carbon skeleton (including the ring).\n\n**3. Determine the Product**\n\nApplying the effects of the reaction to the starting material:\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring is reduced to a `cyclohexane` ring (the C=C bond is saturated).\n*   The `-COOH` group at C1 is reduced to a `-CH3` group.\n*   The `-CHO` group at C2 is reduced to a `-CH3` group.\n*   The `-CH=CH2` (vinyl) group at C5 is reduced to an ethyl group (`-CH2CH3`).\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Since all double bonds and oxygen atoms are removed, the product is a saturated monocyclic alkane. The carbon count remains 10. The general formula for a saturated monocyclic alkane is CnH2n. Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe IHD (also known as the degree of unsaturation) represents the number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule. It can be calculated from the molecular formula or the structure.\n\n*   **Method 1: From the structure**\n    The product is a substituted cyclohexane. It has one ring and zero pi bonds.\n    IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π-bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n*   **Method 2: From the molecular formula (C10H20)**\n    The formula for IHD for a hydrocarbon (CxHy) is: IHD = C - H/2 + 1.\n    IHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 1\n    IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    IHD = 1\n\nBoth methods yield an IHD of 1. This value corresponds to the single ring present in the final saturated molecule.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we must first identify the starting material and the product of the reaction.\n\n### 1.

The starting molecule has a 10-carbon skeleton (a 6-carbon ring with three substituents containing a total of 4 carbons).\n\nThe resulting product is a substituted cyclohexane: **4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane**.\n\n### 3. Molecular Formula of the Product\n\nThe product, 4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane, is a saturated cycloalkane. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ. Since the carbon skeleton has 10 carbon atoms (n=10), the molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n### 4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula for calculating IHD for a hydrocarbon (CₓHᵧ) is:\n\nIHD = (2x + 2 - y) / 2\n\nFor the product C₁₀H₂₀:\n*   x = 10 (number of carbon atoms)\n*   y = 20 (number of hydrogen atoms)\n\nIHD = (2 * 10 + 2 - 20) / 2\nIHD = (20 + 2 - 20) / 2\nIHD = 2 / 2\nIHD = 1\n\nAn IHD of 1 corresponds to the single ring structure of the cyclohexane molecule.\n\nTherefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we first need to understand the starting material and the reaction it undergoes.\n\n**1. The Reactant: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**\n\nLet's break down the structure to determine its molecular formula:\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene:** A six-membered carbon ring with one double bond.\n*   **Carboxylic acid:** A -COOH group is at position 1.\n*   **Formyl:** A -CHO (aldehyde) group is at position 2.\n*   **Vinyl:** A -CH=CH2 group is at position 5.\n\nThe molecular formula of the reactant is C10H12O3. We can calculate its IHD to verify the structure's features:\n*   IHD = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 5.\n*   This corresponds to one ring, one double bond in the ring, one double bond in the vinyl group, one C=O in the formyl group, and one C=O in the carboxylic acid group (1+1+1+1+1 = 5).\n\n**2. The Reaction: Reduction with Red Phosphorus and Excess HI**\n\nThe combination of red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI) is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce a wide range of oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturated bonds to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The carbon-carbon double bond in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a single bond.\n*   The carbon-carbon double bond in the vinyl group will be reduced, converting the vinyl group into an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\n**3. The Product**\n\nThe reaction completely removes all oxygen atoms and saturates all double bonds, without breaking the carbon ring. The carbon skeleton of the reactant (C10) remains intact. The final product is a saturated cycloalkane with the following structure:\n*   A cyclohexane ring.\n*   A methyl group at position 1 (from the original carboxylic acid).\n*   A methyl group at position 2 (from the original formyl group).\n*   An ethyl group at position 5 (from the original vinyl group).\n\nThe resulting molecule is a substituted cyclohexane. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n. Since the product has 10 carbon atoms, its molecular formula will be C10H20.\n\n**4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe IHD, also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated from the molecular formula using the formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2).\n\nFor the product C10H20:\n*   IHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2)\n*   IHD = 11 - 10\n*   IHD = 1\n\nAn IHD of 1 indicates the presence of either one ring or one double bond. Since the product is a fully saturated cycloalkane (1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane, based on IUPAC naming of the product), the IHD of 1 corresponds to the single ring in its structure.\n\nTherefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we must first understand the reaction that takes place.\n\n**1. The Reactant and Reagents:**\n*   **Reactant:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\n**2. The Reaction:**\nThe combination of red phosphorus and excess HI is a powerful reducing agent. This mixture is known to completely reduce several oxygen-containing functional groups to their corresponding alkanes. Specifically:\n*   Carboxylic acid groups (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   Aldehyde groups (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   This reagent also reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (alkenes) to single bonds (alkanes).\n\n**3. Structure and Molecular Formula of the Reactant:**\nLet's break down the name to determine the structure and formula of the starting material:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene:** A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid:** A -COOH group, which by convention is at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl:** A -CHO group at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl:** A -CH=CH2 group at position 5.\n\nFrom this structure, we can deduce the molecular formula:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in the vinyl group = 10 carbons.\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** After accounting for all the bonds, the formula is C10H12O3.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the reactant is 5, calculated as follows:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 5.\nThis corresponds to one ring, one double bond in the ring, one double bond in the vinyl group, one C=O in the carboxylic acid, and one C=O in the formyl group (1+1+1+1+1 = 5).\n\n**4. Structure and Molecular Formula of the Product:**\nThe reaction with red P and excess HI will cause the following reductions:\n*   The carboxylic acid at C1 becomes a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The formyl group at C2 becomes a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is saturated.\n*   The double bond in the vinyl group is saturated, converting it to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\nThe final product is a saturated, substituted cyclohexane ring. The carbon skeleton remains, so the product will have 10 carbon atoms. Since all double bonds are saturated and all oxygen atoms are removed, the resulting molecule is a cycloalkane. The general formula for a monocyclic alkane is CnH2n.\n\nTherefore, the molecular formula of the product is C10H20.\n\n**5. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\nThe IHD is a measure of the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. It can be calculated from the molecular formula:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\nFor the product (C10H20):\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nThe IHD of 1 corresponds to the presence of the single ring in the cyclohexane structure.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe reaction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid with red phosphorus and excess HI is a complete reduction reaction. This powerful reducing agent converts all oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds into their corresponding saturated alkane forms, while preserving the carbon skeleton.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant's Carbon Skeleton:**\n    *   The reactant is named \"2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\".\n    *   The core structure is a 6-carbon ring (`cyclohex`).\n    *   There is a 1-carbon substituent from the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`).\n    *   There is a 1-carbon substituent from the formyl group (`-CHO`).\n    *   There is a 2-carbon substituent from the vinyl group (`-CH=CH₂`).\n    *   Total number of carbon atoms = 6 (ring) + 1 (acid) + 1 (formyl) + 2 (vinyl) = 10 carbons.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Transformation:**\n    *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring (which has one C=C double bond) is reduced to a `cyclohexane` ring (all C-C single bonds).\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) is reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH₃).\n    *   The `formyl` group (-CHO) is reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH₃).\n    *   The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) is reduced to an `ethyl` group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Determine the Product's Structure and Formula:**\n    *   The product is a fully saturated hydrocarbon containing a single ring structure. It is a substituted cyclohexane.\n    *   Since the product is a monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane) with 10 carbon atoms, its molecular formula follows the general formula for cycloalkanes, which is CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or π-bonds in a molecule.\n    *   **Method 1: By Structure:** The product is a substituted cyclohexane. It has one ring and zero π-bonds. Therefore, the IHD = 1.\n    *   **Method 2: By Formula (IHD = C - H/2 + 1):**\n        *   For the product C₁₀H₂₀:\n        *   IHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 1\n        *   IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n        *   IHD = 1\n\nBoth methods yield an IHD of 1. This single degree of unsaturation is due to the presence of the cyclohexane ring.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant Molecule**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to understand its components and calculate its initial index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD), although this is not strictly required to find the answer.\n\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered carbon ring containing one double bond.\n    *   The ring itself contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   The double bond (C=C) within the ring contributes another 1 to the IHD.\n*   **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**: This functional group contains a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   The C=O double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **formyl (-CHO)**: This is an aldehyde group, which also contains a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   The C=O double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **vinyl (-CH=CH2)**: This substituent contains a carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   The C=C double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n\nSo, the total IHD of the reactant is 1 (ring) + 1 (ring C=C) + 1 (acid C=O) + 1 (aldehyde C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = 5.\n\nLet's also determine the molecular formula of the reactant to be thorough.\n*   The carbon skeleton is a 6-membered ring, a carbon in the -COOH group, a carbon in the -CHO group, and two carbons in the vinyl group. Total Carbons (C) = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n*   The product will be a saturated hydrocarbon, so the number of carbons (10) is the most important piece of information from the reactant's structure.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its key functions are:\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) and triple bonds to single bonds (C-C).\n*   It reduces oxygen-containing functional groups completely to the corresponding hydrocarbon.\n    *   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   Ketones (>C=O) are reduced to methylene groups (>CH2).\n    *   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   Alcohols (-OH) are reduced to alkanes (-H).\n*   Crucially, this reaction does not break the carbon skeleton, including any rings.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure and Formula of the Product**\n\nApplying the effects of Red P + HI to our reactant:\n*   The **cyclohex-3-ene** ring will have its double bond reduced, becoming a **cyclohexane** ring. The ring structure itself remains.\n*   The **carboxylic acid** group will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH3).\n*   The **formyl** group will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH3).\n*   The **vinyl** group will have its double bond reduced, becoming an **ethyl group** (-CH2CH3).\n\nThe final product is a saturated hydrocarbon. It consists of the original 10-carbon skeleton but with all double bonds saturated and all oxygen atoms removed. The structure is a substituted cyclohexane.\n\nSince the product is a saturated hydrocarbon with a single ring (a monocyclic alkane or cycloalkane) and has 10 carbon atoms, we can determine its molecular formula. The general formula for a cycloalkane is **CnH2n**.\nFor our product with n=10, the molecular formula is **C10H20**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated in two ways for the product.\n\n*   **Method 1: Using the molecular formula**\n    The formula for IHD for a hydrocarbon C_c H_h is:\n    IHD = c - h/2 + 1\n    For the product C10H20:\n    IHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 1\n    IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    IHD = 1\n\n*   **Method 2: Based on the structure**\n    The IHD is the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi (π) bonds in the molecule.\n    *   Number of rings in the product = 1 (the cyclohexane ring).\n    *   Number of π bonds in the product = 0 (it is a fully saturated hydrocarbon).\n    IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds)\n    IHD = 1 + 0\n    IHD = 1\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant and its Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nFirst, let's determine the structure and the initial degree of unsaturation (IHD) of the starting material: **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The IHD is a count of the number of rings and π (pi) bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This part of the name tells us there is a six-membered ring (which contributes 1 to the IHD) and one carbon-carbon double bond within that ring (which contributes another 1 to the IHD).\n*   **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**: This functional group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which adds 1 to the IHD.\n*   **formyl (-CHO)**: This aldehyde group also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), adding 1 to the IHD.\n*   **vinyl (-CH=CH₂)**: This substituent contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), adding 1 to the IHD.\n\nSumming these contributions, the total IHD of the reactant is:\nIHD_reactant = 1 (for the ring) + 1 (for the C=C in the ring) + 1 (for the C=O in the acid) + 1 (for the C=O in the aldehyde) + 1 (for the C=C in the vinyl group) = **5**.\n\n**2. Understand the Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This reagent combination is known as a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its function is to perform a complete reduction, meaning it:\n*   Reduces all oxygen-containing functional groups (like carboxylic acids, aldehydes, ketones, alcohols) completely to their corresponding alkane parts (e.g., -COOH and -CHO both become -CH₃).\n*   Reduces all carbon-carbon double and triple bonds to single bonds (saturates the molecule).\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Structure**\n\nThe reaction will transform the starting material into a fully saturated hydrocarbon, while keeping the carbon skeleton intact.\n*   The **cyclohexene** ring will be reduced to a **cyclohexane** ring (the C=C bond is saturated).\n*   The **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH) will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **formyl** group (-CHO) will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **vinyl** group (-CH=CH₂) will be reduced to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. It is a **saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe IHD of the final product is calculated based on its structure using the formula:\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds)\n\n*   **Number of rings**: The product still contains the six-membered cyclohexane ring. Therefore, the number of rings is **1**.\n*   **Number of π bonds**: The complete reduction has eliminated all double bonds (both C=C and C=O). Therefore, the number of π bonds is **0**.\n\nSo, the IHD of the product is:\nIHD_product = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\nThe final product has an index of hydrogen deficiency of 1, which is entirely due to the presence of the ring structure.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product is 1.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Reactant:** The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Its molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n2.  **Reagent and Reaction:** The reagent is red phosphorus with an excess of hydroiodic acid (Red P/HI). This is a very powerful reducing agent that performs the following transformations:\n    *   Reduces all oxygen-containing functional groups (like carboxylic acids and aldehydes) completely to alkanes. The -COOH and -CHO groups are both reduced to -CH₃ groups.\n    *   Reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds (alkenes) to single bonds (alkanes). The double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the vinyl group are both saturated.\n    *   The reaction does not break the carbon ring structure.\n3.  **Product:** The reaction removes all double bonds and all oxygen atoms, leaving a saturated hydrocarbon that retains the original ring structure.\n    *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` core becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` group becomes a `methyl` group.\n    *   The `formyl` group becomes a `methyl` group.\n    *   The `vinyl` group becomes an `ethyl` group.\n    *   The final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Since the carbon skeleton is preserved, the product has 10 carbon atoms. As it is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane), its general formula is CₙH₂ₙ. Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is C₁₀H₂₀.\n4.  **Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) Calculation:** The IHD (also known as the degree of unsaturation) represents the number of rings and/or pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n    *   **Method 1: From the structure.** The product is a cyclohexane derivative. It has one ring and no π bonds. Therefore, IHD = 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for π bonds) = 1.\n    *   **Method 2: From the molecular formula (C₁₀H₂₀).** The formula for IHD is `IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n        IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the reactant.\n\nThe reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4.\n*   **Carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group, which we'll place at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO group at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH2 group at position 5.\n\nThe carbon skeleton consists of the 6-carbon ring, 1 carbon in the carboxylic acid, 1 carbon in the formyl group, and 2 carbons in the vinyl group, for a total of 10 carbon atoms.\n\nThe molecular formula for 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the reaction conditions.\n\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI).

The carbon skeleton is C₁₀. Since all double bonds are saturated and all oxygen atoms are removed, the product is a cycloalkane.\n\nThe general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ. For a C₁₀ cycloalkane, the formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated from the molecular formula or by examining the structure.\n\n**Method 1: Using the IHD Formula**\nThe formula for IHD is: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\nFor the product C₁₀H₂₀:\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\nIHD = 11 - 10\nIHD = 1\n\n**Method 2: Analyzing the Structure**\nThe IHD is the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   The product has one ring (the cyclohexane ring).\n*   The product has zero double or triple bonds.\nTherefore, the IHD = 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for pi bonds) = 1.\n\nBoth methods yield an IHD of 1.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we must first identify the reactant and the product of the specified reaction.\n\n### 1.
