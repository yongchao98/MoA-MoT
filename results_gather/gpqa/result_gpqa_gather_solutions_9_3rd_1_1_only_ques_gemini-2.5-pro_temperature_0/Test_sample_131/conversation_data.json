  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nThe 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14 exhibits two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Which two compounds are present in the mixture from the following options: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\nA) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene\nB) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\nC) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\nD) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must interpret the information provided from the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four options fit this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this means the number of protons contributing to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second. The most direct interpretation is that each compound contributes one aromatic singlet, and each of those singlets represents the same number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1. These signals are the sum of all the methyl protons from both compounds. The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 24 (12 from each compound). A 2:1:1 ratio (total of 4 parts) corresponds to signals with integrations of:\n    *   (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n    *   (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    Therefore, the mixture must produce three aliphatic singlets integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to correctly predict the spectrum for each compound based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   The ethyl groups (-CH2CH3) would produce a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region due to spin-spin splitting.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is immediately eliminated because the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets. This rules out **Option B**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (C1, C4) and the \"inner\" pair (C2, C3). This gives **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. The proton at C4 is between a methyl group and a hydrogen, while the proton at C6 is between two methyl groups. They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H (or 2:1:1).\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture that produces two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Prehnitene (one 2H singlet) + Isodurene (two 1H singlets) = **Three aromatic signals**. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene (one 2H singlet) + Isodurene (two 1H singlets) = **Three aromatic signals**. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets**. Since both signals represent 2H, their integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** Durene gives one singlet (12H). Prehnitene gives two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is also a perfect match.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must interpret the information provided by the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14. All four options fit this.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this means the number of protons contributing to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second. The simplest explanation is that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and each signal represents the same number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. These signals are the sum of all the methyl protons from both compounds.\n    *   A crucial clue is that all signals are singlets, which rules out alkyl groups that would be split by adjacent protons (like ethyl groups).\n    *   The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 12 from the first compound and 12 from the second, for a total of 24 protons.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Therefore, the combination of the two compounds must produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This compound has ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The -CH2- protons would be split into a quartet, and the -CH3- protons would be split into a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is immediately **eliminated** because the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets. This also eliminates option C.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1/C4 and the \"inner\" pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H (or 2:1:1).\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture that produces two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Aromatic Signal Check:** All three tetramethylbenzene isomers (Durene, Prehnitene, Isodurene) produce one 2H singlet each. Therefore, a 1:1 mixture of any two of them will result in two distinct 2H singlets, satisfying the \"two singlets in a 1:1 ratio\" condition. The deciding factor must be the aliphatic signals.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Signal Check:**\n\n    *   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides: **one 12H singlet**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB provides: **two 6H singlets**.\n        *   The combined spectrum shows a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n        *   **This is a perfect match.**\n\n    *   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 12H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB provides three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   The combined spectrum would show a total of **four** aliphatic singlets. This does not match the data.\n\n    *   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB provides two 6H singlets.\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB provides three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   The combined spectrum would show at least four signals (assuming one of the 6H signals overlaps). This does not match the data.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this problem by systematically analyzing the provided NMR data and comparing it against the predicted spectra for each possible compound and mixture.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the NMR Data**: I will first break down the information given in the problem.\n    *   Aromatic region: Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. For a 1:1 mixture, this strongly implies each compound gives one aromatic singlet, and each singlet represents the same number of protons (e.g., 2H).\n    *   Aliphatic region: Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. Since each C10H14 isomer has 12 aliphatic protons (from four methyl groups), the total in the mixture is 24. A 2:1:1 ratio of 24 protons corresponds to signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The fact that all signals are singlets is a crucial clue that eliminates compounds with coupled protons, like ethyl groups.\n\n2.  **Predict Individual Spectra**: I will determine the expected 1H NMR signals for each of the four candidate compounds based on their molecular symmetry. This is the most critical step.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options**: I will test each option (A, B, C, D) by combining the predicted spectra of the two compounds in the pair.\n    *   I will first eliminate any option containing a compound that doesn't fit the basic criteria (e.g., producing non-singlet signals).\n    *   Then, I will check if the remaining combinations match the required number of aromatic signals.\n    *   Finally, I will check if the combination produces the correct number and ratio of aliphatic signals (three signals with 12H, 6H, and 6H integrations).\n\n4.  **Conclude the Answer**: The option that perfectly matches all criteria will be the correct answer. I will present this entire logical flow within a Python script.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes 1H NMR data to identify two compounds in a mixture.\n    The function will print its reasoning step-by-step.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Deconstruct the provided 1H NMR data for the 1:1 mixture.\")\n    print(\"  - Aromatic Region: Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\")\n    print(\"    - This implies the mixture contains two compounds that each produce one 2H aromatic singlet.\")\n    print(\"  - Aliphatic Region: Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\")\n    print(\"    - Total aliphatic protons = 12H (from Cpd 1) + 12H (from Cpd 2) = 24H.\")\n    print(\"    - A 2:1:1 ratio (4 parts) for 24H means integrations of (2/4)*24H=12H, (1/4)*24H=6H, and (1/4)*24H=6H.\")\n    print(\"  - Conclusion: We need a pair of compounds that together provide:\")\n    print(\"    - Two 2H aromatic singlets.\")\n    print(\"    - Three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 2: Define the predicted spectral characteristics for each compound.\n    # Data format: { \"aromatic_signals\": count, \"aliphatic_integrations\": [list_of_H_counts] }\n    # A value of 'None' for aliphatic_integrations means it produces non-singlets.\n    # The prediction for 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene) is critical: its two aromatic protons\n    # are in different environments, producing two signals, not one.\n    compounds = {\n        \"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_signals\": 1, \"aliphatic_integrations\": [12]},\n        \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_signals\": 2, \"aliphatic_integrations\": [6, 3, 3]},\n        \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_signals\": 1, \"aliphatic_integrations\": [6, 6]},\n        \"1,4-diethylbenzene\":         {\"aromatic_signals\": 1, \"aliphatic_integrations\": None}\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Predicted 1H NMR signals for individual compounds.\")\n    for name, data in compounds.items():\n        print(f\"  - {name}:\")\n        print(f\"    - Aromatic signals: {data['aromatic_signals']}\")\n        if data['aliphatic_integrations'] is None:\n            print(\"    - Aliphatic signals: Produces non-singlets (quartet/triplet).\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"    - Aliphatic signals (integrations): {data['aliphatic_integrations']}H\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 3: Define the options from the prompt and evaluate them.\n    options = {\n        \"A\": (\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\"),\n        \"B\": (\"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,4-diethylbenzene\"),\n        \"C\": (\"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\"),\n        \"D\": (\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\")\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Evaluating each mixture option.\")\n    correct_option = None\n    for option, (name1, name2) in options.items():\n        print(f\"\\nTesting Option {option}: {name1} and {name2}\")\n        comp1 = compounds[name1]\n        comp2 = compounds[name2]\n\n        # Check for non-singlet producing compounds\n        if comp1[\"aliphatic_integrations\"] is None or comp2[\"aliphatic_integrations\"] is None:\n            print(\"  - Result: FAILED.

Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this means each compound contributes a signal representing an equal number of protons. The most likely scenario is that each compound produces one aromatic singlet representing 2 protons (2H).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. These signals are the sum of all the methyl protons from both compounds. The total number of methyl protons is 12H + 12H = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio (total of 4 parts) for 24 protons means the signals correspond to integrations of:\n    *   (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n    *   (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    So, the combined aliphatic spectrum must show three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n**Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each candidate molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound contains ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The aliphatic protons would show spin-spin splitting, resulting in a quartet and a triplet, not singlets. Therefore, **this compound can be eliminated**, which also eliminates option C.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (C1, C4) and the \"inner\" pair (C2, C3). This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair (C1, C3), the unique one at C2, and the unique one at C5. This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, and 3H)**.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nWe need to find a pair whose combined spectra match the experimental data.\n\n*   **Aromatic Check:** All three tetramethylbenzene isomers produce one 2H singlet each. Therefore, a 1:1 mixture of any two of them will result in two distinct 2H singlets, satisfying the \"two singlets in a 1:1 ratio\" condition. The decision must be made based on the aliphatic signals.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Check:** We need a combination that produces three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n    *   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n        *   **Combined:** This gives a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.

This does not match the \"three signals\" data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must interpret the information provided from the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four options fit this formula.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio. This is crucial for interpreting the signal integrations.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. This means there are two distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 ratio, the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second signal.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1. The chemical shift is characteristic of methyl groups on a benzene ring. The fact that they are all singlets rules out alkyl groups that would show splitting, like ethyl groups.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   The ethyl groups (-CH2CH3) would produce a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region due to spin-spin splitting.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This contradicts the data that all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**, which also eliminates **Option D**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (C1, C4) and the \"inner\" pair (C2, C3). This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at C4 (between two methyls) and the proton at C6 (between a methyl and a proton) are in different chemical environments. They produce **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups (the C1/C3 pair, the C2, and the C5), resulting in **three singlets** with integrations of **6H, 3H, and 3H**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that produces:\n*   Two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   Three aliphatic singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nLet's test the remaining options based on the number of aromatic signals, which is a strong differentiator.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic Signals: 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets.\n    *   Total: The mixture would show **three** aromatic signals (one 2H, two 1H). This does not match the \"two singlets\" data. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic Signals: 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets.\n    *   Total: The mixture would show **three** aromatic signals. This does not match the \"two singlets\" data. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB also gives one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture of these two will produce **two singlets**. Since each signal represents 2 protons, the integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n    *   **Aliphatic Check:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is also a perfect match.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the information provided for the 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 isomers:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"two signals (two singlets) in a 1:1 ratio\".\n    *   This means there are two distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture.\n    *   Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, the 1:1 integration ratio implies that the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second. The most direct interpretation is that each compound contributes one signal, and each signal represents the same number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"three signals (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio\".\n    *   The chemical shift is characteristic of methyl groups attached to a benzene ring.\n    *   The fact that they are all singlets is a crucial clue, as it rules out any alkyl groups that would be split by adjacent protons (like ethyl groups).\n    *   The 2:1:1 ratio represents the relative number of protons in these three distinct environments, summed from both compounds in the mixture.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to correctly predict the spectrum for each isomer based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** This compound has ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The -CH2- protons would be split into a quartet by the adjacent -CH3 protons, and the -CH3- protons would be split into a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be **immediately eliminated** because the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets. This rules out **Option D**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (C1, C4) and the \"inner\" pair (C2, C3). This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. H4 is between a methyl group and a proton, while H6 is between two methyl groups. They are not equivalent and will produce **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture that matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Option D (1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene):** Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **Options A (1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB) and B (1,2,3,4-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB):** Both of these options contain 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n    *   This compound itself produces *two* 1H aromatic singlets.\n    *   The other compound in the mixture (either 1,2,4,5-TMB or 1,2,3,4-TMB) produces *one* 2H aromatic singlet.\n    *   Therefore, a mixture containing 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene would show a total of **three aromatic signals** (one 2H, one 1H, and another 1H). This contradicts the experimental data, which specifies only **two aromatic signals**. Both options A and B are incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB also contributes one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture of these two will produce **two singlets**. Since each signal represents 2 protons, the integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the information provided from the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.

They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H (or 2:1:1).\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture that produces two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets (12H, 6H, 6H).\n\n*   **Aromatic Signal Check:** All three tetramethylbenzene isomers (Durene, Prehnitene, Isodurene) produce one 2H singlet each. Therefore, a 1:1 mixture of any two of them will result in two distinct 2H singlets, satisfying the \"two singlets in a 1:1 ratio\" condition.

This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must interpret the information provided from the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four candidate molecules fit this formula.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The compounds are mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio. This is crucial for interpreting the integration ratios.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this strongly implies that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and these signals represent an equal number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n    *   The fact that all signals are singlets is a key clue. It means the protons giving these signals have no non-equivalent adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 12 (from the first C10H14 molecule) + 12 (from the second C10H14 molecule) = 24 protons.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio has a total of 4 parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the actual number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Therefore, the mixture must produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The -CH2- protons would be a quartet, and the -CH3- protons would be a triplet due to spin-spin splitting. This contradicts the data that all aliphatic signals are singlets. **This compound can be eliminated**, and so can any option containing it (Option A).\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent.

This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups, resulting in **three singlets** with integrations of **6H, 3H, and 3H**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that produces two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio, corresponding to 12H, 6H, 6H).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would show three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from durene and two 1H singlets from isodurene). This contradicts the \"two singlets\" data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would also show three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from prehnitene and two 1H singlets from isodurene). This contradicts the \"two singlets\" data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB also contributes one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with a 2H:2H integration, which is a **1:1 ratio**. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must interpret the information provided from the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four options fit this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this implies that the number of protons contributing to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second. The most direct interpretation is that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and each signal represents the same number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. These signals are the sum of all the methyl protons from both compounds. The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 12H (from the first compound) + 12H (from the second compound) = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio (total 4 parts) for 24H corresponds to signals with integrations of:\n    *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n    *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    Therefore, we are looking for a combination of two compounds that produces three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The -CH2- protons would be split into a quartet and the -CH3- protons into a triplet. Since the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, **this compound can be eliminated**. This immediately rules out **Option C**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1/C4 and the \"inner\" pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nThe aromatic data (two 2H singlets) is consistent with a mixture of any two of the tetramethylbenzene isomers. The decision must be made based on the aliphatic signals, which must combine to give three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Option A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   Combined: The mixture shows a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n\n*   **Option B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Combined: This would result in at least four signals (assuming one of the 6H signals overlaps). This does not match the \"three signals\" data.\n\n*   **Option D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Combined: This would result in a total of four aliphatic singlets. This does not match the \"three signals\" data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must interpret the information provided by the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.

Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this means the number of protons contributing to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second. The most likely scenario is that each compound produces one aromatic singlet, and each of those singlets represents the same number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. These signals come from the methyl groups. The total number of aliphatic protons in a 1:1 mixture is 12H (from the first compound) + 12H (from the second compound) = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio for 24H corresponds to signals with integrations of:\n    *   Signal 1: (2 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = 12H\n    *   Signal 2: (1 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Signal 3: (1 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = 6H\n    Therefore, we are looking for a combination of compounds that produces three aliphatic singlets integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   The ethyl groups (-CH2CH3) will show spin-spin splitting, producing a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region.

They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1/C4 and the \"inner\" pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to a plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H (or 2:1:1).\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture that produces two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets (12H, 6H, 6H).\n\n*   **Aromatic Check:** All three tetramethylbenzene isomers (Durene, Prehnitene, Isodurene) each produce one 2H aromatic singlet. Therefore, a 1:1 mixture of any two of them will result in two distinct 2H singlets, satisfying the \"two singlets in a 1:1 ratio\" condition. The decision must be made based on the aliphatic signals.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Check:**\n\n    *   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides: **one 12H singlet**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB provides: **two 6H singlets**.\n        *   Combined: This results in a total of **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.

Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this implies that the number of protons contributing to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second. The most direct explanation is that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and each signal represents the same number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n    *   The fact that all signals are singlets is a key clue.\n    *   The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 12 (from the first compound) + 12 (from the second compound) = 24 protons.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Therefore, the combined aliphatic signals from the two compounds must be three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This compound contains ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The -CH2- protons would be split into a quartet by the adjacent -CH3- protons, and the -CH3- protons would be split into a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This contradicts the data that all aliphatic signals are singlets.

Due to spin-spin coupling, these groups would produce a quartet and a triplet, not singlets.\n    *   Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene can be immediately eliminated, which invalidates **Option A**.\n\n2.  **Correctly Interpret the Aromatic Signals:** The spectrum shows two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this means the number of protons contributing to each signal is equal. This strongly suggests that each of the two compounds in the mixture contributes one aromatic singlet, and both singlets represent the same number of protons (e.g., 2H each).\n\n3.  **Correctly Predict the Spectrum of Each Isomer:** This requires a careful analysis of each molecule's symmetry.\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetric.\n        *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one 2H singlet**.\n        *   Aliphatic Protons: All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n        *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one 2H singlet**.\n        *   Aliphatic Protons: There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the outer pair (C1, C4) and the inner pair (C2, C3). This results in **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has lower symmetry.\n        *   Aromatic Protons: The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. H4 is between two methyl groups, while H6 is next to a methyl group and an empty position. They produce **two distinct 1H singlets**.\n        *   This is a crucial point. Any mixture containing Isodurene would have at least three aromatic signals (the two 1H singlets from Isodurene plus at least one more from the other compound). This contradicts the experimental data of only two aromatic signals. Therefore, any option containing 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene must be incorrect. This eliminates **Option B** and **Option C**.\n\n4.  **Verify the Remaining Option:** By elimination, only Option D remains. We must verify that it perfectly matches all the data.\n    *   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n        *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture will therefore show **two singlets**. Since both signals represent 2 protons, their integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n        *   **Aliphatic Spectrum:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet of 12H. 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets of 6H each. The combined spectrum will show a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that satisfies all conditions of the 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. This corresponds to Option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the information provided by the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four options fit this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this means the number of protons contributing to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second. The most direct interpretation is that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and each signal represents the same number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. These signals are the sum of all the methyl protons from both compounds.\n    *   The fact that all signals are singlets is a critical clue.\n    *   The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 24 (12 from each C10H14 isomer). The 2:1:1 ratio (total of 4 parts) corresponds to signals with integrations of (2/4)*24H = 12H, (1/4)*24H = 6H, and (1/4)*24H = 6H.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The -CH2- protons would be split into a quartet by the adjacent -CH3 protons, and the -CH3 protons would be split into a triplet. Since the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, **this compound can be immediately eliminated**. This also eliminates option B.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Equivalent protons do not split each other, so they produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the \"inner\" pair at C2/C3 are equivalent. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This symmetry makes the protons at C4 and C6 chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that produces:\n*   **Aromatic:** Two 2H singlets (which gives the required 1:1 ratio). All three tetramethylbenzene isomers produce one 2H singlet each, so any pair will satisfy this condition.\n*   **Aliphatic:** Three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\nLet's test the remaining combinations based on their combined aliphatic signals:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   The combined spectrum shows a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **This is a perfect match.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   The combined spectrum would show a total of **four** aliphatic singlets. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   The combined spectrum would show at least four signals (assuming one of the 6H signals from each compound overlaps). This does not match the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

H4 is between two methyl groups (C3-Me and C5-Me), while H6 is between a methyl group (C1-Me) and another methyl group (C5-Me), but the overall substitution pattern is not symmetric with respect to them. Therefore, this compound produces **two distinct 1H singlets**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Any mixture containing Isodurene would show at least three aromatic signals (the two 1H signals from Isodurene plus at least one from the other compound).

A 2:1:1 ratio of 24 protons corresponds to signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The fact that all signals are singlets is a crucial clue that eliminates compounds with coupled protons, like ethyl groups.\n\n2.  **Predict Individual Spectra**: I will determine the expected 1H NMR signals for each of the four candidate compounds based on their molecular symmetry. This is the most critical step.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options**: I will test each option (A, B, C, D) by combining the predicted spectra of the two compounds in the pair.\n    *   I will first eliminate any option containing a compound that doesn't fit the basic criteria (e.g., producing non-singlet signals).\n    *   Then, I will check if the remaining combinations match the required number of aromatic signals.\n    *   Finally, I will check if the combination produces the correct number and ratio of aliphatic signals (three signals with 12H, 6H, and 6H integrations).\n\n4.  **Conclude the Answer**: The option that perfectly matches all criteria will be the correct answer. I will present this entire logical flow within a Python script.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes 1H NMR data to identify two compounds in a mixture.\n    The function will print its reasoning step-by-step.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Deconstruct the provided 1H NMR data for the 1:1 mixture.\")\n    print(\"  - Aromatic Region: Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\")\n    print(\"    - This implies the mixture contains two compounds that each produce one 2H aromatic singlet.\")\n    print(\"  - Aliphatic Region: Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\")\n    print(\"    - Total aliphatic protons = 12H (from Cpd 1) + 12H (from Cpd 2) = 24H.\")\n    print(\"    - A 2:1:1 ratio (4 parts) for 24H means integrations of (2/4)*24H=12H, (1/4)*24H=6H, and (1/4)*24H=6H.\")\n    print(\"  - Conclusion: We need a pair of compounds that together provide:\")\n    print(\"    - Two 2H aromatic singlets.\")\n    print(\"    - Three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 2: Define the predicted spectral characteristics for each compound.\n    # Data format: { \"aromatic_signals\": count, \"aliphatic_integrations\": [list_of_H_counts] }\n    # A value of 'None' for aliphatic_integrations means it produces non-singlets.\n    # The prediction for 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene) is critical: its two aromatic protons\n    # are in different environments, producing two signals, not one.\n    compounds = {\n        \"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_signals\": 1, \"aliphatic_integrations\": [12]},\n        \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_signals\": 2, \"aliphatic_integrations\": [6, 3, 3]},\n        \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_signals\": 1, \"aliphatic_integrations\": [6, 6]},\n        \"1,4-diethylbenzene\":         {\"aromatic_signals\": 1, \"aliphatic_integrations\": None}\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Predicted 1H NMR signals for individual compounds.\")\n    for name, data in compounds.items():\n        print(f\"  - {name}:\")\n        print(f\"    - Aromatic signals: {data['aromatic_signals']}\")\n        if data['aliphatic_integrations'] is None:\n            print(\"    - Aliphatic signals: Produces non-singlets (quartet/triplet).\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"    - Aliphatic signals (integrations): {data['aliphatic_integrations']}H\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 3: Define the options from the prompt and evaluate them.\n    options = {\n        \"A\": (\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\"),\n        \"B\": (\"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,4-diethylbenzene\"),\n        \"C\": (\"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\"),\n        \"D\": (\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\")\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Evaluating each mixture option.\")\n    correct_option = None\n    for option, (name1, name2) in options.items():\n        print(f\"\\nTesting Option {option}: {name1} and {name2}\")\n        comp1 = compounds[name1]\n        comp2 = compounds[name2]\n\n        # Check for non-singlet producing compounds\n        if comp1[\"aliphatic_integrations\"] is None or comp2[\"aliphatic_integrations\"] is None:\n            print(\"  - Result: FAILED.

Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this means each compound contributes a signal representing an equal number of protons. The most likely scenario is that each compound produces one aromatic singlet representing 2 protons (2H).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. These signals are the sum of all the methyl protons from both compounds. The total number of methyl protons is 12H + 12H = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio (total of 4 parts) for 24 protons means the signals correspond to integrations of:\n    *   (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n    *   (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    So, the combined aliphatic spectrum must show three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n**Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each candidate molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound contains ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The aliphatic protons would show spin-spin splitting, resulting in a quartet and a triplet, not singlets. Therefore, **this compound can be eliminated**, which also eliminates option C.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (C1, C4) and the \"inner\" pair (C2, C3). This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair (C1, C3), the unique one at C2, and the unique one at C5. This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, and 3H)**.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nWe need to find a pair whose combined spectra match the experimental data.\n\n*   **Aromatic Check:** All three tetramethylbenzene isomers produce one 2H singlet each. Therefore, a 1:1 mixture of any two of them will result in two distinct 2H singlets, satisfying the \"two singlets in a 1:1 ratio\" condition. The decision must be made based on the aliphatic signals.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Check:** We need a combination that produces three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n    *   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n        *   **Combined:** This gives a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n\n    *   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two 6H singlets.\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   **Combined:** This would result in at least four signals (one 6H signal might overlap). This does not match the \"three signals\" data.\n\n    *   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one 12H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   **Combined:** This would result in a total of four signals. This does not match the \"three signals\" data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must interpret the information provided from the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four options fit this formula.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio. This is crucial for interpreting the signal integrations.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. This means there are two distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 ratio, the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second signal.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1. The chemical shift is characteristic of methyl groups on a benzene ring. The fact that they are all singlets rules out alkyl groups that would show splitting, like ethyl groups.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   The ethyl groups (-CH2CH3) would produce a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region due to spin-spin splitting.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This contradicts the data that all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**, which also eliminates **Option D**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (C1, C4) and the \"inner\" pair (C2, C3). This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at C4 (between two methyls) and the proton at C6 (between a methyl and a proton) are in different chemical environments. They produce **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups (the C1/C3 pair, the C2, and the C5), resulting in **three singlets** with integrations of **6H, 3H, and 3H**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that produces:\n*   Two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   Three aliphatic singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nLet's test the remaining options based on the number of aromatic signals, which is a strong differentiator.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic Signals: 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets.\n    *   Total: The mixture would show **three** aromatic signals (one 2H, two 1H). This does not match the \"two singlets\" data. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic Signals: 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets.\n    *   Total: The mixture would show **three** aromatic signals. This does not match the \"two singlets\" data. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB also gives one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture of these two will produce **two singlets**. Since each signal represents 2 protons, the integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n    *   **Aliphatic Check:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is also a perfect match.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the information provided for the 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 isomers:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"two signals (two singlets) in a 1:1 ratio\".\n    *   This means there are two distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture.\n    *   Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, the 1:1 integration ratio implies that the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second. The most direct interpretation is that each compound contributes one signal, and each signal represents the same number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"three signals (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio\".\n    *   The chemical shift is characteristic of methyl groups attached to a benzene ring.\n    *   The fact that they are all singlets is a crucial clue, as it rules out any alkyl groups that would be split by adjacent protons (like ethyl groups).\n    *   The 2:1:1 ratio represents the relative number of protons in these three distinct environments, summed from both compounds in the mixture.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to correctly predict the spectrum for each isomer based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** This compound has ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The -CH2- protons would be split into a quartet by the adjacent -CH3 protons, and the -CH3- protons would be split into a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be **immediately eliminated** because the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets. This rules out **Option D**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (C1, C4) and the \"inner\" pair (C2, C3). This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. H4 is between a methyl group and a proton, while H6 is between two methyl groups. They are not equivalent and will produce **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture that matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Option D (1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene):** Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **Options A (1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB) and B (1,2,3,4-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB):** Both of these options contain 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n    *   This compound itself produces *two* 1H aromatic singlets.\n    *   The other compound in the mixture (either 1,2,4,5-TMB or 1,2,3,4-TMB) produces *one* 2H aromatic singlet.\n    *   Therefore, a mixture containing 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene would show a total of **three aromatic signals** (one 2H, one 1H, and another 1H). This contradicts the experimental data, which specifies only **two aromatic signals**. Both options A and B are incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB also contributes one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture of these two will produce **two singlets**. Since each signal represents 2 protons, the integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the information provided from the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four candidate molecules fit this formula.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio. This is a critical piece of information, as it means the total number of protons from each compound contributes equally to the overall spectrum's integration.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. This indicates there are two distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 ratio, the 1:1 integration implies that the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second signal (e.g., each signal represents 2 protons).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n    *   The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 12H (from the first compound's four methyl groups) + 12H (from the second compound's four methyl groups) = 24H.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the actual number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   Therefore, the mixture must produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThe key to solving the problem is to accurately predict the spectrum for each compound based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   The ethyl groups (-CH2CH3) would produce a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region due to spin-spin splitting.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This contradicts the problem statement that all aliphatic signals are singlets. This compound can be **immediately eliminated**, and so can any option containing it (Option A).\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1/C4 (equivalent) and the \"inner\" pair at C2/C3 (equivalent). This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent due to this symmetry. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H (or 2:1:1).\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture that produces two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets (12H, 6H, 6H).\n\n*   **Aromatic Signal Check:** All three tetramethylbenzene isomers (Durene, Prehnitene, Isodurene) produce one 2H singlet each. Therefore, a 1:1 mixture of any two of them will result in two distinct 2H singlets, satisfying the \"two singlets in a 1:1 ratio\" condition. The decision must be made based on the aliphatic signals.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Signal Check:**\n\n    *   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Eliminated.\n\n    *   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB gives: two 6H singlets.\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB gives: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   Combined: This would result in at least four signals (assuming one of the 6H signals overlaps). This does not match the required three signals.\n\n    *   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB gives: **one 12H singlet**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB gives: **two 6H singlets**.\n        *   Combined: This gives a total of **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n\n    *   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB gives: one 12H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB gives: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   Combined: This gives a total of **four singlets**. This does not match the required three signals.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must interpret the information provided from the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 isomers.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this means the number of protons contributing to the first signal is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second. The most direct interpretation is that each of the two compounds in the mixture contributes one aromatic singlet, and each singlet represents the same number of protons (e.g., 2H each).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. The chemical shift is characteristic of methyl groups on a benzene ring. The fact that they are all singlets is a critical clue. The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 24 (12 from each C10H14 compound). A 2:1:1 ratio (total of 4 parts) for 24 protons corresponds to signals with integrations of:\n    *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n    *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    Therefore, the mixture must produce three aliphatic singlets integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThe predicted spectrum for each compound is determined by its molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The -CH2- protons would be split into a quartet, and the -CH3- protons would be split into a triplet. Since the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, **this compound can be immediately eliminated**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (C1, C4) and the \"inner\" pair (C2, C3). This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This symmetry makes the protons at positions 4 and 6 chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture that produces two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 aliphatic singlets (12H, 6H, 6H).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: One 12H singlet (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) plus three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H (from 1,2,3,5-TMB). This gives a total of **four** aliphatic signals. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Each compound produces one 2H singlet. The mixture correctly shows **two singlets** with a 1:1 integration ratio. **This is a match.**\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB provides **one 12H singlet**. 1,2,3,4-TMB provides **two 6H singlets**. The combined spectrum shows **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This option is eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: Two 6H singlets (from 1,2,3,4-TMB) plus three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H (from 1,2,3,5-TMB). This would result in four or five aliphatic signals, depending on overlap. This does not match the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must interpret the information provided from the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four candidate molecules fit this formula.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The compounds are mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio. This is crucial for interpreting the integration ratios.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this strongly implies that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and these signals represent an equal number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n    *   The fact that all signals are singlets is a key clue. It means the protons giving these signals have no non-equivalent adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 12 (from the first C10H14 molecule) + 12 (from the second C10H14 molecule) = 24 protons.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio has a total of 4 parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the actual number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Therefore, the mixture must produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The -CH2- protons would be a quartet, and the -CH3- protons would be a triplet due to spin-spin splitting. This contradicts the data that all aliphatic signals are singlets. **This compound can be eliminated**, and so can any option containing it (Option A).\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent.

They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups, resulting in **three singlets** with integrations of **6H, 3H, and 3H**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that produces two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio, corresponding to 12H, 6H, 6H).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would show three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from durene and two 1H singlets from isodurene). This contradicts the \"two singlets\" data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would also show three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from prehnitene and two 1H singlets from isodurene). This contradicts the \"two singlets\" data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB also contributes one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with a 2H:2H integration, which is a **1:1 ratio**. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **1.

These signals are the sum of all the methyl protons from both compounds. The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 12H (from the first compound) + 12H (from the second compound) = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio (total 4 parts) for 24H corresponds to signals with integrations of:\n    *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n    *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    Therefore, we are looking for a combination of two compounds that produces three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **2.

This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nThe aromatic data (two 2H singlets) is consistent with a mixture of any two of the tetramethylbenzene isomers. The decision must be made based on the aliphatic signals, which must combine to give three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Option A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   Combined: The mixture shows a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.

This is crucial for interpreting the integration ratios.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this means the number of protons contributing to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second. The most likely scenario is that each compound produces one aromatic singlet, and each of those singlets represents the same number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. These signals come from the methyl groups. The total number of aliphatic protons in a 1:1 mixture is 12H (from the first compound) + 12H (from the second compound) = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio for 24H corresponds to signals with integrations of:\n    *   Signal 1: (2 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = 12H\n    *   Signal 2: (1 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Signal 3: (1 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = 6H\n    Therefore, we are looking for a combination of compounds that produces three aliphatic singlets integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   The ethyl groups (-CH2CH3) will show spin-spin splitting, producing a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region.

This does not match the data.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must interpret the information provided from the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four candidate molecules fit this formula.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The compounds are mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio. This is crucial for interpreting the integration ratios.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this implies that the number of protons contributing to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second. The most direct explanation is that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and each signal represents the same number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n    *   The fact that all signals are singlets is a key clue.\n    *   The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 12 (from the first compound) + 12 (from the second compound) = 24 protons.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Therefore, the combined aliphatic signals from the two compounds must be three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This compound contains ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The -CH2- protons would be split into a quartet by the adjacent -CH3- protons, and the -CH3- protons would be split into a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This contradicts the data that all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**, which also eliminates option **D**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1/C4 and the \"inner\" pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets**, each with an integration of **6H**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture that produces two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets (12H, 6H, 6H).\n\n*   **Aromatic Check:** All three tetramethylbenzene isomers (Durene, Prehnitene, Isodurene) produce one 2H aromatic singlet each. Therefore, a 1:1 mixture of any two of them will result in two distinct 2H singlets, satisfying the \"two singlets in a 1:1 ratio\" condition. The decision must be made based on the aliphatic signals.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Check:** We combine the predicted aliphatic signals for each pair to see which one matches the required [12H, 6H, 6H] pattern.\n\n    *   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   Prehnitene gives: two 6H singlets.\n        *   Isodurene gives: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   Combined signals: [6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H]. This is at least four signals, which does not match the data.\n\n    *   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   Durene gives: **one 12H singlet**.\n        *   Prehnitene gives: **two 6H singlets**.\n        *   Combined signals: [12H, 6H, 6H]. This results in **three singlets** with the exact integrations required to produce a 2:1:1 ratio. **This is a perfect match.**\n\n    *   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   Durene gives: one 12H singlet.\n        *   Isodurene gives: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   Combined signals: [12H, 6H, 3H, 3H]. This is four signals, which does not match the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo determine the correct pair of compounds, a systematic analysis of the provided ¹H NMR data is required. We will predict the spectrum for each individual compound and then evaluate which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Given ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe problem provides the following information for a 1:1 molar mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The 1:1 mixture ratio means that the number of protons from each compound contributes equally to the total integration.\n*   The 1:1 ratio in the aromatic region implies the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second.\n*   The total number of aliphatic protons (from the four methyl groups on each molecule) in the mixture is 12H + 12H = 24H. The 2:1:1 ratio (4 total parts) corresponds to signals integrating to (2/4)*24H = **12H**, (1/4)*24H = **6H**, and (1/4)*24H = **6H**.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThe prediction is based on the chemical equivalence of protons, which is determined by the molecule's symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   The ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) would show spin-spin splitting. The -CH₂- protons would appear as a quartet and the -CH₃ protons as a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is immediately eliminated because the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets. This rules out **Option B**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (C1, C4) and the \"inner\" pair (C2, C3). This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons. This plane makes the protons at C4 and C6 equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture that produces two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Aromatic Check:** All three tetramethylbenzene isomers produce one 2H singlet each. Therefore, a 1:1 mixture of any two of them will result in two distinct 2H singlets, satisfying the \"two singlets in a 1:1 ratio\" condition. The deciding factor must be the aliphatic signals.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Check:**\n\n    *   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n        *   Combined Result: A total of **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. This perfectly matches the required 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n    *   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n        *   Ruled out in Step 2.\n\n    *   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two 6H singlets.\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   Combined Result: At least four signals (one 6H signal might overlap, but the 3H signals are unique). This does not match the \"three signals\" data.\n\n    *   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one 12H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   Combined Result: A total of four aliphatic singlets. This does not match the \"three signals\" data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces a spectrum with two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio (12H, 6H, 6H) is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the final answer, a rigorous, step-by-step analysis is required, paying close attention to the details of the 1H NMR data and the structures of the candidate molecules.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe goal is to identify a 1:1 mixture of two isomers of C10H14 that produces a specific 1H NMR spectrum. The key spectral features are:\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlets in a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Derivations**\n\n1.  **Eliminate Impossible Structures First:** A critical piece of information is that all signals in the aliphatic region are *singlets*.\n    *   The structure **1,4-diethylbenzene** contains ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). Due to spin-spin coupling, these groups would produce a quartet and a triplet, not singlets.\n    *   Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene can be immediately eliminated, which invalidates **Option A**.\n\n2.  **Correctly Interpret the Aromatic Signals:** The spectrum shows two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this means the number of protons contributing to each signal is equal. This strongly suggests that each of the two compounds in the mixture contributes one aromatic singlet, and both singlets represent the same number of protons (e.g., 2H each).\n\n3.  **Correctly Predict the Spectrum of Each Isomer:** This requires a careful analysis of each molecule's symmetry.\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetric.\n        *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one 2H singlet**.\n        *   Aliphatic Protons: All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n        *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one 2H singlet**.\n        *   Aliphatic Protons: There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the outer pair (C1, C4) and the inner pair (C2, C3). This results in **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has lower symmetry.\n        *   Aromatic Protons: The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. H4 is between two methyl groups, while H6 is next to a methyl group and an empty position. They produce **two distinct 1H singlets**.\n        *   This is a crucial point. Any mixture containing Isodurene would have at least three aromatic signals (the two 1H singlets from Isodurene plus at least one more from the other compound). This contradicts the experimental data of only two aromatic signals. Therefore, any option containing 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene must be incorrect. This eliminates **Option B** and **Option C**.\n\n4.  **Verify the Remaining Option:** By elimination, only Option D remains. We must verify that it perfectly matches all the data.\n    *   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n        *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture will therefore show **two singlets**. Since both signals represent 2 protons, their integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n        *   **Aliphatic Spectrum:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet of 12H. 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets of 6H each. The combined spectrum will show a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that satisfies all conditions of the 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. This corresponds to Option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the information provided by the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four options fit this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this means the number of protons contributing to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second. The most direct interpretation is that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and each signal represents the same number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. These signals are the sum of all the methyl protons from both compounds.\n    *   The fact that all signals are singlets is a critical clue.\n    *   The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 24 (12 from each C10H14 isomer). The 2:1:1 ratio (total of 4 parts) corresponds to signals with integrations of (2/4)*24H = 12H, (1/4)*24H = 6H, and (1/4)*24H = 6H.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The -CH2- protons would be split into a quartet by the adjacent -CH3 protons, and the -CH3 protons would be split into a triplet. Since the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, **this compound can be immediately eliminated**. This also eliminates option B.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Equivalent protons do not split each other, so they produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the \"inner\" pair at C2/C3 are equivalent. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This symmetry makes the protons at C4 and C6 chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that produces:\n*   **Aromatic:** Two 2H singlets (which gives the required 1:1 ratio). All three tetramethylbenzene isomers produce one 2H singlet each, so any pair will satisfy this condition.\n*   **Aliphatic:** Three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\nLet's test the remaining combinations based on their combined aliphatic signals:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   The combined spectrum shows a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **This is a perfect match.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   The combined spectrum would show a total of **four** aliphatic singlets. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   The combined spectrum would show at least four signals (assuming one of the 6H signals from each compound overlaps). This does not match the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
