The time measured in the lab frame, `t_lab`, is related to the proper time by `t_lab = γ * t_p`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:**\n    *   First, we determine the time of flight in the lab frame, `t_lab`. The particles travel the detector radius, `R`. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. Therefore, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Next, we find the proper time `t_p` experienced by the particle during its flight using the time dilation formula: `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R / c) / γ`.\n    *   Substituting this proper time into the exponential decay formula gives the fraction of surviving particles as a function of the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n        `f = exp(-(R / (γ * c)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n3.  **Use a Ratiometric Method to Solve:**\n    *   The term `K = R / (c * τ)` is a constant because the detector radius, the speed of light, and the particle's intrinsic lifetime are the same in both scenarios. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n    *   By taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get `ln(f) = -K / γ`, which can be rearranged to `K = -γ * ln(f)`.\n    *   Since `K` is constant for both scenarios, we can set the expressions equal to each other:\n        `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n4.  **Substitute Values and Calculate:**\n    *   We are given the initial conditions (Scenario 1): `γ₁ = 20` and `f₁ = 1/3`.\n    *   We are asked to find `γ₂` for the final conditions (Scenario 2): `f₂ = 2/3`.\n    *   Plugging these into the equation:\n        `-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    *   The negative signs on both sides cancel. Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`, the equation becomes:\n        `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n    *   Now, we solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n    *   Using the approximate values for natural logarithms (`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`):\n        `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055) ≈ 54.19`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19.

This allows the problem to be solved without knowing the exact velocity.\n*   **Identifying Constants:** The key to solving this problem efficiently is recognizing that the term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant across both scenarios. This allows for the creation of a ratio that eliminates the need to calculate the proper lifetime `τ` or even use the detector radius `R`.\n*   **Logical Sanity Check:** For a larger fraction of particles to survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), they must \"age\" less during their journey. This requires a greater time dilation effect, which in turn requires a larger Lorentz factor.

The fraction of particles that survive a journey depends on the time elapsed in their own reference frame (proper time), which is shorter than the time measured in the laboratory due to time dilation.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:**\n    *   The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after a proper time `t_p` is given by the decay law: `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n    *   The time of flight in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v`. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`, so `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the proper time `t_p` experienced by the particle is related to the lab time by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `t_p = t_lab / γ`.\n    *   Substituting these into the decay law gives the survival fraction as a function of `γ`:\n        `f = exp(-(R / (c * γ)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n3.  **Set Up a Ratio to Solve:**\n    *   The term `K = R / (c * τ)` is a constant because the detector radius `R`, the speed of light `c`, and the particle's proper lifetime `τ` are the same in both scenarios. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n    *   We can solve for `K` by taking the natural logarithm: `ln(f) = -K / γ`, which gives `K = -γ * ln(f)`.\n    *   Since `K` is constant, we can equate its value from both scenarios:\n        `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n4.  **Substitute Values and Solve for the Unknown:**\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   **Scenario 2:** `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n    *   Plugging these into the equation:\n        `-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    *   The negative signs cancel. Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`, we can also write this as `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`.\n    *   Solving for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:** The final step is to compute this value and compare it to the given options.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Correct Physical Model:** It is essential to use the decay law in terms of the particle's proper time and to correctly apply the time dilation formula to relate it to the lab frame. All candidate answers correctly identified this model.\n*   **Ultra-relativistic Approximation:** The approximation `v ≈ c` is justified by the problem statement and is crucial for simplifying the time-of-flight calculation.\n*   **Logical Sanity Check:** A higher fraction of particles (2/3 vs 1/3) needs to survive. This means their internal clocks must tick slower relative to the lab, which requires a larger time dilation effect. Therefore, the new Lorentz factor `γ₂` must be greater than the original `γ₁ = 20`. The calculated result of ~54 is consistent with this check.\n*   **Mapping Value to Option:** The candidate answers show universal agreement on the calculation, resulting in a value of ~54.19.

Therefore, the proper time the particle experiences during its flight is `t_p = t_lab / γ`.\n\n4.  **Calculate Time of Flight:** The particles travel the detector radius, `R`. The problem states they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" which justifies approximating their velocity `v` as the speed of light `c`. The time of flight in the lab frame is therefore:\n    `t_lab ≈ R / c`\n\n5.  **Combine the Equations:** By substituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `t_p` into the survival equation, we get the fraction of surviving particles as a function of the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `f = exp(-(t_lab / γ) / τ) = exp(-(R / c) / (γ * τ)) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n6.  **Use a Ratiometric Solution:** The term `K = R / (c * τ)` is a constant because the detector radius and the particle's intrinsic properties are the same in both scenarios. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`. We can solve for this constant `K` by taking the natural logarithm:\n    `ln(f) = -K / γ`  which rearranges to `K = -γ * ln(f)`.\n\n7.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor:** Since `K` is constant, we can equate the expressions from the two scenarios:\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   **Scenario 2:** `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\n    `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n    `20 * ln(1/3) = γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n\n    Now, we solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(1/3) / ln(2/3))`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:** Using the properties of logarithms (`ln(1/x) = -ln(x)` and `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`), the expression simplifies:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (-ln(3)) / (-ln(3/2)) = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n    Using the approximate values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055) ≈ 54.19`\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Correct Physical Model:** It is crucial to apply the decay law in the particle's proper reference frame and use time dilation to connect it to the lab frame. All candidate answers correctly identified this as the core of the problem.\n*   **Ultra-relativistic Approximation:** The assumption that the particle's velocity is approximately the speed of light (`v ≈ c`) is justified by the problem and necessary to calculate the time of flight without more information.\n*   **Identifying Constants:** The key to solving the problem is recognizing that the term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant, which allows for a solution without knowing the particle's proper lifetime `τ` or using the detector radius `R=30m`.\n*   **Logical Sanity Check:** For a larger fraction of particles to survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), they must \"age\" less during their journey. This requires a greater time dilation effect, which corresponds to a higher Lorentz factor. The result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is indeed greater than the initial `γ₁ = 20`, which confirms the physical reasoning is sound.\n*   **Mapping Value to Option:** The calculated value is ~54.19.

This effect, quantified by the Lorentz factor `γ`, means the particle's lifetime appears longer from the lab's perspective.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:**\n    *   The fraction of surviving particles is given by `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `t_p` is the proper time experienced by the particle and `τ` is its mean proper lifetime.\n    *   The time of flight in the lab frame, `t_lab`, is the distance `R` divided by the velocity `v`. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Time dilation connects the lab time and proper time: `t_lab = γ * t_p`. Therefore, the proper time the particle experiences during its flight is `t_p = t_lab / γ = R / (γ * c)`.\n    *   Substituting this into the decay equation gives the survival fraction as a function of the Lorentz factor:\n        `f = exp(-(R / (γ * c)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n3.  **Set Up a Ratio to Solve for the Unknown:**\n    *   The term `K = R / (c * τ)` is a constant because the detector radius `R`, the speed of light `c`, and the particle's proper lifetime `τ` do not change between the two scenarios. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n    *   By taking the natural logarithm, we get `ln(f) = -K / γ`, which can be rearranged to `K = -γ * ln(f)`.\n    *   Since `K` is constant for both scenarios, we can equate the expressions from each scenario:\n        `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n4.  **Substitute Values and Calculate:**\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   **Scenario 2:** `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n    *   Plugging these values into the equation:\n        `-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    *   The negative signs cancel. Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`, we can also write this as `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`.\n    *   Now, solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n    *   Using the approximate values for natural logarithms (`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`):\n        `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n        `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.7095`\n        `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\n5.  **Match with Options:** The calculated value is approximately 54.2. Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) 28\n    B) 40\n    C) 68\n    D) 54\n    The result is closest to 54.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Correct Physical Model:** It is essential to use the decay law in terms of the particle's proper time and to correctly apply the time dilation formula to relate it to the lab frame. All candidate answers correctly identified this model.\n*   **Ultra-relativistic Approximation:** The approximation `v ≈ c` is justified by the problem statement and is crucial for simplifying the time-of-flight calculation.\n*   **Identifying Constants:** The key to solving the problem efficiently is recognizing that the term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant across both scenarios. This allows for the creation of a ratio that eliminates the need to know the particle's proper lifetime `τ` or the detector radius `R`.\n*   **Logical Check:** For a larger fraction of particles to survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), they must \"age\" less during their journey. This requires a larger time dilation effect, which in turn requires a higher Lorentz factor. Our result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is greater than `γ₁ = 20`, which is consistent with physical intuition.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** There is a unanimous consensus among all 15 candidate answers on the physical derivation, the final formula, and the calculated numerical result of ~54.2. The discrepancies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) are due to inconsistent ordering of the options in their respective prompts and do not reflect an error in the calculation itself. The calculated value of ~54.2 definitively corresponds to the option \"54\".\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers and a first-principles review of the physics problem, the following step-by-step derivation determines the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Governing Physical Principles**: The problem is solved by combining two fundamental concepts of modern physics:\n    *   **Exponential Decay**: The fraction `f` of unstable particles that survive after a proper time `t_p` (the time in the particle's own reference frame) is given by `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n    *   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation)**: A particle moving with a high velocity experiences time more slowly than a stationary observer. The time measured in the lab frame (`t_lab`) is related to the proper time by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `t_lab = γ * t_p`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation**:\n    *   First, we determine the time of flight in the lab frame. The particles travel the detector radius, `R`, at an \"ultra-relativistic\" velocity, so we can approximate their speed `v ≈ c` (the speed of light). The time of flight is `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Next, we find the proper time `t_p` experienced by the particle during its flight using the time dilation formula: `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R/c) / γ`.\n    *   Substituting this proper time into the exponential decay equation gives the survival fraction `f` as a function of the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n        `f = exp(-(R / (γ * c)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n3.  **Use a Ratiometric Method to Solve**:\n    *   The term `K = R / (c * τ)` is a constant because the detector radius, the speed of light, and the particle's intrinsic proper lifetime are the same in both scenarios. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n    *   By taking the natural logarithm, we can rearrange the formula: `ln(f) = -K / γ`, which gives `K = -γ * ln(f)`.\n    *   Since `K` is constant, the product `-γ * ln(f)` must be the same for both scenarios. Therefore, we can set up a ratio:\n        `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n4.  **Substitute Values and Calculate**:\n    *   We are given the initial conditions (Scenario 1): `γ₁ = 20` and `f₁ = 1/3`.\n    *   We are given the target condition (Scenario 2): `f₂ = 2/3`, and we need to find `γ₂`.\n    *   Plugging these into the ratio equation:\n        `-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    *   The negative signs on both sides cancel. Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`, we can simplify:\n        `20 * [-ln(3)] = γ₂ * [-ln(3/2)]`\n        `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n    *   Now, we solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n    *   Using the approximate values for the natural logarithms (`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`):\n        `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055) ≈ 54.19`\n\n5.  **Match to Options**: The calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. Comparing this to the provided options:\n    *   A) 68\n    *   B) 40\n    *   C) 28\n    *   D) 54\n    The calculated value is closest to 54.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Correct Physical Model**: It is essential to use the decay law in terms of the particle's proper time and to correctly apply the time dilation formula. All candidate answers correctly identified and applied this model.\n*   **Ultra-relativistic Approximation**: The approximation `v ≈ c` is justified by the problem statement and is crucial for simplifying the time-of-flight calculation.\n*   **Identifying Constants**: The key to solving the problem without knowing the detector radius or the particle's lifetime is recognizing that the term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant across both scenarios. This allows for the creation of a ratio that eliminates these unknown values.\n*   **Logical Sanity Check**: For a larger fraction of particles to survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), they must \"age\" less during their journey. This requires a larger time dilation effect, which in turn requires a higher Lorentz factor. The result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is greater than the initial `γ₁ = 20`, which is physically consistent.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers**: All 15 candidate answers, despite showing different letter-to-value mappings for the options, unanimously calculated the correct numerical value of approximately 54. The discrepancies in their final letter choice are artifacts of how the options were presented to them, but their underlying analysis is sound and consistent.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
