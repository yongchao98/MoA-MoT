Let's deduce the identity of each compound step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 3:** \"C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\"\n    *   This hydrolysis reaction, which regenerates the starting material A (as an element) and produces two different acids, is very characteristic. A well-known example is the hydrolysis of sulfur chlorides.\n    *   Let's test the hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂): 2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂ + 4HCl.\n    *   In this reaction:\n        *   The solid product is elemental sulfur. Let's assume **A is Sulfur (S)**.\n        *   One acid produced is **HCl (Hydrochloric acid)**, which is a **strong acid (F)**.\n        *   The other product is SO₂, which dissolves in water to form **H₂SO₃ (Sulfurous acid)**, a **weak acid (G)**.\n    *   This perfectly matches the description. So, we can hypothesize:\n        *   **A = Sulfur (S)**\n        *   **C = SCl₂** (Sulfur dichloride, which is a cherry-red liquid, fitting the \"bright red product\" description).\n        *   **F = HCl**\n        *   **G = H₂SO₃**\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 1:** \"reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.\"\n    *   We have A = Sulfur and C = SCl₂. The reaction is the formation of SCl₂ from sulfur. This requires chlorine. So, gas **B must be Chlorine (Cl₂)**.\n    *   The standard reaction is S + Cl₂ → SCl₂. This is a 1:1 ratio. However, the clue specifies \"8 equivalents\".\n    *   We must consider the stable allotrope of sulfur at standard conditions, which is a solid crown-shaped ring, **S₈**.\n    *   Let's write the reaction with A = S₈: **S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)**.\n    *   In this balanced equation, 1 mole of solid A (S₈) reacts with 8 moles of gas B (Cl₂). This matches the \"8 equivalents\" stoichiometry perfectly.\n    *   So, **A = S₈** and **B = Cl₂**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clue 4:** \"D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\"\n    *   We know B = Cl₂. So, gas D reacts with Cl₂ in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent H.\n    *   A common reaction is the addition of chlorine to ethylene: **C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)**.\n    *   The product, 1,2-dichloroethane, is a widely used solvent.\n    *   This fits the clue. So, we can identify:\n        *   **D = C₂H₄ (Ethene/Ethylene)**\n        *   **H = C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-dichloroethane)**\n\n4.  **Analyze Clue 2:** \"When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\"\n    *   We have C = SCl₂ and D = C₂H₄.\n    *   The reaction is: **SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S**.\n    *   This is the Levinstein process for the synthesis of **bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide**, commonly known as **Mustard Gas**. Mustard gas is an infamous chemical warfare agent and is extremely hazardous.\n    *   This confirms our identification of **E = (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S (Mustard Gas)**.\n\n**Summary of Identities:**\n*   A = S₈ (Sulfur)\n*   B = Cl₂ (Chlorine)\n*   C = SCl₂ (Sulfur dichloride)\n*   D = C₂H₄ (Ethene)\n*   E = (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S (Mustard Gas)\n*   F = HCl (Hydrochloric acid)\n*   G = H₂SO₃ (Sulfurous acid)\n*   H = C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-dichloroethane)\n\n**Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E:**\nThe final question is to find the molecular symmetry group (point group) of E, mustard gas, (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S.\n\nThe molecule's shape is determined by the geometry around the central sulfur atom and the conformation of the two ethyl chloride chains. The point group corresponds to the symmetry of the molecule's most stable conformation.\n\n*   The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two -CH₂CH₂Cl chains.\n*   The molecule is not linear (ruling out D∞h).\n*   It is not highly symmetric like a square planar molecule (ruling out D4h).\n*   The most stable conformation of mustard gas, as determined by computational chemistry and experimental data, possesses a single symmetry element: a two-fold axis of rotation (C₂) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle. In this conformation, a 180° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n*   This conformation does not have any mirror planes (σ). The presence of a C₂ axis and a vertical mirror plane (σv) would result in a C2v point group. However, due to the staggered nature of the ethyl groups to minimize steric hindrance, no such mirror planes exist in the lowest-energy structure.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E (mustard gas) is **C₂**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown compounds and determine the molecular symmetry of product E.\n\n1.  **Identify gases B and D, and solvent H:** The reaction D(g) + B(g) → H (solvent) in a 1:1 ratio is a strong clue. A well-known reaction that fits this description is the formation of phosgene from carbon monoxide and chlorine gas: CO(g) + Cl₂(g) → COCl₂(l). Phosgene (COCl₂) is an extremely hazardous substance used as a solvent and reagent in industry. Therefore, we can identify:\n    *   **B = Cl₂** (Chlorine gas)\n    *   **D = CO** (Carbon monoxide)\n    *   **H = COCl₂** (Phosgene, also known as carbonyl chloride)\n\n2.  **Identify acids F and G:** The reaction of C with water reforms A and produces a strong acid (F) and a weak acid (G). Since C is formed from a reaction involving chlorine (B), the strong acid F is almost certainly hydrochloric acid (HCl). The formation of two distinct acids from the hydrolysis of a substance made only from A and chlorine is unusual. However, if C is a complex where chlorine molecules are trapped and then released into water, the dissolved chlorine will hydrolyze: Cl₂ + H₂O ⇌ HCl (strong acid) + HClO (hypochlorous acid, a weak acid). This perfectly matches the description. Thus:\n    *   **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid)\n    *   **G = HClO** (Hypochlorous acid)\n\n3.  **Identify solid A and product C:** The hydrolysis reaction C + H₂O → A + HCl + HClO implies that A is a solid host material that traps chlorine gas to form C, and this host is reformed (unchanged) when the chlorine is released in water. The stoichiometry A(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → C suggests that one mole of A can trap eight moles of chlorine. A plausible candidate for A is Buckminsterfullerene (C₆₀), a solid which can form clathrates or charge-transfer complexes with guest molecules. The resulting complex, C, would be C₆₀·8Cl₂. While C₆₀ is black, its complexes can be colored, so it is plausible that C is \"bright red\".\n    *   **A = C₆₀** (Buckminsterfullerene)\n    *   **C = C₆₀·8Cl₂** (A fullerene-chlorine complex)\n\n4.  **Identify the extremely hazardous product E:** Product E is formed when C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D.\n    *   C(C₆₀·8Cl₂) + 2D(2CO) → E\n    The reaction involves the trapped chlorine in C reacting with carbon monoxide. The most direct reaction is the formation of phosgene: 2CO + 2Cl₂ → 2COCl₂. The overall reaction would be C₆₀·8Cl₂ + 2CO → C₆₀ + 6Cl₂ + 2COCl₂. The product E, described as \"extremely hazardous,\" is phosgene (COCl₂).\n    *   **E = COCl₂** (Phosgene)\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E:** Now we must find the molecular symmetry group for phosgene (COCl₂). The molecule has a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms. Its structure is trigonal planar.\n    *   The molecule possesses a C₂ rotation axis that passes through the C=O bond.\n    *   It has two vertical mirror planes (σv). One is the plane containing all the atoms, and the other is perpendicular to the molecular plane, bisecting the Cl-C-Cl angle.\n    *   A molecule with a C₂ axis and two vertical mirror planes belongs to the **C₂v** point group. This is a common point group for molecules like water (H₂O) and formaldehyde (H₂CO).\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E (phosgene) is C₂v.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve this chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify the compounds**: I will deduce the chemical identities of the substances labeled A through H by analyzing the described reactions one by one. The key is to find a consistent set of compounds that fits all the clues.\n2.  **Start with the clearest clues**: The reaction `D + B -> H` (where H is a solvent) and the hydrolysis reaction `C + H₂O -> A + F + G` are the most informative starting points.\n3.  **Formulate a hypothesis**: Based on common chemical reactions, I'll propose identities for the compounds. For instance, `B = Cl₂` (chlorine gas) is a good starting assumption.\n4.  **Test the hypothesis**: I will check if the proposed set of compounds is consistent with all the given information, including physical states (solid, gas), color (bright red), and properties (strong/weak acid, hazardous product).\n5.  **Identify Compound E**: Once the identities of C and D are established, I can determine the product E from the reaction `C + 2D -> E`.\n6.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry**: After identifying the chemical structure of the hazardous product E, I will determine its molecular geometry and the corresponding point group (molecular symmetry group).\n7.  **Select the Final Answer**: I will match the determined point group with the given options (A, B, C, D).\n\n**Execution of the plan:**\n\n*   **Clue 4: `D (gas) + B (gas) -> H (solvent)`**\n    Let's assume `B` is chlorine (`Cl₂`). A common reaction is the addition of chlorine to ethene (`C₂H₄`).\n    `C₂H₄ (g) + Cl₂ (g) -> C₂H₄Cl₂ (l)`\n    Here, `D = C₂H₄` (ethene), `B = Cl₂` (chlorine), and `H = C₂H₄Cl₂` (1,2-dichloroethane), which is a common solvent. This is a very strong fit.\n\n*   **Clue 3: `C + H₂O -> A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)`**\n    This is a hydrolysis reaction where `C` disproportionates to reform `A`. This suggests `A` is an element. If `B` is `Cl₂`, then `C` is likely a chloride. The formation of a strong acid `F` points to `HCl`.\n    Let's test sulfur chlorides. The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (`SCl₂`) is:\n    `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O -> S + SO₂ + 4HCl`\n    In this reaction:\n    *   `A` is elemental sulfur (`S`), a solid.\n    *   `F` is hydrochloric acid (`HCl`), a strong acid.\n    *   `G` is sulfurous acid (`H₂SO₃`), a weak acid formed when `SO₂` dissolves in water.\n    This fits the description perfectly. So, we can identify `C = SCl₂`.\n\n*   **Clue 1: `solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C`**\n    This would be `S (s) + 8Cl₂ (g) -> SCl₂ (bright red)`. Sulfur dichloride (`SCl₂`) is indeed a cherry-red liquid. However, the stoichiometry is incorrect (the actual reaction is `S + Cl₂ -> SCl₂`). Given that all other clues fit so well, we will assume the \"8 equivalents\" is an error in the problem statement.\n\n*   **Clue 2: `C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E`**\n    Using our identified compounds:\n    `SCl₂ (C) + 2C₂H₄ (D) -> E`\n    This is the well-known Levinstein process for synthesizing **mustard gas**, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ -> S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`\n    Mustard gas is an extremely hazardous chemical warfare agent. Thus, `E` is mustard gas.\n\n*   **Final Step: Determine the molecular symmetry group of E (Mustard Gas)**\n    The molecule `E` is mustard gas, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   The central sulfur atom is bonded to two `-CH₂CH₂Cl` groups and has two lone pairs, resulting in a bent geometry around the sulfur.\n    *   The molecule is not planar due to rotations around the single bonds.\n    *   The most stable conformation of the molecule is chiral (lacks any mirror planes or an inversion center) but possesses a two-fold rotational axis (`C₂`) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle.\n    *   A molecule whose only symmetry element (besides identity) is a `C₂` axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\nComparing this to the options:\nA) D4h\nB) C2v\nC) C2\nD) D∞h\n\nThe correct molecular symmetry group is C₂.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Identify the compounds based on the chemical clues.\n# A = S (Sulfur)\n# B = Cl₂ (Chlorine)\n# C = SCl₂ (Sulfur dichloride)\n# D = C₂H₄ (Ethene)\n# E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂ (Mustard gas)\n# F = HCl (Hydrochloric acid)\n# G = H₂SO₃ (Sulfurous acid)\n# H = C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-dichloroethane)\n\n# Step 2: Determine the molecular symmetry group of compound E (Mustard Gas).\n# Mustard gas, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂, has a bent structure at the sulfur atom.\n# Due to the arrangement of the ethyl chloride chains, the molecule is not planar and lacks mirror planes.\n# Its most stable conformation possesses a C₂ rotational axis.\n# A molecule with only identity (E) and a C₂ axis belongs to the C₂ point group.\n\n# Step 3: Match the result with the given options.\n# A) D4h\n# B) C2v\n# C) C2\n# D) D∞h\n# The correct option is C.\n\nfinal_choice = 'C'\nprint(f\"The molecular symmetry group of E (mustard gas) is C2.\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the correct option is {final_choice}.\")\n```\n<<<C>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The molecular symmetry group of E (mustard gas) is C2.\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical puzzle to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the clues provided.**\n\n*   **Clue 1:** solid A + 8 gas B → bright red product C\n*   **Clue 2:** C + 2 gas D → extremely hazardous product E\n*   **Clue 3:** C + H₂O → solid A + strong acid F + weak acid G\n*   **Clue 4:** gas D + gas B → solvent H (in a 1:1 ratio)\n\n**Step 2: Identify the most restrictive clue.**\n\nClue 3 is the most chemically specific and restrictive clue. The hydrolysis of C regenerates the starting material A and produces two different acids, one strong (F) and one weak (G). This suggests that the ligands in C (which come from gas B) undergo hydrolysis or disproportionation. The regeneration of A suggests it is a relatively noble element that is resistant to oxidation by water or the acids formed.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate a hypothesis based on Clue 3.**\n\nWe need to find a substance (derived from gas B) that hydrolyzes to produce a strong acid and a weak acid.\n*   Let's consider interhalogens. The gas Bromine monochloride (BrCl) hydrolyzes in water:\n    BrCl + H₂O → HCl + HOBr\n*   In this reaction, Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a strong acid (F), and Hypobromous acid (HOBr) is a weak acid (G). This is a perfect fit for the products described in Clue 3.\n*   Therefore, we can hypothesize:\n    *   **B = BrCl** (Bromine monochloride, a reddish-brown gas)\n    *   **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid)\n    *   **G = HOBr** (Hypobromous acid)\n\n**Step 4: Use the hypothesis to identify other substances.**\n\n*   **Identify A and C (Clue 1 & 3):**\n    *   Since C hydrolyzes to regenerate A, A is likely a noble metal that can be reduced back to its elemental form from a complex. Gold (Au) is a good candidate.\n    *   A = **Au** (Gold, a solid).\n    *   Gold reacts with halogens to form colored complexes. Gold(III) halides like AuCl₃ and AuBr₃ are red. So, C is a red gold(III) bromo-chloro complex.\n    *   C = **Au₂(Br,Cl)₆** (a simplified representation of a red gold halide complex).\n    *   The 1:8 stoichiometry in Clue 1 is a known difficulty in this classic puzzle and is likely a simplification.\n\n*   **Identify D and H (Clue 4):**\n    *   We have D(g) + B(g) → H(solvent) in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   With B = BrCl, we have D(g) + BrCl(g) → H(solvent).\n    *   Let's test a plausible gas for D. If D is Carbon Monoxide (CO), the reaction is:\n        CO + BrCl → BrCOCl (Carbonyl bromochloride)\n    *   BrCOCl is a liquid and can be used as a solvent. This reaction fits the 1:1 stoichiometry.\n    *   So, we can hypothesize:\n        *   **D = CO** (Carbon Monoxide)\n        *   **H = BrCOCl** (Carbonyl bromochloride)\n\n**Step 5: Identify the extremely hazardous product E (Clue 2).**\n\n*   We have C + 2D → E.\n*   Substituting our identified substances: Gold halide complex (C) + 2CO (D) → E.\n*   There is a known reaction where gold(III) chloride oxidizes carbon monoxide to phosgene:\n    Au₂Cl₆ + 2CO → Au₂Cl₄ + 2COCl₂\n*   This reaction produces Phosgene (COCl₂), which is an extremely hazardous chemical warfare agent. The stoichiometry also matches.\n*   Therefore, we can confidently identify E:\n    *   **E = COCl₂** (Phosgene)\n\n**Step 6: Determine the molecular symmetry group of E.**\n\n*   The molecule E is phosgene, COCl₂.\n*   Let's analyze its structure and symmetry elements:\n    *   The molecule is planar.\n    *   It has one two-fold rotation axis (C₂) that passes through the C=O bond.\n    *   It has two mirror planes (σᵥ). One plane is the plane of the molecule itself. The other is perpendicular to the molecular plane and bisects the Cl-C-Cl angle.\n*   A molecule with one C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe step-by-step analysis leads to the identification of E as phosgene (COCl₂), which has a molecular symmetry of C₂ᵥ. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis is a classic chemical puzzle that can be solved by systematically identifying each unknown substance (A through H) based on the described reactions.\n\n1.  **Identifying Gases B and D, and Solvent H:** The reaction where gas D and gas B react in a 1:1 ratio to form solvent H is a strong starting point. A well-known reaction that fits this description is the formation of phosgene (COCl₂) from carbon monoxide (CO) and chlorine (Cl₂). Phosgene is a toxic gas but is used as a solvent in some industrial applications. Another possibility is the reaction of sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and chlorine (Cl₂) to form sulfuryl chloride (SO₂Cl₂), which is also a solvent.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Acids F and G:** The hydrolysis of product C reforms solid A and produces a strong acid (F) and a weak acid (G). This indicates that the ligands on C (which come from gas B) are responsible for forming the acids.\n    *   If B were CO, its hydrolysis would not produce acids.\n    *   If B were Cl₂, its hydrolysis (Cl₂ + H₂O ⇌ HCl + HOCl) produces hydrochloric acid (HCl), which is a strong acid, and hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which is a weak acid. This perfectly matches the description.\n\n3.  **Confirming the Identities of A, B, C, D, and H:**\n    *   Based on the hydrolysis, **B** must be **chlorine gas (Cl₂) **, **F** is **hydrochloric acid (HCl)**, and **G** is **hypochlorous acid (HOCl)**.\n    *   Since B is Cl₂, and it reacts 1:1 with D to form a solvent, D is most likely **carbon monoxide (CO)**, making the solvent H **phosgene (COCl₂)**.\n    *   Now we must identify A and C. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B (Cl₂) to form the bright red product C. A known, though somewhat obscure, reaction fits this stoichiometry: solid iodine (I₂) reacts with excess chlorine.\n    *   Therefore, **A** is **Iodine (I₂) **.\n    *   The reaction is I₂(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 2[ICl₂]⁺[Cl₃]⁻. The product, a complex of iodine and chlorine, can be described as a bright red or orange-yellow solid. So, **C** is the **iodine-chlorine complex, 2[ICl₂]⁺[Cl₃]⁻**.\n    *   The hydrolysis of this complex (C) reforms iodine (A) and produces HCl (F) and HOCl (G), which is consistent with all observations.\n\n4.  **Identifying Product E and its Symmetry:**\n    *   Product C (the iodine-chlorine complex) reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D (CO) to produce the extremely hazardous product E.\n    *   The reaction is: 2[ICl₂]⁺[Cl₃]⁻ (C) + 2CO (D) → 2ICl₃ + 2COCl₂ (E).\n    *   The extremely hazardous product **E** is **phosgene (COCl₂)**. Phosgene is listed as an extremely hazardous substance.\n    *   The final step is to determine the molecular symmetry group of phosgene. The molecule has a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms. It is a planar molecule.\n    *   It possesses a C₂ rotation axis along the C=O bond.\n    *   It has two vertical mirror planes (one containing the molecule and one perpendicular to it).\n    *   A molecule with a C₂ axis and two vertical mirror planes belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E (phosgene) is C₂ᵥ.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis is a classic, albeit complex, chemical puzzle that requires identifying a series of unknown substances based on their reactions. The final goal is to determine the molecular symmetry of product E. Through a step-by-step deduction process, we can identify all the compounds involved.\n\n1.  **Identifying Gases B and D, and Solvent H:** The reaction where two gases, B and D, react in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent (H) is a strong starting point. A well-known reaction that fits this description is the formation of sulfuryl chloride (SO₂Cl₂) from sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and chlorine (Cl₂), both of which are gases. SO₂Cl₂ is a liquid used as a solvent.\n    *   B and D are SO₂ and Cl₂ in some order.\n    *   H is SO₂Cl₂.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Acids F and G and Gas B:** The hydrolysis of product C reforms the starting solid A and produces a strong acid (F) and a weak acid (G). This indicates that the ligands on C (which come from gas B) hydrolyze to form these two acids. If we consider the hydrolysis of chlorine gas (Cl₂), it produces hydrochloric acid (HCl), a strong acid, and hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a weak acid. This perfectly matches the description.\n    *   Cl₂(g) + H₂O(l) ⇌ HCl(aq) + HOCl(aq)\n    *   Therefore, gas **B must be Cl₂**.\n    *   This implies **gas D is SO₂**.\n    *   The strong acid **F is HCl**, and the weak acid **G is HOCl**.\n\n3.  **Identifying Solid A and Product C:** Now we know that solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of chlorine gas (B) to form a bright red product (C). The hydrolysis of C reforms A, suggesting that C is an adduct where A is a carrier for chlorine. The reaction is A(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → C(red). A known solid that forms a bright red adduct with chlorine is **cesium ozonide (CsO₃)**. While this is an obscure compound, it fits the description. The reaction forms CsCl and releases oxygen and chlorine, but in the context of this puzzle, we'll consider the formation of a complex adduct. Let's assume A is a substance that can form a red polychloride adduct. For the purpose of this puzzle, we will denote C as A·(Cl₂)₈.\n\n4.  **Identifying Product E and its Symmetry:** The final step is the reaction of C with 2 equivalents of gas D (SO₂) to form the extremely hazardous product E.\n    *   C + 2D → E\n    *   A·(Cl₂)₈ + 2SO₂ → E\n    Assuming A is a catalyst or carrier, the reaction is effectively between the chlorine and sulfur dioxide: 8Cl₂ + 2SO₂ → E. A plausible reaction is the formation of two molecules of sulfuryl chloride (2SO₂Cl₂), which would consume 2 SO₂ and 2 Cl₂ molecules. However, the problem describes the formation of a single product E. A more fitting, albeit less common, product is the compound **pyrosulfuryl chloride (S₂O₅Cl₂)**. The reaction would be 2SO₂ + Cl₂ → S₂O₅Cl₂. This doesn't match the stoichiometry given.\n\nLet's reconsider the puzzle, as it is known to be a modified version of a classic problem. The inconsistencies suggest we should look for a known hazardous molecule with one of the given symmetries. The D4h point group is highly specific. A well-known example of a molecule with D4h symmetry is **Xenon Tetrafluoride (XeF₄)**. It is a hazardous material as it is a powerful fluorinating agent. If we assume E is XeF₄, we can see if the other clues can be made to fit, even if imperfectly, which is common in such puzzles.\n\n*   **E = XeF₄** (Symmetry D4h).\n*   Formation: C + 2D → XeF₄. The synthesis is Xe + 2F₂ → XeF₄.\n*   This implies **D = F₂** and **C contains Xe**.\n*   C is a \"bright red product\". A known reddish-orange xenon compound is **XePtF₆**. Let's assume this is C.\n*   C is formed from A + 8B. XePtF₆ is formed from Xe + PtF₆. This would make **A = PtF₆** (a red solid) and **B = Xe** (a gas). The 1:8 stoichiometry does not fit, a common issue with this puzzle's various versions.\n*   D + B → H (solvent). F₂ + Xe → H. Xenon difluoride (XeF₂) can be used as a solvent in some applications.\n*   C + H₂O → A + F + G. The hydrolysis of XePtF₆ is complex and does not reform PtF₆, yielding platinum oxides and hydrofluoric acid (HF), a weak acid. This clue does not fit well.\n\nDespite the numerous inconsistencies in the puzzle's description, the question asks for the molecular symmetry group of E. Given that such puzzles often hinge on identifying a key, unique molecule, and that XeF₄ is a classic example of a hazardous molecule with the rare D4h symmetry, it stands as the most probable intended answer for E.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis chemical riddle presents a series of reactions to identify several unknown substances, culminating in determining the molecular symmetry of product E. A step-by-step deduction based on the provided chemical reactions and properties is required.\n\nFirst, let's identify the substances involved:\n\n*   **Reaction 3: C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)**: This hydrolysis reaction is a key clue. The fact that product C reacts with water to reform the initial solid reactant A, along with two different acids (one strong, one weak), strongly suggests that C is a salt where part of it hydrolyzes. The formation of a strong and a weak acid is characteristic of the hydrolysis of certain non-metal halides, particularly those of phosphorus. For instance, phosphorus pentachloride (PCl₅) hydrolyzes to produce phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄, a weak acid) and hydrochloric acid (HCl, a strong acid).\n\n*   **Reaction 4: D + B (1:1 ratio) → H (solvent)**: This describes a simple addition reaction between two gases, B and D, to form a solvent, H.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Solid A + 8 equivalents of gas B → Bright red product C**: This reaction describes the formation of C. While many inorganic compounds can be red, the stoichiometry and other clues must align.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: C + 2 equivalents of gas D → Extremely hazardous product E**: This reaction forms the final product of interest, E, which is described as \"extremely hazardous.\"\n\nLet's try to piece together the identities. If we assume the hydrolysis clue points to phosphorus and chlorine chemistry, we can propose:\n*   **B = Cl₂** (Chlorine, a gas)\n*   **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid, a strong acid)\n*   **G = H₃PO₄** (Phosphoric acid, a weak acid)\n*   **C** is a phosphorus chloride compound.\n\nNow, let's identify D and H using Reaction 4:\n*   If B is Cl₂ and D is a gas that reacts in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent, a very strong candidate for D is carbon monoxide (CO).\n*   **D = CO** (Carbon monoxide, a gas)\n*   **H = COCl₂** (Phosgene), which is formed from CO + Cl₂ → COCl₂. Phosgene is a liquid at room temperature (boiling point 8.3 °C) and is used as a solvent and reagent.\n\nFinally, we can identify the extremely hazardous product E from Reaction 2:\n*   **C + 2D → E**\n*   If C is a phosphorus chloride and D is CO, we must find a reaction that produces E. A known reaction is the reaction of phosphorus pentachloride (PCl₅) with carbon monoxide. While the stoichiometry can vary, a key product of this reaction is phosgene (COCl₂).\n*   Given that H is also phosgene, and E is described as extremely hazardous (a primary characteristic of phosgene), it is highly probable that **E is phosgene (COCl₂)**. The riddle likely contains some inconsistencies, a common trait in such puzzles, but the chemical signposts point strongly toward this conclusion.\n\nNow, we determine the molecular symmetry group of E (phosgene, COCl₂).\nPhosgene has a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms. The molecule is planar. Its structure gives it the following symmetry elements:\n1.  A two-fold rotational axis (C₂) passing through the C=O bond.\n2.  A mirror plane (σᵥ) that contains all the atoms (the molecular plane).\n3.  A second mirror plane (σᵥ') that is perpendicular to the molecular plane and bisects the Cl-C-Cl angle.\n\nA molecule with a C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of the extremely hazardous product E (phosgene) is C₂ᵥ.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Clues**\n\n*   **Clue 1:** solid A + 8 gas B → bright red product C\n*   **Clue 2:** C + 2 gas D → extremely hazardous product E\n*   **Clue 3:** C + H₂O → A + acid F (strong) + acid G (weak)\n*   **Clue 4:** D + B (1:1 ratio) → H (solvent)\n*   **Question:** What is the molecular symmetry group of E? The options are A) D4h, B) D∞h, C) C2, D) C2v.\n\n**2. Analyze the Most Chemically Specific Clues**\n\n*   **Clue 3 is the most revealing.** A compound C hydrolyzes to regenerate the starting material A and produce two different acids, one strong (F) and one weak (G).\n    *   The regeneration of A suggests A is an element.\n    *   The formation of two different acids from the hydrolysis of a substance (C) made from A and B implies that B must contain the atoms necessary for both acids.\n    *   A common strong acid is HCl. A common weak acid is HF. This suggests that the elements Chlorine (Cl) and Fluorine (F) are involved.\n    *   Let's hypothesize: **F = HCl (strong acid)** and **G = HF (weak acid)**.\n    *   This implies that gas B must be a chlorine-fluorine compound (an interhalogen).\n\n*   **Clue 4 provides a relationship between B, D, and H.**\n    *   D + B → H (solvent).\n    *   If B is an interhalogen like ClF, what gas D could react with it in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent H?\n    *   Let's test **B = ClF** (Chlorine monofluoride, a gas).\n    *   Let's test **D = F₂** (Fluorine, a gas).\n    *   The reaction is: F₂(g) + ClF(g) → ClF₃(l).\n    *   This reaction is stoichiometrically 1:1.\n    *   The product, **H = ClF₃** (Chlorine trifluoride), is a liquid at standard pressure below 12 °C and is used as a powerful fluorinating agent (a reactive solvent).\n    *   This set of identities (B=ClF, D=F₂, H=ClF₃) is chemically sound and fits Clue 4 perfectly.\n\n**3. Build the Full Story with the Identified Chemicals**\n\nNow we can propose identities for all the substances:\n*   **B = ClF** (gas)\n*   **D = F₂** (gas)\n*   **H = ClF₃** (solvent)\n*   **F = HCl** (strong acid)\n*   **G = HF** (weak acid)\n\nLet's verify these against the remaining clues.\n\n*   **Clue 1 & 3: The identity of A and C.**\n    *   We need a solid element A that reacts with ClF (B) to form a bright red product C.\n    *   And C must hydrolyze back to A, HCl, and HF.\n    *   Let's test **A = I₂** (Iodine). It is a solid element.\n    *   **Clue 1:** I₂(s) + ClF(g) → C. Iodine reacts with interhalogens to form complexes or other interhalogens (like ICl). Let's assume a bright red complex C is formed. (Note: Puzzles of this type often take liberties with color or stoichiometry. The 1:8 ratio is likely a distractor, as it's not common).\n    *   **Clue 3:** C (Iodine/Chlorine/Fluorine complex) + H₂O → I₂(s) + HCl(aq) + HF(aq). This is chemically very plausible. The complex would break down in water, regenerating the elemental iodine (A) and hydrolyzing the Cl and F components to their respective acids (F and G).\n\n*   **Clue 2: The identity of E.**\n    *   C + 2D → E\n    *   Substituting our identified substances: C (Iodine/Chlorine/Fluorine complex) + 2F₂(g) → E.\n    *   The reaction involves the complex C being treated with excess fluorine (F₂), which is an extremely powerful fluorinating agent. This will fluorinate all elements in the complex to high oxidation states.\n    *   Iodine would be converted to IF₅ or IF₇.\n    *   The chlorine (from the ClF in the complex) would be converted to ClF₃ or ClF₅.\n    *   The product E is described as a single, extremely hazardous substance. All of these potential products are indeed extremely hazardous.\n    *   Notice that **ClF₃** is one of the possible products. We also identified **H = ClF₃**. It is plausible in this puzzle that E and H are the same substance, described in two different contexts (E as a hazardous product, H as a solvent). ClF₃ fits both descriptions.\n    *   Therefore, the most likely identity for **E is ClF₃**.\n\n**4. Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E**\n\n*   We have identified **E = ClF₃** (Chlorine trifluoride).\n*   To find its symmetry, we use VSEPR theory:\n    *   The central atom is Chlorine (Cl), which is in Group 17. It has 7 valence electrons.\n    *   It forms single bonds with 3 Fluorine atoms.\n    *   Number of lone pairs = (7 - 3) / 2 = 2 lone pairs.\n    *   Total electron domains = 3 bonding pairs + 2 lone pairs = 5.\n    *   The electron geometry for 5 domains is trigonal bipyramidal.\n    *   To minimize repulsion, the two lone pairs occupy the equatorial positions. The three fluorine atoms occupy the remaining two axial positions and one equatorial position.\n    *   This arrangement results in a **T-shaped** molecular geometry.\n*   A T-shaped molecule (like ClF₃) has the following symmetry elements:\n    *   A C₂ rotation axis that passes through the Cl atom and the equatorial F atom.\n    *   Two vertical mirror planes (σᵥ), one of which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n*   The set of symmetry elements {E, C₂, 2σᵥ} corresponds to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\n**5. Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe molecular symmetry group of E (ClF₃) is C₂ᵥ. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Decode the Chemical Reactions**\n\nThe problem is a chemical puzzle. We need to identify the compounds A through H to find the identity of the target molecule, E.\n\n*   **Clue 3: C + H₂O → A + F + G**\n    *   This is a hydrolysis reaction where product C reacts with water.\n    *   It reforms solid A, and produces a strong acid (F) and a weak acid (G).\n    *   The formation of a strong acid from a hydrolysis reaction often points to a hydrohalic acid like HCl. If F is HCl, then C must be a chloride compound, and gas B (from reaction 1) must be chlorine (Cl₂).\n    *   The reaction is a disproportionation, where the central element in C is both reduced (to form element A) and oxidized (to form the weak acid G).\n    *   Let's test this with sulfur. The hydrolysis of a sulfur chloride: 2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq).\n    *   This fits the description perfectly:\n        *   **C = SCl₂** (Sulfur dichloride)\n        *   **A = S** (Sulfur, a solid)\n        *   **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid, a strong acid)\n        *   **G = H₂SO₃** (Sulfurous acid, a weak acid, formed from SO₂ + H₂O)\n\n*   **Clue 1: Solid A + 8 equivalents of Gas B → Bright red product C**\n    *   Let's check if our assignments fit.\n    *   A = Sulfur. The stable solid form of sulfur is a crown-shaped ring, **S₈**. So, **A = S₈**.\n    *   B = Chlorine gas, **Cl₂**.\n    *   C = Sulfur dichloride, **SCl₂**. It is described as a cherry-red liquid, which matches \"bright red product\".\n    *   Let's check the stoichiometry: S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l).\n    *   This shows that 1 mole of A (S₈) reacts with 8 moles (equivalents) of B (Cl₂) to form 8 moles of C (SCl₂). This matches the clue perfectly.\n\n*   **Clue 4: D + B (1:1 ratio) → H (solvent)**\n    *   We know B = Cl₂. So, Gas D + Cl₂ → H (solvent).\n    *   Let's consider a common reaction that fits this. The reaction of ethene gas (C₂H₄) with chlorine gas (Cl₂) produces 1,2-dichloroethane (C₂H₄Cl₂), which is a common solvent.\n    *   C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l). This is a 1:1 reaction.\n    *   So, let's hypothesize:\n        *   **D = C₂H₄** (Ethene)\n        *   **H = C₂H₄Cl₂** (1,2-dichloroethane)\n\n*   **Clue 2: C + 2 equivalents of Gas D → Extremely hazardous product E**\n    *   Let's check our final assignments with this clue.\n    *   C = SCl₂\n    *   D = C₂H₄\n    *   The reaction is: SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E.\n    *   This is a known chemical reaction, the Levinstein process, used to synthesize bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide: SCl₂ + 2CH₂=CH₂ → (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S.\n    *   The product, **(ClCH₂CH₂)₂S**, is commonly known as **mustard gas**, a potent chemical warfare agent, which certainly qualifies as an \"extremely hazardous product\".\n    *   Therefore, **E = (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E**\n\nNow that we have identified E as mustard gas, (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S, we need to determine its molecular point group from the given options.\n\n*   **Molecule:** E = (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S\n*   **Structure:** It has a central sulfur atom bonded to two chloroethyl groups. The geometry around the sulfur atom is bent (similar to water), and there is free rotation around the single bonds (S-C and C-C).\n*   **Options:** A) C₂, B) D∞h, C) D4h, D) C₂v\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry of the molecule in a plausible conformation and evaluate the options:\n\n1.  **D∞h:** This point group is for linear molecules with a center of inversion, like CO₂ or H₂. Mustard gas is not linear. So, B is incorrect.\n2.  **D4h:** This point group describes molecules with high symmetry, such as a square planar shape (e.g., XeF₄). Mustard gas does not have this shape. So, C is incorrect.\n3.  **C₂v:** This point group requires a C₂ axis and two mirror planes containing the axis. For mustard gas to have C₂v symmetry, the entire S-C-C-Cl backbone of both chains would need to lie in a single plane. This would create significant steric hindrance and is a very high-energy, unstable conformation. So, D is incorrect.\n4.  **C₂:** This point group requires only a single C₂ (two-fold) rotational axis. Molecules of the type X(YR₂)₂ (like mustard gas or diethyl ether) can easily adopt a stable, low-energy conformation that possesses a C₂ axis. This axis would bisect the C-S-C angle. The two chloroethyl groups would be arranged as mirror images of each other after a 180° rotation, resulting in a chiral (twisted) structure. This is a very common and plausible conformation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy eliminating the other impossible or highly unlikely options, the most appropriate molecular symmetry group for mustard gas among the choices provided is C₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis is a classic chemical riddle that can be solved by systematically identifying the unknown compounds.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the most revealing clue.**\nReaction 3 is the key: `C + H₂O → A(s) + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)`.\nThe hydrolysis of compound `C` regenerates the solid starting material `A` and produces two different acids. This is a very specific type of reaction, characteristic of the hydrolysis of a complex gold salt.\n*   **A** is **Au** (Gold), a solid metal.\n*   The reaction that fits this description is the hydrolysis of dibrominefluoride tetrafluoroaurate(III): `3[BrF₂][AuF₄] + 10H₂O → 3Au(s) + 2HBrO₃(aq) + HBr(aq) + 24HF(aq)`.\n*   This reaction produces solid gold (**A**), a strong acid (**F**, HBrO₃, bromic acid), and a weak acid (**G**, HF, hydrofluoric acid).\n*   Therefore, the bright red product **C** is **[BrF₂]⁺[AuF₄]⁻**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the other reactants.**\n*   From Reaction 1, `A(s) + 8B(g) → C`, we know that gold (A) reacts with gas `B` to form `C`. The reactant that forms this complex is **B = BrF₃** (Bromine trifluoride). The 1:8 stoichiometry in the riddle is a known red herring; the actual reaction is `2Au + 3BrF₃ → [BrF₂]⁺[AuF₄]⁻ + Br₂`.\n*   From Reaction 2, `C + 2D(g) → E (extremely hazardous product)`, the powerful fluorinating agent `C` reacts with a gas `D`. A logical candidate for `D` is **CO** (Carbon monoxide).\n*   The reaction fluorinates carbon monoxide to produce **E = COF₂** (Carbonyl fluoride). Carbonyl fluoride is the fluorine analog of phosgene and is indeed an extremely hazardous gas, fitting the description perfectly.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the molecular symmetry of E.**\nNow we must find the molecular symmetry group for the product **E**, which we have identified as **COF₂** (Carbonyl fluoride).\n\n1.  **Molecular Structure:** The central atom is carbon. It is double-bonded to one oxygen atom and single-bonded to two fluorine atoms. According to VSEPR theory, the molecule has a trigonal planar geometry.\n\n    ```\n      O\n     //\n    C\n   / \\\n  F   F\n    ```\n\n2.  **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   **C₂ axis:** There is a two-fold axis of rotation that passes through the C=O bond. Rotating the molecule 180° around this axis leaves it unchanged.\n    *   **Two Mirror Planes (σᵥ):** There are two vertical mirror planes that contain the C₂ axis. One is the plane of the molecule itself, and the other is perpendicular to the molecular plane, bisecting the F-C-F angle.\n\n3.  **Point Group:** A molecule with one C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes containing that axis belongs to the **C₂v** point group.\n\nComparing this to the options provided:\nA) C₂\nB) C₂v\nC) D∞h\nD) D₄h\n\nThe correct molecular symmetry group for E (COF₂) is C₂v.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle and determine the molecular symmetry group of E.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues and Identify the Compounds**\n\nThe problem provides a series of chemical reactions. The key is to use the properties of the reactants and products to identify them one by one.\n\n*   **Clue 3: C + H₂O → A + F + G**\n    *   This is a hydrolysis reaction where the starting material A is reformed. This suggests a disproportionation reaction.\n    *   F is a strong acid, and G is a weak acid. A common and fitting pair of acids produced from the hydrolysis of a single compound is a strong hydrohalic acid (like HCl) and a weak oxoacid.\n    *   Let's hypothesize that F is hydrochloric acid (HCl, strong) and G is sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃, weak). H₂SO₃ is formed when SO₂ dissolves in water.\n    *   This hypothesis implies that compound C contains sulfur and chlorine.\n    *   The reaction would be: `[Sulfur Chloride Compound C] + H₂O → S (forms A) + SO₂ (forms G) + HCl (F)`.\n    *   This fits the description: A is regenerated (elemental sulfur), F is a strong acid (HCl), and G is a weak acid (H₂SO₃).\n\n*   **Clue 1: Solid A + 8 equivalents of gas B → Bright red product C**\n    *   Based on our hypothesis, A is elemental sulfur, which is a solid (typically as S₈). B would be chlorine gas (Cl₂). C is a sulfur chloride.\n    *   Let's check the stoichiometry: A = S₈, B = Cl₂.\n    *   The reaction is: `S₈ (solid) + 8 Cl₂ (gas) → 8 SCl₂`.\n    *   This reaction has a 1:8 molar ratio between A (S₈) and B (Cl₂), which perfectly matches the clue.\n    *   Furthermore, sulfur dichloride (SCl₂) is described as a cherry-red liquid, which matches the \"bright red product C\".\n    *   So, we can confidently identify:\n        *   **A = S₈ (Sulfur)**\n        *   **B = Cl₂ (Chlorine)**\n        *   **C = SCl₂ (Sulfur dichloride)**\n\n*   **Clue 4: D + B → H (1:1 ratio)**\n    *   We know B is chlorine gas (Cl₂). D is another gas, and H is a solvent.\n    *   `D (gas) + Cl₂ (gas) → H (solvent)`\n    *   A common reaction that fits this description is the addition of chlorine to an alkene. Let's test ethylene (C₂H₄) as gas D.\n    *   `C₂H₄ (gas) + Cl₂ (gas) → C₂H₄Cl₂ (liquid)`\n    *   The product, 1,2-dichloroethane (C₂H₄Cl₂), is a widely used solvent. This fits all parts of the clue.\n    *   So, we identify:\n        *   **D = C₂H₄ (Ethylene)**\n        *   **H = C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-dichloroethane)**\n\n*   **Clue 2: C + 2 equivalents of gas D → Extremely hazardous product E**\n    *   We have identified C = SCl₂ and D = C₂H₄.\n    *   The reaction is: `SCl₂ + 2 C₂H₄ → E`\n    *   This is a known reaction, the Levinstein process, which is used to produce bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide: `SCl₂ + 2 CH₂=CH₂ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   The product, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂, is commonly known as **mustard gas**, a potent chemical warfare agent. This certainly fits the description \"extremely hazardous product E\".\n    *   So, we identify:\n        *   **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂ (Mustard Gas)**\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E**\n\nNow that we have identified E as mustard gas, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂, we need to determine its point group.\n\n1.  **Molecular Structure:** The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two identical 2-chloroethyl groups (-CH₂CH₂Cl). Due to the two lone pairs on the sulfur atom, the C-S-C bond is bent, similar to the H-O-H bond in water.\n\n2.  **Conformation:** The molecule is flexible due to free rotation around the S-C and C-C single bonds. The overall symmetry depends on the specific, low-energy conformation the molecule adopts. We look for the most symmetric, plausible conformation.\n\n3.  **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   Let's try to find a C₂ axis. An axis passing through the S atom and bisecting the C-S-C angle can be a C₂ axis. If the two -CH₂CH₂Cl chains are arranged as identical \"propellers\" (i.e., they have the same set of dihedral angles), a 180° rotation around this axis will map the molecule onto itself. This is a very plausible conformation, analogous to the most stable conformer of diethyl ether.\n    *   Let's check for mirror planes (σ). A C₂v point group would require two mirror planes. One would have to contain the C-S-C atoms. For this to be a mirror plane, the rest of the chains must also lie in this plane, which would force an unfavorable eclipsed conformation. Therefore, there are no mirror planes.\n    *   Let's check for an inversion center (i). There is no point in the molecule through which inversion of all atoms results in an identical structure.\n    *   Since the molecule possesses a C₂ axis but lacks mirror planes or an inversion center, its point group is C₂.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The point group for the most symmetric stable conformer of mustard gas, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂, is C₂.\n\n**Final Answer Selection**\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) C₂\nB) D₄h\nC) C₂v\nD) D∞h\n\nOur derived point group is C₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

Let's deduce the identity of each compound step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 3:** \"C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\"\n    *   This hydrolysis reaction, which regenerates the starting material A (as an element) and produces two different acids, is very characteristic. A well-known example is the hydrolysis of sulfur chlorides.\n    *   Let's test the hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂): 2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂ + 4HCl.\n    *   In this reaction:\n        *   The solid product is elemental sulfur. Let's assume **A is Sulfur (S)**.\n        *   One acid produced is **HCl (Hydrochloric acid)**, which is a **strong acid (F)**.\n        *   The other product is SO₂, which dissolves in water to form **H₂SO₃ (Sulfurous acid)**, a **weak acid (G)**.\n    *   This perfectly matches the description. So, we can hypothesize:\n        *   **A = Sulfur (S)**\n        *   **C = SCl₂** (Sulfur dichloride, which is a cherry-red liquid, fitting the \"bright red product\" description).\n        *   **F = HCl**\n        *   **G = H₂SO₃**\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 1:** \"reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.\"\n    *   We have A = Sulfur and C = SCl₂. The reaction is the formation of SCl₂ from sulfur. This requires chlorine. So, gas **B must be Chlorine (Cl₂)**.\n    *   The standard reaction is S + Cl₂ → SCl₂. This is a 1:1 ratio. However, the clue specifies \"8 equivalents\".\n    *   We must consider the stable allotrope of sulfur at standard conditions, which is a solid crown-shaped ring, **S₈**.\n    *   Let's write the reaction with A = S₈: **S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)**.\n    *   In this balanced equation, 1 mole of solid A (S₈) reacts with 8 moles of gas B (Cl₂). This matches the \"8 equivalents\" stoichiometry perfectly.\n    *   So, **A = S₈** and **B = Cl₂**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clue 4:** \"D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\"\n    *   We know B = Cl₂. So, gas D reacts with Cl₂ in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent H.\n    *   A common reaction is the addition of chlorine to ethylene: **C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)**.\n    *   The product, 1,2-dichloroethane, is a widely used solvent.\n    *   This fits the clue. So, we can identify:\n        *   **D = C₂H₄ (Ethene/Ethylene)**\n        *   **H = C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-dichloroethane)**\n\n4.  **Analyze Clue 2:** \"When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\"\n    *   We have C = SCl₂ and D = C₂H₄.\n    *   The reaction is: **SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S**.\n    *   This is the Levinstein process for the synthesis of **bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide**, commonly known as **Mustard Gas**. Mustard gas is an infamous chemical warfare agent and is extremely hazardous.\n    *   This confirms our identification of **E = (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S (Mustard Gas)**.\n\n**Summary of Identities:**\n*   A = S₈ (Sulfur)\n*   B = Cl₂ (Chlorine)\n*   C = SCl₂ (Sulfur dichloride)\n*   D = C₂H₄ (Ethene)\n*   E = (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S (Mustard Gas)\n*   F = HCl (Hydrochloric acid)\n*   G = H₂SO₃ (Sulfurous acid)\n*   H = C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-dichloroethane)\n\n**Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E:**\nThe final question is to find the molecular symmetry group (point group) of E, mustard gas, (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S.\n\nThe molecule's shape is determined by the geometry around the central sulfur atom and the conformation of the two ethyl chloride chains. The point group corresponds to the symmetry of the molecule's most stable conformation.\n\n*   The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two -CH₂CH₂Cl chains.\n*   The molecule is not linear (ruling out D∞h).\n*   It is not highly symmetric like a square planar molecule (ruling out D4h).\n*   The most stable conformation of mustard gas, as determined by computational chemistry and experimental data, possesses a single symmetry element: a two-fold axis of rotation (C₂) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle. In this conformation, a 180° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n*   This conformation does not have any mirror planes (σ). The presence of a C₂ axis and a vertical mirror plane (σv) would result in a C2v point group. However, due to the staggered nature of the ethyl groups to minimize steric hindrance, no such mirror planes exist in the lowest-energy structure.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E (mustard gas) is **C₂**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown compounds and determine the molecular symmetry of product E.\n\n1.  **Identify gases B and D, and solvent H:** The reaction D(g) + B(g) → H (solvent) in a 1:1 ratio is a strong clue. A well-known reaction that fits this description is the formation of phosgene from carbon monoxide and chlorine gas: CO(g) + Cl₂(g) → COCl₂(l). Phosgene (COCl₂) is an extremely hazardous substance used as a solvent and reagent in industry. Therefore, we can identify:\n    *   **B = Cl₂** (Chlorine gas)\n    *   **D = CO** (Carbon monoxide)\n    *   **H = COCl₂** (Phosgene, also known as carbonyl chloride)\n\n2.  **Identify acids F and G:** The reaction of C with water reforms A and produces a strong acid (F) and a weak acid (G). Since C is formed from a reaction involving chlorine (B), the strong acid F is almost certainly hydrochloric acid (HCl). The formation of two distinct acids from the hydrolysis of a substance made only from A and chlorine is unusual. However, if C is a complex where chlorine molecules are trapped and then released into water, the dissolved chlorine will hydrolyze: Cl₂ + H₂O ⇌ HCl (strong acid) + HClO (hypochlorous acid, a weak acid). This perfectly matches the description. Thus:\n    *   **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid)\n    *   **G = HClO** (Hypochlorous acid)\n\n3.  **Identify solid A and product C:** The hydrolysis reaction C + H₂O → A + HCl + HClO implies that A is a solid host material that traps chlorine gas to form C, and this host is reformed (unchanged) when the chlorine is released in water. The stoichiometry A(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → C suggests that one mole of A can trap eight moles of chlorine. A plausible candidate for A is Buckminsterfullerene (C₆₀), a solid which can form clathrates or charge-transfer complexes with guest molecules. The resulting complex, C, would be C₆₀·8Cl₂. While C₆₀ is black, its complexes can be colored, so it is plausible that C is \"bright red\".\n    *   **A = C₆₀** (Buckminsterfullerene)\n    *   **C = C₆₀·8Cl₂** (A fullerene-chlorine complex)\n\n4.  **Identify the extremely hazardous product E:** Product E is formed when C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D.\n    *   C(C₆₀·8Cl₂) + 2D(2CO) → E\n    The reaction involves the trapped chlorine in C reacting with carbon monoxide. The most direct reaction is the formation of phosgene: 2CO + 2Cl₂ → 2COCl₂. The overall reaction would be C₆₀·8Cl₂ + 2CO → C₆₀ + 6Cl₂ + 2COCl₂. The product E, described as \"extremely hazardous,\" is phosgene (COCl₂).\n    *   **E = COCl₂** (Phosgene)\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E:** Now we must find the molecular symmetry group for phosgene (COCl₂). The molecule has a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms. Its structure is trigonal planar.\n    *   The molecule possesses a C₂ rotation axis that passes through the C=O bond.\n    *   It has two vertical mirror planes (σv). One is the plane containing all the atoms, and the other is perpendicular to the molecular plane, bisecting the Cl-C-Cl angle.\n    *   A molecule with a C₂ axis and two vertical mirror planes belongs to the **C₂v** point group. This is a common point group for molecules like water (H₂O) and formaldehyde (H₂CO).\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E (phosgene) is C₂v.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve this chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify the compounds**: I will deduce the chemical identities of the substances labeled A through H by analyzing the described reactions one by one. The key is to find a consistent set of compounds that fits all the clues.\n2.  **Start with the clearest clues**: The reaction `D + B -> H` (where H is a solvent) and the hydrolysis reaction `C + H₂O -> A + F + G` are the most informative starting points.\n3.  **Formulate a hypothesis**: Based on common chemical reactions, I'll propose identities for the compounds. For instance, `B = Cl₂` (chlorine gas) is a good starting assumption.\n4.  **Test the hypothesis**: I will check if the proposed set of compounds is consistent with all the given information, including physical states (solid, gas), color (bright red), and properties (strong/weak acid, hazardous product).\n5.  **Identify Compound E**: Once the identities of C and D are established, I can determine the product E from the reaction `C + 2D -> E`.\n6.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry**: After identifying the chemical structure of the hazardous product E, I will determine its molecular geometry and the corresponding point group (molecular symmetry group).\n7.  **Select the Final Answer**: I will match the determined point group with the given options (A, B, C, D).\n\n**Execution of the plan:**\n\n*   **Clue 4: `D (gas) + B (gas) -> H (solvent)`**\n    Let's assume `B` is chlorine (`Cl₂`). A common reaction is the addition of chlorine to ethene (`C₂H₄`).\n    `C₂H₄ (g) + Cl₂ (g) -> C₂H₄Cl₂ (l)`\n    Here, `D = C₂H₄` (ethene), `B = Cl₂` (chlorine), and `H = C₂H₄Cl₂` (1,2-dichloroethane), which is a common solvent. This is a very strong fit.\n\n*   **Clue 3: `C + H₂O -> A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)`**\n    This is a hydrolysis reaction where `C` disproportionates to reform `A`. This suggests `A` is an element. If `B` is `Cl₂`, then `C` is likely a chloride. The formation of a strong acid `F` points to `HCl`.\n    Let's test sulfur chlorides. The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (`SCl₂`) is:\n    `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O -> S + SO₂ + 4HCl`\n    In this reaction:\n    *   `A` is elemental sulfur (`S`), a solid.\n    *   `F` is hydrochloric acid (`HCl`), a strong acid.\n    *   `G` is sulfurous acid (`H₂SO₃`), a weak acid formed when `SO₂` dissolves in water.\n    This fits the description perfectly. So, we can identify `C = SCl₂`.\n\n*   **Clue 1: `solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C`**\n    This would be `S (s) + 8Cl₂ (g) -> SCl₂ (bright red)`. Sulfur dichloride (`SCl₂`) is indeed a cherry-red liquid. However, the stoichiometry is incorrect (the actual reaction is `S + Cl₂ -> SCl₂`). Given that all other clues fit so well, we will assume the \"8 equivalents\" is an error in the problem statement.\n\n*   **Clue 2: `C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E`**\n    Using our identified compounds:\n    `SCl₂ (C) + 2C₂H₄ (D) -> E`\n    This is the well-known Levinstein process for synthesizing **mustard gas**, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ -> S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`\n    Mustard gas is an extremely hazardous chemical warfare agent. Thus, `E` is mustard gas.\n\n*   **Final Step: Determine the molecular symmetry group of E (Mustard Gas)**\n    The molecule `E` is mustard gas, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   The central sulfur atom is bonded to two `-CH₂CH₂Cl` groups and has two lone pairs, resulting in a bent geometry around the sulfur.\n    *   The molecule is not planar due to rotations around the single bonds.\n    *   The most stable conformation of the molecule is chiral (lacks any mirror planes or an inversion center) but possesses a two-fold rotational axis (`C₂`) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle.\n    *   A molecule whose only symmetry element (besides identity) is a `C₂` axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\nComparing this to the options:\nA) D4h\nB) C2v\nC) C2\nD) D∞h\n\nThe correct molecular symmetry group is C₂.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Identify the compounds based on the chemical clues.\n# A = S (Sulfur)\n# B = Cl₂ (Chlorine)\n# C = SCl₂ (Sulfur dichloride)\n# D = C₂H₄ (Ethene)\n# E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂ (Mustard gas)\n# F = HCl (Hydrochloric acid)\n# G = H₂SO₃ (Sulfurous acid)\n# H = C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-dichloroethane)\n\n# Step 2: Determine the molecular symmetry group of compound E (Mustard Gas).\n# Mustard gas, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂, has a bent structure at the sulfur atom.\n# Due to the arrangement of the ethyl chloride chains, the molecule is not planar and lacks mirror planes.\n# Its most stable conformation possesses a C₂ rotational axis.\n# A molecule with only identity (E) and a C₂ axis belongs to the C₂ point group.\n\n# Step 3: Match the result with the given options.\n# A) D4h\n# B) C2v\n# C) C2\n# D) D∞h\n# The correct option is C.\n\nfinal_choice = 'C'\nprint(f\"The molecular symmetry group of E (mustard gas) is C2.\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the correct option is {final_choice}.\")\n```\n<<<C>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The molecular symmetry group of E (mustard gas) is C2.\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical puzzle to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the clues provided.**\n\n*   **Clue 1:** solid A + 8 gas B → bright red product C\n*   **Clue 2:** C + 2 gas D → extremely hazardous product E\n*   **Clue 3:** C + H₂O → solid A + strong acid F + weak acid G\n*   **Clue 4:** gas D + gas B → solvent H (in a 1:1 ratio)\n\n**Step 2: Identify the most restrictive clue.**\n\nClue 3 is the most chemically specific and restrictive clue. The hydrolysis of C regenerates the starting material A and produces two different acids, one strong (F) and one weak (G). This suggests that the ligands in C (which come from gas B) undergo hydrolysis or disproportionation. The regeneration of A suggests it is a relatively noble element that is resistant to oxidation by water or the acids formed.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate a hypothesis based on Clue 3.**\n\nWe need to find a substance (derived from gas B) that hydrolyzes to produce a strong acid and a weak acid.\n*   Let's consider interhalogens. The gas Bromine monochloride (BrCl) hydrolyzes in water:\n    BrCl + H₂O → HCl + HOBr\n*   In this reaction, Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a strong acid (F), and Hypobromous acid (HOBr) is a weak acid (G). This is a perfect fit for the products described in Clue 3.\n*   Therefore, we can hypothesize:\n    *   **B = BrCl** (Bromine monochloride, a reddish-brown gas)\n    *   **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid)\n    *   **G = HOBr** (Hypobromous acid)\n\n**Step 4: Use the hypothesis to identify other substances.**\n\n*   **Identify A and C (Clue 1 & 3):**\n    *   Since C hydrolyzes to regenerate A, A is likely a noble metal that can be reduced back to its elemental form from a complex. Gold (Au) is a good candidate.\n    *   A = **Au** (Gold, a solid).\n    *   Gold reacts with halogens to form colored complexes. Gold(III) halides like AuCl₃ and AuBr₃ are red. So, C is a red gold(III) bromo-chloro complex.\n    *   C = **Au₂(Br,Cl)₆** (a simplified representation of a red gold halide complex).\n    *   The 1:8 stoichiometry in Clue 1 is a known difficulty in this classic puzzle and is likely a simplification.\n\n*   **Identify D and H (Clue 4):**\n    *   We have D(g) + B(g) → H(solvent) in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   With B = BrCl, we have D(g) + BrCl(g) → H(solvent).\n    *   Let's test a plausible gas for D. If D is Carbon Monoxide (CO), the reaction is:\n        CO + BrCl → BrCOCl (Carbonyl bromochloride)\n    *   BrCOCl is a liquid and can be used as a solvent. This reaction fits the 1:1 stoichiometry.\n    *   So, we can hypothesize:\n        *   **D = CO** (Carbon Monoxide)\n        *   **H = BrCOCl** (Carbonyl bromochloride)\n\n**Step 5: Identify the extremely hazardous product E (Clue 2).**\n\n*   We have C + 2D → E.\n*   Substituting our identified substances: Gold halide complex (C) + 2CO (D) → E.\n*   There is a known reaction where gold(III) chloride oxidizes carbon monoxide to phosgene:\n    Au₂Cl₆ + 2CO → Au₂Cl₄ + 2COCl₂\n*   This reaction produces Phosgene (COCl₂), which is an extremely hazardous chemical warfare agent. The stoichiometry also matches.\n*   Therefore, we can confidently identify E:\n    *   **E = COCl₂** (Phosgene)\n\n**Step 6: Determine the molecular symmetry group of E.**\n\n*   The molecule E is phosgene, COCl₂.\n*   Let's analyze its structure and symmetry elements:\n    *   The molecule is planar.\n    *   It has one two-fold rotation axis (C₂) that passes through the C=O bond.\n    *   It has two mirror planes (σᵥ). One plane is the plane of the molecule itself. The other is perpendicular to the molecular plane and bisects the Cl-C-Cl angle.\n*   A molecule with one C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe step-by-step analysis leads to the identification of E as phosgene (COCl₂), which has a molecular symmetry of C₂ᵥ. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis is a classic chemical puzzle that can be solved by systematically identifying each unknown substance (A through H) based on the described reactions.\n\n1.  **Identifying Gases B and D, and Solvent H:** The reaction where gas D and gas B react in a 1:1 ratio to form solvent H is a strong starting point. A well-known reaction that fits this description is the formation of phosgene (COCl₂) from carbon monoxide (CO) and chlorine (Cl₂). Phosgene is a toxic gas but is used as a solvent in some industrial applications. Another possibility is the reaction of sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and chlorine (Cl₂) to form sulfuryl chloride (SO₂Cl₂), which is also a solvent.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Acids F and G:** The hydrolysis of product C reforms solid A and produces a strong acid (F) and a weak acid (G). This indicates that the ligands on C (which come from gas B) are responsible for forming the acids.\n    *   If B were CO, its hydrolysis would not produce acids.\n    *   If B were Cl₂, its hydrolysis (Cl₂ + H₂O ⇌ HCl + HOCl) produces hydrochloric acid (HCl), which is a strong acid, and hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which is a weak acid. This perfectly matches the description.\n\n3.  **Confirming the Identities of A, B, C, D, and H:**\n    *   Based on the hydrolysis, **B** must be **chlorine gas (Cl₂) **, **F** is **hydrochloric acid (HCl)**, and **G** is **hypochlorous acid (HOCl)**.\n    *   Since B is Cl₂, and it reacts 1:1 with D to form a solvent, D is most likely **carbon monoxide (CO)**, making the solvent H **phosgene (COCl₂)**.\n    *   Now we must identify A and C. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B (Cl₂) to form the bright red product C. A known, though somewhat obscure, reaction fits this stoichiometry: solid iodine (I₂) reacts with excess chlorine.\n    *   Therefore, **A** is **Iodine (I₂) **.\n    *   The reaction is I₂(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 2[ICl₂]⁺[Cl₃]⁻. The product, a complex of iodine and chlorine, can be described as a bright red or orange-yellow solid. So, **C** is the **iodine-chlorine complex, 2[ICl₂]⁺[Cl₃]⁻**.\n    *   The hydrolysis of this complex (C) reforms iodine (A) and produces HCl (F) and HOCl (G), which is consistent with all observations.\n\n4.  **Identifying Product E and its Symmetry:**\n    *   Product C (the iodine-chlorine complex) reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D (CO) to produce the extremely hazardous product E.\n    *   The reaction is: 2[ICl₂]⁺[Cl₃]⁻ (C) + 2CO (D) → 2ICl₃ + 2COCl₂ (E).\n    *   The extremely hazardous product **E** is **phosgene (COCl₂)**. Phosgene is listed as an extremely hazardous substance.\n    *   The final step is to determine the molecular symmetry group of phosgene. The molecule has a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms. It is a planar molecule.\n    *   It possesses a C₂ rotation axis along the C=O bond.\n    *   It has two vertical mirror planes (one containing the molecule and one perpendicular to it).\n    *   A molecule with a C₂ axis and two vertical mirror planes belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E (phosgene) is C₂ᵥ.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis is a classic, albeit complex, chemical puzzle that requires identifying a series of unknown substances based on their reactions. The final goal is to determine the molecular symmetry of product E. Through a step-by-step deduction process, we can identify all the compounds involved.\n\n1.  **Identifying Gases B and D, and Solvent H:** The reaction where two gases, B and D, react in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent (H) is a strong starting point. A well-known reaction that fits this description is the formation of sulfuryl chloride (SO₂Cl₂) from sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and chlorine (Cl₂), both of which are gases. SO₂Cl₂ is a liquid used as a solvent.\n    *   B and D are SO₂ and Cl₂ in some order.\n    *   H is SO₂Cl₂.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Acids F and G and Gas B:** The hydrolysis of product C reforms the starting solid A and produces a strong acid (F) and a weak acid (G). This indicates that the ligands on C (which come from gas B) hydrolyze to form these two acids. If we consider the hydrolysis of chlorine gas (Cl₂), it produces hydrochloric acid (HCl), a strong acid, and hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a weak acid. This perfectly matches the description.\n    *   Cl₂(g) + H₂O(l) ⇌ HCl(aq) + HOCl(aq)\n    *   Therefore, gas **B must be Cl₂**.\n    *   This implies **gas D is SO₂**.\n    *   The strong acid **F is HCl**, and the weak acid **G is HOCl**.\n\n3.  **Identifying Solid A and Product C:** Now we know that solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of chlorine gas (B) to form a bright red product (C). The hydrolysis of C reforms A, suggesting that C is an adduct where A is a carrier for chlorine. The reaction is A(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → C(red). A known solid that forms a bright red adduct with chlorine is **cesium ozonide (CsO₃)**. While this is an obscure compound, it fits the description. The reaction forms CsCl and releases oxygen and chlorine, but in the context of this puzzle, we'll consider the formation of a complex adduct. Let's assume A is a substance that can form a red polychloride adduct. For the purpose of this puzzle, we will denote C as A·(Cl₂)₈.\n\n4.  **Identifying Product E and its Symmetry:** The final step is the reaction of C with 2 equivalents of gas D (SO₂) to form the extremely hazardous product E.\n    *   C + 2D → E\n    *   A·(Cl₂)₈ + 2SO₂ → E\n    Assuming A is a catalyst or carrier, the reaction is effectively between the chlorine and sulfur dioxide: 8Cl₂ + 2SO₂ → E. A plausible reaction is the formation of two molecules of sulfuryl chloride (2SO₂Cl₂), which would consume 2 SO₂ and 2 Cl₂ molecules. However, the problem describes the formation of a single product E. A more fitting, albeit less common, product is the compound **pyrosulfuryl chloride (S₂O₅Cl₂)**. The reaction would be 2SO₂ + Cl₂ → S₂O₅Cl₂. This doesn't match the stoichiometry given.\n\nLet's reconsider the puzzle, as it is known to be a modified version of a classic problem. The inconsistencies suggest we should look for a known hazardous molecule with one of the given symmetries. The D4h point group is highly specific. A well-known example of a molecule with D4h symmetry is **Xenon Tetrafluoride (XeF₄)**. It is a hazardous material as it is a powerful fluorinating agent. If we assume E is XeF₄, we can see if the other clues can be made to fit, even if imperfectly, which is common in such puzzles.\n\n*   **E = XeF₄** (Symmetry D4h).\n*   Formation: C + 2D → XeF₄. The synthesis is Xe + 2F₂ → XeF₄.\n*   This implies **D = F₂** and **C contains Xe**.\n*   C is a \"bright red product\". A known reddish-orange xenon compound is **XePtF₆**. Let's assume this is C.\n*   C is formed from A + 8B. XePtF₆ is formed from Xe + PtF₆. This would make **A = PtF₆** (a red solid) and **B = Xe** (a gas). The 1:8 stoichiometry does not fit, a common issue with this puzzle's various versions.\n*   D + B → H (solvent). F₂ + Xe → H. Xenon difluoride (XeF₂) can be used as a solvent in some applications.\n*   C + H₂O → A + F + G. The hydrolysis of XePtF₆ is complex and does not reform PtF₆, yielding platinum oxides and hydrofluoric acid (HF), a weak acid. This clue does not fit well.\n\nDespite the numerous inconsistencies in the puzzle's description, the question asks for the molecular symmetry group of E. Given that such puzzles often hinge on identifying a key, unique molecule, and that XeF₄ is a classic example of a hazardous molecule with the rare D4h symmetry, it stands as the most probable intended answer for E.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis chemical riddle presents a series of reactions to identify several unknown substances, culminating in determining the molecular symmetry of product E. A step-by-step deduction based on the provided chemical reactions and properties is required.\n\nFirst, let's identify the substances involved:\n\n*   **Reaction 3: C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)**: This hydrolysis reaction is a key clue. The fact that product C reacts with water to reform the initial solid reactant A, along with two different acids (one strong, one weak), strongly suggests that C is a salt where part of it hydrolyzes. The formation of a strong and a weak acid is characteristic of the hydrolysis of certain non-metal halides, particularly those of phosphorus. For instance, phosphorus pentachloride (PCl₅) hydrolyzes to produce phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄, a weak acid) and hydrochloric acid (HCl, a strong acid).\n\n*   **Reaction 4: D + B (1:1 ratio) → H (solvent)**: This describes a simple addition reaction between two gases, B and D, to form a solvent, H.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Solid A + 8 equivalents of gas B → Bright red product C**: This reaction describes the formation of C. While many inorganic compounds can be red, the stoichiometry and other clues must align.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: C + 2 equivalents of gas D → Extremely hazardous product E**: This reaction forms the final product of interest, E, which is described as \"extremely hazardous.\"\n\nLet's try to piece together the identities. If we assume the hydrolysis clue points to phosphorus and chlorine chemistry, we can propose:\n*   **B = Cl₂** (Chlorine, a gas)\n*   **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid, a strong acid)\n*   **G = H₃PO₄** (Phosphoric acid, a weak acid)\n*   **C** is a phosphorus chloride compound.\n\nNow, let's identify D and H using Reaction 4:\n*   If B is Cl₂ and D is a gas that reacts in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent, a very strong candidate for D is carbon monoxide (CO).\n*   **D = CO** (Carbon monoxide, a gas)\n*   **H = COCl₂** (Phosgene), which is formed from CO + Cl₂ → COCl₂. Phosgene is a liquid at room temperature (boiling point 8.3 °C) and is used as a solvent and reagent.\n\nFinally, we can identify the extremely hazardous product E from Reaction 2:\n*   **C + 2D → E**\n*   If C is a phosphorus chloride and D is CO, we must find a reaction that produces E. A known reaction is the reaction of phosphorus pentachloride (PCl₅) with carbon monoxide. While the stoichiometry can vary, a key product of this reaction is phosgene (COCl₂).\n*   Given that H is also phosgene, and E is described as extremely hazardous (a primary characteristic of phosgene), it is highly probable that **E is phosgene (COCl₂)**. The riddle likely contains some inconsistencies, a common trait in such puzzles, but the chemical signposts point strongly toward this conclusion.\n\nNow, we determine the molecular symmetry group of E (phosgene, COCl₂).\nPhosgene has a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms. The molecule is planar. Its structure gives it the following symmetry elements:\n1.  A two-fold rotational axis (C₂) passing through the C=O bond.\n2.  A mirror plane (σᵥ) that contains all the atoms (the molecular plane).\n3.  A second mirror plane (σᵥ') that is perpendicular to the molecular plane and bisects the Cl-C-Cl angle.\n\nA molecule with a C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of the extremely hazardous product E (phosgene) is C₂ᵥ.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Clues**\n\n*   **Clue 1:** solid A + 8 gas B → bright red product C\n*   **Clue 2:** C + 2 gas D → extremely hazardous product E\n*   **Clue 3:** C + H₂O → A + acid F (strong) + acid G (weak)\n*   **Clue 4:** D + B (1:1 ratio) → H (solvent)\n*   **Question:** What is the molecular symmetry group of E? The options are A) D4h, B) D∞h, C) C2, D) C2v.\n\n**2. Analyze the Most Chemically Specific Clues**\n\n*   **Clue 3 is the most revealing.** A compound C hydrolyzes to regenerate the starting material A and produce two different acids, one strong (F) and one weak (G).\n    *   The regeneration of A suggests A is an element.\n    *   The formation of two different acids from the hydrolysis of a substance (C) made from A and B implies that B must contain the atoms necessary for both acids.\n    *   A common strong acid is HCl. A common weak acid is HF. This suggests that the elements Chlorine (Cl) and Fluorine (F) are involved.\n    *   Let's hypothesize: **F = HCl (strong acid)** and **G = HF (weak acid)**.\n    *   This implies that gas B must be a chlorine-fluorine compound (an interhalogen).\n\n*   **Clue 4 provides a relationship between B, D, and H.**\n    *   D + B → H (solvent).\n    *   If B is an interhalogen like ClF, what gas D could react with it in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent H?\n    *   Let's test **B = ClF** (Chlorine monofluoride, a gas).\n    *   Let's test **D = F₂** (Fluorine, a gas).\n    *   The reaction is: F₂(g) + ClF(g) → ClF₃(l).\n    *   This reaction is stoichiometrically 1:1.\n    *   The product, **H = ClF₃** (Chlorine trifluoride), is a liquid at standard pressure below 12 °C and is used as a powerful fluorinating agent (a reactive solvent).\n    *   This set of identities (B=ClF, D=F₂, H=ClF₃) is chemically sound and fits Clue 4 perfectly.\n\n**3. Build the Full Story with the Identified Chemicals**\n\nNow we can propose identities for all the substances:\n*   **B = ClF** (gas)\n*   **D = F₂** (gas)\n*   **H = ClF₃** (solvent)\n*   **F = HCl** (strong acid)\n*   **G = HF** (weak acid)\n\nLet's verify these against the remaining clues.\n\n*   **Clue 1 & 3: The identity of A and C.**\n    *   We need a solid element A that reacts with ClF (B) to form a bright red product C.\n    *   And C must hydrolyze back to A, HCl, and HF.\n    *   Let's test **A = I₂** (Iodine). It is a solid element.\n    *   **Clue 1:** I₂(s) + ClF(g) → C. Iodine reacts with interhalogens to form complexes or other interhalogens (like ICl). Let's assume a bright red complex C is formed. (Note: Puzzles of this type often take liberties with color or stoichiometry. The 1:8 ratio is likely a distractor, as it's not common).\n    *   **Clue 3:** C (Iodine/Chlorine/Fluorine complex) + H₂O → I₂(s) + HCl(aq) + HF(aq). This is chemically very plausible. The complex would break down in water, regenerating the elemental iodine (A) and hydrolyzing the Cl and F components to their respective acids (F and G).\n\n*   **Clue 2: The identity of E.**\n    *   C + 2D → E\n    *   Substituting our identified substances: C (Iodine/Chlorine/Fluorine complex) + 2F₂(g) → E.\n    *   The reaction involves the complex C being treated with excess fluorine (F₂), which is an extremely powerful fluorinating agent. This will fluorinate all elements in the complex to high oxidation states.\n    *   Iodine would be converted to IF₅ or IF₇.\n    *   The chlorine (from the ClF in the complex) would be converted to ClF₃ or ClF₅.\n    *   The product E is described as a single, extremely hazardous substance. All of these potential products are indeed extremely hazardous.\n    *   Notice that **ClF₃** is one of the possible products. We also identified **H = ClF₃**. It is plausible in this puzzle that E and H are the same substance, described in two different contexts (E as a hazardous product, H as a solvent). ClF₃ fits both descriptions.\n    *   Therefore, the most likely identity for **E is ClF₃**.\n\n**4. Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E**\n\n*   We have identified **E = ClF₃** (Chlorine trifluoride).\n*   To find its symmetry, we use VSEPR theory:\n    *   The central atom is Chlorine (Cl), which is in Group 17. It has 7 valence electrons.\n    *   It forms single bonds with 3 Fluorine atoms.\n    *   Number of lone pairs = (7 - 3) / 2 = 2 lone pairs.\n    *   Total electron domains = 3 bonding pairs + 2 lone pairs = 5.\n    *   The electron geometry for 5 domains is trigonal bipyramidal.\n    *   To minimize repulsion, the two lone pairs occupy the equatorial positions. The three fluorine atoms occupy the remaining two axial positions and one equatorial position.\n    *   This arrangement results in a **T-shaped** molecular geometry.\n*   A T-shaped molecule (like ClF₃) has the following symmetry elements:\n    *   A C₂ rotation axis that passes through the Cl atom and the equatorial F atom.\n    *   Two vertical mirror planes (σᵥ), one of which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n*   The set of symmetry elements {E, C₂, 2σᵥ} corresponds to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\n**5. Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe molecular symmetry group of E (ClF₃) is C₂ᵥ. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Decode the Chemical Reactions**\n\nThe problem is a chemical puzzle. We need to identify the compounds A through H to find the identity of the target molecule, E.\n\n*   **Clue 3: C + H₂O → A + F + G**\n    *   This is a hydrolysis reaction where product C reacts with water.\n    *   It reforms solid A, and produces a strong acid (F) and a weak acid (G).\n    *   The formation of a strong acid from a hydrolysis reaction often points to a hydrohalic acid like HCl. If F is HCl, then C must be a chloride compound, and gas B (from reaction 1) must be chlorine (Cl₂).\n    *   The reaction is a disproportionation, where the central element in C is both reduced (to form element A) and oxidized (to form the weak acid G).\n    *   Let's test this with sulfur. The hydrolysis of a sulfur chloride: 2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq).\n    *   This fits the description perfectly:\n        *   **C = SCl₂** (Sulfur dichloride)\n        *   **A = S** (Sulfur, a solid)\n        *   **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid, a strong acid)\n        *   **G = H₂SO₃** (Sulfurous acid, a weak acid, formed from SO₂ + H₂O)\n\n*   **Clue 1: Solid A + 8 equivalents of Gas B → Bright red product C**\n    *   Let's check if our assignments fit.\n    *   A = Sulfur. The stable solid form of sulfur is a crown-shaped ring, **S₈**. So, **A = S₈**.\n    *   B = Chlorine gas, **Cl₂**.\n    *   C = Sulfur dichloride, **SCl₂**. It is described as a cherry-red liquid, which matches \"bright red product\".\n    *   Let's check the stoichiometry: S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l).\n    *   This shows that 1 mole of A (S₈) reacts with 8 moles (equivalents) of B (Cl₂) to form 8 moles of C (SCl₂). This matches the clue perfectly.\n\n*   **Clue 4: D + B (1:1 ratio) → H (solvent)**\n    *   We know B = Cl₂. So, Gas D + Cl₂ → H (solvent).\n    *   Let's consider a common reaction that fits this. The reaction of ethene gas (C₂H₄) with chlorine gas (Cl₂) produces 1,2-dichloroethane (C₂H₄Cl₂), which is a common solvent.\n    *   C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l). This is a 1:1 reaction.\n    *   So, let's hypothesize:\n        *   **D = C₂H₄** (Ethene)\n        *   **H = C₂H₄Cl₂** (1,2-dichloroethane)\n\n*   **Clue 2: C + 2 equivalents of Gas D → Extremely hazardous product E**\n    *   Let's check our final assignments with this clue.\n    *   C = SCl₂\n    *   D = C₂H₄\n    *   The reaction is: SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E.\n    *   This is a known chemical reaction, the Levinstein process, used to synthesize bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide: SCl₂ + 2CH₂=CH₂ → (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S.\n    *   The product, **(ClCH₂CH₂)₂S**, is commonly known as **mustard gas**, a potent chemical warfare agent, which certainly qualifies as an \"extremely hazardous product\".\n    *   Therefore, **E = (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E**\n\nNow that we have identified E as mustard gas, (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S, we need to determine its molecular point group from the given options.\n\n*   **Molecule:** E = (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S\n*   **Structure:** It has a central sulfur atom bonded to two chloroethyl groups. The geometry around the sulfur atom is bent (similar to water), and there is free rotation around the single bonds (S-C and C-C).\n*   **Options:** A) C₂, B) D∞h, C) D4h, D) C₂v\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry of the molecule in a plausible conformation and evaluate the options:\n\n1.  **D∞h:** This point group is for linear molecules with a center of inversion, like CO₂ or H₂. Mustard gas is not linear. So, B is incorrect.\n2.  **D4h:** This point group describes molecules with high symmetry, such as a square planar shape (e.g., XeF₄). Mustard gas does not have this shape. So, C is incorrect.\n3.  **C₂v:** This point group requires a C₂ axis and two mirror planes containing the axis. For mustard gas to have C₂v symmetry, the entire S-C-C-Cl backbone of both chains would need to lie in a single plane. This would create significant steric hindrance and is a very high-energy, unstable conformation. So, D is incorrect.\n4.  **C₂:** This point group requires only a single C₂ (two-fold) rotational axis. Molecules of the type X(YR₂)₂ (like mustard gas or diethyl ether) can easily adopt a stable, low-energy conformation that possesses a C₂ axis. This axis would bisect the C-S-C angle. The two chloroethyl groups would be arranged as mirror images of each other after a 180° rotation, resulting in a chiral (twisted) structure. This is a very common and plausible conformation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy eliminating the other impossible or highly unlikely options, the most appropriate molecular symmetry group for mustard gas among the choices provided is C₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis is a classic chemical riddle that can be solved by systematically identifying the unknown compounds.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the most revealing clue.**\nReaction 3 is the key: `C + H₂O → A(s) + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)`.\nThe hydrolysis of compound `C` regenerates the solid starting material `A` and produces two different acids. This is a very specific type of reaction, characteristic of the hydrolysis of a complex gold salt.\n*   **A** is **Au** (Gold), a solid metal.\n*   The reaction that fits this description is the hydrolysis of dibrominefluoride tetrafluoroaurate(III): `3[BrF₂][AuF₄] + 10H₂O → 3Au(s) + 2HBrO₃(aq) + HBr(aq) + 24HF(aq)`.\n*   This reaction produces solid gold (**A**), a strong acid (**F**, HBrO₃, bromic acid), and a weak acid (**G**, HF, hydrofluoric acid).\n*   Therefore, the bright red product **C** is **[BrF₂]⁺[AuF₄]⁻**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the other reactants.**\n*   From Reaction 1, `A(s) + 8B(g) → C`, we know that gold (A) reacts with gas `B` to form `C`. The reactant that forms this complex is **B = BrF₃** (Bromine trifluoride). The 1:8 stoichiometry in the riddle is a known red herring; the actual reaction is `2Au + 3BrF₃ → [BrF₂]⁺[AuF₄]⁻ + Br₂`.\n*   From Reaction 2, `C + 2D(g) → E (extremely hazardous product)`, the powerful fluorinating agent `C` reacts with a gas `D`. A logical candidate for `D` is **CO** (Carbon monoxide).\n*   The reaction fluorinates carbon monoxide to produce **E = COF₂** (Carbonyl fluoride). Carbonyl fluoride is the fluorine analog of phosgene and is indeed an extremely hazardous gas, fitting the description perfectly.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the molecular symmetry of E.**\nNow we must find the molecular symmetry group for the product **E**, which we have identified as **COF₂** (Carbonyl fluoride).\n\n1.  **Molecular Structure:** The central atom is carbon. It is double-bonded to one oxygen atom and single-bonded to two fluorine atoms. According to VSEPR theory, the molecule has a trigonal planar geometry.\n\n    ```\n      O\n     //\n    C\n   / \\\n  F   F\n    ```\n\n2.  **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   **C₂ axis:** There is a two-fold axis of rotation that passes through the C=O bond. Rotating the molecule 180° around this axis leaves it unchanged.\n    *   **Two Mirror Planes (σᵥ):** There are two vertical mirror planes that contain the C₂ axis. One is the plane of the molecule itself, and the other is perpendicular to the molecular plane, bisecting the F-C-F angle.\n\n3.  **Point Group:** A molecule with one C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes containing that axis belongs to the **C₂v** point group.\n\nComparing this to the options provided:\nA) C₂\nB) C₂v\nC) D∞h\nD) D₄h\n\nThe correct molecular symmetry group for E (COF₂) is C₂v.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle and determine the molecular symmetry group of E.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues and Identify the Compounds**\n\nThe problem provides a series of chemical reactions. The key is to use the properties of the reactants and products to identify them one by one.\n\n*   **Clue 3: C + H₂O → A + F + G**\n    *   This is a hydrolysis reaction where the starting material A is reformed. This suggests a disproportionation reaction.\n    *   F is a strong acid, and G is a weak acid. A common and fitting pair of acids produced from the hydrolysis of a single compound is a strong hydrohalic acid (like HCl) and a weak oxoacid.\n    *   Let's hypothesize that F is hydrochloric acid (HCl, strong) and G is sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃, weak). H₂SO₃ is formed when SO₂ dissolves in water.\n    *   This hypothesis implies that compound C contains sulfur and chlorine.\n    *   The reaction would be: `[Sulfur Chloride Compound C] + H₂O → S (forms A) + SO₂ (forms G) + HCl (F)`.\n    *   This fits the description: A is regenerated (elemental sulfur), F is a strong acid (HCl), and G is a weak acid (H₂SO₃).\n\n*   **Clue 1: Solid A + 8 equivalents of gas B → Bright red product C**\n    *   Based on our hypothesis, A is elemental sulfur, which is a solid (typically as S₈). B would be chlorine gas (Cl₂). C is a sulfur chloride.\n    *   Let's check the stoichiometry: A = S₈, B = Cl₂.\n    *   The reaction is: `S₈ (solid) + 8 Cl₂ (gas) → 8 SCl₂`.\n    *   This reaction has a 1:8 molar ratio between A (S₈) and B (Cl₂), which perfectly matches the clue.\n    *   Furthermore, sulfur dichloride (SCl₂) is described as a cherry-red liquid, which matches the \"bright red product C\".\n    *   So, we can confidently identify:\n        *   **A = S₈ (Sulfur)**\n        *   **B = Cl₂ (Chlorine)**\n        *   **C = SCl₂ (Sulfur dichloride)**\n\n*   **Clue 4: D + B → H (1:1 ratio)**\n    *   We know B is chlorine gas (Cl₂). D is another gas, and H is a solvent.\n    *   `D (gas) + Cl₂ (gas) → H (solvent)`\n    *   A common reaction that fits this description is the addition of chlorine to an alkene. Let's test ethylene (C₂H₄) as gas D.\n    *   `C₂H₄ (gas) + Cl₂ (gas) → C₂H₄Cl₂ (liquid)`\n    *   The product, 1,2-dichloroethane (C₂H₄Cl₂), is a widely used solvent. This fits all parts of the clue.\n    *   So, we identify:\n        *   **D = C₂H₄ (Ethylene)**\n        *   **H = C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-dichloroethane)**\n\n*   **Clue 2: C + 2 equivalents of gas D → Extremely hazardous product E**\n    *   We have identified C = SCl₂ and D = C₂H₄.\n    *   The reaction is: `SCl₂ + 2 C₂H₄ → E`\n    *   This is a known reaction, the Levinstein process, which is used to produce bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide: `SCl₂ + 2 CH₂=CH₂ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   The product, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂, is commonly known as **mustard gas**, a potent chemical warfare agent. This certainly fits the description \"extremely hazardous product E\".\n    *   So, we identify:\n        *   **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂ (Mustard Gas)**\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E**\n\nNow that we have identified E as mustard gas, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂, we need to determine its point group.\n\n1.  **Molecular Structure:** The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two identical 2-chloroethyl groups (-CH₂CH₂Cl). Due to the two lone pairs on the sulfur atom, the C-S-C bond is bent, similar to the H-O-H bond in water.\n\n2.  **Conformation:** The molecule is flexible due to free rotation around the S-C and C-C single bonds. The overall symmetry depends on the specific, low-energy conformation the molecule adopts. We look for the most symmetric, plausible conformation.\n\n3.  **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   Let's try to find a C₂ axis. An axis passing through the S atom and bisecting the C-S-C angle can be a C₂ axis. If the two -CH₂CH₂Cl chains are arranged as identical \"propellers\" (i.e., they have the same set of dihedral angles), a 180° rotation around this axis will map the molecule onto itself. This is a very plausible conformation, analogous to the most stable conformer of diethyl ether.\n    *   Let's check for mirror planes (σ). A C₂v point group would require two mirror planes. One would have to contain the C-S-C atoms. For this to be a mirror plane, the rest of the chains must also lie in this plane, which would force an unfavorable eclipsed conformation. Therefore, there are no mirror planes.\n    *   Let's check for an inversion center (i). There is no point in the molecule through which inversion of all atoms results in an identical structure.\n    *   Since the molecule possesses a C₂ axis but lacks mirror planes or an inversion center, its point group is C₂.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The point group for the most symmetric stable conformer of mustard gas, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂, is C₂.\n\n**Final Answer Selection**\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) C₂\nB) D₄h\nC) C₂v\nD) D∞h\n\nOur derived point group is C₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
