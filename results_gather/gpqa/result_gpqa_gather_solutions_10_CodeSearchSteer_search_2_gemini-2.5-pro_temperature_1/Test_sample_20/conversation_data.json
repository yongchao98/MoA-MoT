An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to the carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds.\n    *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are part of the C=C double bonds.\n    *   These alpha-carbons are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Since there are **no alpha-hydrogens**, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups.\n    *   The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are all alpha-carbons to the adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   Each of these alpha-carbons has **two alpha-hydrogens**.\n    *   Due to the presence of these alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism to form its enol, which is the highly stable aromatic compound phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene).\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism.**\n\nOptical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A common feature of a chiral molecule is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C-2). It is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a **chiral center**.\n    *   The molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   The structure is the trans-isomer of an alkene with a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃) on each of the double-bonded carbons: CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups, so there are no chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral.\n    *   Achiral molecules do not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   A = benzoquinone\n*   B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n### Analysis of Tautomerism and Optical Isomerism\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a type of isomerism where a molecule exists in two or more readily interconvertible structures that differ in the relative position of at least one atomic nucleus, typically a hydrogen atom. A common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):** This molecule has a ring structure with two carbonyl (C=O) groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound possesses three keto groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbon atoms located between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) each have two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is an aromatic compound, which makes it particularly stable. The equilibrium between the keto and enol forms exists, confirming that it shows tautomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of a chiral molecule is the presence of a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The IUPAC name for this compound indicates a propanoate chain with a hydroxyl (-OH) group on the second carbon. Let's examine the groups attached to the second carbon atom:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methyl ester group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since all four groups are different, the second carbon is a chiral center. Consequently, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which has a trans configuration around the carbon-carbon double bond. The structure is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral. It does not have a chiral center. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   A = benzoquinone\n*   B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:**\n    *   **Task:** Identify two specific compounds from a given list based on their chemical properties.\n    *   **Property 1 (Compound A):** Must *not* show tautomerism. The candidates are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.\n    *   **Property 2 (Compound B):** Must show optical isomerism. The candidates are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.\n    *   **Output:** Select the correct option (A, B, C, or D) that correctly identifies both compounds A and B. The final answer should be presented in a Python code block that prints the result.\n\n2.  **Analyze Part A: Tautomerism**\n    *   **Definition:** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where isomers (tautomers) can readily interconvert, most commonly through the migration of a proton and a shift of a double bond. The most frequent type is keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Key Requirement for Keto-Enol Tautomerism:** The molecule must possess an \"alpha-hydrogen\" – a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group. This alpha-carbon is typically sp³ hybridized.\n    *   **Candidate 1: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.** Its structure is a 6-membered ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups. These are sp³ hybridized carbons, and they are alpha-carbons to two carbonyl groups each. They have alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to readily tautomerize to its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is aromatic and very stable. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n    *   **Candidate 2: Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone).** Its structure is a 6-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds (they are sp² hybridized). While they have hydrogen atoms, these are not the typical alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon required for simple keto-enol tautomerism. The conversion to its corresponding \"enol\" (hydroquinone) is a reduction (a redox reaction), not a simple isomerization (tautomerism). Thus, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n    *   **Definition:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Key Requirement:** The most common cause of chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Candidate 1: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's analyze the central carbon (carbon-2). It is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n    *   **Candidate 2: Dimethyl fumarate.** This is the trans-isomer of an alkene. The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. It has a center of symmetry and is achiral. It has no chiral centers. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:**\n    *   Compound A (no tautomerism) = benzoquinone\n    *   Compound B (optical isomerism) = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n    *   Matching this pair with the given options:\n        *   A) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate  <- This is a match.\n        *   B) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n        *   C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n        *   D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n    *   The correct option is A.\n\n5.  **Construct the Python Code:**\n    *   The code will programmatically determine the correct choice based on the conclusions from the analysis.\n    *   It will define the correct compound for each property.\n    *   It will then check the list of options to find the one that matches the correct compounds for both A and B.\n    *   Finally, it will print the letter of the correct option.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the isomerism problem by identifying the correct compounds\n    for properties A and B and then selecting the corresponding multiple-choice option.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Part A: Identify the compound that does not show tautomerism.\n    # - Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has alpha-hydrogens on sp3 carbons and readily tautomerizes to the stable aromatic enol, phloroglucinol.\n    # - Benzoquinone's conversion to hydroquinone is a redox reaction, not tautomerism.

The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound with a carbonyl group (keto form) to exhibit this type of tautomerism, it must have at least one hydrogen atom on the alpha-carbon (the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group). This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen. The presence of an alpha-hydrogen on an sp³ hybridized carbon allows for the formation of an enol tautomer.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze Benzoquinone.**\n    *   The structure of p-benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups at positions 1 and 4, and two C=C double bonds.\n    *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (alpha-carbons) are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n    *   These alpha-carbons are all sp² hybridized as they are part of the ring's double bonds. They do have hydrogen atoms attached, but these are vinylic hydrogens.\n    *   Crucially, for standard keto-enol tautomerism, the alpha-carbon needs to be sp³ hybridized to allow for the formation of a new double bond without disrupting the existing framework in an unstable way. Since benzoquinone lacks sp³ hybridized alpha-carbons with alpha-hydrogens, it cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.**\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups.\n    *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (alpha-carbons) are C2, C4, and C6.\n    *   These alpha-carbons are sp³ hybridized and each has two alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it can tautomerize to form phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is an aromatic and thus very stable enol form.\n    *   Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.**\n\n*   **Conclusion for (A):** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism (B)**\n\n*   **Step 1: Understand Optical Isomerism.**\n    Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.**\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n    *   The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and will show optical isomerism.**\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze Dimethyl fumarate.**\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid.\n    *   Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   The molecule is planar around the C=C double bond.\n    *   It does not contain any chiral centers (no carbon is bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The molecule possesses a center of inversion (located at the midpoint of the C=C bond), which makes it achiral.\n    *   Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate is achiral and will not show optical isomerism.**\n\n*   **Conclusion for (B):** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer Formulation**\n\n*   Compound (A), which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B), which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n1.  **Analyze Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where molecules can interconvert by a chemical reaction, most commonly the migration of a proton. The most frequent type is keto-enol tautomerism. A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group. This alpha-carbon is typically sp³ hybridized.\n\n2.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups.\n    *   **Alpha-hydrogens:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons. They are sp³ hybridized and each has two hydrogen atoms. These hydrogens are highly acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Tautomerization:** Due to the presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily undergoes tautomerization. It converts to its enol form, benzene-1,3,5-triol (also known as phloroglucinol). This enol form is exceptionally stable because it is an aromatic compound.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone groups opposite each other.\n    *   **Alpha-hydrogens:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds (they are sp² hybridized). While these carbons have hydrogen atoms, they are not the typical labile alpha-hydrogens found on sp³ carbons that participate in keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Tautomerization:** For benzoquinone (C₆H₄O₂) to form its corresponding phenol-like structure (hydroquinone, C₆H₆O₂), it would need to gain two hydrogen atoms. This is a change in the molecular formula, which means the reaction is a reduction, not an isomerization (tautomerism).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\n4.  **Result for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Analyze Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common source of chirality in organic molecules is a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n2.  **Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** The formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). The four groups attached to it are:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n3.  **Analyze Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans* isomer of an ester with the formula CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar. It has a center of symmetry (inversion center) located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Any molecule that possesses a plane of symmetry or a center of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since dimethyl fumarate is achiral, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Result for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nMatching this with the given options:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\n*   **Tautomerism** is a type of isomerism where a molecule exists in two or more interconvertible forms that differ in the position of a proton and a double bond. Keto-enol tautomerism is a common type, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen atom (a hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Benzoquinone:** The structure of 1,4-benzoquinone consists of a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone (C=O) groups at opposite ends. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Since benzoquinone lacks alpha-hydrogens, it cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbon atoms between the carbonyl groups are CH₂ groups, meaning they have alpha-hydrogens. These alpha-hydrogens can move, allowing the compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), is particularly stable due to the formation of an aromatic ring.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\n*   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center – a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since this carbon is a chiral center, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and will exhibit optical isomerism (it has D and L enantiomers).\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the trans-isomer of an alkene with the formula CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C=C double bond. Due to this symmetry, it is achiral and does not have a non-superimposable mirror image. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct option:\n\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\nTautomerism is a type of isomerism where a molecule exists in two or more readily interconvertible structures that differ in the relative position of at least one atom, commonly a hydrogen atom. Keto-enol tautomerism is a common type that occurs in carbonyl compounds, but it requires the presence of at least one alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone):** In the structure of benzoquinone, the carbon atoms adjacent to the two carbonyl groups are part of carbon-carbon double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has alpha-hydrogens on the carbons situated between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6). The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows it to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is an aromatic compound, which makes it particularly stable. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does exhibit tautomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** Benzoquinone is the compound that does not show tautomerism.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon has four different substituents, it is a chiral center.

For the compounds in question, we are concerned with **keto-enol tautomerism**. The essential requirement for a ketone or aldehyde to undergo this type of tautomerism is the presence of at least one **alpha-hydrogen**—a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom directly adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** The structure of benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups at opposite ends and two C=C double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are part of these double bonds. Consequently, these alpha-carbons are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, **benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbon atoms at positions 2, 4, and 6 are situated between carbonyl groups, making them alpha-carbons. Each of these carbons is a -CH₂- group, possessing two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows the molecule to readily tautomerize to its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Analysis of Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism exhibited by **chiral** molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common feature that confers chirality is a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is `CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃`. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bearing the hydroxyl group). This carbon is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is attached to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is therefore chiral and **will show optical isomerism**.\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is `CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. This molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. It does not contain any carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The molecule possesses a center of symmetry, which makes it achiral. Achiral molecules do not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**Part 1: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism (A)**\n\n*   **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two isomers that can be interconverted, most commonly by the migration of a proton. The most frequent type is keto-enol tautomerism.\n*   For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one **alpha-hydrogen**. An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\nLet's analyze the two given compounds:\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone groups at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4).\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are the carbons involved in the C=C double bonds (at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6).\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** These alpha-carbons are each bonded to another carbon (in the ring) and a hydrogen. Wait, let me re-examine the structure of p-benzoquinone. The formula is C6H4O2. The carbons at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6 are sp2 hybridized and are part of C=C double bonds. Each of these carbons is bonded to one hydrogen atom. So, there are alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   However, for tautomerization to occur, the enol form must be reasonably stable. The enol form of benzoquinone would be hydroquinone (1,4-dihydroxybenzene). While hydroquinone is a very stable aromatic compound, the conversion from benzoquinone to hydroquinone is a **reduction** (gain of two electrons and two protons), not a simple tautomeric shift. Tautomerism is an isomerization equilibrium (same molecular formula). Benzoquinone (C6H4O2) and hydroquinone (C6H6O2) have different molecular formulas. Therefore, this is not tautomerism. The key point is that the alpha-hydrogens are on sp2 carbons, and removing one to form an enol would disrupt the conjugated system in a way that is not a typical keto-enol tautomerization. The system is already conjugated. The compound is considered non-tautomeric.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered saturated ring (cyclohexane) with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are the alpha-carbons. They are located between two carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** Each of these alpha-carbons (CH2 groups) has two hydrogen atoms. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because the resulting negative charge after deprotonation can be delocalized over two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Tautomerism:** Due to the presence of these highly acidic alpha-hydrogens, this compound readily undergoes tautomerization to form its enol isomer, **phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene)**. This enol form is aromatic and thus exceptionally stable, so the equilibrium heavily favors the enol form.\n    *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion for (A):** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism (B)**\n\n*   **Optical isomerism** is shown by **chiral** molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   A common source of chirality is the presence of a **chiral center** (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\nLet's analyze the two given compounds:\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2, the one bonded to the -OH group). It is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since all four groups attached to this carbon are different, it is a chiral center.\n    *   The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans* isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two -COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Check:** The molecule is planar. It has a plane of symmetry that contains the C=C double bond. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral. It also has a center of inversion.\n    *   Since the molecule is achiral, it cannot show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion for (B):** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism. So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer Formulation**\n\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nMatching this with the options provided:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n### Analysis of Tautomerism and Optical Isomerism\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers.

The carbon atoms that are part of the carbonyl groups (C=O) are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms. The other four carbon atoms are part of C=C double bonds and are sp2 hybridized. These carbons have vinylic hydrogens, not the required α-hydrogens on an sp3 hybridized carbon. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbon atoms at positions 2, 4, and 6 are situated between carbonyl groups and possess acidic α-hydrogens. The presence of these α-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is aromatic and particularly stable, meaning the equilibrium favors the enol form.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images.

The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism, existing as two enantiomers (D and L forms).\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule has the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, which is the trans isomer of an alkene. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, which makes it achiral. It does not have any chiral centers. While it exhibits geometric (cis-trans) isomerism, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n### Analysis of Tautomerism and Optical Isomerism\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a type of isomerism where a molecule exists in two or more interconvertible forms that differ in the position of a proton and a double bond.

The carbon atoms between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are alpha-carbons, and each is bonded to two hydrogen atoms. These alpha-hydrogens allow the compound to undergo tautomerism. In fact, it readily converts to its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is exceptionally stable because it is an aromatic compound, which is a much more stable state than the non-aromatic trione form.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images.

These alpha-hydrogens allow the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is particularly stable because it is aromatic, containing a planar ring with 6 π-electrons.

The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group) on an sp³-hybridized carbon.\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with two C=C double bonds and two C=O groups at opposite ends.\n    *   Structure:\n        ```\n           O\n          //\n        HC=CH\n       /    \\\n    O=C      C=O\n       \\    /\n        HC=CH\n        ```\n    *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (α-carbons) are part of the C=C double bonds. They are sp²-hybridized and do not have any α-hydrogens.\n    *   While one might consider the formation of hydroquinone (1,4-dihydroxybenzene), this process involves the addition of two hydrogen atoms (a reduction), changing the molecular formula from C₆H₄O₂ to C₆H₆O₂. Since tautomers must be isomers, they must have the same molecular formula. Therefore, this conversion is a redox reaction, not tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups, separated by CH₂ groups.\n    *   Structure (keto form):\n        ```\n             O=C\n              / \\\n            H₂C CH₂\n             |   |\n           O=C   C=O\n              \\ /\n               CH₂\n        ```\n    *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the CH₂ groups) are sp³-hybridized and each has two α-hydrogens.\n    *   These α-hydrogens can migrate to the oxygen of the carbonyl groups, leading to the formation of an enol. This molecule can undergo tautomerization to form 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic and highly stable compound.\n    *   Both the keto form (Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) and the enol form (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene) have the same molecular formula (C₆H₆O₃).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.\n\nFrom this analysis, the compound that does **not** show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of a chiral molecule is a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Methyl lactate):**\n    *   Structure:\n        ```\n              OH\n              |\n        CH₃ - C* - C(=O)OCH₃\n              |\n              H\n        ```\n    *   The central carbon atom (marked with *) is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   Since it has a chiral center and lacks a plane of symmetry, the molecule is chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   This is the trans-isomer of an alkene with ester groups.\n    *   Structure:\n        ```\n          CH₃OOC       H\n                \\     /\n                 C = C\n                /     \\\n               H       COOCH₃\n        ```\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers. It is planar around the C=C double bond and possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) as well as a center of inversion. Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism.\n\nFrom this analysis, the compound that **will** show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nTo determine the correct option, we must analyze the properties of each compound.\n\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\nTautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers. For keto-enol tautomerism, the most common form, a compound must typically possess an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Benzoquinone:** In the structure of 1,4-benzoquinone, the carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of a double bond and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. The other hydrogens are vinylic, meaning they are attached to carbons in a double bond. These are not readily mobile. Therefore, benzoquinone lacks the necessary α-hydrogens on a saturated carbon and does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound is in equilibrium with its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). The enol form is exceptionally stable because it is an aromatic ring, which is a highly favored energetic state. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily shows tautomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center – a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    2.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    3.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism, existing as two enantiomers (R and S forms).\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the trans-isomer with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar around the central double bond and possesses a plane of symmetry. It does not contain any chiral centers. Therefore, it is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Compound **A** is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound **B** is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Part A: Tautomerism.**\n    *   Tautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n    *   **Benzoquinone:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) groups are part of double bonds within the ring and have no attached hydrogen atoms. Therefore, benzoquinone lacks alpha-hydrogens and cannot undergo tautomerism.\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are adjacent to carbonyl groups and each has two hydrogen atoms. These are alpha-hydrogens, so this compound can and does exhibit tautomerism (to form phloroglucinol).\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does *not* show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Part B: Optical Isomerism.**\n    *   Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common cause of chirality is a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). This makes it a chiral center. Therefore, this compound will show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is a trans-alkene. It is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. It does not have any chiral centers. Therefore, it will not show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n3.  **Combine and Select the Final Answer.**\n    *   Based on the analysis, A = benzoquinone and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n    *   This combination matches option C.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the properties of four compounds to answer a multiple-choice question.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Part A: Determine which compound does not show tautomerism.\n    # Tautomerism requires alpha-hydrogens (hydrogens on the carbon next to a C=O group).\n    \n    # Analysis of Benzoquinone:\n    # The carbons next to the C=O groups are part of C=C double bonds and have no hydrogens.\n    # No alpha-hydrogens means no tautomerism.\n    compound_A_no_tautomerism = \"benzoquinone\"\n    \n    # Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:\n    # The CH2 groups between the C=O groups have alpha-hydrogens.\n    # It shows tautomerism (forming phloroglucinol).\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Analysis for Tautomerism (Compound A)\")\n    print(\" - Benzoquinone has no alpha-hydrogens, so it does not show tautomerism.\")\n    print(\" - Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has alpha-hydrogens, so it shows tautomerism.\")\n    print(f\" - Therefore, compound A (does not show tautomerism) is: {compound_A_no_tautomerism}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Part B: Determine which compound shows optical isomerism.\n    # Optical isomerism requires a chiral center (a carbon with four different groups attached).\n    \n    # Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:\n    # The central carbon is attached to -H, -OH, -CH3, and -COOCH3.\n    # These four groups are different, so it has a chiral center and shows optical isomerism.\n    compound_B_optical_isomerism = \"methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\"\n    \n    # Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:\n    # This molecule is a trans-alkene and is achiral (it has a plane of symmetry).\n    # It has no chiral centers and does not show optical isomerism.\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Analysis for Optical Isomerism (Compound B)\")\n    print(\" - Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center (a carbon with 4 different groups), so it shows optical isomerism.\")\n    print(\" - Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not have a chiral center, so it does not show optical isomerism.\")\n    print(f\" - Therefore, compound B (shows optical isomerism) is: {compound_B_optical_isomerism}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: Match the findings with the given options.\n    # Option A: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Incorrect)\n    # Option B: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate (Incorrect)\n    # Option C: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Correct)\n    # Option D: A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate (Incorrect)\n    \n    final_choice = \"C\"\n    \n    print(\"Step 3: Conclusion\")\n    print(f\"The correct option is the one where A is '{compound_A_no_tautomerism}' and B is '{compound_B_optical_isomerism}'.\")\n    print(\"This corresponds to option C.\")\n    \n    # Final Answer\n    print(f\"<<<{final_choice}>>>\")\n\nsolve_chemistry_problem()\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: Step 1: Analysis for Tautomerism (Compound A)\n - Benzoquinone has no alpha-hydrogens, so it does not show tautomerism.\n - Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has alpha-hydrogens, so it shows tautomerism.\n - Therefore, compound A (does not show tautomerism) is: benzoquinone\n------------------------------\nStep 2: Analysis for Optical Isomerism (Compound B)\n - Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center (a carbon with 4 different groups), so it shows optical isomerism.\n - Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not have a chiral center, so it does not show optical isomerism.\n - Therefore, compound B (shows optical isomerism) is: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n------------------------------\nStep 3: Conclusion\nThe correct option is the one where A is 'benzoquinone' and B is 'methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate'.\nThis corresponds to option C.\n<<<C>>>\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### **Part 1: Analysis of Tautomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify the compound between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione that does **not** show tautomerism.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Tautomerism**\nTautomerism is a form of isomerism where isomers, called tautomers, are in equilibrium and can readily interconvert. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the migration of a proton (H+) and the shifting of a double bond. A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on an sp³ hybridized carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Benzoquinone**\n*   **Structure:** Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone) is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups opposite each other and two carbon-carbon double bonds. Its molecular formula is C₆H₄O₂.\n    ```\n       O\n      //\n    HC==CH\n     |  |\n    O=C--C=O\n     |  |\n    HC==CH\n    ```\n    A more accurate representation:\n    ```\n       O\n      //\n    C\n   / \\\\\n  HC  CH\n  ||  ||\n  HC  CH\n   \\ //\n    C\n   \\\\\n    O\n    ```\n*   **Check for Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are called alpha-carbons. In benzoquinone, all four carbons adjacent to the two carbonyl groups are part of C=C double bonds. They are sp² hybridized. There are no sp³ hybridized alpha-carbons with attached hydrogens.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since benzoquinone lacks the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon, it cannot undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**\n*   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups.\n    ```\n         O\n        //\n      C\n     /  \\\n   H₂C    CH₂\n    |      |\n  O=C      C=O\n     \\    /\n       CH₂\n    ```\n*   **Check for Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are all alpha-carbons. Each is an sp³ hybridized carbon bonded to two hydrogen atoms. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n*   **Tautomerization:** Due to the presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can readily tautomerize. Its enol form is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic compound. The stability gained from forming an aromatic ring makes this tautomerization highly favorable.\n    *Keto form (less stable)* <=> *Enol form (phloroglucinol, aromatic, more stable)*\n*   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism.\n\n**Summary for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n---\n\n### **Part 2: Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify which compound between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate will show optical isomerism.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Optical Isomerism**\nOptical isomerism occurs in molecules that are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid).\n    ```\n          O\n         //\n    CH₃ - C*H - C - O - CH₃\n          |\n          OH\n    ```\n*   **Check for Chirality:** Let's examine the carbon atom labeled with an asterisk (C2).\n    *   Group 1: -H (hydrogen)\n    *   Group 2: -OH (hydroxyl group)\n    *   Group 3: -CH₃ (methyl group)\n    *   Group 4: -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl group)\n    Since all four groups attached to this carbon are different, it is a chiral center. The molecule as a whole lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n*   **Conclusion:** Because it contains a chiral center, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule. It exists as a pair of enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images) and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid.\n    ```\n         H         COOCH₃\n          \\       /\n           C === C\n          /       \\\n    CH₃OOC         H\n    ```\n*   **Check for Chirality:**\n    *   There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups, so there are no chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry (inversion center) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Any molecule with a center of symmetry is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule. It is superimposable on its mirror image and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nMatching this result with the given options:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n1.  **Understanding Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where molecules, called tautomers, can readily interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the migration of a proton (H+) and a shift in the location of a double bond. A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen—a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are -CH2- groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The hydrogens on carbons 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-hydrogens because they are adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Since these alpha-hydrogens are present, the compound can undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Stability:** The tautomerization of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can happen at all three keto sites, leading to the formation of benzene-1,3,5-triol (also known as phloroglucinol). This enol form is an aromatic compound and is therefore exceptionally stable. The equilibrium heavily favors this aromatic enol form.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione clearly shows tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Benzoquinone (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone groups opposite each other. The structure is cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. While these carbons do have hydrogen atoms, attempting to form an enol tautomer would disrupt the stable conjugated system of the quinone without forming a fully aromatic ring. This makes the potential enol form very unstable.\n    *   **Equilibrium:** Because the enol form is highly unstable compared to the keto form, the equilibrium lies almost entirely with the keto (quinone) form. For practical purposes in chemistry, it is considered a non-tautomerizing ketone. The related compound, hydroquinone, is formed by a reduction reaction (gain of two H atoms), not by tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does not show significant tautomerism.\n\n4.  **Decision for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Understanding Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and will exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Therefore, it will show optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which has a *trans* configuration around the double bond: CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality Check:** The molecule does not have any chiral centers. Furthermore, the molecule is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry that cuts through the C=C double bond. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since dimethyl fumarate is achiral, it is superimposable on its mirror image and will not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Decision for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Combination:**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\n### Part A: Tautomerism Analysis\n\nTautomers are isomers of a compound that differ only in the position of a proton and a double bond. A common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** In the structure of p-benzoquinone, there are no hydrogen atoms on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (alpha-carbons). The hydrogens present are attached to the doubly bonded carbons, which are vinylic hydrogens. The absence of alpha-hydrogens means that benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three ketone groups. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 each have two hydrogen atoms. These hydrogens are alpha-hydrogens to two carbonyl groups, which makes them particularly acidic. Due to the presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily undergoes keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is an aromatic compound and is significantly more stable, meaning the equilibrium favors the enol form.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism Analysis\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center— a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). This makes the carbon atom a chiral center, and thus the molecule will exhibit optical isomerism, existing as two enantiomers (R and S isomers).\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule, with the formula CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, is the trans-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. It does not contain any carbon atom bonded to four different groups, so it has no chiral center. The molecule is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Compound **A** (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound **B** (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\n### Analysis of Compounds\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n*   **Tautomerism** is an isomerization reaction that involves the migration of a proton and a shift in the location of a double bond.

Therefore, benzoquinone lacks alpha-hydrogens and cannot undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism. Attempting to draw a tautomer would result in a highly unstable structure with cumulated double bonds within the ring.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound possesses three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 each have two hydrogen atoms. These are alpha-hydrogens, situated between two carbonyl groups, making them acidic and readily available for tautomerization. This compound exists in equilibrium with its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). The enol form is exceptionally stable because it is aromatic, containing a planar ring with 6 π-electrons.\n\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n*   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images.

The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n    2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n    4.  an ester group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon has four different substituents, it is a chiral center. Consequently, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as a pair of enantiomers (optical isomers).\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. It is a *trans* isomer. The molecule has a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral.

For keto-enol tautomerism, the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group) is typically required.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** The structure of benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Because it lacks alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone does not undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbon atoms between the carbonyls (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are alpha-carbons, and each is bonded to hydrogen atoms. The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows it to undergo tautomerism. Its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), is particularly stable because it is aromatic.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common source of chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  a methyl group (–CH₃)\n    2.  a hydroxyl group (–OH)\n    3.  a hydrogen atom (–H)\n    4.  an ester group (–COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center, and the molecule exhibits optical isomerism.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The chemical formula is CH₃OOC–CH=CH–COOCH₃. This molecule is a trans-isomer and does not contain any carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The carbons of the double bond are each bonded to only three groups. Therefore, it does not have a chiral center and is not optically active.\n\nThus, the compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the findings:\n*   (A) is benzoquinone.\n*   (B) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**Part 1: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism (A)**\n\nTautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, is an equilibrium between a keto form (containing a C=O bond) and an enol form (containing a C=C bond adjacent to an -OH group). This process requires the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen,\" which is a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl group. Crucially, this alpha-carbon must be sp3-hybridized.\n\nLet's analyze the two compounds given for part A:\n\n1.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are methylene groups (-CH2-).\n    *   **Alpha-hydrogens:** Each ketone group has two adjacent alpha-carbons. For example, the ketone at C1 has alpha-carbons at C2 and C6. Both C2 and C6 are sp3-hybridized and each has two hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Tautomerism:** Because it possesses alpha-hydrogens on sp3-hybridized carbons, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it can tautomerize multiple times to form 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic and therefore very stable compound. The equilibrium strongly favors this aromatic enol form.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with two ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1 and 4, and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) at positions 2-3 and 5-6.\n    *   **Alpha-hydrogens:** The carbons alpha (adjacent) to the ketone groups are the carbons involved in the double bonds (C2, C3, C5, C6). These carbons are all sp2-hybridized.\n    *   **Tautomerism:** Benzoquinone lacks any sp3-hybridized alpha-carbons. Therefore, it does not have the necessary type of alpha-hydrogens to undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does *not* show tautomerism.\n\n**Therefore, compound (A) is benzoquinone.**\n\n**Part 2: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism (B)**\n\nOptical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\nLet's analyze the two compounds given for part B:\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Let's examine carbon-2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n    *   **Groups attached to C2:**\n        1.  -H (hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH3 (methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH3 (methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   **Chirality:** Since carbon-2 is bonded to four distinctly different groups, it is a chiral center. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and *will* show optical isomerism (it exists as two enantiomers).\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups (-COOCH3) are in a *trans* position across the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar. It has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and also a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Molecules with a plane of symmetry or a center of symmetry are achiral. There are no chiral centers in the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule and does *not* show optical isomerism.\n\n**Therefore, compound (B) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.**\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\n1.  **Definition of Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where isomers can be interconverted by the migration of an atom or group, most commonly a proton. The most prevalent type is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the interconversion of a keto form (containing a C=O group) and an enol form (containing a C=C-OH group). A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of at least one alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O). This alpha-carbon must be sp³ hybridized.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with single bonds between carbons and three carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are -CH₂- groups.\n    *   **Alpha-hydrogens:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons to the carbonyl groups. Each of these carbons is sp³ hybridized and bears two hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since it has sp³-hybridized alpha-carbons with hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it readily tautomerizes to its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism**.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two carbonyl (C=O) groups at opposite positions (1 and 4).\n    *   **Alpha-hydrogens:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6) are part of carbon-carbon double bonds. These carbons are sp² hybridized.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone lacks the necessary alpha-hydrogens on sp³-hybridized carbons. Tautomerization is not possible under normal conditions. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n4.  **Result for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\n1.  **Definition of Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon at position 2 is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and non-superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene with a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃) on each of the double-bonded carbons. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar around the double bond. It possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry at the center of the C=C bond). Molecules with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion are achiral and cannot be optically active. There are no chiral centers in this molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule. Therefore, **it will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n4.  **Result for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nThis is a two-part question that tests knowledge of tautomerism and optical isomerism.\n\n### **Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a form of isomerism where two structural isomers, called tautomers, are in rapid equilibrium. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have an **α-hydrogen**—a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** The structure is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons are sp² hybridized and do not have the required α-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. The carbons between the ketones (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are sp³-hybridized and each possesses two α-hydrogens. These hydrogens are highly acidic and can be readily removed to form the enol tautomer, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is aromatic and very stable.

For keto-enol tautomerism, a key requirement is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen—a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** This molecule consists of a six-membered ring with two opposing carbonyl groups (C=O) and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The hydrogen atoms are attached to the double-bonded carbons (sp2-hybridized carbons). While these are technically alpha-hydrogens, their removal is difficult. If tautomerism were to occur, it would create a highly strained and unstable structure with adjacent double bonds within the ring, which is energetically unfavorable. Consequently, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three ketone groups and alpha-hydrogens located on the carbons between them. It can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (also known as phloroglucinol), is an aromatic compound. The stability gained from achieving aromaticity is significant, so not only does cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione show tautomerism, but its enol form is particularly stable.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common source of chirality is a chiral center: a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Methyl lactate):** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is attached to four distinct groups: a methyl group (-CH₃), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). This makes the carbon atom a chiral center, and the molecule exists as two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Thus, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, and it is the *trans* isomer, meaning the two methoxycarbonyl groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond. This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbon-carbon double bond, making it superimposable on its mirror image. Because it is achiral, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone (A), and the compound that will show optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (B).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nMy plan is to solve this chemistry problem by breaking it down into two parts, as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n1.  I will analyze the structure of **benzoquinone**. Tautomerism (specifically keto-enol tautomerism) requires an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on an sp3-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl (C=O) group. In 1,4-benzoquinone, all carbon atoms in the ring are sp2-hybridized (part of C=C or C=O double bonds), so there are no alpha-hydrogens. Thus, it cannot undergo tautomerism.\n2.  I will analyze the structure of **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**. The carbon atoms at positions 2, 4, and 6 are sp3-hybridized and each has two hydrogen atoms. These are alpha-hydrogens, situated between two carbonyl groups, making them highly acidic and mobile. This compound readily tautomerizes to its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol.\n3.  Conclusion for Part 1: **Benzoquinone** is the compound (A) that does not show tautomerism.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism.**\n1.  I will analyze the structure of **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. Optical isomerism requires a chiral center, which is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to a hydrogen (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methyl ester group (-COOCH3). Since these four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center, and the molecule will exhibit optical isomerism.\n2.  I will analyze the structure of **dimethyl fumarate**. This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene. It is planar and has a center of symmetry. It does not contain any chiral centers. Therefore, it is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n3.  Conclusion for Part 2: **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** is the compound (B) that shows optical isomerism.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, compound A is benzoquinone and compound B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. This matches option D. I will now write the Python code to reflect this logic and print the final answer.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze tautomerism for the first pair of compounds.\n# Tautomerism requires an alpha-hydrogen (an H on an sp3 carbon next to a C=O).\n# Benzoquinone has only sp2 carbons in its ring, so no alpha-hydrogens.\n# Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has CH2 groups between the C=O groups, which contain alpha-hydrogens.\ncompound_that_does_not_show_tautomerism = \"benzoquinone\"\n\n# Step 2: Analyze optical isomerism for the second pair of compounds.\n# Optical isomerism requires a chiral center (a carbon with four different attached groups).\n# Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: The central carbon is bonded to -H, -OH, -CH3, and -COOCH3.

Understanding Tautomerism:**\nTautomerism is a form of isomerism where isomers, called tautomers, readily interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have a hydrogen atom on a carbon that is adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen, and the carbon it is attached to is the alpha-carbon, which is typically sp³-hybridized.\n\n**2. Analyzing Benzoquinone:**\n*   **Structure:** Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone) is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4) and two carbon-carbon double bonds. Its formula is C₆H₄O₂.\n*   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n*   **Check for Alpha-Hydrogens:** Each of these alpha-carbons is part of a double bond (sp²-hybridized). They do have hydrogen atoms attached, but these are vinylic hydrogens, not hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone lacks the required sp³-hybridized alpha-carbon with an alpha-hydrogen. Therefore, it cannot undergo the typical keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n**3. Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n*   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons between the carbonyls (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are CH₂ groups.\n*   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are all alpha-carbons to two carbonyl groups each. For example, the carbon at position 2 is alpha to both the C1 carbonyl and the C3 carbonyl.\n*   **Check for Alpha-Hydrogens:** These alpha-carbons are sp³-hybridized and each has two hydrogens. These hydrogens are quite acidic because the negative charge that results from removing one is stabilized by two carbonyl groups.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has acidic alpha-hydrogens and readily undergoes tautomerism. Its enol form is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic and very stable compound. This provides a strong driving force for tautomerization.\n\n**Outcome for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n---\n\n### **Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism**\n\n**1. Understanding Optical Isomerism:**\nOptical isomerism occurs when a molecule is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n**2. Analyzing Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n*   **Structure:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n    *   The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n        1.  -H (Hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (Hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (Methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (Methoxycarbonyl group)\n*   **Conclusion:** Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. The molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry, so it is chiral. Chiral molecules exist as pairs of enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images) and are optically active. Therefore, it will show optical isomerism.\n\n**3. Analyzing Dimethyl fumarate:**\n*   **Structure:** This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl but-2-enedioate. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n*   **Chirality Check:**\n    *   There are no chiral centers (no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The molecule has a center of inversion (located at the midpoint of the C=C bond).\n    *   The presence of a center of inversion means the molecule is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule, it is optically inactive and will not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Outcome for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer Derivation**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nCombining these two findings, we match them with the given options:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a form of isomerism where two structural isomers, called tautomers, are in rapid equilibrium. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the migration of a proton and a shift in the position of a double bond. A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). This alpha-carbon must typically be sp³ hybridized.\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone, Cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring containing two carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1 and 4, and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) at positions 2 and 5.\n    *   **Alpha-carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n    *   **Analysis:** All these alpha-carbons are sp² hybridized as they are part of the C=C double bonds. They do not have the required sp³-hybridized carbon with an attached hydrogen atom next to the carbonyl group. Therefore, benzoquinone cannot undergo the standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are methylene groups (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Alpha-carbons:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are all alpha-carbons to two carbonyl groups each.\n    *   **Analysis:** These alpha-carbons are sp³ hybridized and each has two hydrogen atoms attached. These alpha-hydrogens are highly acidic and readily removed, allowing the molecule to undergo tautomerism. The resulting enol form is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic compound. Due to the high stability gained from aromaticity, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione exists almost entirely as its tautomer, phloroglucinol.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism.\n\n*   **Result for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common source of chirality is a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is `CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃`.\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2. It is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  A hydroxyl group (`-OH`)\n        2.  A hydrogen atom (`-H`)\n        3.  A methyl group (`-CH₃`)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (`-COOCH₃`)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism (it has two enantiomers).\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is `CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃` where the two `-COOCH₃` groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond, but it does not have any carbon atom bonded to four different groups. There are no chiral centers. Furthermore, the molecule possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry), which makes it achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and will not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Result for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Summary**\n\n*   **Compound A** (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   **Compound B** (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to the pair given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\n### Analysis of Tautomerism and Optical Isomerism\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomers are isomers that readily interconvert, most commonly through the migration of a proton and a shift in the location of a double bond. For keto-enol tautomerism, the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group) is typically required.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** This molecule has a six-membered ring structure with two ketone groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Therefore, p-benzoquinone lacks the necessary alpha-hydrogens to undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound possesses alpha-hydrogens on the carbons situated between the ketone groups. It can undergo keto-enol tautomerism to form its enol isomer, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). The enol form is particularly stable because it is aromatic, meaning the equilibrium favors the enol.\n\nBased on this, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center, a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula for this ester is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  a methyl group (–CH₃)\n    2.  a hydroxyl group (–OH)\n    3.  a hydrogen atom (–H)\n    4.  an ester group (–COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will exhibit optical isomerism and exist as a pair of enantiomers (L and D isomers).\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. It is a *trans* isomer. The carbons of the double bond are each bonded to only three groups, so there is no chiral center. The molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\nTautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two interconvertible structural isomers. In the context of keto-enol tautomerism, a compound must typically possess an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group) to undergo this process.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone:** In the structure of p-benzoquinone, the carbonyl carbons do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. The other four carbons in the ring are sp2 hybridized (part of a double bond) and do not have alpha-hydrogens in the traditional sense required for keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has CH2 groups at positions 2, 4, and 6. The hydrogens on these carbons are alpha-hydrogens to the adjacent carbonyl groups. This allows it to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is particularly stable because it is an aromatic compound.\n\nThus, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center, a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). This makes the carbon a chiral center, and the molecule exhibits optical isomerism, existing as L and D enantiomers.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule has the formula CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with a *trans* configuration across the carbon-carbon double bond. It does not contain any chiral centers. Due to the presence of a center of inversion, the molecule is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nCombining the findings:\n*   (A) The compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone.\n*   (B) The compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\n### Analysis of Compound (A): Tautomerism\n\nTautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers. For keto-enol tautomerism, the presence of an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is typically required.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** In this molecule, the carbon atoms adjacent to the two carbonyl groups are part of carbon-carbon double bonds and do not have any attached hydrogen atoms. Without an α-hydrogen, benzoquinone cannot undergo the necessary proton transfer to form an enol tautomer. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound possesses hydrogen atoms on the carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6, which are α-hydrogens to the carbonyl groups. It can undergo keto-enol tautomerism to form its enol, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). This enol form is exceptionally stable because it is an aromatic compound, which fulfills Hückel's rule (cyclic, planar, conjugated, with 6 π-electrons). Because its enol form is highly stabilized by aromaticity, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily shows tautomerism.\n\nThus, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Analysis of Compound (B): Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center, a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The second carbon atom in the chain is bonded to four distinct groups: a methyl group (-CH₃), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since it has a chiral center, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and thus exhibits optical isomerism, existing as two enantiomers (R and S forms).\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the trans-isomer of butenedioic acid dimethyl ester (CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃). Due to the carbon-carbon double bond, the molecule is planar. This planarity results in a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral and therefore optically inactive. While it has a stereoisomer (its cis- geometric isomer, dimethyl maleate), it does not have optical isomers.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the findings:\n*   Compound (A), which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B), which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Part 1: Tautomerism Analysis**\n\nThe first part of the question asks to identify the compound that does **not** show tautomerism from the pair: benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.\n\n1.  **Understanding Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the migration of a proton and a shift of a double bond. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-hydrogen on an sp³-hybridized carbon).\n\n2.  **Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure (Keto form):** It's a six-membered ring with three carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are -CH₂- groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** Each of these -CH₂- groups is adjacent to two carbonyl groups, meaning they possess highly acidic α-hydrogens.\n    *   **Tautomerization:** The presence of these α-hydrogens allows for keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it can undergo tautomerization at all three keto sites to form 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol).\n    *   **Stability:** The resulting tautomer, phloroglucinol, is an aromatic compound, which makes it extremely stable. The equilibrium strongly favors this aromatic \"enol\" form.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione clearly **shows** tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Benzoquinone (specifically, 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It's a six-membered ring with two carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1 and 4, and two carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons are sp²-hybridized and do not have the typical α-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon required for simple keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Tautomerization:** Any rearrangement would disrupt the stable conjugated system without forming a more stable product (like an aromatic ring). Therefore, benzoquinone is not considered to show tautomerism under normal conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does **not** show tautomerism.\n\n4.  **Identifying Compound A:** Based on the analysis, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. So, A = benzoquinone.\n\n---\n\n**Part 2: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\nThe second part of the question asks to identify which compound, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate, will show optical isomerism.\n\n1.  **Understanding Optical Isomerism:** A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the central carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **will show** optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers, R and S).\n\n3.  **Analyzing Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule is planar. It possesses a center of symmetry (an inversion center) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. A molecule with a center of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule, it cannot have an enantiomer and is not optically active. Therefore, it does **not** show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Identifying Compound B:** Based on the analysis, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. So, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n---\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis matches the pair described in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\n*   **Step 1: Analyze Tautomerism for Compound A**\n\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a type of isomerism where two structures, called tautomers, are in equilibrium and readily interconvert. The most common form is **keto-enol tautomerism**, which requires a carbonyl group (keto form) and at least one **alpha-hydrogen** on an adjacent **sp3-hybridized carbon**. The proton from this alpha-carbon migrates to the carbonyl oxygen, and a double bond forms between the alpha-carbon and the carbonyl carbon, creating an enol.\n\n    *   **Compound 1: Benzoquinone (specifically, p-benzoquinone)**\n        *   Structure: It's a six-membered ring with alternating single and double bonds, and two carbonyl (C=O) groups at opposite positions (positions 1 and 4).\n        *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are part of C=C double bonds. They are sp2-hybridized, not sp3-hybridized.\n        *   Since there are no alpha-hydrogens on sp3-hybridized carbons, p-benzoquinone **does not** undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 2: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**\n        *   Structure: It's a six-membered saturated ring with three carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH2 groups.\n        *   These CH2 groups are alpha-carbons to the carbonyl groups. They are sp3-hybridized and each has two alpha-hydrogens.\n        *   These alpha-hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are located between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n        *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily undergoes tautomerization. It can tautomerize to form a very stable aromatic enol called phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). The equilibrium heavily favors this stable aromatic form.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze Optical Isomerism for Compound B**\n\n    *   **Optical isomerism** is exhibited by **chiral** molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n    *   **Compound 1: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n        *   Structure: `CH3-CH(OH)-C(=O)OCH3`.\n        *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), the one bonded to the -OH group.\n        *   It is bonded to four different groups:\n            1.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            4.  A methyl ester group (-COOCH3)\n        *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. Molecules with a chiral center are chiral and thus exhibit optical isomerism (exist as a pair of enantiomers).\n        *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **will show** optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 2: Dimethyl fumarate**\n        *   Structure: `CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3`, where the two ester groups are *trans* to each other across the C=C double bond.\n        *   The molecule is planar. It has a center of symmetry (an inversion center) midway through the C=C bond.\n        *   Molecules with a plane of symmetry or a center of symmetry are achiral.\n        *   There are no chiral centers in the molecule.\n        *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and **will not show** optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Combine the results**\n\n    *   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   The compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\n**Detailed Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\nThe problem asks us to identify two compounds from given pairs based on their chemical properties: one that does not exhibit tautomerism (A), and one that shows optical isomerism (B).\n\n**Part 1: Identifying Compound A (No Tautomerism)**\n\n*   **Principle of Tautomerism:** The most common form of tautomerism is keto-enol tautomerism. For this to occur, a molecule must possess a carbonyl group (C=O) and at least one alpha-hydrogen. An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to an sp³-hybridized carbon atom that is directly adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbon atoms between the carbonyls (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are the alpha-carbons.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** Each of these alpha-carbons is a CH₂ group. This means they are sp³-hybridized and each has two alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of these alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism to form its enol tautomer, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is a very stable aromatic compound. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is a six-membered ring with two carbon-carbon double bonds and two carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds. This makes them sp²-hybridized, and they are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since benzoquinone lacks alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon, it cannot undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n*   **Result for A:** Compound A is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying Compound B (Shows Optical Isomerism)**\n\n*   **Principle of Optical Isomerism:** A compound shows optical isomerism if its molecule is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is not superimposable on its mirror image. The most common source of chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is CH₃–CH(OH)–COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the carbon bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to four distinct groups:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is therefore chiral and **will show** optical isomerism.\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl Fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is CH₃OOC–CH=CH–COOCH₃, with the two ester groups in a *trans* position relative to the double bond.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** There are no carbon atoms in this molecule that are bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, which makes it achiral. Achiral molecules do not exhibit optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate **will not** show optical isomerism.\n*   **Result for B:** Compound B is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nCombining our findings:\n*   A (no tautomerism) = **benzoquinone**\n*   B (shows optical isomerism) = **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n1.  **Understanding Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two structural isomers, called tautomers. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the migration of a proton (H+) from an alpha-carbon (a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group) to the carbonyl oxygen, along with a shift of a double bond. A key requirement for a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of at least one hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized alpha-carbon.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring containing two carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1 and 4, and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) at positions 2-3 and 5-6.\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons alpha (adjacent) to the carbonyl groups are C2, C3, C5, and C6.\n    *   **Hybridization and Alpha-Hydrogens:** In benzoquinone, all these alpha-carbons are part of C=C double bonds, meaning they are sp²-hybridized. There are no sp³-hybridized alpha-carbons with available hydrogens. Therefore, benzoquinone cannot undergo the standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered saturated ring with three carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons alpha to the carbonyl groups are C2, C4, and C6. These are methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   **Hybridization and Alpha-Hydrogens:** These alpha-carbons are sp³-hybridized and each has two hydrogen atoms. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since it has acidic alpha-hydrogens on sp³-hybridized carbons, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily undergoes keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it exists in equilibrium with its highly stable enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is an aromatic compound.\n\n*   **Result for Part A:** Benzoquinone is the compound that does not show tautomerism. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Understanding Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl group. It is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and will exist as a pair of enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). Therefore, it shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans* isomer of dimethyl but-2-enedioate. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two -COOCH₃ groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** The molecule has no carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The two central carbons are sp²-hybridized and are part of a double bond.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, making it an achiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since dimethyl fumarate is achiral, it cannot show optical isomerism. (It does show geometrical isomerism with its *cis* counterpart, dimethyl maleate).\n\n*   **Result for Part B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the compound that shows optical isomerism. So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nCombining the results from both parts:\n*   A = benzoquinone\n*   B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\n### Analysis of Tautomerism and Optical Isomerism\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n*   **Tautomerism** is a form of isomerism where structures can interconvert through the migration of a proton, typically accompanied by a shift in double bonds. A common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an alpha-hydrogen).\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):** In this molecule, the carbon atoms adjacent to the two carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Because it lacks alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has CH2 groups at positions 2, 4, and 6, which are alpha to the carbonyl groups. These carbons have acidic alpha-hydrogens. This allows the molecule to undergo tautomerism to form its enol, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is particularly stable because it is an aromatic compound.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n*   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). Since this carbon has four different substituents, it is a chiral center, and the molecule exhibits optical isomerism, existing as a pair of enantiomers (R and S forms).\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioate. It features a carbon-carbon double bond. The molecule is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. As it is superimposable on its mirror image, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\n### Analysis of Tautomerism (A)\n\n**Benzoquinone:** For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group). The structure of p-benzoquinone shows a six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbon atoms that are part of the double bonds and are adjacent to the carbonyl groups do not have any hydrogen atoms attached; they are sp2-hybridized and bonded to other carbons in the ring. Therefore, p-benzoquinone lacks the necessary α-hydrogens and does not show tautomerism.\n\n**Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound possesses α-hydrogens on the carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6. Because of this, it can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is particularly stable because it is an aromatic compound. The presence of a stable aromatic enol form means that an equilibrium exists between the keto and enol forms.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Analysis of Optical Isomerism (B)\n\n**Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center, a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The chemical name for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is methyl lactate. The second carbon atom in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is attached to four distinct groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). This carbon is a chiral center, meaning the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism, existing as D and L isomers.\n\n**Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the trans-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. It has a carbon-carbon double bond, and the structure is planar around this bond. Due to its symmetry (it possesses a center of inversion), it is achiral and cannot be optically active. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism. Its cis-isomer, dimethyl maleate, also has a plane of symmetry and is achiral.\n\nTherefore, the compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **(A)** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   **(B)** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\n### Analysis of Tautomerism (Compound A)\n\n*   **Tautomerism** is a type of isomerism where isomers interconvert through the migration of an atom or group, most commonly a proton. Keto-enol tautomerism is a frequent type, requiring a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-hydrogen).\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone)** does not have any α-hydrogens. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds and are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms. Therefore, it cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism. While tautomerism could theoretically be drawn, the resulting structure with cumulative double bonds in a six-membered ring would be extremely unstable.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione** possesses α-hydrogens on the carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6. The presence of these hydrogens allows it to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), is particularly stable because it is an aromatic compound.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Compound B)\n\n*   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common cause of chirality is a chiral center, a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (also called methyl lactate) has a central carbon atom bonded to four distinct groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). This makes it a chiral molecule that exists as optical isomers (enantiomers).\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate** is the trans-isomer of butenedioic acid methyl ester. Due to the double bond, there is no chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and thus optically inactive. Dimethyl fumarate and dimethyl maleate are geometric isomers (diastereomers) of each other, not enantiomers.\n\nTherefore, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism**\n\n1.  **Principle of Tautomerism**: Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where molecules can readily interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound with a carbonyl group (keto form) to exhibit this, it must have at least one hydrogen atom on an adjacent sp³-hybridized carbon. This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen.\n2.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone**: The structure of p-benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups (alpha-carbons) are part of these C=C double bonds, meaning they are sp²-hybridized. Benzoquinone lacks the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon, so it cannot undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n3.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has a six-membered ring with three C=O groups.

So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   A = benzoquinone\n*   B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n### Analysis of Tautomerism and Optical Isomerism\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a type of isomerism where a molecule exists in two or more readily interconvertible structures that differ in the relative position of at least one atomic nucleus, typically a hydrogen atom. A common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):** This molecule has a ring structure with two carbonyl (C=O) groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound possesses three keto groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbon atoms located between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) each have two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is an aromatic compound, which makes it particularly stable. The equilibrium between the keto and enol forms exists, confirming that it shows tautomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of a chiral molecule is the presence of a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The IUPAC name for this compound indicates a propanoate chain with a hydroxyl (-OH) group on the second carbon. Let's examine the groups attached to the second carbon atom:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methyl ester group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since all four groups are different, the second carbon is a chiral center. Consequently, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which has a trans configuration around the carbon-carbon double bond. The structure is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral. It does not have a chiral center. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   A = benzoquinone\n*   B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:**\n    *   **Task:** Identify two specific compounds from a given list based on their chemical properties.\n    *   **Property 1 (Compound A):** Must *not* show tautomerism. The candidates are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.\n    *   **Property 2 (Compound B):** Must show optical isomerism. The candidates are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.\n    *   **Output:** Select the correct option (A, B, C, or D) that correctly identifies both compounds A and B. The final answer should be presented in a Python code block that prints the result.\n\n2.  **Analyze Part A: Tautomerism**\n    *   **Definition:** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where isomers (tautomers) can readily interconvert, most commonly through the migration of a proton and a shift of a double bond. The most frequent type is keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Key Requirement for Keto-Enol Tautomerism:** The molecule must possess an \"alpha-hydrogen\" – a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group. This alpha-carbon is typically sp³ hybridized.\n    *   **Candidate 1: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.** Its structure is a 6-membered ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups. These are sp³ hybridized carbons, and they are alpha-carbons to two carbonyl groups each. They have alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to readily tautomerize to its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is aromatic and very stable. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n    *   **Candidate 2: Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone).** Its structure is a 6-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds (they are sp² hybridized). While they have hydrogen atoms, these are not the typical alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon required for simple keto-enol tautomerism. The conversion to its corresponding \"enol\" (hydroquinone) is a reduction (a redox reaction), not a simple isomerization (tautomerism). Thus, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n    *   **Definition:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Key Requirement:** The most common cause of chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Candidate 1: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's analyze the central carbon (carbon-2). It is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n    *   **Candidate 2: Dimethyl fumarate.** This is the trans-isomer of an alkene. The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. It has a center of symmetry and is achiral. It has no chiral centers. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:**\n    *   Compound A (no tautomerism) = benzoquinone\n    *   Compound B (optical isomerism) = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n    *   Matching this pair with the given options:\n        *   A) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate  <- This is a match.\n        *   B) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n        *   C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n        *   D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n    *   The correct option is A.\n\n5.  **Construct the Python Code:**\n    *   The code will programmatically determine the correct choice based on the conclusions from the analysis.\n    *   It will define the correct compound for each property.\n    *   It will then check the list of options to find the one that matches the correct compounds for both A and B.\n    *   Finally, it will print the letter of the correct option.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the isomerism problem by identifying the correct compounds\n    for properties A and B and then selecting the corresponding multiple-choice option.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Part A: Identify the compound that does not show tautomerism.\n    # - Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has alpha-hydrogens on sp3 carbons and readily tautomerizes to the stable aromatic enol, phloroglucinol.\n    # - Benzoquinone's conversion to hydroquinone is a redox reaction, not tautomerism.

The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound with a carbonyl group (keto form) to exhibit this type of tautomerism, it must have at least one hydrogen atom on the alpha-carbon (the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group). This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen. The presence of an alpha-hydrogen on an sp³ hybridized carbon allows for the formation of an enol tautomer.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze Benzoquinone.**\n    *   The structure of p-benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups at positions 1 and 4, and two C=C double bonds.\n    *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (alpha-carbons) are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n    *   These alpha-carbons are all sp² hybridized as they are part of the ring's double bonds. They do have hydrogen atoms attached, but these are vinylic hydrogens.\n    *   Crucially, for standard keto-enol tautomerism, the alpha-carbon needs to be sp³ hybridized to allow for the formation of a new double bond without disrupting the existing framework in an unstable way. Since benzoquinone lacks sp³ hybridized alpha-carbons with alpha-hydrogens, it cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.**\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups.\n    *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (alpha-carbons) are C2, C4, and C6.\n    *   These alpha-carbons are sp³ hybridized and each has two alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it can tautomerize to form phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is an aromatic and thus very stable enol form.\n    *   Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.**\n\n*   **Conclusion for (A):** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism (B)**\n\n*   **Step 1: Understand Optical Isomerism.**\n    Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.**\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n    *   The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and will show optical isomerism.**\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze Dimethyl fumarate.**\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid.\n    *   Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   The molecule is planar around the C=C double bond.\n    *   It does not contain any chiral centers (no carbon is bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The molecule possesses a center of inversion (located at the midpoint of the C=C bond), which makes it achiral.\n    *   Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate is achiral and will not show optical isomerism.**\n\n*   **Conclusion for (B):** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer Formulation**\n\n*   Compound (A), which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B), which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n1.  **Analyze Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where molecules can interconvert by a chemical reaction, most commonly the migration of a proton. The most frequent type is keto-enol tautomerism. A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group.

These hydrogens are highly acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Tautomerization:** Due to the presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily undergoes tautomerization. It converts to its enol form, benzene-1,3,5-triol (also known as phloroglucinol). This enol form is exceptionally stable because it is an aromatic compound.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone groups opposite each other.\n    *   **Alpha-hydrogens:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds (they are sp² hybridized). While these carbons have hydrogen atoms, they are not the typical labile alpha-hydrogens found on sp³ carbons that participate in keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Tautomerization:** For benzoquinone (C₆H₄O₂) to form its corresponding phenol-like structure (hydroquinone, C₆H₆O₂), it would need to gain two hydrogen atoms. This is a change in the molecular formula, which means the reaction is a reduction, not an isomerization (tautomerism).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\n4.  **Result for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Analyze Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules.

Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n3.  **Analyze Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans* isomer of an ester with the formula CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar.

For the compounds in question, we are concerned with **keto-enol tautomerism**. The essential requirement for a ketone or aldehyde to undergo this type of tautomerism is the presence of at least one **alpha-hydrogen**—a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom directly adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** The structure of benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups at opposite ends and two C=C double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are part of these double bonds. Consequently, these alpha-carbons are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, **benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbon atoms at positions 2, 4, and 6 are situated between carbonyl groups, making them alpha-carbons. Each of these carbons is a -CH₂- group, possessing two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows the molecule to readily tautomerize to its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Analysis of Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism exhibited by **chiral** molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common feature that confers chirality is a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is `CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃`. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bearing the hydroxyl group). This carbon is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is attached to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is therefore chiral and **will show optical isomerism**.\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is `CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. This molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. It does not contain any carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The molecule possesses a center of symmetry, which makes it achiral. Achiral molecules do not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**Part 1: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism (A)**\n\n*   **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two isomers that can be interconverted, most commonly by the migration of a proton. The most frequent type is keto-enol tautomerism.\n*   For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one **alpha-hydrogen**. An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\nLet's analyze the two given compounds:\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone groups at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4).\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are the carbons involved in the C=C double bonds (at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6).\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** These alpha-carbons are each bonded to another carbon (in the ring) and a hydrogen. Wait, let me re-examine the structure of p-benzoquinone. The formula is C6H4O2. The carbons at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6 are sp2 hybridized and are part of C=C double bonds. Each of these carbons is bonded to one hydrogen atom. So, there are alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   However, for tautomerization to occur, the enol form must be reasonably stable. The enol form of benzoquinone would be hydroquinone (1,4-dihydroxybenzene). While hydroquinone is a very stable aromatic compound, the conversion from benzoquinone to hydroquinone is a **reduction** (gain of two electrons and two protons), not a simple tautomeric shift. Tautomerism is an isomerization equilibrium (same molecular formula). Benzoquinone (C6H4O2) and hydroquinone (C6H6O2) have different molecular formulas. Therefore, this is not tautomerism. The key point is that the alpha-hydrogens are on sp2 carbons, and removing one to form an enol would disrupt the conjugated system in a way that is not a typical keto-enol tautomerization. The system is already conjugated. The compound is considered non-tautomeric.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered saturated ring (cyclohexane) with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are the alpha-carbons. They are located between two carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** Each of these alpha-carbons (CH2 groups) has two hydrogen atoms. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because the resulting negative charge after deprotonation can be delocalized over two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Tautomerism:** Due to the presence of these highly acidic alpha-hydrogens, this compound readily undergoes tautomerization to form its enol isomer, **phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene)**. This enol form is aromatic and thus exceptionally stable, so the equilibrium heavily favors the enol form.\n    *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion for (A):** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism (B)**\n\n*   **Optical isomerism** is shown by **chiral** molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   A common source of chirality is the presence of a **chiral center** (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\nLet's analyze the two given compounds:\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2, the one bonded to the -OH group). It is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since all four groups attached to this carbon are different, it is a chiral center.\n    *   The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans* isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two -COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Check:** The molecule is planar. It has a plane of symmetry that contains the C=C double bond. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral. It also has a center of inversion.\n    *   Since the molecule is achiral, it cannot show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion for (B):** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism. So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer Formulation**\n\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nMatching this with the options provided:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n### Analysis of Tautomerism and Optical Isomerism\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers.

The carbon atoms that are part of the carbonyl groups (C=O) are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms. The other four carbon atoms are part of C=C double bonds and are sp2 hybridized. These carbons have vinylic hydrogens, not the required α-hydrogens on an sp3 hybridized carbon. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbon atoms at positions 2, 4, and 6 are situated between carbonyl groups and possess acidic α-hydrogens. The presence of these α-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is aromatic and particularly stable, meaning the equilibrium favors the enol form.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism, existing as two enantiomers (D and L forms).\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule has the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, which is the trans isomer of an alkene. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, which makes it achiral. It does not have any chiral centers.

Therefore, benzoquinone lacks the necessary alpha-hydrogens to undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three carbonyl groups in a six-membered ring. The carbon atoms between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are alpha-carbons, and each is bonded to two hydrogen atoms. These alpha-hydrogens allow the compound to undergo tautomerism. In fact, it readily converts to its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is exceptionally stable because it is an aromatic compound, which is a much more stable state than the non-aromatic trione form.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images.

These alpha-hydrogens allow the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is particularly stable because it is aromatic, containing a planar ring with 6 π-electrons.

The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group) on an sp³-hybridized carbon.\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with two C=C double bonds and two C=O groups at opposite ends.\n    *   Structure:\n        ```\n           O\n          //\n        HC=CH\n       /    \\\n    O=C      C=O\n       \\    /\n        HC=CH\n        ```\n    *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (α-carbons) are part of the C=C double bonds.

Since tautomers must be isomers, they must have the same molecular formula.

For keto-enol tautomerism, the most common form, a compound must typically possess an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Benzoquinone:** In the structure of 1,4-benzoquinone, the carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of a double bond and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. The other hydrogens are vinylic, meaning they are attached to carbons in a double bond. These are not readily mobile. Therefore, benzoquinone lacks the necessary α-hydrogens on a saturated carbon and does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound is in equilibrium with its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). The enol form is exceptionally stable because it is an aromatic ring, which is a highly favored energetic state. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily shows tautomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center – a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    2.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    3.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism, existing as two enantiomers (R and S forms).\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the trans-isomer with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar around the central double bond and possesses a plane of symmetry. It does not contain any chiral centers. Therefore, it is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Compound **A** is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound **B** is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Part A: Tautomerism.**\n    *   Tautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n    *   **Benzoquinone:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) groups are part of double bonds within the ring and have no attached hydrogen atoms. Therefore, benzoquinone lacks alpha-hydrogens and cannot undergo tautomerism.\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are adjacent to carbonyl groups and each has two hydrogen atoms. These are alpha-hydrogens, so this compound can and does exhibit tautomerism (to form phloroglucinol).\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does *not* show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Part B: Optical Isomerism.**\n    *   Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common cause of chirality is a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). This makes it a chiral center. Therefore, this compound will show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is a trans-alkene. It is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. It does not have any chiral centers. Therefore, it will not show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n3.  **Combine and Select the Final Answer.**\n    *   Based on the analysis, A = benzoquinone and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n    *   This combination matches option C.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the properties of four compounds to answer a multiple-choice question.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Part A: Determine which compound does not show tautomerism.\n    # Tautomerism requires alpha-hydrogens (hydrogens on the carbon next to a C=O group).\n    \n    # Analysis of Benzoquinone:\n    # The carbons next to the C=O groups are part of C=C double bonds and have no hydrogens.\n    # No alpha-hydrogens means no tautomerism.\n    compound_A_no_tautomerism = \"benzoquinone\"\n    \n    # Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:\n    # The CH2 groups between the C=O groups have alpha-hydrogens.\n    # It shows tautomerism (forming phloroglucinol).\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Analysis for Tautomerism (Compound A)\")\n    print(\" - Benzoquinone has no alpha-hydrogens, so it does not show tautomerism.\")\n    print(\" - Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has alpha-hydrogens, so it shows tautomerism.\")\n    print(f\" - Therefore, compound A (does not show tautomerism) is: {compound_A_no_tautomerism}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Part B: Determine which compound shows optical isomerism.\n    # Optical isomerism requires a chiral center (a carbon with four different groups attached).\n    \n    # Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:\n    # The central carbon is attached to -H, -OH, -CH3, and -COOCH3.\n    # These four groups are different, so it has a chiral center and shows optical isomerism.\n    compound_B_optical_isomerism = \"methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\"\n    \n    # Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:\n    # This molecule is a trans-alkene and is achiral (it has a plane of symmetry).\n    # It has no chiral centers and does not show optical isomerism.\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Analysis for Optical Isomerism (Compound B)\")\n    print(\" - Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center (a carbon with 4 different groups), so it shows optical isomerism.\")\n    print(\" - Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not have a chiral center, so it does not show optical isomerism.\")\n    print(f\" - Therefore, compound B (shows optical isomerism) is: {compound_B_optical_isomerism}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: Match the findings with the given options.\n    # Option A: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Incorrect)\n    # Option B: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate (Incorrect)\n    # Option C: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Correct)\n    # Option D: A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate (Incorrect)\n    \n    final_choice = \"C\"\n    \n    print(\"Step 3: Conclusion\")\n    print(f\"The correct option is the one where A is '{compound_A_no_tautomerism}' and B is '{compound_B_optical_isomerism}'.\")\n    print(\"This corresponds to option C.\")\n    \n    # Final Answer\n    print(f\"<<<{final_choice}>>>\")\n\nsolve_chemistry_problem()\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: Step 1: Analysis for Tautomerism (Compound A)\n - Benzoquinone has no alpha-hydrogens, so it does not show tautomerism.\n - Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has alpha-hydrogens, so it shows tautomerism.\n - Therefore, compound A (does not show tautomerism) is: benzoquinone\n------------------------------\nStep 2: Analysis for Optical Isomerism (Compound B)\n - Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center (a carbon with 4 different groups), so it shows optical isomerism.\n - Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not have a chiral center, so it does not show optical isomerism.\n - Therefore, compound B (shows optical isomerism) is: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n------------------------------\nStep 3: Conclusion\nThe correct option is the one where A is 'benzoquinone' and B is 'methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate'.\nThis corresponds to option C.\n<<<C>>>\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### **Part 1: Analysis of Tautomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify the compound between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione that does **not** show tautomerism.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Tautomerism**\nTautomerism is a form of isomerism where isomers, called tautomers, are in equilibrium and can readily interconvert. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the migration of a proton (H+) and the shifting of a double bond. A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on an sp³ hybridized carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Benzoquinone**\n*   **Structure:** Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone) is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups opposite each other and two carbon-carbon double bonds. Its molecular formula is C₆H₄O₂.\n    ```\n       O\n      //\n    HC==CH\n     |  |\n    O=C--C=O\n     |  |\n    HC==CH\n    ```\n    A more accurate representation:\n    ```\n       O\n      //\n    C\n   / \\\\\n  HC  CH\n  ||  ||\n  HC  CH\n   \\ //\n    C\n   \\\\\n    O\n    ```\n*   **Check for Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are called alpha-carbons. In benzoquinone, all four carbons adjacent to the two carbonyl groups are part of C=C double bonds. They are sp² hybridized. There are no sp³ hybridized alpha-carbons with attached hydrogens.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since benzoquinone lacks the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon, it cannot undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**\n*   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups.\n    ```\n         O\n        //\n      C\n     /  \\\n   H₂C    CH₂\n    |      |\n  O=C      C=O\n     \\    /\n       CH₂\n    ```\n*   **Check for Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are all alpha-carbons. Each is an sp³ hybridized carbon bonded to two hydrogen atoms. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n*   **Tautomerization:** Due to the presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can readily tautomerize. Its enol form is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic compound. The stability gained from forming an aromatic ring makes this tautomerization highly favorable.\n    *Keto form (less stable)* <=> *Enol form (phloroglucinol, aromatic, more stable)*\n*   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism.\n\n**Summary for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n---\n\n### **Part 2: Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify which compound between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate will show optical isomerism.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Optical Isomerism**\nOptical isomerism occurs in molecules that are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid).\n    ```\n          O\n         //\n    CH₃ - C*H - C - O - CH₃\n          |\n          OH\n    ```\n*   **Check for Chirality:** Let's examine the carbon atom labeled with an asterisk (C2).\n    *   Group 1: -H (hydrogen)\n    *   Group 2: -OH (hydroxyl group)\n    *   Group 3: -CH₃ (methyl group)\n    *   Group 4: -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl group)\n    Since all four groups attached to this carbon are different, it is a chiral center. The molecule as a whole lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n*   **Conclusion:** Because it contains a chiral center, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule. It exists as a pair of enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images) and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid.\n    ```\n         H         COOCH₃\n          \\       /\n           C === C\n          /       \\\n    CH₃OOC         H\n    ```\n*   **Check for Chirality:**\n    *   There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups, so there are no chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry (inversion center) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Any molecule with a center of symmetry is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule. It is superimposable on its mirror image and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nMatching this result with the given options:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n1.  **Understanding Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where molecules, called tautomers, can readily interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the migration of a proton (H+) and a shift in the location of a double bond. A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen—a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are -CH2- groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The hydrogens on carbons 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-hydrogens because they are adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Since these alpha-hydrogens are present, the compound can undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Stability:** The tautomerization of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can happen at all three keto sites, leading to the formation of benzene-1,3,5-triol (also known as phloroglucinol). This enol form is an aromatic compound and is therefore exceptionally stable. The equilibrium heavily favors this aromatic enol form.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione clearly shows tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Benzoquinone (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone groups opposite each other. The structure is cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. While these carbons do have hydrogen atoms, attempting to form an enol tautomer would disrupt the stable conjugated system of the quinone without forming a fully aromatic ring. This makes the potential enol form very unstable.\n    *   **Equilibrium:** Because the enol form is highly unstable compared to the keto form, the equilibrium lies almost entirely with the keto (quinone) form. For practical purposes in chemistry, it is considered a non-tautomerizing ketone. The related compound, hydroquinone, is formed by a reduction reaction (gain of two H atoms), not by tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does not show significant tautomerism.\n\n4.  **Decision for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Understanding Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and will exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Therefore, it will show optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which has a *trans* configuration around the double bond: CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality Check:** The molecule does not have any chiral centers. Furthermore, the molecule is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry that cuts through the C=C double bond. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since dimethyl fumarate is achiral, it is superimposable on its mirror image and will not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Decision for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Combination:**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\n### Part A: Tautomerism Analysis\n\nTautomers are isomers of a compound that differ only in the position of a proton and a double bond. A common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** In the structure of p-benzoquinone, there are no hydrogen atoms on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (alpha-carbons). The hydrogens present are attached to the doubly bonded carbons, which are vinylic hydrogens. The absence of alpha-hydrogens means that benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three ketone groups. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 each have two hydrogen atoms. These hydrogens are alpha-hydrogens to two carbonyl groups, which makes them particularly acidic. Due to the presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily undergoes keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is an aromatic compound and is significantly more stable, meaning the equilibrium favors the enol form.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism Analysis\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center— a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). This makes the carbon atom a chiral center, and thus the molecule will exhibit optical isomerism, existing as two enantiomers (R and S isomers).\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule, with the formula CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, is the trans-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. It does not contain any carbon atom bonded to four different groups, so it has no chiral center. The molecule is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Compound **A** (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound **B** (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\n### Analysis of Compounds\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n*   **Tautomerism** is an isomerization reaction that involves the migration of a proton and a shift in the location of a double bond. For keto-enol tautomerism, the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is typically required.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** This molecule has a six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Therefore, benzoquinone lacks alpha-hydrogens and cannot undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism. Attempting to draw a tautomer would result in a highly unstable structure with cumulated double bonds within the ring.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound possesses three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 each have two hydrogen atoms. These are alpha-hydrogens, situated between two carbonyl groups, making them acidic and readily available for tautomerization. This compound exists in equilibrium with its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). The enol form is exceptionally stable because it is aromatic, containing a planar ring with 6 π-electrons.\n\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n*   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images.

Consequently, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as a pair of enantiomers (optical isomers).\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. It is a *trans* isomer. The molecule has a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral. While it exhibits geometric (cis-trans) isomerism, it does not have a chiral center and is not optically active.\n\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Compound **A** (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound **B** (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nTo determine the correct option, we must analyze both parts of the question: which compound does not show tautomerism (A) and which shows optical isomerism (B).\n\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\nTautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers. For keto-enol tautomerism, the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group) is typically required.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** The structure of benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Because it lacks alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone does not undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbon atoms between the carbonyls (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are alpha-carbons, and each is bonded to hydrogen atoms. The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows it to undergo tautomerism. Its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), is particularly stable because it is aromatic.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common source of chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  a methyl group (–CH₃)\n    2.  a hydroxyl group (–OH)\n    3.  a hydrogen atom (–H)\n    4.  an ester group (–COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center, and the molecule exhibits optical isomerism.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The chemical formula is CH₃OOC–CH=CH–COOCH₃. This molecule is a trans-isomer and does not contain any carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The carbons of the double bond are each bonded to only three groups. Therefore, it does not have a chiral center and is not optically active.\n\nThus, the compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the findings:\n*   (A) is benzoquinone.\n*   (B) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**Part 1: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism (A)**\n\nTautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, is an equilibrium between a keto form (containing a C=O bond) and an enol form (containing a C=C bond adjacent to an -OH group). This process requires the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen,\" which is a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl group. Crucially, this alpha-carbon must be sp3-hybridized.\n\nLet's analyze the two compounds given for part A:\n\n1.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are methylene groups (-CH2-).\n    *   **Alpha-hydrogens:** Each ketone group has two adjacent alpha-carbons. For example, the ketone at C1 has alpha-carbons at C2 and C6. Both C2 and C6 are sp3-hybridized and each has two hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Tautomerism:** Because it possesses alpha-hydrogens on sp3-hybridized carbons, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it can tautomerize multiple times to form 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic and therefore very stable compound. The equilibrium strongly favors this aromatic enol form.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with two ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1 and 4, and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) at positions 2-3 and 5-6.\n    *   **Alpha-hydrogens:** The carbons alpha (adjacent) to the ketone groups are the carbons involved in the double bonds (C2, C3, C5, C6). These carbons are all sp2-hybridized.\n    *   **Tautomerism:** Benzoquinone lacks any sp3-hybridized alpha-carbons. Therefore, it does not have the necessary type of alpha-hydrogens to undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does *not* show tautomerism.\n\n**Therefore, compound (A) is benzoquinone.**\n\n**Part 2: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism (B)**\n\nOptical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\nLet's analyze the two compounds given for part B:\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Let's examine carbon-2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n    *   **Groups attached to C2:**\n        1.  -H (hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH3 (methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH3 (methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   **Chirality:** Since carbon-2 is bonded to four distinctly different groups, it is a chiral center. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and *will* show optical isomerism (it exists as two enantiomers).\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups (-COOCH3) are in a *trans* position across the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar. It has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and also a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Molecules with a plane of symmetry or a center of symmetry are achiral. There are no chiral centers in the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule and does *not* show optical isomerism.\n\n**Therefore, compound (B) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.**\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\n1.  **Definition of Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where isomers can be interconverted by the migration of an atom or group, most commonly a proton. The most prevalent type is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the interconversion of a keto form (containing a C=O group) and an enol form (containing a C=C-OH group). A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of at least one alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O). This alpha-carbon must be sp³ hybridized.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with single bonds between carbons and three carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are -CH₂- groups.\n    *   **Alpha-hydrogens:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons to the carbonyl groups. Each of these carbons is sp³ hybridized and bears two hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since it has sp³-hybridized alpha-carbons with hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it readily tautomerizes to its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism**.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two carbonyl (C=O) groups at opposite positions (1 and 4).\n    *   **Alpha-hydrogens:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6) are part of carbon-carbon double bonds. These carbons are sp² hybridized.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone lacks the necessary alpha-hydrogens on sp³-hybridized carbons. Tautomerization is not possible under normal conditions. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n4.  **Result for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\n1.  **Definition of Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon at position 2 is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and non-superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene with a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃) on each of the double-bonded carbons. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar around the double bond. It possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry at the center of the C=C bond). Molecules with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion are achiral and cannot be optically active. There are no chiral centers in this molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule. Therefore, **it will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n4.  **Result for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nThis is a two-part question that tests knowledge of tautomerism and optical isomerism.\n\n### **Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a form of isomerism where two structural isomers, called tautomers, are in rapid equilibrium. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have an **α-hydrogen**—a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** The structure is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons are sp² hybridized and do not have the required α-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. The carbons between the ketones (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are sp³-hybridized and each possesses two α-hydrogens. These hydrogens are highly acidic and can be readily removed to form the enol tautomer, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is aromatic and very stable.

For keto-enol tautomerism, a key requirement is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen—a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** This molecule consists of a six-membered ring with two opposing carbonyl groups (C=O) and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The hydrogen atoms are attached to the double-bonded carbons (sp2-hybridized carbons). While these are technically alpha-hydrogens, their removal is difficult. If tautomerism were to occur, it would create a highly strained and unstable structure with adjacent double bonds within the ring, which is energetically unfavorable. Consequently, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three ketone groups and alpha-hydrogens located on the carbons between them. It can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (also known as phloroglucinol), is an aromatic compound. The stability gained from achieving aromaticity is significant, so not only does cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione show tautomerism, but its enol form is particularly stable.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common source of chirality is a chiral center: a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Methyl lactate):** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is attached to four distinct groups: a methyl group (-CH₃), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). This makes the carbon atom a chiral center, and the molecule exists as two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Thus, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, and it is the *trans* isomer, meaning the two methoxycarbonyl groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond. This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbon-carbon double bond, making it superimposable on its mirror image. Because it is achiral, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone (A), and the compound that will show optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (B).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nMy plan is to solve this chemistry problem by breaking it down into two parts, as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n1.  I will analyze the structure of **benzoquinone**. Tautomerism (specifically keto-enol tautomerism) requires an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on an sp3-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl (C=O) group. In 1,4-benzoquinone, all carbon atoms in the ring are sp2-hybridized (part of C=C or C=O double bonds), so there are no alpha-hydrogens. Thus, it cannot undergo tautomerism.\n2.  I will analyze the structure of **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**. The carbon atoms at positions 2, 4, and 6 are sp3-hybridized and each has two hydrogen atoms. These are alpha-hydrogens, situated between two carbonyl groups, making them highly acidic and mobile. This compound readily tautomerizes to its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol.\n3.  Conclusion for Part 1: **Benzoquinone** is the compound (A) that does not show tautomerism.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism.**\n1.  I will analyze the structure of **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. Optical isomerism requires a chiral center, which is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to a hydrogen (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methyl ester group (-COOCH3). Since these four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center, and the molecule will exhibit optical isomerism.\n2.  I will analyze the structure of **dimethyl fumarate**. This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene. It is planar and has a center of symmetry. It does not contain any chiral centers. Therefore, it is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n3.  Conclusion for Part 2: **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** is the compound (B) that shows optical isomerism.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, compound A is benzoquinone and compound B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. This matches option D. I will now write the Python code to reflect this logic and print the final answer.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze tautomerism for the first pair of compounds.\n# Tautomerism requires an alpha-hydrogen (an H on an sp3 carbon next to a C=O).\n# Benzoquinone has only sp2 carbons in its ring, so no alpha-hydrogens.\n# Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has CH2 groups between the C=O groups, which contain alpha-hydrogens.\ncompound_that_does_not_show_tautomerism = \"benzoquinone\"\n\n# Step 2: Analyze optical isomerism for the second pair of compounds.\n# Optical isomerism requires a chiral center (a carbon with four different attached groups).\n# Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: The central carbon is bonded to -H, -OH, -CH3, and -COOCH3.

Understanding Tautomerism:**\nTautomerism is a form of isomerism where isomers, called tautomers, readily interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have a hydrogen atom on a carbon that is adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen, and the carbon it is attached to is the alpha-carbon, which is typically sp³-hybridized.\n\n**2. Analyzing Benzoquinone:**\n*   **Structure:** Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone) is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4) and two carbon-carbon double bonds. Its formula is C₆H₄O₂.\n*   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n*   **Check for Alpha-Hydrogens:** Each of these alpha-carbons is part of a double bond (sp²-hybridized). They do have hydrogen atoms attached, but these are vinylic hydrogens, not hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone lacks the required sp³-hybridized alpha-carbon with an alpha-hydrogen. Therefore, it cannot undergo the typical keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n**3. Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n*   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons between the carbonyls (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are CH₂ groups.\n*   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are all alpha-carbons to two carbonyl groups each. For example, the carbon at position 2 is alpha to both the C1 carbonyl and the C3 carbonyl.\n*   **Check for Alpha-Hydrogens:** These alpha-carbons are sp³-hybridized and each has two hydrogens. These hydrogens are quite acidic because the negative charge that results from removing one is stabilized by two carbonyl groups.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has acidic alpha-hydrogens and readily undergoes tautomerism. Its enol form is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic and very stable compound. This provides a strong driving force for tautomerization.\n\n**Outcome for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n---\n\n### **Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism**\n\n**1. Understanding Optical Isomerism:**\nOptical isomerism occurs when a molecule is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n**2. Analyzing Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n*   **Structure:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n    *   The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n        1.  -H (Hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (Hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (Methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (Methoxycarbonyl group)\n*   **Conclusion:** Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. The molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry, so it is chiral. Chiral molecules exist as pairs of enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images) and are optically active. Therefore, it will show optical isomerism.\n\n**3. Analyzing Dimethyl fumarate:**\n*   **Structure:** This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl but-2-enedioate. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n*   **Chirality Check:**\n    *   There are no chiral centers (no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The molecule has a center of inversion (located at the midpoint of the C=C bond).\n    *   The presence of a center of inversion means the molecule is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule, it is optically inactive and will not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Outcome for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer Derivation**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nCombining these two findings, we match them with the given options:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a form of isomerism where two structural isomers, called tautomers, are in rapid equilibrium. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the migration of a proton and a shift in the position of a double bond. A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). This alpha-carbon must typically be sp³ hybridized.\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone, Cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring containing two carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1 and 4, and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) at positions 2 and 5.\n    *   **Alpha-carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n    *   **Analysis:** All these alpha-carbons are sp² hybridized as they are part of the C=C double bonds. They do not have the required sp³-hybridized carbon with an attached hydrogen atom next to the carbonyl group. Therefore, benzoquinone cannot undergo the standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are methylene groups (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Alpha-carbons:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are all alpha-carbons to two carbonyl groups each.\n    *   **Analysis:** These alpha-carbons are sp³ hybridized and each has two hydrogen atoms attached. These alpha-hydrogens are highly acidic and readily removed, allowing the molecule to undergo tautomerism. The resulting enol form is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic compound. Due to the high stability gained from aromaticity, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione exists almost entirely as its tautomer, phloroglucinol.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism.\n\n*   **Result for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common source of chirality is a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is `CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃`.\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2. It is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  A hydroxyl group (`-OH`)\n        2.  A hydrogen atom (`-H`)\n        3.  A methyl group (`-CH₃`)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (`-COOCH₃`)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism (it has two enantiomers).\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is `CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃` where the two `-COOCH₃` groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond, but it does not have any carbon atom bonded to four different groups. There are no chiral centers. Furthermore, the molecule possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry), which makes it achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and will not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Result for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Summary**\n\n*   **Compound A** (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   **Compound B** (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to the pair given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\n### Analysis of Tautomerism and Optical Isomerism\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomers are isomers that readily interconvert, most commonly through the migration of a proton and a shift in the location of a double bond. For keto-enol tautomerism, the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group) is typically required.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** This molecule has a six-membered ring structure with two ketone groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Therefore, p-benzoquinone lacks the necessary alpha-hydrogens to undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound possesses alpha-hydrogens on the carbons situated between the ketone groups. It can undergo keto-enol tautomerism to form its enol isomer, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). The enol form is particularly stable because it is aromatic, meaning the equilibrium favors the enol.\n\nBased on this, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center, a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula for this ester is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  a methyl group (–CH₃)\n    2.  a hydroxyl group (–OH)\n    3.  a hydrogen atom (–H)\n    4.  an ester group (–COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will exhibit optical isomerism and exist as a pair of enantiomers (L and D isomers).\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. It is a *trans* isomer. The carbons of the double bond are each bonded to only three groups, so there is no chiral center. The molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\nTautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two interconvertible structural isomers. In the context of keto-enol tautomerism, a compound must typically possess an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group) to undergo this process.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone:** In the structure of p-benzoquinone, the carbonyl carbons do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. The other four carbons in the ring are sp2 hybridized (part of a double bond) and do not have alpha-hydrogens in the traditional sense required for keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has CH2 groups at positions 2, 4, and 6. The hydrogens on these carbons are alpha-hydrogens to the adjacent carbonyl groups. This allows it to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is particularly stable because it is an aromatic compound.\n\nThus, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center, a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). This makes the carbon a chiral center, and the molecule exhibits optical isomerism, existing as L and D enantiomers.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule has the formula CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with a *trans* configuration across the carbon-carbon double bond. It does not contain any chiral centers. Due to the presence of a center of inversion, the molecule is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nCombining the findings:\n*   (A) The compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone.\n*   (B) The compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\n### Analysis of Compound (A): Tautomerism\n\nTautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers. For keto-enol tautomerism, the presence of an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is typically required.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** In this molecule, the carbon atoms adjacent to the two carbonyl groups are part of carbon-carbon double bonds and do not have any attached hydrogen atoms. Without an α-hydrogen, benzoquinone cannot undergo the necessary proton transfer to form an enol tautomer. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound possesses hydrogen atoms on the carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6, which are α-hydrogens to the carbonyl groups. It can undergo keto-enol tautomerism to form its enol, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). This enol form is exceptionally stable because it is an aromatic compound, which fulfills Hückel's rule (cyclic, planar, conjugated, with 6 π-electrons). Because its enol form is highly stabilized by aromaticity, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily shows tautomerism.\n\nThus, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Analysis of Compound (B): Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center, a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The second carbon atom in the chain is bonded to four distinct groups: a methyl group (-CH₃), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since it has a chiral center, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and thus exhibits optical isomerism, existing as two enantiomers (R and S forms).\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the trans-isomer of butenedioic acid dimethyl ester (CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃). Due to the carbon-carbon double bond, the molecule is planar. This planarity results in a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral and therefore optically inactive. While it has a stereoisomer (its cis- geometric isomer, dimethyl maleate), it does not have optical isomers.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the findings:\n*   Compound (A), which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B), which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Part 1: Tautomerism Analysis**\n\nThe first part of the question asks to identify the compound that does **not** show tautomerism from the pair: benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.\n\n1.  **Understanding Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the migration of a proton and a shift of a double bond. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-hydrogen on an sp³-hybridized carbon).\n\n2.  **Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure (Keto form):** It's a six-membered ring with three carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are -CH₂- groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** Each of these -CH₂- groups is adjacent to two carbonyl groups, meaning they possess highly acidic α-hydrogens.\n    *   **Tautomerization:** The presence of these α-hydrogens allows for keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it can undergo tautomerization at all three keto sites to form 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol).\n    *   **Stability:** The resulting tautomer, phloroglucinol, is an aromatic compound, which makes it extremely stable. The equilibrium strongly favors this aromatic \"enol\" form.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione clearly **shows** tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Benzoquinone (specifically, 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It's a six-membered ring with two carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1 and 4, and two carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons are sp²-hybridized and do not have the typical α-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon required for simple keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Tautomerization:** Any rearrangement would disrupt the stable conjugated system without forming a more stable product (like an aromatic ring). Therefore, benzoquinone is not considered to show tautomerism under normal conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does **not** show tautomerism.\n\n4.  **Identifying Compound A:** Based on the analysis, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. So, A = benzoquinone.\n\n---\n\n**Part 2: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\nThe second part of the question asks to identify which compound, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate, will show optical isomerism.\n\n1.  **Understanding Optical Isomerism:** A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the central carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **will show** optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers, R and S).\n\n3.  **Analyzing Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule is planar. It possesses a center of symmetry (an inversion center) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. A molecule with a center of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule, it cannot have an enantiomer and is not optically active. Therefore, it does **not** show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Identifying Compound B:** Based on the analysis, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. So, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n---\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis matches the pair described in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\n*   **Step 1: Analyze Tautomerism for Compound A**\n\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a type of isomerism where two structures, called tautomers, are in equilibrium and readily interconvert. The most common form is **keto-enol tautomerism**, which requires a carbonyl group (keto form) and at least one **alpha-hydrogen** on an adjacent **sp3-hybridized carbon**. The proton from this alpha-carbon migrates to the carbonyl oxygen, and a double bond forms between the alpha-carbon and the carbonyl carbon, creating an enol.\n\n    *   **Compound 1: Benzoquinone (specifically, p-benzoquinone)**\n        *   Structure: It's a six-membered ring with alternating single and double bonds, and two carbonyl (C=O) groups at opposite positions (positions 1 and 4).\n        *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are part of C=C double bonds. They are sp2-hybridized, not sp3-hybridized.\n        *   Since there are no alpha-hydrogens on sp3-hybridized carbons, p-benzoquinone **does not** undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 2: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**\n        *   Structure: It's a six-membered saturated ring with three carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH2 groups.\n        *   These CH2 groups are alpha-carbons to the carbonyl groups. They are sp3-hybridized and each has two alpha-hydrogens.\n        *   These alpha-hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are located between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n        *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily undergoes tautomerization. It can tautomerize to form a very stable aromatic enol called phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). The equilibrium heavily favors this stable aromatic form.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze Optical Isomerism for Compound B**\n\n    *   **Optical isomerism** is exhibited by **chiral** molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n    *   **Compound 1: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n        *   Structure: `CH3-CH(OH)-C(=O)OCH3`.\n        *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), the one bonded to the -OH group.\n        *   It is bonded to four different groups:\n            1.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            4.  A methyl ester group (-COOCH3)\n        *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. Molecules with a chiral center are chiral and thus exhibit optical isomerism (exist as a pair of enantiomers).\n        *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **will show** optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 2: Dimethyl fumarate**\n        *   Structure: `CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3`, where the two ester groups are *trans* to each other across the C=C double bond.\n        *   The molecule is planar. It has a center of symmetry (an inversion center) midway through the C=C bond.\n        *   Molecules with a plane of symmetry or a center of symmetry are achiral.\n        *   There are no chiral centers in the molecule.\n        *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and **will not show** optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Combine the results**\n\n    *   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   The compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\n**Detailed Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\nThe problem asks us to identify two compounds from given pairs based on their chemical properties: one that does not exhibit tautomerism (A), and one that shows optical isomerism (B).\n\n**Part 1: Identifying Compound A (No Tautomerism)**\n\n*   **Principle of Tautomerism:** The most common form of tautomerism is keto-enol tautomerism. For this to occur, a molecule must possess a carbonyl group (C=O) and at least one alpha-hydrogen. An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to an sp³-hybridized carbon atom that is directly adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbon atoms between the carbonyls (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are the alpha-carbons.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** Each of these alpha-carbons is a CH₂ group. This means they are sp³-hybridized and each has two alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of these alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism to form its enol tautomer, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is a very stable aromatic compound. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is a six-membered ring with two carbon-carbon double bonds and two carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds. This makes them sp²-hybridized, and they are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since benzoquinone lacks alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon, it cannot undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n*   **Result for A:** Compound A is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying Compound B (Shows Optical Isomerism)**\n\n*   **Principle of Optical Isomerism:** A compound shows optical isomerism if its molecule is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is not superimposable on its mirror image. The most common source of chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is CH₃–CH(OH)–COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the carbon bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to four distinct groups:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is therefore chiral and **will show** optical isomerism.\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl Fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is CH₃OOC–CH=CH–COOCH₃, with the two ester groups in a *trans* position relative to the double bond.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** There are no carbon atoms in this molecule that are bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, which makes it achiral. Achiral molecules do not exhibit optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate **will not** show optical isomerism.\n*   **Result for B:** Compound B is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nCombining our findings:\n*   A (no tautomerism) = **benzoquinone**\n*   B (shows optical isomerism) = **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n1.  **Understanding Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two structural isomers, called tautomers. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the migration of a proton (H+) from an alpha-carbon (a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group) to the carbonyl oxygen, along with a shift of a double bond. A key requirement for a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of at least one hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized alpha-carbon.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring containing two carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1 and 4, and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) at positions 2-3 and 5-6.\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons alpha (adjacent) to the carbonyl groups are C2, C3, C5, and C6.\n    *   **Hybridization and Alpha-Hydrogens:** In benzoquinone, all these alpha-carbons are part of C=C double bonds, meaning they are sp²-hybridized. There are no sp³-hybridized alpha-carbons with available hydrogens. Therefore, benzoquinone cannot undergo the standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered saturated ring with three carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons alpha to the carbonyl groups are C2, C4, and C6. These are methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   **Hybridization and Alpha-Hydrogens:** These alpha-carbons are sp³-hybridized and each has two hydrogen atoms. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since it has acidic alpha-hydrogens on sp³-hybridized carbons, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily undergoes keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it exists in equilibrium with its highly stable enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is an aromatic compound.\n\n*   **Result for Part A:** Benzoquinone is the compound that does not show tautomerism. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Understanding Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl group. It is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and will exist as a pair of enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). Therefore, it shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans* isomer of dimethyl but-2-enedioate. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two -COOCH₃ groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** The molecule has no carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The two central carbons are sp²-hybridized and are part of a double bond.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, making it an achiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since dimethyl fumarate is achiral, it cannot show optical isomerism. (It does show geometrical isomerism with its *cis* counterpart, dimethyl maleate).\n\n*   **Result for Part B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the compound that shows optical isomerism. So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nCombining the results from both parts:\n*   A = benzoquinone\n*   B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\n### Analysis of Tautomerism and Optical Isomerism\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n*   **Tautomerism** is a form of isomerism where structures can interconvert through the migration of a proton, typically accompanied by a shift in double bonds. A common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an alpha-hydrogen).\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):** In this molecule, the carbon atoms adjacent to the two carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Because it lacks alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has CH2 groups at positions 2, 4, and 6, which are alpha to the carbonyl groups. These carbons have acidic alpha-hydrogens. This allows the molecule to undergo tautomerism to form its enol, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is particularly stable because it is an aromatic compound.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n*   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). Since this carbon has four different substituents, it is a chiral center, and the molecule exhibits optical isomerism, existing as a pair of enantiomers (R and S forms).\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioate. It features a carbon-carbon double bond. The molecule is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. As it is superimposable on its mirror image, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\n### Analysis of Tautomerism (A)\n\n**Benzoquinone:** For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group). The structure of p-benzoquinone shows a six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbon atoms that are part of the double bonds and are adjacent to the carbonyl groups do not have any hydrogen atoms attached; they are sp2-hybridized and bonded to other carbons in the ring. Therefore, p-benzoquinone lacks the necessary α-hydrogens and does not show tautomerism.\n\n**Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound possesses α-hydrogens on the carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6. Because of this, it can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is particularly stable because it is an aromatic compound. The presence of a stable aromatic enol form means that an equilibrium exists between the keto and enol forms.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Analysis of Optical Isomerism (B)\n\n**Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center, a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The chemical name for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is methyl lactate. The second carbon atom in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is attached to four distinct groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). This carbon is a chiral center, meaning the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism, existing as D and L isomers.\n\n**Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the trans-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. It has a carbon-carbon double bond, and the structure is planar around this bond. Due to its symmetry (it possesses a center of inversion), it is achiral and cannot be optically active. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism. Its cis-isomer, dimethyl maleate, also has a plane of symmetry and is achiral.\n\nTherefore, the compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **(A)** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   **(B)** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\n### Analysis of Tautomerism (Compound A)\n\n*   **Tautomerism** is a type of isomerism where isomers interconvert through the migration of an atom or group, most commonly a proton. Keto-enol tautomerism is a frequent type, requiring a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-hydrogen).\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone)** does not have any α-hydrogens. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds and are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms. Therefore, it cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism. While tautomerism could theoretically be drawn, the resulting structure with cumulative double bonds in a six-membered ring would be extremely unstable.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione** possesses α-hydrogens on the carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6. The presence of these hydrogens allows it to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), is particularly stable because it is an aromatic compound.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Compound B)\n\n*   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common cause of chirality is a chiral center, a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (also called methyl lactate) has a central carbon atom bonded to four distinct groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). This makes it a chiral molecule that exists as optical isomers (enantiomers).\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate** is the trans-isomer of butenedioic acid methyl ester. Due to the double bond, there is no chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and thus optically inactive. Dimethyl fumarate and dimethyl maleate are geometric isomers (diastereomers) of each other, not enantiomers.\n\nTherefore, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
