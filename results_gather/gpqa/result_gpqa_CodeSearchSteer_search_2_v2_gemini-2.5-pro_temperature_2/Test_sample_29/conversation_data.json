    "To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we first need to calculate the wavelength of the light it *emits*. From there, we can deduce the absorbed wavelength and its corresponding color.\n\n### 1. Calculate the Wavelength of Emitted Light\nThe relationship between the energy (E) of a photon and its wavelength (λ) is given by the formula:\nE = hc/λ\nwhere:\n*   *h* is Planck's constant (4.1357 x 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s)\n*   *c* is the speed of light (3.00 x 10⁸ m/s)\n*   *E* is the energy of the light (given as 2.3393 eV)\n\nA convenient shortcut for this calculation is the formula:\nλ (nm) ≈ 1240 / E (eV)\n\nUsing this formula:\nλ_emitted ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 530 nm\n\n### 2. Determine the Color of Emitted Light\nA wavelength of 530 nm falls within the **green** region of the visible light spectrum (approximately 495 nm to 570 nm). So, the textile dye emits green light.\n\n### 3. Determine the Color of Absorbed Light\nFluorescence, the phenomenon described, involves a molecule absorbing light at one wavelength and then emitting it at a longer, lower-energy wavelength. This energy difference is known as the Stokes shift. Therefore, the light absorbed by the compound must have a higher energy and a shorter wavelength than the green light it emits.\n\nLet's examine the options:\n*   **Yellow Light:** Wavelength of ~570–590 nm (Longer than 530 nm, lower energy).\n*   **Red Light:** Wavelength of ~620–750 nm (Longer than 530 nm, lower energy).\n*   **Violet Light:** Wavelength of ~380–450 nm (Shorter than 530 nm, higher energy).\n*   **Blue Light:** Wavelength of ~450–495 nm (Shorter than 530 nm, higher energy).\n\nBoth blue and violet light have higher energy than the emitted green light and could potentially be absorbed. However, the energy transition from absorbing blue light to emitting green light represents a very common and typical Stokes shift for organic dyes. For instance, the well-known green fluorescent protein (GFP) absorbs blue light to emit green light. An absorption in the blue region is the most direct and common cause for an emission in the adjacent green region of the spectrum.\n\nThus, the organic compound most likely absorbs blue light.\n\n<<<A>>>"
