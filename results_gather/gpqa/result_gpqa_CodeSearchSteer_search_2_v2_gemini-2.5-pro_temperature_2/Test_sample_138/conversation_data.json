    "The reaction described involves the treatment of a starting material with sodium nitrite (NaNO₂), hydrochloric acid (HCl), and water (H₂O) to produce a diketone. This set of reagents in situ generates nitrous acid (HNO₂), which is a key reactant for the nitrosation of ketones. This reaction specifically converts a ketone into an α-diketone (a 1,2-diketone). The mechanism proceeds by converting the ketone to its enol form, which then reacts with the nitrosonium ion (NO⁺) generated from the nitrous acid. This initially forms an α-nitroso ketone, which tautomerizes to an oxime. Subsequent hydrolysis of the oxime yields the final α-diketone product. For this reaction to occur, the starting material must be a ketone that possesses at least one hydrogen atom on an adjacent carbon (the α-carbon).\n\n**Reaction A: Formation of 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione**\n\nThe product is an α-diketone with carbonyl groups at positions 1 and 2 of a cyclohexane ring. The starting material must therefore be a ketone to undergo α-nitrosation. The logical precursor is 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one. In this molecule, the carbonyl group is at position 1. The reaction introduces a second carbonyl group at an adjacent position (the α-position), which is C-2 (or C-6), leading to the formation of 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione.\n\n**Reaction B: Formation of 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione**\n\nSimilarly, the product 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione is an α-diketone. The carbonyl groups are at positions 2 and 3. The starting material must be a ketone that can be oxidized at the α-position to yield this product. If we start with 5-methylhexan-2-one, the carbonyl group is at C-2. The α-carbons are at C-1 (a methyl group) and C-3 (a methylene group). The nitrosation reaction preferentially occurs at the more substituted α-carbon that has hydrogens. Therefore, the reaction will take place at the C-3 methylene group, introducing a second carbonyl group and yielding the desired 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione.\n\nBased on this analysis, compound A must be 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, and compound B must be 5-methylhexan-2-one. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
