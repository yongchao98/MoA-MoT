    "An oscillating charge distribution, such as a spheroid with a symmetry axis, can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole, provided its size is significantly smaller than the wavelength of the radiated field. The behavior of the radiated power from such a dipole provides the answer to the question.\n\n### Angular Distribution of Radiated Power\n\nFor an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) is not uniform in all directions. Instead, it follows a `sin²θ` relationship, where `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis). The formula for the radiated power per unit solid angle is given by:\n\n`dP/dΩ = (p₀²ω⁴ / (32π²ε₀c³)) sin²θ`\n\nHere, `p₀` is the amplitude of the dipole moment, `ω` is the angular frequency, `ε₀` is the permittivity of free space, and `c` is the speed of light.\n\nThe maximum power, `A`, is radiated in the direction perpendicular to the oscillation axis, where `θ = 90°`. At this angle, `sin²(90°) = 1`, so the expression for maximum power is:\n\n`A = p₀²ω⁴ / (32π²ε₀c³)`\n\nTo find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at an angle of `θ = 30°`, we evaluate the `sin²θ` term at this angle:\n\n`sin(30°) = 1/2`\n`sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`\n\nThe fraction of the maximum power `A` at `θ = 30°` is the ratio of the power at `30°` to the power at `90°`:\n\nFraction = `(sin²(30°)) / (sin²(90°)) = (1/4) / 1 = 1/4`\n\n### Wavelength Dependence\n\nThe radiated power is also dependent on the wavelength (`λ`) of the radiation. The total power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency (`ω⁴`). The relationship between angular frequency and wavelength is `ω = 2πc/λ`.\n\nSubstituting this into the proportionality for power, we find:\n\n`P ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (2πc/λ)⁴ ∝ 1/λ⁴` or `λ⁻⁴`.\n\nThis `λ⁻⁴` dependence is characteristic of electric dipole radiation and is famously known as Rayleigh scattering, which explains why the sky appears blue. Shorter wavelengths (like blue light) are scattered much more strongly than longer wavelengths.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining these two results, the fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at an angle `θ = 30°` is `1/4`, and the possible form of the function `f`, which describes the radiated power, is proportional to `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
