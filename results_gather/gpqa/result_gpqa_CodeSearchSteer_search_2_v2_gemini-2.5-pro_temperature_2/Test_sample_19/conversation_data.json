    "The impulse approximation in many-body nuclear calculations rests on several key assumptions that allow the complex interaction with a nucleus to be treated as a simpler interaction with a single, free nucleon. Analyzing the provided options in light of established principles of nuclear physics reveals the jointly required assumptions.\n\nThe core tenets of the impulse approximation are:\n*   **Single Nucleon Interaction:** The fundamental premise is that the incoming probe or interaction current interacts with only one nucleon at a time within the nucleus. This simplifies the many-body problem to a two-body interaction.\n*   **Negligible Final State Interaction (Transparency):** It is assumed that neither the incoming probe nor the struck nucleon is significantly affected by the other nucleons in the nucleus. This implies that the rest of the nucleus is essentially \"transparent\" to the interacting particles.\n*   **Negligible Binding Energy Effects:** The interaction is considered to happen over a very short timescale, so short that the binding forces holding the nucleon within the nucleus can be ignored during the collision. The nucleon is treated as if it were a free particle at the moment of interaction.\n\nEvaluating the given choices against these principles:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.** This is a direct statement of the first principle mentioned above and is a foundational component of the impulse approximation.\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.** This corresponds to the assumption of negligible final state interactions, where the rest of the nucleus does not interfere with the primary interaction.\n3.  **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.** The impulse approximation primarily deals with the behavior of nucleons as fundamental units within the nucleus. The internal quark-gluon structure of the nucleon is a deeper level of complexity and is not a standard assumption for the impulse approximation itself. The approximation treats the nucleon as a \"free\" nucleon, whatever its internal structure may be.\n4.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.** This is the \"impulse\" hypothesis itselfâ€”the collision is so rapid that the potential energy holding the nucleon in the nucleus is insignificant compared to the interaction energy.\n\nTherefore, assumptions 1, 2, and 4 are the ones that collectively define the impulse approximation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
