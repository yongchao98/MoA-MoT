    "The provided physical system is a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator.\n\n### Energy of the States\n\nThe energy eigenvalues ($E_n$) for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by the formula:\n\n$E_n = (n + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega$\n\nHere, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the principal quantum number, which can take non-negative integer values (n = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n\n*   **Ground State (n=0):** This is the lowest energy level.\n    $E_0 = (0 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (3/2)\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **First Excited State (n=1):**\n    $E_1 = (1 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (5/2)\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Second Excited State (n=2):**\n    $E_2 = (2 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (7/2)\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Third Excited State (n=3):**\n    $E_3 = (3 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (9/2)\\hbar\\omega$\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is **(9/2)$\\hbar\\omega$**.\n\n### Degeneracy of the Third Excited State\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ refers to the number of different quantum states that have the same energy. For the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy ($g_n$) for a given quantum number $n$ can be calculated with the formula:\n\n$g_n = (n+1)(n+2)/2$\n\nTo find the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for the third excited state, we set n=3:\n\n$g_3 = (3+1)(3+2)/2 = (4)(5)/2 = 10$\n\nThis degeneracy can also be found by counting the possible combinations of non-negative integers ($n_x, n_y, n_z$) that sum to n=3:\n*   (3, 0, 0): There are 3 distinct permutations: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3).\n*   (2, 1, 0): There are 6 distinct permutations: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2).\n*   (1, 1, 1): There is only 1 combination: (1,1,1).\n\nThe total number of states is 3 + 6 + 1 = 10. Thus, there are **10** linearly independent eigenfunctions for the energy eigenvalue of the third excited state.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$, and it has a degeneracy of 10. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
