    "The problem can be solved by systematically identifying the unknown substances based on the chemical reactions and properties described.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z**: Substance Z is a saturated hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n. The mass fraction of hydrogen in a cycloalkane is (2n * 1.008) / (n * 12.011 + 2n * 1.008) ≈ 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.1428, or 14.28%. This matches the given information, indicating Z is a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Determine the Carbon Skeleton**: The hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions yields only substance Z. This implies that all components in mixtures X and Y share the same carbon skeleton as Z. The reaction described, a disproportionation over a platinum catalyst to produce a saturated and an aromatic compound, is characteristic of six-membered rings, specifically the Zelinsky irreversible catalysis. This points to Z being cyclohexane (C6H12), a widely used solvent, which is consistent with the problem statement. The hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane is also a well-known industrial process.\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture Y**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated. One of these components is Z (cyclohexane). The disproportionation reaction of a cyclohexene or cyclohexadiene typically yields cyclohexane and benzene. Benzene (C6H6) does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (Z) and benzene. The hydrogenation of this mixture would produce only cyclohexane, as benzene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane (C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12) and cyclohexane itself does not react. This aligns with all given conditions.\n\n4.  **Identify Mixture X**: Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B, which decolorizes bromine water (indicating unsaturation) and has no conjugated multiple bonds. This mixture undergoes a disproportionation/hydrogen transfer reaction on a heated platinum catalyst to form the equimolar mixture Y (cyclohexane and benzene).\n    *   A + B → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)\n    *   Since hydrogenation of A and B produces only cyclohexane, both must have a six-carbon ring structure. They must be unsaturated isomers of cyclohexane. The possible compounds are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadienes (C6H8).\n    *   The condition \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" rules out 1,3-cyclohexadiene, leaving 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) as a possible component.\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis that mixture X is composed of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Let's check the stoichiometry of the hydrogen transfer reaction:\n        C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) → C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\n    *   Balancing the atoms:\n        *   Reactants: C = 6 + 6 = 12; H = 10 + 8 = 18\n        *   Products: C = 6 + 6 = 12; H = 12 + 6 = 18\n    *   The reaction is balanced and produces an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and benzene, which is mixture Y. This type of reaction, a catalytic transfer hydrogenation, where 1,4-cyclohexadiene acts as a hydrogen donor, is well-documented. Both components of X, cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene, have C=C bonds and would decolorize bromine water.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**: The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Based on our identification, the two liquids are:\n    *   Liquid A: Cyclohexene (C6H10), which has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid B: 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8), which has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each liquid: 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nFinal Answer: The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>"
