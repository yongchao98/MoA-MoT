    "An electrophilic substitution reaction, such as bromination, on a substituted benzene ring results in different isomeric products depending on the nature of the substituent. The substituent group directs the incoming electrophile to specific positions on the ring (ortho, meta, or para). To arrange the given substances in increasing order of the weight fraction of the para-isomer, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent.\n\nThe six substances are:\n1) **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The methyl group (-CH3) is an activating, ortho, para-director.\n2) **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** The ethyl ester group (-COOC2H5) is a deactivating, meta-director.\n3) **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group (-Cl) is a deactivating, ortho, para-director.\n4) **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group (-NO2) is a strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n5) **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is an activating, ortho, para-director.\n6) **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is a deactivating, meta-director.\n\n### Analysis of Isomer Distribution:\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups (NO2, COOC2H5, COOH):** These substituents direct the incoming bromine primarily to the meta position. The formation of the para-isomer is minimal.\n    *   **C6H5-NO2 (4):** The nitro group is one of the strongest deactivating, meta-directing groups. Bromination of nitrobenzene requires harsh conditions and yields the meta-isomer as the main product, with only trace amounts of the para-isomer (around 0-5%).\n    *   **C6H5-COOH (6) and C6H5-COOC2H5 (2):** These groups are also deactivating and meta-directing. For reactions like nitration, ethyl benzoate gives predominantly the meta product (73%) with a small amount of the para isomer (5%). The directing effect of -COOH is similar. The para yield for these will be very low, but likely slightly higher than for the strongly deactivating -NO2 group. Between -COOH and -COOC2H5, their deactivating strengths are comparable, leading to very low and similar para yields. Without precise bromination data, it's reasonable to place them close to each other, with -NO2 giving the least para product. A source gives the nitration para-yield for ethyl benzoate as 5%.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups (CH3, C2H5, Cl):** These substituents direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions. The ratio between ortho and para isomers is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n    *   **C6H5-CH3 (1, Toluene):** The methyl group is small, and while it directs to both ortho and para positions, steric hindrance from the methyl group slightly disfavors the ortho positions. For bromination, the para isomer is typically the major product, but a significant amount of the ortho isomer is also formed. Conventional bromination yields about 60-70% para-bromotoluene.\n    *   **C6H5-C2H5 (5, Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions leads to a higher yield of the para-isomer compared to toluene. In a similar reaction, mercuration, the para-isomer yield increases from 79.2% for toluene to 83.2% for ethylbenzene, showing the effect of the larger alkyl group.\n    *   **C6H5-Cl (3, Chlorobenzene):** Halogens are a special case of ortho, para-directors. While they are deactivating overall, they strongly favor the para position. In the bromination of chlorobenzene, the para-isomer is highly favored, often with an ortho/para ratio of about 0.1, meaning around 90% of the ortho-para mixture is the para isomer. Another source indicates a 30% ortho and 70% para distribution for the nitration of chlorobenzene, which is still a high para yield.\n\n### Arranging the Substances:\n\nBased on the para-isomer yield percentage:\n\n1.  **C6H5-NO2 (4):** Lowest para yield, as it is strongly meta-directing. (estimated ~1-2%)\n2.  **C6H5-COOH (6):** Very low para yield, meta-directing. (estimated ~2-5%)\n3.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (2):** Very low para yield, similar to -COOH, but perhaps slightly more due to the ester group's properties. (estimated ~5%)\n4.  **C6H5-CH3 (1):** Significant para yield, but also a considerable ortho yield. (estimated ~60-70%)\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (5):** Higher para yield than toluene due to increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions. (estimated >70%)\n6.  **C6H5-Cl (3):** Highest para yield due to the electronic properties of the halogen substituent, which strongly favor para substitution. (estimated ~80-90%)\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is:\n**C6H5-NO2 < C6H5-COOH < C6H5-COOC2H5 < C6H5-CH3 < C6H5-C2H5 < C6H5-Cl**\n\nMapping this back to the substance numbers:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
