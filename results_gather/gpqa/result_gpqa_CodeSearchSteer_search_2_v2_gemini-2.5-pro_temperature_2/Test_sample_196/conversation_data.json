    "### Analysis of the Starting Material (Compound X)\n\nFirst, the structure of the starting material, Compound X, must be determined from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n*   A very broad absorption in the 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ range is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n*   The strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n*   Absorptions at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are typical for C=C stretching within a benzene ring.\nFrom the IR data, Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n**¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n*   **10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H):** This signal is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals in the aromatic region indicate a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield signal at 7.2 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n*   **Alkyl Group Analysis:**\n    *   **2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H):** A benzylic methine (CH) proton attached to the benzene ring.\n    *   **1.7 ppm (multiplet, 2H):** A methylene (CH₂) group.\n    *   **1.4 ppm (doublet, 3H):** A methyl (CH₃) group adjacent to a single proton (a CH group).\n    *   **0.9 ppm (triplet, 3H):** A methyl (CH₃) group adjacent to a CH₂ group.\n*   **Assembling the Structure:** The signals for the alkyl group are consistent with a *sec*-butyl group `[-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃]`. The methine proton (2.9 ppm) is the one bonded to the benzene ring, and it couples with the adjacent methyl protons (1.4 ppm) and methylene protons (1.7 ppm). The methylene protons couple with both the methine and the terminal methyl group (0.9 ppm).\n\nCombining all the pieces, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches the description for option C, which is the starting material.\n\n### The Reaction and Final Product\n\nThe reaction involves treating Compound X with **red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a powerful reducing agent. Specifically, it is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group is reduced to a methyl group.\n    `Ar-COOH + 6 HI → Ar-CH₃ + 2 H₂O + 3 I₂`\n*   **Product:** The benzene ring and the *sec*-butyl group are unaffected by these conditions. Therefore, the final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the spectral analysis, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI reduces the carboxylic acid to a methyl group, yielding 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene as the final product.\n\n*   **Compound X:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\nComparing this to the given options:\n*   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect alkyl group.\n*   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect structure.\n*   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material.\n*   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: This is the correct final product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
