    "### Correct Answer: B\n\nTo design a molecular diagnostic kit for a new retrovirus, the most scientifically sound and effective approach is to first identify the virus through cDNA sequencing and then develop a real-time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.\n\n### Rationale:\n\n**Why Option B is Correct:**\n\n*   **Retroviruses are RNA viruses:** A key characteristic of retroviruses is that their genetic material is RNA. To analyze or detect this genetic code using most standard molecular biology techniques, the RNA must first be converted into DNA. This process is called reverse transcription, and the resulting DNA is known as complementary DNA (cDNA). Therefore, performing cDNA sequencing is the correct first step to determine the unique genetic sequence of the new virus.\n*   **Sequencing is essential for test design:** Once the cDNA is sequenced, scientists have the genetic blueprint of the virus. This information is crucial for designing a highly specific and accurate diagnostic test.\n*   **Real-time PCR is the gold standard:** Real-time Reverse Transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) is a powerful, rapid, and highly sensitive method for detecting viral genetic material. By using the sequence data to create specific primers and probes, a real-time PCR kit can quickly detect the presence of the retrovirus's genetic material in a patient's sample, even in the early stages of infection. This makes it ideal for rapid diagnosis during an outbreak.\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n*   **A) First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick and accurate diagnosis.** This option is incorrect for a few reasons. Firstly, this describes an immunological test (ELISA), not a molecular diagnostic test. Secondly, it targets IgG antibodies, which the body produces relatively late in an infection. A test for IgG is useful for determining if someone *has had* a past infection but is not ideal for quick diagnosis of an acute or early-stage illness. For early diagnosis, a direct detection method like PCR is far superior.\n\n*   **C) First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.** This option is flawed because it suggests direct DNA sequencing. Since retroviruses have an RNA genome, this is not the correct initial step. The RNA must first be converted to cDNA before it can be sequenced. While standard PCR is used for DNA, detecting an RNA virus requires Reverse Transcription PCR (RT-PCR).\n\n*   **D) First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.** This option is scientifically unsound. You cannot design the specific primers needed for a PCR test based on clinical symptoms alone. Many different viruses can cause similar symptoms, and PCR tests rely on targeting a unique genetic sequence to be accurate. A molecular test can only be designed after the virus's genetic code is known.\n\n<<<B>>>"
