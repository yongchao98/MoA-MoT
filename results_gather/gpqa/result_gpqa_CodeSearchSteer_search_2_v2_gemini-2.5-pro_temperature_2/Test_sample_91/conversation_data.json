    "Here is the step-by-step calculation of the enthalpy of formation for the given compound.\n\n### **1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule to count the number of each type of bond. The compound is given as (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **Carbon (C) count:**\n    *   (CH₃)₂**C**=: 1 C + 2 from the methyl groups = 3\n    *   =**C**H-: 1 C\n    *   -**C**H₂-: 1 C\n    *   -**C**H(CH₃)-: 1 C + 1 from the methyl group = 2\n    *   -**C**H₂-: 1 C\n    *   -**C**H=: 1 C\n    *   =**C**(CH₃)₂: 1 C + 2 from the methyl groups = 3\n    *   **Total Carbons = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12**\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H) count:**\n    *   (C**H**₃)₂C=: 2 * 3 = 6\n    *   =C**H**-: 1\n    *   -C**H**₂-: 2\n    *   -C**H**(C**H**₃)-: 1 + 3 = 4\n    *   -C**H**₂-: 2\n    *   -C**H**=: 1\n    *   =C(C**H**₃)₂: 2 * 3 = 6\n    *   **Total Hydrogens = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22**\n\nThe molecular formula is **C₁₂H₂₂**.\n\n### **2. Count the Covalent Bonds**\n\nNext, we count each type of bond in the molecule:\n\n*   **C-H bonds:** From the formula, we have 22 hydrogen atoms, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** The structure clearly shows two double bonds: (CH₃)₂**C=C**H- and -C**H=C**(CH₃)₂. There are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** We can count the single bonds in the \"backbone\" and those connecting to the methyl groups.\n    *   Backbone: =C-C, -C-C-, -C-C-, -C-C= -> 4 bonds\n    *   To methyl groups: (CH₃)₂C has 2, -CH(CH₃) has 1, and =C(CH₃)₂ has 2 -> 5 bonds\n    *   **Total C-C bonds = 4 + 5 = 9**\n\n### **3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of Elements**\n\nThis is the energy required to break the elements in their standard state into individual gaseous atoms. The general formula for calculating the enthalpy of formation from bond energies is:\nΔH_f = (Enthalpy of atomization of elements) - (Total bond energy of the compound)\n\n*   **For Carbon:** The enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol for C(s) → C(g).\n*   **For Hydrogen:** The standard state is H₂(g). The bond energy of an H-H bond is given as 100 kJ/mol. To form one mole of H(g) atoms, we need to break 0.5 moles of H-H bonds, so the enthalpy of atomization is 0.5 * 100 kJ/mol = 50 kJ/mol.\n\nTotal enthalpy of atomization for C₁₂H₂₂ = (12 * ΔH_atom(C)) + (22 * ΔH_atom(H))\n= (12 * 1000) + (22 * 50)\n= 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ/mol**\n\n### **4. Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Compound**\n\nThis is the energy released when the gaseous atoms form one mole of the compound. It is the sum of the bond energies of all bonds in the molecule.\n\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol\n\nTotal bond energy = 600 + 1800 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n### **5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) is the difference between the energy required to atomize the elements and the energy released on forming the compound.\n\nΔH_f = (Total enthalpy of atomization of elements) - (Total bond energy of the compound)\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n### **6. Check the Answer Options**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Now we compare this with the given options:\nA) 11200 kJ/mol\nB) 1900 kJ/g\nC) 67.4 kJ/mol\nD) 11.44 kJ/g\n\nOur calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol. Option B has the correct number but incorrect units (kJ/g instead of kJ/mol). Option D is given in kJ/g. Let's convert our result to these units to check.\n\n*   Molar mass of C₁₂H₂₂ = (12 * 12.01) + (22 * 1.01) ≈ 166.34 g/mol. Using the simplified atomic weights (C=12, H=1) from the problem's context gives 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n*   Enthalpy of formation in kJ/g = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.446 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
