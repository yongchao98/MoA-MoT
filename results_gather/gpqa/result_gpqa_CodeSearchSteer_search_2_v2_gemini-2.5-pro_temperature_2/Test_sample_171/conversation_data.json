    "The problem can be solved by applying the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of particles in a system over various energy states while in thermal equilibrium. The assumption that the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) allows the use of this equation.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation provides the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two different energy states (say, *j* and *i*) as follows:\n\n(N_j / N_i) = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   **N_j / N_i** is the ratio of the population of the higher energy level *j* to the lower energy level *i*.\n*   **g_j / g_i** is the ratio of the statistical weights (or degeneracies) of the two energy levels.\n*   **E_j - E_i** (also denoted as **ΔE**) is the energy difference between the two levels.\n*   **k** is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   **T** is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\nLet's denote the ratio of excited atoms for Star 1 and Star 2 as R_1 and R_2, respectively.\nFor Star 1 (temperature T_1):\nR_1 = (N_j / N_i)_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n\nFor Star 2 (temperature T_2):\nR_2 = (N_j / N_i)_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nThe problem states that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. This translates to the ratio of populations in star_1 being twice that in star_2:\nR_1 = 2 * R_2\n\nBy substituting the Boltzmann expressions into this relation, we get:\n(g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nThe ratio of statistical weights (g_j / g_i) cancels out on both sides:\nexp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nTo solve for the temperatures, we can rearrange the equation:\nexp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] = 2\n\nUsing the exponential property exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b), the equation becomes:\nexp[(ΔE / (k * T_2)) - (ΔE / (k * T_1))] = 2\n\nTaking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\nCombining the fractions in the parenthesis gives:\n(ΔE / k) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] = ln(2)\n\nThe problem provides the energy difference ΔE as approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J, and the Boltzmann constant *k* is also approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K. This simplifies the ratio ΔE / k to approximately 1.\n\nSubstituting ΔE / k = 1 into the equation, we arrive at the final relationship:\nln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
