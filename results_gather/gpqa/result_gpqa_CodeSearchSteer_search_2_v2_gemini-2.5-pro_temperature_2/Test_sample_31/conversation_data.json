    "To determine the total energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus, we must use the principles of special relativity.\n\n**1. Identify the Nucleus and its Components**\nThe nucleus X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n*   Lithium has an atomic number of 3, which means it has 3 protons.\n*   The number of neutrons is given as 3.\n*   The nucleus is therefore Lithium-6 (⁶Li), composed of 3 protons and 3 neutrons.\n\n**2. Determine the Rest Mass (m₀)**\nTo find the total energy, we first need the rest mass of the nucleus. In particle accelerator contexts, the total mass is often calculated as the sum of the rest masses of its constituent nucleons.\n*   The rest mass of a proton is approximately 938.27 MeV/c².\n*   The rest mass of a neutron is slightly higher, at approximately 939.57 MeV/c².\n\nThe total rest mass (m₀) of the ⁶Li nucleus is the sum of the masses of its 3 protons and 3 neutrons:\nm₀ = (3 × 938.27 MeV/c²) + (3 × 939.57 MeV/c²)\nm₀ = 2814.81 MeV/c² + 2818.71 MeV/c²\nm₀ = 5633.52 MeV/c²\n\nTo make the final calculation easier, we can convert this to GeV/c²:\nm₀ = 5.63352 GeV/c²\n\n**3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\nThe Lorentz factor accounts for the relativistic effects at high speeds. It is calculated based on the velocity (v) of the nucleus, given as 0.96c (where c is the speed of light).\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96c)²/c²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\nγ = 1 / √0.0784\nγ = 1 / 0.28\nγ ≈ 3.5714\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E)**\nThe total energy of a particle moving at relativistic speed is given by Einstein's famous equation, E = γm₀c².\n\nE = γ × (m₀c²)\nE ≈ 3.5714 × (5.63352 GeV)\nE ≈ 20.1197 GeV\n\nThis calculated value is extremely close to the provided option B. The minor difference of about 0.012 GeV is likely due to the use of slightly different rounded values for the proton and neutron masses in the source of the question.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the ⁶Li nucleus is approximately 20.132 GeV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
