    "A dominant-negative mutation creates a mutant protein that, when co-expressed with the wild-type (WT) protein, interferes with the WT protein's function. This is common in proteins that must form dimers or larger complexes to be active, like the transcription factor described.\n\nHere's an analysis of the options:\n\n*   **A) Change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype:** This is incorrect. A dominant-negative effect leads to a loss of function, not a gain of function. The mutant protein antagonizes the normal protein's activity.\n*   **B) Protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele:** This is the most likely phenotype. For a dominant-negative effect to occur in a dimeric protein, the mutant subunit (Y) must still be able to dimerize with the wild-type subunit (WT). However, this resulting WT-Y heterodimer is non-functional. This sequestration of WT protein into inactive complexes effectively causes a loss of function of the protein produced by the wild-type allele. Furthermore, such malformed or non-functional protein complexes can be targeted by the cell's quality control machinery for degradation by the proteasome.\n*   **C) Protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype:** While protein aggregation can cause a loss-of-function and is one possible mechanism for a dominant-negative effect, the most direct consequence of a mutation in a dimerization domain is the formation of faulty dimers, not necessarily large-scale aggregation.\n*   **D) Loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype:** This is incorrect. If mutation Y completely prevented dimerization, the mutant protein could not interact with or inhibit the wild-type protein. The remaining wild-type proteins would form functional WT-WT dimers. Since mutation X's recessive nature implies that 50% of the normal protein level is sufficient for function (haplosufficiency), this scenario would likely result in a wild-type or near-wild-type phenotype, not the dominant-negative phenotype described.\n\nTherefore, the defining feature of this dominant-negative mutation is the interference with the wild-type protein, leading to a functional loss of the wild-type allele's product, a process which can involve the degradation of the resulting non-functional complexes.\n\n<<<B>>>"
