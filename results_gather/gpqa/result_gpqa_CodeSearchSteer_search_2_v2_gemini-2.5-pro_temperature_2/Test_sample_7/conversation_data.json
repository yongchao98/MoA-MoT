  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nB) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\nC) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\nD) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental results:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Single Mutants:** The resistance levels of the single knock-out mutants compared to the wild-type (100% resistance) reveal the individual contribution of each gene to anthracnose resistance.\n    *   `g1`: 75% resistance. The loss of gene G1 causes a minor loss of resistance (25%).\n    *   `g3`: 50% resistance. The loss of gene G3 causes a more significant loss of resistance (50%).\n    *   `g2`: 0% resistance. The loss of gene G2 completely abolishes resistance. This indicates that G2 is an essential gene in the resistance pathway.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Double Mutants (Epistasis):** Epistasis occurs when the effect of one gene's mutation masks the effect of another. The phenotype of the double mutant reveals the functional relationship between the genes. We compare the double mutant's phenotype to that of the single mutants.\n    *   `g1g2` and `g2g3`: Both double mutants show 0% resistance, which is the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant. The severe phenotype of `g2` (0% resistance) masks the milder phenotypes of `g1` (75% resistance) and `g3` (50% resistance). This is the definition of epistasis, with G2 being epistatic to both G1 and G3. In a genetic pathway, this usually means G2 acts downstream of G1 and G3, or is the essential component in the pathway they all share.\n    *   `g1g3`: This double mutant has 10% resistance. This phenotype is not the same as `g1` (75%) or `g3` (50%). Instead, it is a novel and much more severe phenotype than either single mutant. This is known as a synergistic interaction, which often implies that the two genes function in parallel pathways that contribute to the same outcome, or that they are part of a protein complex. Because they both contribute to the same overall function, they can be described as being partially redundant. The loss of both is more detrimental than an additive effect.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Role of a Transcription Factor (TF):** The prompt states that at least one gene is a TF acting upstream of another.\n    *   The central importance of G2, demonstrated by its complete loss-of-function phenotype and its epistatic relationship over G1 and G3, makes it the strongest candidate for a master regulatory gene, such as a key transcription factor that activates the entire resistance response. A model that fits all the data is that G1 and G3 act upstream, potentially in parallel, and their pathway converges on the activation of G2. G2, as a transcription factor, then activates the downstream genes necessary for resistance. `(G1/G3) -> G2(TF) -> Resistance Genes -> Resistance`. This model is consistent with the epistasis data and the information about a TF.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**\n    *   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:**\n        *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": This is strongly supported by the data.\n        *   \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\": Their synergistic interaction can be described as partial redundancy, as they both contribute to the same function. This is a plausible interpretation.\n        *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\": This is incorrect. The `g1g3` double mutant (10% resistance) does not have the phenotype of the `g1` mutant (75% resistance). However, the first two statements in this option are the most accurate descriptions based on the data.\n    *   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:**\n        *   We cannot determine anything about promoters from this data.\n        *   G3 is not epistatic to G1, as the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not that of `g3` (50%).\n    *   **C) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:**\n        *   It is less likely that G1 is the primary TF, given its mild phenotype compared to G2.\n        *   Pleiotropy (one gene affecting multiple traits) cannot be concluded as we only have data for one trait (disease resistance).\n        *   \"G2 is epistatic towards G1\" is a correct statement, but other parts of the option are not supported.\n    *   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:**\n        *   Pleiotropy cannot be concluded.\n        *   G1 is not epistatic towards G3.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOption A provides the most accurate description of the genetic interactions, even with the inaccuracy in its final clause. The conclusions that G2 is a key regulator (like a TF) and that G1 and G3 have a synergistic or partially redundant role are the strongest interpretations of the experimental results. The other options contain assertions that are unsubstantiated by the data (pleiotropy, promoter structure) or are less likely.\n\n<<<A>>>"
