    "A) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is a quantum field theory that describes the strong nuclear force. Like other quantum field theories, calculations in QCD involving loop diagrams lead to ultraviolet divergences. These high-energy divergences require a process called regularization, where a parameter (a \"cutoff\") is introduced to make the calculations finite. A common method used is lattice QCD, which discretizes spacetime, with the lattice spacing acting as a regulator.\n\nB) Superstring Theory is a theoretical framework that treats particles not as points, but as one-dimensional vibrating strings. A key feature of superstring theory is that it is believed to be free from the ultraviolet (high-energy) divergences that plague quantum field theories. This finiteness arises because the extended nature of strings smooths out interactions at very short distances, which corresponds to high energies, thus avoiding the infinities. While infrared divergences can still occur, the theory does not fundamentally require regularization at high energies.\n\nC) Classical Electrodynamics, which describes the interactions of electric charges and currents, runs into a problem with infinities when dealing with point-like charged particles. The self-energy of a classical point particle—the energy of the particle's own electric field—is infinite. This is a high-energy/short-distance problem. To resolve this divergence, some form of regularization is necessary, such as assuming the particle has a finite, non-zero radius.\n\nD) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), the quantum version of electromagnetism, also suffers from ultraviolet divergences in calculations involving loop diagrams, similar to QCD. Historically, it was the first quantum field theory where these infinities were systematically handled through the procedures of regularization and renormalization. Therefore, QED absolutely requires regularization to make sense of its high-energy behavior.\n\nBased on this analysis, Superstring Theory is the only one among the choices that is considered to be free of ultraviolet divergences and thus does not inherently require regularization at high energies.\n\n<<<B>>>"
