    "Based on a thorough analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the unknown compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2 is identified as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n### **Analysis of Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectrum:**\n    *   The two distinct bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n    *   The strong absorption band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. This frequency is typical for an ester group that is conjugated with a benzene ring.\n\n*   **¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal corresponds to a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-), resulting in a triplet. This is the upfield portion of an ethyl group.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amino group (-NH₂). The broadening is a common effect due to nitrogen's quadrupolar moment and proton exchange.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This quartet represents a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group. Its significant downfield shift to ~4.5 ppm indicates it is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom within an ester functionality (-COOCH₂-).\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The upfield doublet (~7.0 ppm) corresponds to the protons adjacent to the electron-donating amino group (-NH₂), while the downfield doublet (~8.0 ppm) corresponds to the protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation:**\n    *   The molecular formula C9H11NO2 has a degree of unsaturation of 5. This is consistent with a benzene ring (4 degrees) and a carbonyl double bond (1 degree).\n\n### **Evaluation of Proposed Structures**\n\n1.  **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This structure would have the ethyl group protons (a triplet and quartet) within the propionate acyl chain, not attached to the ester oxygen. This contradicts the quartet's chemical shift of 4.5 ppm.\n2.  **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This structure is a secondary amide, which would show only a single N-H stretch in the IR spectrum, and its C=O stretch would be at a lower frequency (~1670 cm⁻¹). The provided data indicates a primary amine.\n3.  **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This structure is a primary amide, and while it would show two N-H stretches, the substitution pattern on the benzene ring is meta (1,3), which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum, not two clean doublets.\n4.  **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectroscopic evidence. It possesses a primary amine (-NH₂), an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃), and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, which accounts for all the observed signals and splitting patterns in the IR and NMR spectra. Published spectra of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate confirm these assignments.\n\n<<<D>>>"
