    "To determine the area of the pseudosphere, we are given the metric:\n$ds^{2}=\\frac{32}{\\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)}\\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\\right)$\n\nThe area element $dA$ for a surface with a given metric $ds^2 = g_{11}dx^2 + 2g_{12}dxdy + g_{22}dy^2$ is calculated as $dA = \\sqrt{\\det(g)} \\,dx\\,dy$, where $g$ is the metric tensor.\n\n1.  **Identify the Metric Tensor**\n    From the given metric, we can identify the components of the metric tensor $g$ in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$:\n    $g_{xx} = \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}$\n    $g_{yy} = \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}$\n    $g_{xy} = g_{yx} = 0$\n\n2.  **Calculate the Determinant of the Metric Tensor**\n    The determinant of $g$ is:\n    $\\det(g) = g_{xx}g_{yy} - g_{xy}^2 = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right)^2 - 0 = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right)^2$\n\n3.  **Determine the Area Element**\n    The area element $dA$ is the square root of the determinant:\n    $dA = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right)^2} \\,dx\\,dy = \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\,dx\\,dy$\n\n4.  **Define the Region of Integration**\n    The metric is defined for $4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0$, which implies $x^2 + y^2 < 4$. This is the interior of a disk centered at the origin with a radius of 2. The phrase \"pseudosphere of radius r=2\" indicates that this disk is the domain of our surface. Therefore, we need to integrate the area element over this disk.\n\n5.  **Set up the Area Integral**\n    The total area $A$ is the integral of the area element over the disk $D$ where $x^2+y^2 < 4$:\n    $A = \\iint_D \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\,dx\\,dy$\n\n6.  **Convert to Polar Coordinates**\n    To simplify the integral, we switch to polar coordinates $(\\rho, \\theta)$, where $x = \\rho\\cos\\theta$, $y = \\rho\\sin\\theta$, and the area element in the plane becomes $dx\\,dy = \\rho\\,d\\rho\\,d\\theta$. The integration domain becomes $0 \\le \\rho < 2$ and $0 \\le \\theta \\le 2\\pi$. The integral transforms to:\n    $A = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32}{4-\\rho^2} \\rho \\,d\\rho\\,d\\theta$\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Integral**\n    We can separate the integral into two parts:\n    $A = \\left(\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta\\right) \\left(\\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} \\,d\\rho\\right)$\n\n    The integral with respect to $\\theta$ is simply $2\\pi$.\n    $A = 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} \\,d\\rho$\n\n    To solve the integral with respect to $\\rho$, we use the substitution $u = 4 - \\rho^2$, which gives $du = -2\\rho\\,d\\rho$. We also change the limits of integration:\n    -   When $\\rho = 0$, $u = 4 - 0^2 = 4$.\n    -   As $\\rho \\to 2$, $u \\to 4 - 2^2 = 0$.\n\n    The integral becomes:\n    $A = 2\\pi \\int_{4}^{0} \\frac{32}{u} \\left(\\frac{du}{-2}\\right) = 2\\pi \\int_{4}^{0} \\frac{-16}{u} \\,du = 32\\pi \\int_{0}^{4} \\frac{1}{u} \\,du$\n\n    This is an improper integral due to the singularity at $u=0$. Evaluating it:\n    $A = 32\\pi \\left[\\ln|u|\\right]_0^4 = 32\\pi \\left(\\ln(4) - \\lim_{a\\to0^+} \\ln(a)\\right)$\n\n    Since $\\lim_{a\\to0^+} \\ln(a) = -\\infty$:\n    $A = 32\\pi (\\ln(4) - (-\\infty)) = +\\infty$\n\nThe calculated area is infinite. Options C and D represent variable quantities, not a scalar area. Option A is zero, which is incorrect as the integrand is positive. Thus, the only valid answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
