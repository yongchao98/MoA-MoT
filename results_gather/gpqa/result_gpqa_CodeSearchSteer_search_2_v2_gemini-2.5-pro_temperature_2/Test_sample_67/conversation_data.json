    "When a particle with a magnetic moment is placed in an external magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes the magnetic moment to precess around the direction of the magnetic field. This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession, named after Joseph Larmor. The angular frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nIn this problem, the initial magnetic field aligns the spin-1/2 particle's magnetic moment along the +Z direction. When this field is replaced by a new magnetic field of the same magnitude, B, pointing along the +Y direction, the magnetic moment begins to precess around the new field axis (+Y).\n\nThe evolution of the spin is governed by the Larmor frequency, which is given by the equation:\n\nω = γB\n\nwhere:\n*   ω is the angular frequency of precession.\n*   γ is the gyromagnetic ratio of the particle.\n*   B is the magnitude of the magnetic field.\n\nAs the particle's magnetic moment precesses around the Y-axis, its Z-component oscillates. The frequency of this oscillation is precisely the Larmor frequency. Therefore, the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment will oscillate with an angular frequency of γB. This result is a cornerstone of magnetic resonance phenomena like NMR and EPR.\n\n<<<B>>>"
