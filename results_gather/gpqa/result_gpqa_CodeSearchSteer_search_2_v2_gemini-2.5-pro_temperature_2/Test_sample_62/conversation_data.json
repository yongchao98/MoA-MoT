    "### Analysis of the Molecular Transition\n\nTo solve this problem, we must first identify the initial and final quantum states of the molecule and then calculate the energy of the photon required to induce this transition. Finally, we can determine the photon's momentum.\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The molecule is in its fundamental (or ground) state. In the rotation-vibration model, this corresponds to a vibrational quantum number `v = 0` and a rotational quantum number `J = 0`.\n\n2.  **Final State & Selection Rules**: The molecule absorbs a photon and moves to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" For a rovibrational transition in a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, the selection rules are `Δv = +1` and `ΔJ = ±1`.\n    *   Starting from `J = 0`, a transition to `J = -1` is not possible. Therefore, the rotational quantum number must change by `ΔJ = +1`.\n    *   This means the final state must be `v' = 1` and `J' = 1`.\n    *   This specific transition, from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=1), is the first line in the R-branch of the molecule's rovibrational spectrum.\n\n3.  **Energy of the Transition**: The energy of a state in the simple rotation-vibration model is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies.\n    *   E(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + B∙J(J+1)\n        *   `ħ` is the reduced Planck's constant.\n        *   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n        *   `B` is the rotational constant.\n\n    The energy of the absorbed photon (ΔE) is the difference in energy between the final and initial states.\n    *   Initial energy: E(0, 0) = (1/2)ħω\n    *   Final energy: E(1, 1) = (1 + 1/2)ħω + B∙1(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n    *   ΔE = E(1, 1) - E(0, 0) = [ (3/2)ħω + 2B ] - (1/2)ħω = **ħω + 2B**\n\n4.  **Photon Momentum**: The momentum (`p`) of a photon is related to its energy (`E`) by the equation `p = E/c`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n\n### Calculation\n\nNow, we will substitute the given values into the derived equations.\n\n**Constants:**\n*   Reduced Planck's constant (`ħ`) ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   Speed of light (`c`) ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n*   Atomic mass unit (amu) ≈ 1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n**Given Data:**\n*   Mass of atom X (Mx): 20 amu\n*   Mass of atom Y (My): 2 amu\n*   Bond length (R): 2 Å = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   Angular frequency (ω): 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Rotational Term (2B)**\n\nFirst, we need to find the rotational constant `B`, which depends on the molecule's moment of inertia (`I`). The moment of inertia is calculated from the reduced mass (`μ`) and the bond length (`R`).\n\n*   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n    μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n    μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n    μ ≈ 1.818 * (1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n*   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n    I = μR²\n    I ≈ (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)² = 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n*   **Rotational Constant (B):**\n    B = ħ² / (2I)\n    B ≈ (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (2 * 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 4.608 x 10⁻²³ J\n\n*   **Calculate 2B:**\n    2B ≈ 2 * 4.608 x 10⁻²³ J = 9.216 x 10⁻²³ J\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Vibrational Term (ħω)**\n\n*   **Vibrational Energy Component:**\n    ħω = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Total Photon Energy (ΔE)**\n\n*   **ΔE = ħω + 2B**\n    ΔE ≈ (4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J) + (9.216 x 10⁻²³ J) ≈ 4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n    *(Note that the rotational energy contribution is much smaller than the vibrational energy contribution).*\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Photon's Momentum (p)**\n\n*   **p = ΔE / c**\n    p ≈ (4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3.00 x 10⁸ m/s)\n    p ≈ 1.408 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
