    "Here is a breakdown of the question to determine the correct answer:\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomers are isomers that can rapidly interconvert, most commonly through the movement of a proton. For a ketone or aldehyde to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have an alpha-hydrogenâ€”a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone:** This molecule has a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone groups. The carbon atoms adjacent to the ketone groups are part of carbon-carbon double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Therefore, benzoquinone lacks alpha-hydrogens and cannot undergo tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound possesses three ketone groups. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons and each is bonded to hydrogen atoms. Because of the presence of these alpha-hydrogens, it can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is aromatic and therefore particularly stable, meaning the equilibrium favors the enol form.\n\nBased on this analysis, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nA compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common feature of chiral molecules is a stereocenter, which is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). This makes it a chiral center, and thus the molecule exhibits optical isomerism, existing as a pair of enantiomers.\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is the trans isomer of a butenedioate molecule. It has a carbon-carbon double bond and a center of symmetry, which makes it achiral. Since it is achiral, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   (A) The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   (B) The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
