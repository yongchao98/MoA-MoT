    "To determine how many of the listed stars would be detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we must evaluate two main criteria for each star: its visibility from Paranal Observatory and whether its apparent brightness meets the specified signal-to-noise requirement.\n\nA star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 can be achieved in a one-hour exposure with a single 8.2m VLT. According to performance data, ESPRESSO can reach an S/N of 10 for a star with an apparent V magnitude of 19.4 in just 20 minutes. For a longer exposure of one hour (60 minutes), the instrument can detect even fainter objects. The limiting magnitude for a one-hour exposure is approximately 20.6 mag.\n\nThe second criterion is visibility. The Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of about -24.6° South. This southern location dictates which parts of the sky are observable.\n\nHere is an analysis of each star:\n\n*   **a) Canopus:** This is the second-brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent visual magnitude of -0.74. Its declination is approximately -52° 41', making it easily observable from the southern hemisphere location of Paranal. As it is significantly brighter than the magnitude limit, Canopus is **detectable**.\n*   **b) Polaris:** Commonly known as the North Star, Polaris has a declination of almost +89° 16'. Due to its extreme northern position in the sky, it never rises above the horizon at Paranal's southern latitude. Therefore, Polaris is **not detectable** from this location.\n*   **c) Star at 10 pc:** The apparent magnitude (m) can be calculated from the absolute magnitude (M) and distance in parsecs (d) using the formula m = M - 5 + 5\\*log10(d).\n    *   m = 15 - 5 + 5\\*log10(10) = 15.0.\n    With a declination of 0°, this star is visible from Paranal. Since its apparent magnitude of 15.0 is much brighter than the 20.6 mag limit, it is **detectable**.\n*   **d) Star at 200 pc:** Using the same formula:\n    *   m = 15 - 5 + 5\\*log10(200) ≈ 10 + 5\\*(2.3) = 21.5.\n    This star, with an apparent magnitude of 21.5, is fainter than the detection limit of ~20.6 mag for a one-hour exposure. Thus, it is **not detectable**.\n*   **e) Star at 5 pc:**\n    *   m = 15 - 5 + 5\\*log10(5) ≈ 10 + 5\\*(0.7) = 13.5.\n    This star is visible from Paranal and, with a magnitude of 13.5, is bright enough to be **detectable**.\n*   **f) Star at 50 pc:**\n    *   m = 15 - 5 + 5\\*log10(50) ≈ 10 + 5\\*(1.7) = 18.5.\n    This star is visible and its magnitude of 18.5 is well within the detection limit, making it **detectable**.\n\nCounting the stars that meet both visibility and brightness criteria, we have: Canopus, the star at 10 pc, the star at 5 pc, and the star at 50 pc.\n\nIn total, 4 of the listed stars are detectable.\n\n<<<C>>>"
