    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound with its most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotopic Peak (M+2):** A second peak is observed at m/z = 158, which is two mass units higher than the molecular ion. The intensity of this peak is 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%).\n*   **Interpretation:** This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a distinctive pattern for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom. Chlorine has two main isotopes, ³⁵Cl (about 75% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (about 25% abundance), which results in this characteristic 3:1 ratio for M+ and M+2 peaks. Therefore, the unknown compound contains one chlorine atom, and its molecular weight is 156 g/mol (using the ³⁵Cl isotope).\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Given the presence of the broad O-H peak, this carbonyl group is identified as part of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n*   **Interpretation:** The IR data strongly suggest that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is highly indicative of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). Its integration of 1H confirms the presence of one such proton, and it appears as a singlet because it does not couple with other protons.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The two sets of protons are chemically non-equivalent but symmetrical, each coupling with its neighbor to produce a doublet.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring substituted with a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group at positions 1 and 4.\n    *   **MW:** The molecular weight is 156.57 g/mol, which matches the m/z of 156.\n    *   **IR:** As a carboxylic acid, it would show a very broad O-H stretch and a C=O stretch around 1700 cm⁻¹, consistent with the data.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** It possesses a carboxylic acid proton (~11-13 ppm), and its *para*-substituted ring would result in two doublets for the four aromatic protons. This structure perfectly matches all spectral data.\n\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **MW & IR:** The molecular weight and functional group are correct.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** An *ortho*-substituted ring would produce a much more complex splitting pattern for the four non-equivalent aromatic protons, not two simple doublets. This contradicts the NMR data.\n\n*   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:**\n    *   **MW:** The molecular weight is correct.\n    *   **IR & ¹H NMR:** This compound is an acyl chloride/ester. It lacks the broad O-H stretch from a carboxylic acid in the IR spectrum and would not have the characteristic carboxylic acid proton signal around 11 ppm in the ¹H NMR.\n\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:**\n    *   **MW:** The molecular weight is correct.\n    *   **IR & ¹H NMR:** This molecule is an aldehyde with a phenolic hydroxyl group. It would have an aldehyde proton signal (around 9-10 ppm) and would lack the very acidic proton at 11 ppm. The substitution pattern is also incorrect for the observed ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the mass spectrometry, IR, and ¹H NMR data, the only structure that fits all the evidence is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
