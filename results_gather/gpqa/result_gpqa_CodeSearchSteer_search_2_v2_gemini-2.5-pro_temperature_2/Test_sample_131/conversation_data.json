    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two aromatic compounds present in the mixture:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Mass\n\nAll the proposed compounds—1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene—have the same molecular formula, C10H14, and a corresponding molar mass of approximately 134.22 g/mol. Therefore, this information does not help distinguish between them.\n\n### 2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Compound\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, this molecule has only two sets of equivalent protons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons on the benzene ring are equivalent and will produce a single singlet.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are also equivalent, resulting in a single singlet.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons on the ring are in different chemical environments and will produce two separate singlets.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the one at position 2, the one at position 5, and the equivalent pair at positions 1 and 3. This results in three singlets with an integration ratio of 3H:3H:6H, which simplifies to 1:1:2.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 alkyl singlets (ratio 1:1:2).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two ring protons are equivalent and will show as a single singlet.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are in two different environments: the pair at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent, and the pair at positions 2 and 3 are equivalent. This leads to two singlets of equal intensity (6H each).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (ratio 1:1).\n\n*   **1,4-Diethylbenzene:** This compound is also highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four ring protons are equivalent and produce a single singlet.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The protons of the two equivalent ethyl groups will produce a quartet (for the -CH2- groups) and a triplet (for the -CH3 groups).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (4H), 1 alkyl quartet (4H), 1 alkyl triplet (6H). This compound does not exhibit only singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Mixture Based on the Provided Spectral Data\n\nThe problem states that a 1:1 mixture of two compounds shows:\n*   **Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Alkyl region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's test the options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This combination would produce three aromatic singlets (one 2H signal from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and two 1H signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene). This does not match the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This pair would also result in three aromatic singlets (one 2H signal from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and two 1H signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene). This does not match.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** This mixture is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene produces a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region, not just singlets.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** Both compounds show a single aromatic singlet for 2 protons each. In a 1:1 mixture, this would result in two singlets of equal intensity (a 1:1 ratio), which perfectly matches the description.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet for its 12 methyl protons. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes two singlets, each for 6 methyl protons. In total, the mixture will exhibit three singlets (assuming they have different chemical shifts). The integration ratio will be 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to 2:1:1. This also perfectly matches the description.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that accounts for all the features observed in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
