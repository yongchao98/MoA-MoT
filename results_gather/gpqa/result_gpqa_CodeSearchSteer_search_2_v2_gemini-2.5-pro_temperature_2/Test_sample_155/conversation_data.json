    "### Analysis of the Chromatograms Reveals Two and Three Peaks\n\nThe chemist will observe two peaks in the standard reverse-phase HPLC chromatogram and three peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This outcome is due to the specific stereoisomers produced in each reaction and the different separation capabilities of the two HPLC column types.\n\n**Breakdown of the Reactions:**\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** The treatment of (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene) with mCPBA results in the formation of a racemic mixture of epoxides. The subsequent acid-catalyzed ring-opening is an anti-addition process. This specific sequence—anti-addition to the epoxide derived from a trans-alkene—yields a single product: the meso-octane-4,5-diol. A meso compound is achiral despite having chiral centers due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction 2:** The treatment of (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) with mCPBA produces a meso-epoxide. The following acid-catalyzed anti-addition opens the epoxide ring to form a racemic mixture of (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These two products are enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.\n\n**The Combined Product Mixture:**\n\nAfter combining the products from both reactions, the final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n2.  (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n3.  (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso-diol is a diastereomer of the (4R, 5R) and (4S, 5S) diols.\n\n**Chromatographic Separation:**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties like polarity. Enantiomers, such as the (4R, 5R) and (4S, 5S) diols, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated; they elute together as a single peak. However, diastereomers (the meso-diol vs. the enantiomeric pair) have different physical properties and will be separated. Consequently, the standard HPLC will show **two peaks**: one for the meso compound and another for the unresolved racemic pair.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This method utilizes a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment within the column. This allows for the separation of enantiomers because they interact differently with the chiral stationary phase. Therefore, all three stereoisomers in the mixture—the meso-diol, the (4R, 5R)-diol, and the (4S, 5S)-diol—will have different retention times and will be resolved into **three distinct peaks**, assuming the resolution is high enough.\n\n<<<B>>>"
