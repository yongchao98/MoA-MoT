    "This problem can be solved by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum from the theory of special relativity. When an electron and a positron collide, they annihilate, converting their total energy into two photons.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Define Initial State:**\n    *   An electron moves from the left with a Lorentz factor (γ_e) of 4.\n    *   A positron moves from the right with a Lorentz factor (γ_p) of 2.\n    *   Let the horizontal axis be the x-axis. The electron's velocity is in the +x direction, and the positron's is in the -x direction.\n    *   The rest mass of both the electron and the positron is denoted by `m_e`.\n\n2.  **Calculate Initial Energy:**\n    *   The energy of a relativistic particle is given by `E = γmc²`.\n    *   Energy of the electron (E_e) = 4 * `m_e` * c²\n    *   Energy of the positron (E_p) = 2 * `m_e` * c²\n    *   The total initial energy (E_initial) is the sum of their energies:\n        E_initial = E_e + E_p = (4 + 2) * `m_e` * c² = 6 * `m_e` * c²\n\n3.  **Calculate Initial Momentum:**\n    *   The magnitude of a relativistic particle's momentum can be calculated using the formula `p = sqrt(E² - (mc²)²) / c` or `p = γmv`.\n    *   Alternatively, a useful relation is `p = sqrt(γ² - 1) * mc`.\n    *   Momentum of the electron (p_e) = sqrt(4² - 1) * `m_e`c = sqrt(15) * `m_e`c.\n    *   Momentum of the positron (p_p) = sqrt(2² - 1) * `m_e`c = sqrt(3) * `m_e`c.\n    *   Since momentum is a vector, and the particles are moving in opposite directions along the x-axis, the total initial momentum (p_initial) is the vector sum:\n        p_initial_x = p_e - p_p = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * `m_e`c.\n        p_initial_y = 0.\n\n4.  **Define Final State:**\n    *   The final state consists of two photons.\n    *   It's given that both photons have the same energy (E_γ).\n    *   One photon moves to the upper-right (at an angle θ above the x-axis) and the other to the lower-right (at an angle -θ below the x-axis).\n\n5.  **Apply Conservation Laws to the Final State:**\n    *   **Energy Conservation**: The total initial energy equals the total final energy.\n        E_initial = E_γ + E_γ = 2 * E_γ\n        6 * `m_e`c² = 2 * E_γ\n        E_γ = 3 * `m_e`c²\n        So, each photon has an energy of 3 * `m_e`c².\n\n    *   **Momentum Conservation**: The total initial momentum equals the total final momentum. The momentum of a photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c`.\n        *   **Y-Momentum**: The initial y-momentum is zero. The final y-momenta of the two photons are `(E_γ / c) * sin(θ)` and `(E_γ / c) * sin(-θ)`. Their sum is `(E_γ / c) * (sin(θ) - sin(θ)) = 0`. This confirms that the photons are emitted at equal and opposite angles to the horizontal axis.\n        *   **X-Momentum**: The initial x-momentum must equal the sum of the final x-momenta.\n            p_initial_x = (E_γ / c) * cos(θ) + (E_γ / c) * cos(-θ)\n            (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * `m_e`c = 2 * (E_γ / c) * cos(θ)\n\n6.  **Solve for the Angle:**\n    *   Substitute the value of E_γ into the x-momentum equation:\n        (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * `m_e`c = 2 * ( (3 * `m_e`c²) / c) * cos(θ)\n    *   Simplify and solve for cos(θ):\n        (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * `m_e`c = 6 * `m_e`c * cos(θ)\n        cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6\n    *   Using the approximate values sqrt(15) ≈ 3.873 and sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732:\n        cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n    *   Find the angle θ:\n        θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1 degrees.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the angle *between* the directions of the photons. This angle is 2θ.\n    *   Angle = 2 * θ = 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°.\n\nThis value is closest to 138 degrees.\n\n<<<A>>>"
