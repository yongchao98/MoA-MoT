    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we will perform a step-by-step stoichiometric calculation.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each species:**\n\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.080 moles of H⁺ ions.\n\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2), a strong base:**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, it dissociates to produce two hydroxide ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)2 → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol\n\n**2. Account for the neutralization reactions:**\n\nFirst, the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) will react with the strong base (OH⁻ from Ba(OH)2).\n\n*   Initial moles of H⁺ (strong acid) = 0.080 mol\n*   Initial moles of OH⁻ (strong base) = 0.180 mol\n\nThe reaction is: H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\nSince there are fewer moles of H⁺, it is the limiting reactant.\n*   Moles of OH⁻ remaining after reacting with HCl = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\nNext, the remaining strong base (OH⁻) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   Moles of CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n*   Moles of OH⁻ available for this reaction = 0.100 mol\n\nThe reaction is: CH3COOH + OH⁻ → CH3COO⁻ + H₂O\nThe limiting reactant is CH3COOH.\n*   Moles of excess OH⁻ remaining = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\nAfter all reactions, the solution contains an excess of 0.050 moles of strong base (OH⁻). The presence of a strong base in excess will determine the pH of the solution.\n\n**3. Calculate the final concentration and pH:**\n\nFirst, calculate the total volume of the solution.\n*   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n\nNow, calculate the final concentration of the excess hydroxide ions [OH⁻].\n*   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n*   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\nNext, calculate the pOH.\n*   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n*   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\nFinally, calculate the pH using the relation pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C).\n*   pH = 14 - pOH\n*   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<C>>>"
