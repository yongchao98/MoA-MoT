    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. Here is a step-by-step calculation to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n### 1. Identify the Frames of Reference and Given Information\n\n*   **Galaxy Reference Frame (S):** This is considered the stationary frame.\n*   **Ejecta Reference Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame.\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is 60,000 km/s.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt'):** The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is 50 seconds.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** For calculations, we'll use the value of 300,000 km/s.\n\n### 2. The Concept of Time Dilation\n\nAccording to Einstein's theory of special relativity, an observer in a stationary reference frame will measure time passing more slowly for an object moving at a relativistic speed. This effect is known as time dilation.\n\nTo find the distance traveled by the ejecta as measured from the Galaxy's frame, we first need to determine the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt). This is calculated using the time dilation formula:\n\nΔt = γ * Δt'\n\nwhere **γ** (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n### 3. Calculation Steps\n\n**a. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\nThe Lorentz factor is given by the formula:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nFirst, find the ratio of the ejecta's velocity to the speed of light:\nv/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n\nNow, plug this into the Lorentz factor equation:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04)\nγ = 1 / √0.96\n\n**b. Calculate Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\nUsing the time dilation formula, we can now find the time that has passed in the Galaxy's reference frame:\nΔt = Δt' * γ = 50 s * (1 / √0.96)\nSince √0.96 is approximately 0.9798:\nΔt ≈ 50 / 0.9798 s\nΔt ≈ 51.031 s\n\nThis means that while 50 seconds have passed for the ejecta, about 51.03 seconds have passed in the Galaxy's frame of reference.\n\n**c. Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d):**\nThe distance traveled is the velocity multiplied by the time elapsed in the stationary (Galaxy) frame.\nd = v * Δt\n\nUsing the more precise value for Δt:\nd = 60,000 km/s * (50 / √0.96) s\nd = 3,000,000 km / √0.96\nd ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798\nd ≈ 3,061,849 km\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated distance of approximately 3,061,849 km is closest to the provided option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
