    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Materials:** The reaction begins with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene and 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium iodide (NaI) at an elevated temperature.\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** Sodium iodide reacts with the two dibromomethyl (-CHBr2) groups on the 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. This causes a debromination reaction, eliminating the four bromine atoms to form two new double bonds. The product of this in-situ reaction is 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene. This molecule is a reactive diene.\n*   The norbornadiene derivative has two double bonds, which act as dienophiles. Since 2 equivalents of the diene precursor are used, a double Diels-Alder reaction occurs, with one molecule of the generated diene adding to each of the two double bonds of the norbornadiene.\n*   **Product 1:** A complex polycyclic adduct formed from one molecule of the norbornadiene derivative and two molecules of 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene, with the tert-butoxy group still intact.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Aqueous sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** The tert-butoxy group (-OtBu) is a protecting group that is labile under strong acidic conditions. The aqueous sulfuric acid catalyzes the cleavage of the tert-butyl ether, replacing the tert-butoxy group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   **Product 2:** The same polycyclic structure as product 1, but with a hydroxyl group at the 7-position of the central bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane core.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Sulfur trioxide (SO3) and pyridine in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** This combination of reagents is used for the Parikh-Doering oxidation. This is a mild method to oxidize secondary alcohols to ketones. The secondary alcohol in product 2 is oxidized to a ketone.\n*   **Product 3:** A ketone, with the carbonyl group at the 7-position of the central bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane core.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n\n*   **Condition:** Heating at 150Â°C.\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** Large adducts formed via Diels-Alder reactions often undergo a reverse reaction, called a retro-Diels-Alder reaction, upon heating. In this case, heating product 3 causes the molecule to fragment. This process is expected to reverse the two Diels-Alder reactions.\n*   The fragmentation yields three components:\n    1.  Two molecules of the diene used in the first step: 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n    2.  The central core of the molecule, which would be bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one. This molecule is known to be unstable and readily eliminates a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) via a cheletropic reaction to form the very stable aromatic molecule, benzene.\n*   Therefore, the final products of the heating step are two molecules of 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene, one molecule of benzene, and one molecule of carbon monoxide.\n\n**Identifying \"Product 4\" and Counting Distinct Hydrogens**\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on the final product 4. Since multiple products are formed, and \"benzene\" (which has 1 type of hydrogen) is not a likely answer given the options, \"product 4\" likely refers to the major organic product other than benzene, which is **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**.\n\nLet's determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in this molecule (C8H8). The structure is a six-membered ring with two double bonds inside the ring (at C1-C2 and C3-C4) and two exocyclic double bonds at the other two carbon atoms (C5 and C6). Assuming the molecule is planar for maximum conjugation, it possesses a C2 axis of symmetry that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n\nDue to this symmetry:\n1.  The hydrogen on C1 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C4. (Set 1)\n2.  The hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C3. (Set 2)\n3.  On the exocyclic methylene group at C5 (=CH2), the two hydrogens are chemically different (diastereotopic). Let's call them \"inner\" and \"outer\". The C2 symmetry makes the \"inner\" hydrogen on C5 equivalent to the \"inner\" hydrogen on C6. (Set 3)\n4.  Similarly, the \"outer\" hydrogen on C5 is equivalent to the \"outer\" hydrogen on C6. (Set 4)\n\nCounting these sets, we find there are **4** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
