    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the flux ratio:\n\n1.  **Identify Neutrino Sources by Energy:** First, we need to know which nuclear reactions in the Sun produce neutrinos in the specified energy bands. The primary neutrino-producing reactions are part of the proton-proton (pp) chain and the CNO cycle.\n    *   **pp-I chain:** Produces low-energy *pp* neutrinos (up to 0.42 MeV). These are below both energy bands in question.\n    *   **pp-II chain:** This branch produces monoenergetic *⁷Be* (Beryllium-7) neutrinos. About 90% of these have an energy of 862 keV (0.862 MeV), with the remaining 10% at 384 keV.\n    *   **pp-III chain:** This branch produces high-energy *⁸B* (Boron-8) neutrinos, which have a continuous energy spectrum up to about 15 MeV. This branch is crucial to the question.\n    *   **CNO cycle:** This cycle produces neutrinos from the decay of *¹³N* (up to 1.20 MeV) and *¹⁵O* (up to 1.73 MeV), both with continuous energy spectra. These contribute a small fraction (about 1-2%) to the Sun's total energy and neutrino output compared to the pp-chain.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hypothetical Scenario:** The question states that the pp-III branch stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Since that is the travel time for neutrinos from the Sun to Earth, we would observe the effects of this shutdown *now*.\n    *   The defining reaction of the pp-III branch is the fusion of Beryllium-7 with a proton to create Boron-8 (⁷Be + p → ⁸B + γ).\n    *   The subsequent decay of Boron-8 (⁸B → ⁸Be* + e⁺ + νₑ) is what produces the high-energy *⁸B* neutrinos.\n    *   Therefore, if the pp-III branch stops, the flux of *⁸B* neutrinos immediately ceases.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Flux in Each Energy Band:** Now, let's look at what neutrinos are left in our two energy bands of interest.\n    *   **Band 1 (700-800 keV or 0.7-0.8 MeV):**\n        *   The *⁸B* neutrinos, which would normally contribute here, are now absent.\n        *   The main *⁷Be* line is at 862 keV, which is *outside* this band.\n        *   *pp* neutrinos are too low in energy.\n        *   The only remaining contributors are the neutrinos from the CNO cycle (*¹³N* and *¹⁵O*), which have continuous spectra that pass through this range. However, their flux is very low.\n\n    *   **Band 2 (800-900 keV or 0.8-0.9 MeV):**\n        *   Again, there are no *⁸B* neutrinos.\n        *   Crucially, this band contains the very strong, monoenergetic line from the pp-II branch's *⁷Be* neutrinos at 862 keV. This reaction path remains unchanged.\n        *   A small number of CNO neutrinos will also fall within this band.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio of Flux (band 1) / Flux (band 2).\n    *   Flux in Band 1 consists only of the very low flux from CNO neutrinos.\n    *   Flux in Band 2 is completely dominated by the massive flux from the 862 keV *⁷Be* neutrino line. The contribution from CNO neutrinos in this band is negligible in comparison.\n    *   Therefore, the flux in Band 1 is extremely small compared to the flux in Band 2. The ratio will be a very small number, much less than 1.\n\n    Let's look at the options:\n    A) 0.1 (10⁻¹)\n    B) 10\n    C) 1\n    D) 0.01 (10⁻²)\n\n    Given that the flux in band 2 is overwhelmingly larger than the flux in band 1, the ratio will be very small. The CNO flux is roughly 1% of the total pp-chain flux. The ⁷Be neutrino flux is a substantial component of the pp-chain flux (second only to the pp-neutrinos themselves). The flux in band 1 is just a small slice of the CNO spectrum, while the flux in band 2 contains the entirety of the dominant ⁷Be line. Thus, a ratio of 0.01 or even smaller is expected.\n\n<<<D>>>"
