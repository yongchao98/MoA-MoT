    "To identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound, a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data is necessary.\n\n1.  **Analyze the functional groups and structural elements:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituents. The aromatic ring itself contributes 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds). A di-substituted benzene ring will have 4 aromatic protons. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two signals for these protons, which is characteristic of a para-substituted ring.\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum:** The presence of an ester group (-COO-) is confirmed. This group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond, which adds one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum - Vinyl-H signals:** The spectrum shows two signals for vinyl protons (-CH=CH-), described as one doublet and one doublet of quartets. This specific splitting pattern is a classic indicator of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). The vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split into a doublet of quartets by the other vinyl proton and the three methyl protons. The other vinyl proton appears as a doublet. This group (-CH=CH-) contains a carbon-carbon double bond, which adds another degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum - CH₃ and CH₂ signals:** There are two signals for methyl (-CH₃) groups and no signals for methylene (-CH₂) groups. One methyl group is part of the propenyl substituent (-CH=CH-CH₃). The second methyl group must be part of the ester, forming either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). The absence of -CH₂ signals is a crucial constraint.\n\n2.  **Determine the Degrees of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    *   Aromatic ring = 4 DBE\n    *   Ester (C=O) = 1 DBE\n    *   Vinyl group (C=C) = 1 DBE\n    *   **Total DBE = 6**\n\n3.  **Assemble the molecular fragments to find the formula:**\n    *   Aromatic ring: C₆H₄ (4 hydrogens)\n    *   Propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃): C₃H₅ (5 hydrogens: 1H vinyl + 1H vinyl + 3H methyl)\n    *   Ester part containing one methyl group (e.g., -COOCH₃): C₂H₃O₂ (3 hydrogens from the methyl group)\n    *   **Total Carbon atoms:** 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 2 (ester part) = 11 carbons.\n    *   **Total Hydrogen atoms:** 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (ester methyl) = 12 hydrogens.\n    *   **Total Oxygen atoms:** 2 (from the ester group).\n\n    This assembly leads to the molecular formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n4.  **Verify the proposed formula and rule out other options:**\n    *   **D) C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** The DBE for this formula is 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 6. This matches the required DBE calculated from the structural features. All spectroscopic data can be perfectly explained by a molecule with this formula, such as methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate or 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate. Both these structures are isomers with the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂, have a di-substituted aromatic ring, an ester, a propenyl group, two methyl groups, and no methylene groups, and would exhibit six distinct signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n    *   **A) C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** The DBE is 12 - (14/2) + 1 = 6. While the DBE is correct, it is not possible to construct a molecule with this formula that also fits the NMR data (two CH₃ groups and no CH₂ groups).\n    *   **B) C₁₂H₁₂O₂:** The DBE is 12 - (12/2) + 1 = 7. This does not match the calculated DBE of 6 from the described functional groups.\n    *   **C) C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** The DBE is 11 - (14/2) + 1 = 5. This contradicts the required DBE of 6, as it does not account for the C=C double bond of the vinyl group, which is explicitly identified in the NMR spectrum.\n\nBased on the thorough analysis of the spectral information, the only chemical formula that fits all the given data is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<D>>>"
