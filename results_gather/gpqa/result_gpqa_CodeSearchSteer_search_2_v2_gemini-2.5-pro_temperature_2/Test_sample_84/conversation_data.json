    "The solution to this problem involves a multi-step calculation based on the principles of planetary equilibrium temperature and the radial velocity method for exoplanet detection.\n\nFirst, the equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates back into space. The formula for equilibrium temperature can be simplified for this problem. Given that the star's properties (temperature and radius) are constant for both planets and that their albedos are the same, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures depends only on their respective distances (semi-major axes, 'a') from the star:\n\n**T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a_2 / a_1)**\n\nNext, we must find the ratio of the semi-major axes. This can be derived from the information provided by the radial velocity (RV) method. The gravitational pull of an orbiting planet causes a \"wobble\" in its host star, which is observable as a periodic Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines. For a planet in a circular orbit, the amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is related to the planet's mass (M_p), the star's mass (M_star), and the semi-major axis (a) of the planet's orbit by the following equation:\n\n**K = M_p * √(G / (a * M_star))**\n\nHere, G is the gravitational constant. The maximum Doppler shift in wavelength (Δλ) is directly proportional to this radial velocity amplitude.\n\nBy rearranging this formula to solve for the semi-major axis 'a', we get:\n\n**a = (G * M_p²) / (K² * M_star)**\n\nWe can now establish a ratio for the semi-major axes of the two planets (a_2 / a_1). In this ratio, the gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n\n**a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K_1 / K_2)²**\n\nThe ratio of the RV amplitudes (K_1 / K_2) is the same as the ratio of their observed Doppler shifts (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2). Using the given values:\n*   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n*   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n*   Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n\nWe can calculate the ratios:\n*   M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n*   K_1 / K_2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n\n**a_2 / a_1 = (5/7)² * (3/4)² = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784**\n\nFinally, we substitute this ratio back into the equation for the equilibrium temperature ratio:\n\n**T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(225 / 784) = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357**\n\nThus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>"
