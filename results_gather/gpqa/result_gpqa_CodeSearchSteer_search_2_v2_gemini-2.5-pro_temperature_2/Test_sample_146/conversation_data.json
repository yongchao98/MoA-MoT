    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the velocity of particle A.\n\n**1. Initial State Energy**\n\nThe annihilation process begins with a proton ($p$) and a slowly moving antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). Since the antiproton's movement is slow, its kinetic energy is considered negligible. We assume the proton is at rest. The total energy in the initial state is therefore the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n\nThe rest mass energy of a proton is approximately 938.3 MeV. Since a proton and an antiproton have the same mass, the initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is:\n\n$E_{initial} = E_{p} + E_{\\bar{p}} = m_{p}c^{2} + m_{\\bar{p}}c^{2} = 2 \\times (m_{p}c^{2})$\n$E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.3 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.6 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n**2. Final State Energy**\n\nThe annihilation results in four particles: two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$. According to the problem statement, the rest mass energy of each particle A ($m_{A}c^{2}$) is 300 MeV. The total energy in the final state ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the relativistic energies of these four particles. Due to the conservation of momentum from a near-rest initial state, the particles must be ejected with equal speeds to maintain a total momentum of zero.\n\nThe total final energy is:\n\n$E_{final} = 4 \\times E_{A} = 4 \\times \\gamma m_{A}c^{2}$\nWhere $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is given by $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\n**3. Conservation of Energy**\n\nBy applying the principle of conservation of energy, the initial energy must equal the final energy:\n\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n$1876.6 \\, \\text{MeV} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\, \\text{MeV})$\n\n**4. Calculation of the Velocity**\n\nFirst, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1876.6}{4 \\times 300} = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\nNext, we use the definition of $\\gamma$ to solve for the velocity ($v$):\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n$1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nNow, we substitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n$v/c \\approx 0.7688$\n\nSo, the velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77c.\n\n$v \\approx 0.77c$\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
