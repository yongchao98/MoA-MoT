    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the structure of the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded hydrogen atom.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reaction Analysis\n\n1.  **Product 1:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with potassium hydroxide (KOH), yielding a product with a ketone functional group (IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹) and a proton NMR spectrum indicating the presence of 14 protons. A subsequent reaction step involves ozonolysis, which characteristically cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. This implies that a C=C bond must be present. There is a contradiction, as the proton count of 14 suggests a saturated ketone with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O, while the ozonolysis step requires an unsaturated precursor, which would have fewer protons.\n\n    This contradiction suggests a likely error in the provided proton count. If we assume the molecule contains a double bond and a ketone within a C₁₀ framework, the formula would be C₁₀H₁₂O. A plausible structure that fits the spectral data, particularly the unique signal at 4.79 ppm (2H), is **7-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. The signal at 4.79 ppm is characteristic of the two protons of an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂). The ketone in the six-membered ring accounts for the IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n\n2.  **Product 2:** Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide, which is a classic Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces the ketone at the C-3 position to a hydroxyl group, leaving the double bond untouched. Therefore, Product 2 is **7-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n3.  **Product 3:** A solution of Product 2 is subjected to reductive ozonolysis (ozone followed by dimethyl sulfide). This reaction cleaves the exocyclic double bond (C=CH₂) and converts it into a ketone (C=O). The alcohol group at the C-3 position remains unchanged. The resulting structure, Product 3, is **3-hydroxybicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-one**.\n\n### Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3\n\nThe final step is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable hydrogen atom in Product 3, which is 3-hydroxybicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-one.\n\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** The protons in the molecule are either on the carbon framework, or the hydroxyl proton (-OH). The hydroxyl proton will exchange with a deuterated solvent and is excluded by the question. The protons alpha to the ketone (at C-6 and C-8) are deshielded. However, the proton on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-3) is even more deshielded due to the electronegativity of the oxygen atom. Its chemical shift is typically in the 3.5-4.5 ppm range, while protons alpha to a ketone are usually around 2.5 ppm. Therefore, H-3 is the most deshielded proton of interest.\n\n*   **Coupling of H-3:** The H-3 proton resides on a six-membered ring that adopts a chair-like conformation. It is coupled to its neighboring protons on carbons C-2 and C-4. Both C-2 and C-4 are methylene (-CH₂) groups. Thus, H-3 is coupled to a total of four protons.\n\n*   **Splitting Pattern:** In a chair conformation, the four neighboring protons are not magnetically equivalent. There are two axial protons and two equatorial protons.\n    *   The coupling between H-3 and the two adjacent axial protons results in a large coupling constant (J_ax-ax).\n    *   The coupling between H-3 and the two adjacent equatorial protons results in a smaller coupling constant (J_ax-eq).\n\n    Since H-3 is coupled to two sets of two equivalent protons, each with a different coupling constant, its signal will be split into a **triplet of triplets**. First, the coupling to two protons gives a triplet, and then each peak of that triplet is further split into another triplet by the other pair of protons.\n\nTherefore, the coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen atom is a triplet of triplets.\n\n<<<D>>>"
