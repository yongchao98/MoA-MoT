    "I will analyze each proposed reaction sequence to determine which one is the most efficient and logical for synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the directing effects of different substituent groups on an aromatic ring during electrophilic substitution reactions.\n\nThe target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2). These groups are all *meta* to each other, located at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n\nHere is an analysis of the directing effects of the involved functional groups:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Amino group (-NH2):** Activating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n**A) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene reacts with acetyl chloride in the presence of AlCl3 to form acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director. This is a good first step.\n2.  **Bromination:** The acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone. This correctly establishes the 1,3-relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n3.  **Nitration:** In 3-bromoacetophenone, we have two substituents: the acetyl group at C1 (a *meta*-director) and the bromine at C3 (an *ortho, para*-director). The acetyl group directs the new nitro group to position C5. The bromo group directs to positions C2, C4, and C6. Although the directing effects are conflicting, the position *meta* to both groups (C5) is significantly favored, leading to the desired product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. The acetyl group strongly deactivates the ring, particularly at the *ortho* positions (C2, C6), making them less favorable for substitution. The subsequent steps listed (reduction of a nitro group) are irrelevant as the target molecule has been successfully formed. The first three steps represent a viable, high-yield pathway.\n\n**B) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n1.  **Bromination:** Benzene is converted to bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n2.  **Nitration:** This step will produce a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. This sequence does not lead to the required 1,3-disubstituted intermediate, making it impossible to form the 1,3,5-trisubstituted final product.\n\n**C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl ...**\n1.  **Nitration:** Benzene is nitrated to form nitrobenzene. The nitro group is a strong *meta*-director.\n2.  **Bromination (implied, but missing):** To achieve a 1,3,5 substitution, a bromination step would be logical here to form 3-bromonitrobenzene.\n3.  **Acylation (implied, but missing):** A Friedel-Crafts acylation would then be needed. However, this reaction is ineffective on strongly deactivated rings like nitrobenzene or 3-bromonitrobenzene. The listed sequence starting with the reduction of nitrobenzene (Fe/HCl) and subsequent diazotization and removal is illogical for reaching the target product.\n\n**D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n1.  **Nitration:** Benzene becomes nitrobenzene.\n2.  **Reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group (-NH2), forming aniline. The amino group is a strong *ortho, para*-director.\n3.  **Acylation:** The amino group is acylated to form acetanilide. This is done to moderate the activating effect of the amine and for protection.\n4.  **Bromination:** Acetanilide undergoes bromination. The acetamido group directs the bromine to the *para* position (due to sterics), yielding 4-bromoacetanilide. This path also fails to produce the necessary *meta* substitution pattern.\n\nBased on this analysis, the sequence described in the first three steps of option A is the most chemically sound and direct route to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one with a high yield.\n\n<<<A>>>"
