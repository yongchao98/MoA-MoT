    "The existence of magnetic monopoles—isolated north or south poles—would fundamentally alter two of Maxwell's equations to create a more symmetric set of laws for electricity and magnetism.\n\nThe affected equations would be:\n*   **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** In our universe, this law states that the divergence of the magnetic field (∇·B) is zero, which is a mathematical way of saying that magnetic monopoles do not exist. If they did exist, they would act as sources or \"sinks\" for the magnetic field, much like electric charges do for the electric field. The equation would be modified to show that the divergence of the magnetic field is proportional to the magnetic charge density (ρm). This law relates to the **divergence of the magnetic field**.\n\n*   **Faraday's Law of Induction:** This law describes how a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field (the curl of E, or ∇×E). In a universe with magnetic monopoles, the movement of these monopoles would constitute a \"magnetic current\" (Jm). This magnetic current would also induce a circulating electric field, adding a new term to Faraday's Law. This law relates to the **circulation (or curl) of the electric field**.\n\nTherefore, the two equations that would change are the ones related to the divergence of the magnetic field and the circulation of the electric field.\n\n<<<B>>>"
