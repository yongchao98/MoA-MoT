    "The solution to this problem involves understanding the relationship between the parameters measured in the radial velocity (RV) method. Here is a step-by-step derivation of the answer:\n\n1.  **Understanding the RV Method:** The radial velocity method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic \"wobble\" of a host star caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. This wobble induces a Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines. When the star moves towards us, its light is blueshifted, and when it moves away, it is redshifted. The magnitude of this shift is directly related to the star's velocity along our line of sight.\n\n2.  **Relating Wavelength Shift to Velocity:** The observed radial velocity of the star (*v*<sub>r</sub>) is directly proportional to the periodic shift in wavelength (Δλ). The amplitude of the velocity wave, known as the semi-amplitude (*K*), is therefore directly proportional to the amplitude of the wavelength shift.\n    *   K ∝ Δλ\n\n    Given the wavelength shifts for the two planets, we have:\n    *   Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom\n    *   Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes is K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7.\n\n3.  **Connecting Velocity to Orbital Period:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude (*K*) is related to the planet's mass (*M*<sub>p</sub>), the star's mass (*M*<sub>*</sub>), and the orbital period (*P*). The formula, derived from Kepler's Laws of Motion, is approximately:\n\n    K ∝ (Mₚ) / (M\\*^(2/3) * P^(1/3))\n\n    This shows an inverse relationship between the velocity semi-amplitude and the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n4.  **Deriving the Relationship for the Period:** We can rearrange the formula to solve for the orbital period (*P*):\n\n    P^(1/3) ∝ Mₚ / (M\\*^(2/3) * K)\n\n    Cubing both sides gives:\n\n    P ∝ Mₚ³ / (M\\*² * K³)\n\n5.  **Calculating the Ratio of the Orbital Periods:** We need to find the ratio P₂ / P₁. Using the proportionality from the previous step:\n\n    P₂ / P₁ = [ Mₚ₂³ / (M\\*₂² * K₂³) ] / [ Mₚ₁³ / (M\\*₁² * K₁³) ]\n\n    The problem provides key information that simplifies this ratio:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: M\\*₁ = M\\*₂.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: Mₚ₁ ≈ Mₚ₂.\n\n    Because of these similarities, the terms for the masses cancel out, leaving:\n\n    P₂ / P₁ ≈ K₁³ / K₂³ = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Substituting the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes (which is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts):\n\n    P₂ / P₁ ≈ (5 / 7)³ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n\n*   A) ~ 1.40\n*   B) ~ 0.36\n*   C) ~ 1.96\n*   D) ~ 0.85\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 0.36 matches option B. This means the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, making it significantly shorter. This is consistent with the fact that its larger induced wavelength shift implies a greater stellar velocity, which in turn suggests a closer and faster orbit.\n\n<<<B>>>"
