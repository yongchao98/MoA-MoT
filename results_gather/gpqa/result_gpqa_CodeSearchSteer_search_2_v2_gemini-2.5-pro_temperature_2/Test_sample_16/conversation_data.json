    "To determine the concentration of calcium ions in the solution, we need to consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe reaction for the formation of the Ca-EDTA complex ([CaY]²⁻) is the reverse of its dissociation. The problem provides the formation constant (Kf), also known as the stability constant, KCa-EDTA.\n\n**1. Set up the dissociation reaction:**\n\nThe Ca-EDTA complex dissociates into calcium ions and EDTA ions.\n[CaY]²⁻  ⇌  Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n**2. Relate the dissociation constant (Kd) to the formation constant (Kf):**\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this dissociation (Kd) is the reciprocal of the formation constant (Kf).\nKd = 1 / Kf = 1 / (5x10¹⁰) = 2x10⁻¹¹\n\n**3. Express the equilibrium concentrations:**\n\nWe can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the concentration of the dissociated ions. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions that form from the dissociation.\n\n*   **Initial Concentration:**\n    *   [[CaY]²⁻] = 0.02 M\n    *   [Ca²⁺] = 0 M\n    *   [Y⁴⁻] = 0 M\n*   **Change in Concentration:**\n    *   [[CaY]²⁻] = -x\n    *   [Ca²⁺] = +x\n    *   [Y⁴⁻] = +x\n*   **Equilibrium Concentration:**\n    *   [[CaY]²⁻] = 0.02 - x\n    *   [Ca²⁺] = x\n    *   [Y⁴⁻] = x\n\n**4. Write the dissociation constant expression:**\n\nKd = ( [Ca²⁺] [Y⁴⁻] ) / [ [CaY]²⁻ ]\n\n**5. Solve for x:**\n\nSubstitute the equilibrium concentrations into the expression:\n2x10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n\nBecause the formation constant (Kf) is very large, the complex is very stable, and the amount of dissociation (x) will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\n2x10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\nNow, solve for x²:\nx² ≈ (2x10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\nx² ≈ 4x10⁻¹³\n\nNow, find the square root to solve for x, which represents the [Ca²⁺]:\nx = √(4x10⁻¹³)\nx = √(40x10⁻¹⁴)\nx ≈ 6.32x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is approximately 6.3x10⁻⁷ M. Comparing this to the given options, it matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
