    "Here is the step-by-step derivation for the required Lorentz factor.\n\n### Principles of Particle Decay\n\nThe decay of unstable particles follows an exponential law. The fraction of particles, `N/N₀`, that survive after a time `t` in their own rest frame is given by:\n\nN/N₀ = e<sup>(-t/τ)</sup>\n\nwhere:\n*   `N` is the number of particles remaining.\n*   `N₀` is the initial number of particles.\n*   `τ` is the proper mean lifetime of the particle (the average lifetime in its rest frame).\n\n### Relativistic Effects (Time Dilation)\n\nBecause the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, we must consider the effects of special relativity. An observer in the laboratory frame (the detector's frame) will see the particle's internal clock running slower. This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n\nThe lifetime of the particle as measured in the lab frame (`τ'`) is longer than its proper lifetime (`τ`) and is given by:\n\n`τ' = γτ`\n\nHere, `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nwhere `v` is the particle's velocity and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n### Solving the Problem\n\nThe time it takes for a particle to travel from the center of the detector to its inner wall (a distance `R` of 30 meters) in the lab frame is `t_lab`. Since the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic velocities, we can approximate their speed `v` as being equal to the speed of light `c`.\n\n`t_lab ≈ R/c`\n\nThe fraction of particles that survive this journey to the detector wall is determined by the decay law, using the time measured in the lab frame (`t_lab`) and the dilated lifetime (`τ'`).\n\nThe survival probability `P` is:\n\nP = N/N₀ = e<sup>(-t_lab / τ')</sup> = e<sup>-(R/c) / (γτ)</sup>\n\nThis can be written as:\n\nP = e<sup>-k/γ</sup>\n\nwhere `k = R / (cτ)` is a constant that depends on the detector radius and the particle's proper lifetime.\n\n**1. Using the initial conditions to find `k`:**\n\nWe are given that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁` is ~20, one-third (1/3) of the particles reach the detector.\n\n*   `P₁ = 1/3`\n*   `γ₁ = 20`\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n\n1/3 = e<sup>(-k/20)</sup>\n\nTo solve for `k`, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\nln(1/3) = -k/20\n-ln(3) = -k/20\n`k = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**2. Finding the new Lorentz factor (`γ₂`):**\n\nNow we want to find the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds (2/3) of the particles to reach the detector.\n\n*   `P₂ = 2/3`\n*   `γ₂ = ?`\n\nUsing the same survival equation with the value of `k` we just found:\n\n2/3 = e<sup>(-k / γ₂)</sup>\n2/3 = e<sup>- (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂</sup>\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(2/3) = - (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\nln(2) - ln(3) = - (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\n-(ln(3) - ln(2)) = - (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\nln(3/2) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\n\nNow, we can solve for `γ₂`:\n\nγ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)\n\nUsing the approximate values for the natural logarithms (ln(3) ≈ 1.0986 and ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055):\n\nγ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055\nγ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThis calculated value is extremely close to 54. Therefore, the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.\n\n<<<A>>>"
