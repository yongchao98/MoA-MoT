    "Here is the step-by-step calculation of the pH at the two specified points in the titration.\n\n### 1. Initial State and Dilution\n\n*   **Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH):**\n    *   Volume = 20.00 cm³ = 0.020 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.05 M\n    *   Moles = Volume × Concentration = 0.020 L × 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol\n\n*   **Dilution:**\n    *   The acetic acid solution is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n    *   New total volume = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.040 L\n    *   **New concentration of acetic acid:**\n    *   Concentration = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.040 L = 0.025 M\n\n### 2. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, forming its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This creates a buffer solution.\n\n*   **Reaction:** CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH reacted:** 0.001 mol × 25% = 0.00025 mol\n*   **Moles of CH₃COO⁻ formed:** 0.00025 mol\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH remaining:** 0.001 mol - 0.00025 mol = 0.00075 mol\n\nThe pH of a buffer solution can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\n*   **pH = pKa + log ([A⁻]/[HA])**\n    Where:\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka)\n    *   [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate).\n    *   [HA] is the concentration of the acid (acetic acid).\n\n*   **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   Ka = 1.85x10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log(1.85x10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   Since both the acid and its conjugate base are in the same solution, the ratio of their concentrations is equal to the ratio of their moles.\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log (0.00025 / 0.00075)\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log (1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - log(3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n    *   **pH ≈ 4.26**\n\n### 3. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa).\n\n*   **Moles of NaOH required:** Equal to the initial moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 mol.\n*   **Volume of 0.1 M NaOH added:**\n    *   Volume = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n*   **Total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n\n*   **Concentration of acetate (CH₃COO⁻) at the equivalence point:**\n    *   Concentration = Moles of acetate / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n\nThe acetate ion is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water, producing OH⁻ ions.\n\n*   **Hydrolysis reaction:** CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n\nTo find the pH, we must first calculate the concentration of OH⁻.\n\n*   **Calculate Kb for acetate:**\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka (where Kw = 1.0x10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C)\n    *   Kb = (1.0x10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85x10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41x10⁻¹⁰\n\n*   **Set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis:**\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   Let x = [OH⁻] = [CH₃COOH]\n    *   5.41x10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    *   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n    *   5.41x10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02\n    *   x² = (5.41x10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 = 1.082x10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082x10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29x10⁻⁶ M\n\n*   **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29x10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 5.48\n    *   **pH ≈ 8.52**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
