    "To eliminate an anti-nutritional compound, the goal is to inactivate the gene responsible for its synthesis. This is most effectively achieved by a mutation that prevents the formation of a functional protein. Let's analyze the impact of each mutation on protein synthesis.\n\nThe intact gene begins with the sequence `5’-ATG TTT CTC...`, where `ATG` is the start codon. This sequence is read by the ribosome in three-base units called codons to build a protein.\n\nHere's a breakdown of each mutant:\n*   **Mutant 1:** The sequence `5’-ATG TTC TAC...` changes the original codons. Compared to the intact `ATG TTT CTC...`, this mutation alters the third codon from `CTC` (which codes for the amino acid Leucine) to `TAC` (which codes for Tyrosine). This type of mutation, which swaps one amino acid for another, is called a **missense mutation**. A single amino acid change might not inactivate the protein; its effect can range from no change in function to complete loss of function, making the outcome uncertain.\n*   **Mutant 2:** The sequence `5’-ATG TTC TAA...` introduces a `TAA` codon at the third position. The `TAA` codon is one of the three \"stop\" codons (along with UAG and UGA in mRNA). Introducing a stop codon in the middle of a gene is called a **nonsense mutation**. This signals the cellular machinery to stop protein synthesis prematurely. The result is a drastically shortened, two-amino-acid peptide, which will almost certainly be non-functional.\n*   **Mutant 3:** The sequence `5’-ATG TTT TAC...` also shows a change in the third codon, from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). Similar to Mutant 1, this is a **missense mutation**, and its ability to completely eliminate the protein's function is not guaranteed.\n*   **Mutant 4:** The sequence in this mutant appears to involve multiple changes or deletions. If a number of bases not divisible by three were inserted or deleted, it would cause a **frameshift mutation**. Frameshift mutations alter the entire downstream sequence of amino acids and are also very likely to produce a non-functional protein. However, the mutation presented in **Mutant 2** is the most direct and certain way to knockout the gene's function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon very early in the protein-coding sequence. This nonsense mutation will lead to the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein, making it the most probable mutation to successfully eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>"
