    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of the given Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure.\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Schrödinger Cat State (ρ):** The state is given by the pure state vector:\n    |ψ⟩ = (cos(φ)|α⟩ + sin(φ)|-α⟩) / N\n    where N is the normalization constant, N = √(1 + sin(2φ)exp(-2|α|²)). The density matrix is ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ|.\n\n*   **Relative Entropy of Non-Gaussianity (δ):** This measure quantifies how different a state ρ is from a reference Gaussian state τ. The reference state τ is the Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments (mean displacement and covariance matrix) as ρ. The formula for relative entropy is S(ρ||τ) = Tr(ρ(ln ρ - ln τ)).\n    The prompt provides a simplified formula `del_b = trace(rho* ln(rho))-trace(tau* ln(tau))`. This corresponds to S(τ) - S(ρ), where S is the von Neumann entropy, S(σ) = -Tr(σ ln σ).\n\n*   **Simplification for Pure States:** Since the state ρ is a pure state, its von Neumann entropy is zero (S(ρ) = 0). Thus, the non-Gaussianity measure simplifies to δ = S(τ). We need to find the entropy of the reference Gaussian state.\n\n**2. Specialize the State**\n\nThe problem provides specific values:\n*   α = 0.5\n*   φ = -π/4\n\nLet's plug these into the state definition:\n*   cos(-π/4) = 1/√2\n*   sin(-π/4) = -1/√2\n*   |ψ⟩ becomes proportional to (|α⟩ - |-α⟩). This is known as an **odd Schrödinger cat state**.\n\n**3. The Small α Approximation (Odd Cat State → Single Photon Fock State)**\n\nFor small values of the amplitude α, the odd cat state `N(|α⟩ - |-α⟩)` is a good approximation of the single-photon Fock state |1⟩. Let's analyze this approximation for α = 0.5.\n\nThe Taylor expansion of a coherent state |α⟩ is:\n|α⟩ = e⁻|α|²/² ( |0⟩ + α|1⟩ + α²/√2! |2⟩ + ... )\n\nThe odd cat state `|α⟩ - |-α⟩` becomes:\ne⁻|α|²/² [ ( |0⟩ + α|1⟩ + ... ) - ( |0⟩ - α|1⟩ + ... ) ]\n≈ e⁻|α|²/² [ 2α|1⟩ + O(α³) ]\n\nThe state is dominated by the |1⟩ component. Given α = 0.5 is relatively small, we can approximate the non-Gaussianity of our state by calculating the non-Gaussianity of the |1⟩ state.\n\n**4. Calculate Non-Gaussianity for the |1⟩ Fock State**\n\n*   **State:** ρ = |1⟩⟨1| (this is a pure, non-Gaussian state).\n*   **Non-Gaussianity Measure:** δ = S(τ), where τ is the reference Gaussian state for ρ = |1⟩⟨1|.\n*   **Find the Reference State τ:** We need the first and second moments of the |1⟩ state.\n    *   **First Moment (displacement):** ⟨a⟩ = ⟨1|a|1⟩ = ⟨1|√1|0⟩ = 0.\n    *   **Second Moments (covariance):**\n        *   Average photon number: ⟨n⟩ = ⟨a†a⟩ = ⟨1|a†a|1⟩ = 1.\n        *   Squeezing term: ⟨a²⟩ = ⟨1|a²|1⟩ = ⟨1|a(√1|0⟩) = 0.\n\n*   The reference Gaussian state τ is the one with ⟨a⟩=0, ⟨a²⟩=0, and ⟨n⟩=1. A Gaussian state with zero displacement and zero squeezing is a **thermal state**.\n*   The density matrix for a thermal state with average photon number ⟨n⟩ is τ = Σ [⟨n⟩ⁿ / (⟨n⟩+1)ⁿ⁺¹] |n⟩⟨n|.\n*   **Calculate the Entropy of the Reference State S(τ):** The von Neumann entropy of a thermal state with average photon number ⟨n⟩ is given by the formula:\n    S(τ) = (⟨n⟩ + 1) ln(⟨n⟩ + 1) - ⟨n⟩ ln(⟨n⟩)\n\n    For our reference state, ⟨n⟩ = 1.\n    S(τ) = (1 + 1) ln(1 + 1) - 1 ln(1)\n    S(τ) = 2 ln(2) - 0\n    S(τ) ≈ 2 * 0.6931 = 1.3862\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe non-Gaussianity of the Schrödinger cat state with α=0.5 and φ=-π/4 can be approximated by the non-Gaussianity of the single-photon Fock state |1⟩, which is 2 ln(2). This value is approximately 1.38.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 2.48\nB) 0.25\nC) 0\nD) 1.38\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
