    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.**\nThis reaction is the electrophilic aromatic substitution (nitration) of toluene. The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene directs incoming electrophiles to the *ortho* and *para* positions. Without specific conditions to favor one over the other, a mixture is typically formed. The kinetic product distribution slightly favors the *ortho* isomer (*o*-nitrotoluene) over the *para* isomer (*p*-nitrotoluene). We will proceed assuming the major kinetic product, *o*-nitrotoluene, is product 1.\n\n**Product 1: *o*-nitrotoluene**\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄, forming product 2.**\nThis step involves the oxidation of the methyl group on *o*-nitrotoluene. Manganese dioxide (MnO₂) in the presence of sulfuric acid is an oxidizing agent capable of converting an alkyl group on an aromatic ring to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n\n**Product 2: *o*-nitrobenzoic acid**\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\nProduct 2, *o*-nitrobenzoic acid, is an acid. Aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is a strong base. The most straightforward and immediate reaction is an acid-base neutralization. The NaOH will deprotonate the carboxylic acid to form its corresponding sodium salt. Acetone in this context serves as a solvent. While reactions involving acetone and nitroaromatics in the presence of a base (like the Janovsky reaction) are known, they are less likely here compared to the simple acid-base reaction. Therefore, product 3 is the anion of *o*-nitrobenzoic acid.\n\n**Product 3: *o*-nitrobenzoate anion**\n\n**Determining the Molecular Symmetry of Product 3**\nNow we must determine the molecular symmetry group (point group) for the *o*-nitrobenzoate anion. The structure consists of a benzene ring with a carboxylate group (COO⁻) and a nitro group (NO₂) attached to adjacent carbons (positions 1 and 2).\n*   For the purpose of point group determination, we consider the lowest energy conformation, which is likely planar to maximize electronic resonance.\n*   Assuming the molecule is planar, it possesses a single plane of symmetry (σ), which is the plane containing the molecule itself.\n*   The molecule does not have a center of inversion (*i*) or any proper rotational axes of symmetry (Cₙ, for n>1).\n\nA molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\nHad we chosen the *para* isomer initially, the final product would have been the *p*-nitrobenzoate anion. This molecule has a C₂ axis and two vertical planes of symmetry, belonging to the C₂ᵥ point group, which is not among the options. The pathway starting with the major *ortho* product leads directly to one of the given choices.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of product 3 is **Cs**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
