    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds so they can be detected by optical ground-based telescopes, we need to consider the wavelength at which Earth's atmosphere becomes transparent to light.\n\n### Key Factors:\n\n*   **Lyman-alpha Wavelength (λ_emitted):** Neutral hydrogen absorbs light at the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) wavelength, which is approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å) or 121.6 nanometers (nm). This wavelength is in the ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n*   **Atmospheric Cutoff:** The Earth's atmosphere blocks most ultraviolet radiation. Ground-based optical telescopes can typically only detect light at wavelengths longer than about 300 to 350 nm (3000 to 3500 Å). A new instrument for the Very Large Telescope, called CUBES, is being specifically designed to observe in the 300-400 nm range, which is considered the very edge of the ground-based ultraviolet window. For a conservative estimate, we can use 3500 Å as the minimum observable wavelength.\n*   **Redshift (z):** Redshift describes how much the wavelength of light has been stretched as it travels through the expanding universe. It is calculated using the formula:\n    *z = (λ_observed / λ_emitted) - 1*\n\n### Calculation:\n\nUsing the values above, we can calculate the minimum redshift (`z_min`) required for the 1216 Å Lyman-alpha line to be shifted into the observable range of a ground-based telescope.\n\n1.  **Emitted Wavelength (λ_emitted):** 1216 Å\n2.  **Minimum Observed Wavelength (λ_observed):** ~3500 Å (a reasonable estimate for the atmospheric cutoff)\n3.  **Calculate Redshift:**\n    *   *z* = (3500 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\n    *   *z* ≈ 2.878 - 1\n    *   *z* ≈ 1.878\n\nThis calculated redshift of approximately 1.9 means that for a Lyman-alpha absorption feature to be detectable from the ground, the object must be at least at this redshift. Comparing this to the provided options:\n\n*   A) 1.2\n*   B) 3\n*   C) 1.9\n*   D) 2.4\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 1.9. Searches for Lyman-alpha emitters with ground-based telescopes are indeed performed at high redshifts, with some surveys starting around z ~ 2 and extending to z > 6.\n\n<<<C>>>"
