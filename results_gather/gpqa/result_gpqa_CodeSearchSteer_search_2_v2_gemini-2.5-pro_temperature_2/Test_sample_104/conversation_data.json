    "To determine the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same signal amplitude as the spotted star, we first need to calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the star's rotation. Then, we can equate this to the signal produced by a transiting exoplanet.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Brightness Variation from Starspots\n\nThe brightness of a star is related to the flux it emits, which, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, is proportional to the fourth power of its effective temperature (T⁴). The star has an unspotted effective temperature (T_eff) of 6000K, and the spots have a temperature (T_spot) of 5000K (a 1000K difference).\n\nThe problem states that one hemisphere is spotty with a filling factor (f) of 20% (or 0.20), while the other is unspotted. The rotational modulation of brightness will be the difference between the flux from the unspotted hemisphere facing the observer (maximum brightness) and the flux from the spotted hemisphere facing the observer (minimum brightness).\n\n1.  **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when we view the unspotted hemisphere. The flux is proportional to T_eff⁴.\n2.  **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when we view the spotted hemisphere. The flux from this hemisphere is a combination of the unspotted portion (80% of the area) and the spotted portion (20% of the area).\n    *   F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴\n\nThe amplitude of the light curve signal (ΔF/F_max) is the change in flux relative to the maximum flux:\n\nAmplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\nAmplitude = 1 - (F_min / F_max)\nAmplitude = 1 - [ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴ ] / T_eff⁴\nAmplitude = 1 - (1 - f) - f * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴\nAmplitude = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values:\n*   f = 0.20\n*   T_eff = 6000 K\n*   T_spot = 5000 K\n\nAmplitude = 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴]\nAmplitude = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]\nAmplitude = 0.20 * [1 - (625 / 1296)]\nAmplitude = 0.20 * [(1296 - 625) / 1296]\nAmplitude = 0.20 * (671 / 1296)\nAmplitude ≈ 0.20 * 0.51775\nAmplitude ≈ 0.10355\n\nSo, the brightness of the star varies by approximately 10.36% due to the spots.\n\n### Step 2: Equate to an Exoplanet Transit Signal\n\nWhen an exoplanet transits its star, it blocks a portion of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of this transit signal is approximately the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n\nTransit Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)\nTransit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\nWe want this transit depth to be equal to the amplitude of the signal from the starspots.\n\n(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude\n(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355\n\n### Step 3: Solve for the Relative Planet Radius (R_pl/R_star)\n\nTo find the radius of the planet relative to the star, we take the square root of the amplitude:\n\nR_pl / R_star = √0.10355\nR_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<B>>>"
