    "The problem asks to compare the total energy spectrum of the two emitted `E` particles in two different nuclear decays. This problem is analogous to comparing standard two-neutrino double beta decay with neutrinoless double beta decay involving the emission of a Majoron.\n\n### Analysis of the Decays\n\n1.  **Original Decay: 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V**\n    This is a multi-body decay, as there are at least three particles in the final state (in reality, six particles: two B, two E, and two V). The total energy released by the conversion of nucleons A to B, known as the Q-value, is shared among the final products. The two `V` particles (analogous to neutrinos) can carry away a variable amount of energy. Because of this, the sum of the kinetic energies of the two `E` particles is not fixed but is distributed over a continuous spectrum. The spectrum extends up to a maximum value, the endpoint `Q`, which occurs when the two `V` particles and the recoiling `B` nucleons carry away the minimum possible energy (essentially zero).\n\n2.  **Variant Decay: 2A -> 2B + 2E + M**\n    In this variant, the two `V` particles are replaced by a single, massless exotic particle `M`. Such a decay is akin to Majoron-emitting neutrinoless double beta decay. Since the final state still consists of multiple particles (two B, two E, and one M), the decay energy is shared among them. The particle `M` can carry away a variable amount of kinetic energy. Consequently, the sum of the kinetic energies of the two `E` particles must remain continuous, as energy is continuously partitioned between the `E` particles and the `M` particle. This eliminates options A and C, which state the spectrum becomes discrete.\n\n### Comparison of the Endpoints\n\nThe crucial difference lies in the composition of the final state particles and their masses. The endpoint of the `E` particle energy spectrum corresponds to the maximum possible kinetic energy they can collectively have.\n\n*   **In the first decay (2V)**, the total energy released (`Q_nuc`) must account for creating the rest mass of the two `E` particles and the two `V` particles, in addition to their kinetic energies.\n    The endpoint `Q` is given by:\n    `Q = Q_nuc - 2*m_E*c² - 2*m_V*c²`\n    Here, `Q` is the maximum kinetic energy available to the two `E` particles, and `m_V` is the rest mass of the `V` particle. Since `V` is a particle, it must have a non-negative mass (`m_V` ≥ 0).\n\n*   **In the second decay (1M)**, the total energy released (`Q_nuc`) must account for creating the rest mass of the two `E` particles. The particle `M` is specified as massless (`m_M` = 0).\n    The new endpoint `Q_new` is given by:\n    `Q_new = Q_nuc - 2*m_E*c² - 1*m_M*c² = Q_nuc - 2*m_E*c²`\n\nBy comparing the two endpoints, we can see that `Q_new = Q + 2*m_V*c²`. Since `V` is described as a \"much lighter particle\", it has a positive rest mass (`m_V > 0`). Therefore, the term `2*m_V*c²` is positive, which means `Q_new` is greater than `Q`.\n\nThe energy that was required to create the rest mass of the two `V` particles is now available as kinetic energy for the final state particles in the variant decay. This results in a higher maximum possible energy for the two `E` particles, thus increasing the endpoint of their spectrum.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe decay involving the massless particle `M` also results in a continuous energy spectrum for the `E` particles, but its endpoint is higher than that of the original decay involving two massive `V` particles. Research on various modes of double beta decay confirms that replacing final-state neutrinos with a single massless Majoron maintains a continuous electron sum-energy spectrum, but alters its shape and endpoint.\n\nTherefore, the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.\n\n<<<D>>>"
