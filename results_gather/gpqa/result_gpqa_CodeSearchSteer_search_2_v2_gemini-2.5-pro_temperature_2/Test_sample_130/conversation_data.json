    "The problem describes a classic organic chemistry synthesis followed by structural analysis using NMR spectroscopy. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem to arrive at the solution:\n\n**1. Identification of the Reactants**\n\n*   **Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated. Its anhydride shows a single proton signal at 7 ppm and two carbon signals at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. This is characteristic of **maleic anhydride**. The two equivalent protons on the double bond give the single ¹H NMR signal, while the two equivalent alkene carbons (137 ppm) and two equivalent carbonyl carbons (165 ppm) give the two ¹³C NMR signals.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene with methyl groups on all four carbons of the diene system and a CH₂ group at the 5-position.\n\n**2. The Reaction: Diels-Alder Cycloaddition**\n\nThe reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. Because of the way the reactants can approach each other, two stereoisomeric products are formed: the *endo* and the *exo* adducts.\n\n*   The **major product** is typically the ***endo*** **adduct**, formed via a transition state that benefits from stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n*   The **minor product** is the ***exo*** **adduct**.\n\n**3. Structural Analysis using 2D NOESY NMR**\n\nThe key to solving the problem lies in understanding what a Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) shows and how the *endo* and *exo* structures differ.\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy):** This technique shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically less than 5 Å apart), which helps in determining the 3D structure of a molecule.\n*   ***Endo* vs. *Exo* Geometry:**\n    *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the anhydride part of the molecule is positioned on the same side as the CH₂ bridge of the bicyclic system. This brings the protons on the bridgehead carbons (from maleic anhydride) close to the protons of the CH₂ bridge.\n    *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the anhydride is on the opposite side of the CH₂ bridge. Here, the bridgehead protons are far from the CH₂ bridge protons.\n*   **The Diagnostic Cross-Peak:** The problem states that a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor one. This must be the NOE interaction that is unique to the *endo* geometry. This specific interaction is between the **bridgehead protons** and the **CH₂ bridge protons**.\n\n**4. Assigning the NMR Signals**\n\nThe final step is to assign the proton resonances mentioned in the options to the protons identified in the structural analysis.\n\n*   **Bridgehead Protons:** These two protons are attached to the carbons that were part of maleic anhydride. They are adjacent to two carbonyl groups, which deshields them, placing their signal significantly downfield. \"A 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\" is a very reasonable assignment for these two chemically equivalent protons.\n*   **CH₂ Bridge Protons:** These two protons are part of the saturated CH₂ bridge. They are in a more shielded environment. Importantly, they are diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent. They couple to each other, giving rise to two separate signals, each appearing as a doublet (this is known as an AB system). \"A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\" corresponds to one of these bridge protons.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major (*endo*) product and absent in the minor (*exo*) product connects the bridgehead protons and the CH₂ bridge protons. Based on the chemical shift assignments, this cross-peak is between the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** and the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
