    "To determine the correct statement, we must first calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay.\n\n**1. Construct the Operator Matrix Ay**\n\nThe operator is given by Ay = c∙S, where c = h/4π and S is the matrix:\nS =  [ 0  -i ]\n     [ i   0 ]\n\nThis S matrix is the Pauli-Y spin matrix, σy. The operator Ay is the y-component of the spin angular momentum.\n\nSo, the matrix for Ay is:\nAy = (h/4π) * [ 0  -i ] = [ 0      -ih/4π ]\n               [ i   0 ]   [ ih/4π     0    ]\n\n**2. Calculate the Eigenvalues (a)**\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - aI) = 0, where 'a' is the eigenvalue and 'I' is the identity matrix.\n\ndet | -a      -ih/4π |  = 0\n    | ih/4π     -a   |\n\n(-a)(-a) - (-ih/4π)(ih/4π) = 0\na² - (-i² * (h/4π)²) = 0\na² - ( -(-1) * (h²/16π²) ) = 0\na² - (h²/16π²) = 0\na² = h²/16π²\na = ± h/4π\n\nThe eigenvalues are a₁ = +h/4π and a₂ = -h/4π. These are purely real values, as expected for a Hermitian operator representing a physical observable.\n\n*   **Analysis of Statement A:** This statement claims the imaginary parts are ±1/2 and real parts are ±1. This is incorrect.\n*   **Analysis of Statement C:** This statement correctly identifies the real parts as ±h/4π but incorrectly claims there are non-zero imaginary parts. This is incorrect.\n\n**3. Calculate the Eigenvectors (Eigenfunctions φ)**\n\nWe now solve the equation Ayφ = aφ for each eigenvalue.\n\n*   **For a = +h/4π:**\n    [ 0      -ih/4π ] [v₁] = (h/4π) [v₁]\n    [ ih/4π     0    ] [v₂]         [v₂]\n\n    This simplifies to the system of equations:\n    1.  -iv₂ = v₁\n    2.  iv₁ = v₂\n    If we choose v₁ = 1, then from the second equation, v₂ = i. This is consistent with the first equation (-i * i = 1).\n    So, the eigenvector φ₁ is proportional to [1, i]ᵀ.\n\n*   **For a = -h/4π:**\n    [ 0      -ih/4π ] [v₁] = -(h/4π) [v₁]\n    [ ih/4π     0    ] [v₂]          [v₂]\n\n    This simplifies to:\n    1.  -iv₂ = -v₁  => v₁ = iv₂\n    2.  iv₁ = -v₂\n    If we choose v₁ = 1, then v₂ = -i.\n    So, the eigenvector φ₂ is proportional to [1, -i]ᵀ.\n\n**4. Analyze the Remaining Statements**\n\n*   **Analysis of Statement B:** \"The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.\"\n    This statement is imprecise. The \"basis functions of the matrix operator\" usually refers to the basis in which the matrix is written, which is typically the standard basis (ᵀ andᵀ). These are the eigenvectors of the Az operator, not the Ay operator. The eigenfunctions we calculated ([1, i]ᵀ and [1, -i]ᵀ) form a basis for the 2D space, but they are not the basis in which the Ay matrix was initially given. Thus, statement B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Analysis of Statement D:** \"The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.\"\n    Let's evaluate the two parts of this statement:\n    1.  **Can it be an eigenfunction of A²?** The operator A² represents the square of the total intrinsic angular momentum. For a spin-1/2 particle like a muon, A² = s(s+1)ħ²I, where s=1/2 and ħ = h/2π. This results in A² being a constant multiplied by the identity matrix (I). Any vector is an eigenvector of the identity matrix. Therefore, any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². This part is correct.\n    2.  **Can it be an eigenfunction of Az?** For an eigenfunction to be shared between two operators, those operators must commute. The commutation relation for angular momentum components is [Ai, Aj] = iħεᵢⱼₖAₖ. For the Y and Z components, this gives [Ay, Az] = iħAx. Since the commutator is not zero, Ay and Az do not share a common set of eigenfunctions. An eigenfunction of Ay cannot simultaneously be an eigenfunction of Az. This part is also correct.\n\nTherefore, statement D is the only correct statement.\n\n<<<D>>>"
