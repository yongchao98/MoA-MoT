    "### Analysis of the Reaction\n\nThis problem involves two separate reduction reactions of a dicarboxylic acid monoester, yielding enantiomeric lactone products. A careful analysis of the reactants, reagents, and products is necessary to determine the stereochemistry of the starting materials.\n\n**1. Product and Precursor Identification:**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is a derivative of `tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, which is a six-membered ring containing an oxygen atom and a carbonyl group, characteristic of a **delta-lactone**.\n*   **Lactone Formation:** Delta-lactones are formed by the intramolecular cyclization (esterification) of a **5-hydroxycarboxylic acid**.\n*   **Precursor:** The specific precursor for `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one` is `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`. The stereocenter at C3 of the acid corresponds to the stereocenter at C4 of the lactone. This cyclization reaction, typically acid-catalyzed (H+), does not alter the configuration of the stereocenter.\n\n**2. Starting Material Structure:**\n\n*   The options provide the starting material as `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n*   According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the principal functional group is the carboxylic acid, which defines carbon C1. \"Pentanoic acid\" defines a five-carbon chain.\n*   Therefore, the structure is `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(5)(=O)O(i-Bu)`. This molecule is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethyl-hexanedioic acid. More systematically, it's **3-ethylpentanedioic acid 1-isobutyl ester.** It contains a free carboxylic acid at one end and an isobutyl ester at the other.\n\n**3. Analysis of Reaction B (with BH₃):**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃) is a highly selective reducing agent. It vigorously reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols while typically leaving esters untouched under the same conditions.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  Starting with B, `(S)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO(iBu)`, BH₃ selectively reduces the `-COOH` group at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  The intermediate formed is `(S)-HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO(iBu)`.\n    3.  The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) hydrolyzes the isobutyl ester at the other end to a carboxylic acid.\n    4.  This produces `(S)-HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`, which is the required 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid precursor.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** This precursor cyclizes to form `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. Since the reaction preserves the stereocenter, starting material **B must have the (S) configuration**.\n\n**4. Analysis of Reaction A (with LiBH₄):**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) has a different selectivity than borane. It is known to readily reduce esters to primary alcohols, while being much less reactive towards carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid first reacts as an acid with the hydride, deprotonating to form a lithium carboxylate, which is resistant to reduction.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  Starting with A, `(R)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO(iBu)`, the LiBH₄ will first deprotonate the carboxylic acid.\n    2.  The LiBH₄ will then selectively reduce the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) then protonates the lithium carboxylate at C1, restoring the `-COOH` group.\n    4.  The resulting molecule is `(R)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`. This is a **4-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.**\n*   **Product Contradiction:** A 4-hydroxycarboxylic acid cyclizes to form a five-membered ring lactone (a gamma-lactone), not the six-membered delta-lactone specified in the problem. This presents a conflict with the known selectivity of LiBH₄.\n\n**5. Resolving the Contradiction:**\n\nThere is a less common, but known, reaction pathway for borohydrides with protic substrates like carboxylic acids. The reaction between LiBH₄ and the acidic proton of the carboxylic acid generates H₂ gas and BH₃ *in situ*. This newly formed borane can then act as the reducing agent, following the same selective pathway as seen in Reaction B (reducing the carboxylic acid end). While LiBH₄ itself preferentially reduces esters, its reaction with the starting material changes the effective reducing species.\n\n*   **Revised Mechanism for A:**\n    1.  `A`, `(R)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO(iBu)`, reacts with a portion of the LiBH₄ to generate BH₃.\n    2.  This in-situ BH₃ then reduces the `-COOH` group of another starting material molecule to `-CH₂OH`.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) hydrolyzes the ester and promotes cyclization, leading to the delta-lactone.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Under this valid, albeit more nuanced, interpretation, both LiBH₄ and BH₃ lead to the reduction of the same functional group (the carboxylic acid). Therefore, to obtain the (R)-lactone, **starting material A must have the (R) configuration.**\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n\n*   For Reaction A, to obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material must be: **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   For Reaction B, to obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material must be: **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
