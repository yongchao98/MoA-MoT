    "The identification of the unknown organic compound is based on the analysis of its 1H NMR spectrum. Here is a breakdown of the provided data:\n\n*   **Compound:** Unknown, with options of Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate.\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)\n    *   5.5 ppm (1H, dq)\n    *   2.1 ppm (3H, s)\n    *   1.6 ppm (3H, d)\n\n**Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n\n1.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet peak integrating to three protons is characteristic of a methyl group (CH₃) that is not coupled to any neighboring protons. This is indicative of an acetyl group (CH₃COO-), which is present in all four potential compounds (as they are all acetates).\n2.  **Signals at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm:** These signals are in the vinylic region (protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond).\n3.  **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** A doublet peak integrating to three protons suggests a methyl group (CH₃) coupled to a single proton. This pattern fits a propenyl group (CH₃-CH=CH-). A butenyl group, such as in but-2-enyl acetate (CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂OAc), would show a signal for a CH₂ group, which is absent in the data. This strongly suggests the compound is a propenyl acetate.\n4.  **Coupling Constant (J-value):** The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant (J) of 16.0 Hz. This J-value represents the coupling between the two vinylic protons. The magnitude of the coupling constant is crucial for determining the stereochemistry of the double bond.\n    *   For *trans* isomers, the coupling constant (³J) is typically in the range of 11-18 Hz.\n    *   For *cis* isomers, the coupling constant is smaller, generally between 6-15 Hz.\n    *   Since the observed J-value is 16.0 Hz, it falls squarely in the range for a *trans* configuration.\n\n**Structure Confirmation:**\n\nBased on this analysis, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**. Let's assign all the signals to the protons in this structure:\n\n*   **H**C=C**H**: The two vinylic protons.\n    *   The proton attached to the carbon with the acetate group (-CHOAc) is more deshielded and appears at **7.0 ppm**. It is a doublet because it's coupled only to the other vinylic proton.\n    *   The other vinylic proton (-CH=CH-CH₃) appears at **5.5 ppm**. It is a doublet of quartets (dq) because it is coupled to the other vinylic proton (d) and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (q).\n*   **CH₃**-CH=CH-: The methyl group protons appear at **1.6 ppm**. The signal is a doublet because it's coupled to the adjacent vinylic proton.\n*   CH₃**COO**: The acetyl methyl protons appear as a singlet at **2.1 ppm**.\n\nAll aspects of the provided 1H NMR data are consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
