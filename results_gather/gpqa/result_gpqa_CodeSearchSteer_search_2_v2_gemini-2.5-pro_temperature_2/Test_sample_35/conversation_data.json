    "An absorption line with an observed energy of 3.9 micro-electronvolts (µeV) from a structure at a distance of 2.1 gigaparsecs (Gpc) corresponds to the well-known 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen. To determine this, the redshift of the object must be calculated to find the energy of the line in its rest-frame.\n\nFirst, the distance of 2.1 Gpc is used to estimate the cosmological redshift (z). Based on cosmological models, a distance of this magnitude corresponds to a redshift of approximately z = 0.5. The relationship between the observed energy (E_obs) and the rest-frame energy (E_rest) is given by the formula E_rest = E_obs * (1 + z).\n\nUsing the given and estimated values:\n*   E_obs = 3.9 x 10⁻⁶ eV\n*   z ≈ 0.5\n\nThe rest-frame energy is calculated as:\nE_rest = (3.9 x 10⁻⁶ eV) * (1 + 0.5) = 5.85 x 10⁻⁶ eV, or 5.85 µeV.\n\nThis calculated rest-frame energy is a very close match to the energy of the hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen (H I), which is 5.87 µeV. This transition, which produces radiation with a wavelength of 21 cm, occurs when the spin of the electron flips relative to the spin of the proton in a solitary, neutral hydrogen atom.\n\nIn the Milky Way, this 21-cm line is a fundamental tool for mapping the structure of the interstellar medium. While the line can be seen in both emission and absorption, absorption lines are characteristically produced when a cooler gas lies in front of a warmer background source. The 21-cm line, particularly in absorption, is a primary indicator of the cold atomic interstellar medium, which consists of neutral hydrogen clouds with temperatures typically around 10 to 100 Kelvin. Therefore, this absorption line is most characteristically observed in the cold atomic interstellar medium of our galaxy.\n\n<<<A>>>"
