    "To clearly distinguish between two quantum energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in their energy measurements. This is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nThe principle can be stated as: ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, where:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n*   Δt is the uncertainty in time, which corresponds to the lifetime of the quantum state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\nA quantum state that exists for only a short time cannot have a definite energy. The finite lifetime of a state leads to a broadening of its energy level, known as the natural linewidth. To resolve two energy levels, the separation between them must be larger than this inherent energy uncertainty.\n\nThe two states have lifetimes of:\n*   τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n\nThe state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy uncertainty, which will be the limiting factor for resolving the two levels. In this case, τ₁ is the shorter lifetime.\n\nLet's calculate the minimum energy uncertainty (ΔE₁) for the first state:\nΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\nΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\nΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nFor the two energy levels to be clearly resolved, their energy difference must be significantly greater than this energy width. We can evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This is much larger than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **B) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **C) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is much smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **D) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly an energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is sufficiently large to ensure that the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished.\n\n<<<A>>>"
