    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum orbital period of the second planet.\n\n1.  **Understanding the Transit Condition and Impact Parameter**\n    The impact parameter, *b*, is the projected distance between the center of the star and the center of the planet at the middle of a transit, normalized by the star's radius (*R*<sub>s</sub>). For a circular orbit, it is defined as:\n    `b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s`\n    where *a* is the semi-major axis (orbital distance) and *i* is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n\n    For a transit or an occultation to occur, the planet's path must cross the stellar disk. This means the impact parameter *b* must be less than or equal to 1 (i.e., `b â‰¤ 1`). The maximum possible orbital distance for a planet to still transit is when its impact parameter is exactly 1.\n\n2.  **Using Planet 1's Data to Find the Orbital Inclination**\n    We are given the following for Planet 1:\n    *   Orbital period, *P*<sub>1</sub> = 3 days\n    *   Impact parameter, *b*<sub>1</sub> = 0.2\n\n    Using the impact parameter formula for Planet 1:\n    `b_1 = (a_1 * cos(i)) / R_s = 0.2`\n    Since both planets share the same orbital plane, the inclination *i* is the same for both. We can rearrange this equation to solve for `cos(i)`:\n    `cos(i) = (0.2 * R_s) / a_1`\n\n3.  **Determining the Maximum Orbital Distance for Planet 2**\n    For Planet 2 to exhibit transit and occultation events, its impact parameter *b*<sub>2</sub> must be at most 1. The maximum orbital period corresponds to the maximum possible orbital distance (*a*<sub>2,max</sub>), which occurs when *b*<sub>2</sub> = 1.\n    `b_2 = (a_{2,max} * cos(i)) / R_s = 1`\n    Solving for *a*<sub>2,max</sub>:\n    `a_{2,max} = R_s / cos(i)`\n\n4.  **Relating the Orbital Distances of the Two Planets**\n    Now we can substitute the expression for `cos(i)` that we found from Planet 1's data into the equation for *a*<sub>2,max</sub>:\n    `a_{2,max} = R_s / ((0.2 * R_s) / a_1)`\n    The stellar radius *R*<sub>s</sub> cancels out, giving:\n    `a_{2,max} = a_1 / 0.2 = 5 * a_1`\n    This tells us that the maximum orbital distance for Planet 2 is 5 times the orbital distance of Planet 1. The radii of the planets and the star are not needed to determine this ratio.\n\n5.  **Applying Kepler's Third Law**\n    Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period (*P*) and the semi-major axis (*a*) of planets orbiting the same star:\n    `(P_2 / P_1)^2 = (a_2 / a_1)^3`\n\n    We can now solve for the maximum orbital period of Planet 2, *P*<sub>2,max</sub>, by using the maximum semi-major axis, *a*<sub>2,max</sub>:\n    `P_{2,max}^2 = P_1^2 * (a_{2,max} / a_1)^3`\n\n6.  **Calculating the Final Answer**\n    Substitute the known values into the equation:\n    *   *P*<sub>1</sub> = 3 days\n    *   *a*<sub>2,max</sub> / *a*<sub>1</sub> = 5\n\n    `P_{2,max}^2 = (3 \\text{ days})^2 * (5)^3`\n    `P_{2,max}^2 = 9 * 125 = 1125`\n    `P_{2,max} = \\sqrt{1125} \\text{ days}`\n    `P_{2,max} = \\sqrt{25 * 45} = 5 * \\sqrt{9 * 5} = 5 * 3 * \\sqrt{5} = 15\\sqrt{5} \\text{ days}`\n\n    Calculating the numerical value:\n    `P_{2,max} \\approx 15 * 2.236 \\approx 33.54 \\text{ days}`\n\nThis value is approximately 33.5 days.\n\n<<<C>>>"
