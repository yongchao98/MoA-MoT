    "To determine the correct IUPAC name, we must first establish the structure of the molecule based on the description and then apply IUPAC nomenclature rules.\n\n1.  **Identify the Principal Functional Group:** The functional groups present are carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3). According to IUPAC rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority and will determine the parent name of the molecule. Therefore, the parent name is **benzoic acid**, and the carbon atom attached to the -COOH group is assigned locant number 1.\n\n2.  **Determine the Positions of Substituents:**\n    *   The carboxylic acid (-COOH) is at position 1.\n    *   A methoxy group (-OCH3) is para to the carboxylic acid, so it is at position 4.\n    *   A hydroxyl (-OH) group and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are ortho to the carboxylic acid. This means they are at positions 2 and 6.\n    *   A carbaldehyde (-CHO, prefix \"formyl\") and a cyano (-CN) group are meta to the carboxylic acid, so they are at positions 3 and 5.\n\n3.  **Refine Substituent Positions with Additional Constraints:**\n    *   The description states that the methoxy group and the hydroxyl group are both *ortho* to the cyano group.\n    *   The methoxy group is at position 4. For it to be ortho to the cyano group, the cyano group must be at position 3 or 5. This is consistent with what we already know.\n    *   The hydroxyl group is at position 2 or 6. For it to be ortho to the cyano group (at 3 or 5), they must be on adjacent carbons. This leads to two possibilities that are consistent with all constraints:\n        *   Possibility A: Hydroxyl at 2, Cyano at 3.\n        *   Possibility B: Hydroxyl at 6, Cyano at 5.\n\n    Let's complete the structure for Possibility A:\n    *   1: -COOH\n    *   2: -OH (ortho to COOH)\n    *   3: -CN (meta to COOH, ortho to -OH at 2 and -OCH3 at 4)\n    *   4: -OCH3 (para to COOH)\n    *   5: -CHO (meta to COOH)\n    *   6: -N(CH3)2 (ortho to COOH)\n\n4.  **Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules:**\n    *   The main functional group (-COOH) is at C1.\n    *   We need to number the ring to give the lowest possible locant set to the substituents. Both clockwise and counter-clockwise numbering from C1 result in the same locant set: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   When the locant sets are identical, we use alphabetical order of the prefixes to break the tie. The numbering is chosen to give the lowest locant to the substituent cited first in the name.\n    *   The prefixes in alphabetical order are: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n    *   The first prefix alphabetically is \"cyano\". We must choose the numbering direction that gives the \"cyano\" group the lower number.\n    *   Based on our structure (Possibility A), the cyano group is at position 3. If we numbered in the opposite direction, the dimethylamino group would be at 2 and the cyano group would be at 5. Since 3 is lower than 5, the numbering is confirmed.\n    *   The locants are: 2-hydroxy, 3-cyano, 4-methoxy, 5-formyl, 6-dimethylamino.\n\n5.  **Construct the Final Name:**\n    *   List the prefixes alphabetically with their assigned locants:\n        *   3-cyano\n        *   6-(dimethylamino)\n        *   5-formyl\n        *   2-hydroxy\n        *   4-methoxy\n    *   Combine them before the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n    The correct IUPAC name is **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - Incorrect locants.\n    *   B) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - Correct locants, but prefixes are not alphabetized.\n    *   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - This matches our derived name perfectly.\n    *   D) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - Incorrect locants resulting from the wrong numbering direction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
