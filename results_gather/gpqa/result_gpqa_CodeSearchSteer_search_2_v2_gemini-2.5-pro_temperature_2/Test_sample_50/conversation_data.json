    "To determine the net potential energy of the system, we can use the method of image charges.\n\n1.  **Method of Image Charges**: A point charge *q* placed at a distance *d* from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius *R* induces a charge distribution on the surface of the sphere. The electric field outside the sphere can be modeled by replacing the sphere with an \"image charge\" *q'* located inside the sphere along the line connecting the center and the charge *q*.\n\n2.  **Image Charge and its Location**:\n    *   The value of the image charge is `q' = -q * (R/d)`.\n    *   The position of the image charge, measured from the center of the sphere, is `b = R^2 / d`.\n\n3.  **Calculating Potential Energy**: The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge *q* from infinity to its position at distance *d* from the center of the sphere. The potential energy `U` of a charge `q` in the potential `V` created by other charges is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`. The factor of 1/2 is crucial and arises because the energy is stored in the electric field, and it corrects for double-counting the interaction energy.\n\n4.  **Potential at the location of charge q**: The potential at the location of the charge *q* due to the induced charges on the sphere is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge *q'*.\n\n    The distance between the charge *q* (at *d*) and the image charge *q'* (at *b*) is `d - b`.\n\n    `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n    The potential `V_induced` at the position of *q* due to *q'* is:\n    `V_induced = (1 / 4πε₀) * q' / (d - b)`\n    Substituting the values for *q'* and *(d - b)*:\n    `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    where `k = 1 / 4πε₀`.\n\n    Simplifying this expression:\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Final Calculation of Potential Energy**: Now, we can calculate the potential energy *U*:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nB) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated expression matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
