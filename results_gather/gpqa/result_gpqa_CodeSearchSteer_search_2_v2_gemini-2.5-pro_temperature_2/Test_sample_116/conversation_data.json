    "Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. Let's analyze each compound to determine if it is chiral.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This compound belongs to a class of molecules called biphenyls. Normally, there is free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. However, when there are bulky groups in the positions ortho to the connecting bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'), rotation can be restricted. In this molecule, all four ortho positions are occupied by large groups (two nitro groups and two carboxylate groups). This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, makes the molecule unable to adopt a planar conformation and leads to two non-superimposable mirror image forms (enantiomers). A well-known example that provided early evidence for this type of isomerism is 6,6'-dinitrodiphenic acid. Thus, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule has a central carbon atom (at position 2) that is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center, or stereocenter. Due to this chiral center, the molecule is chiral and exists as a pair of enantiomers (R and S forms), meaning it shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone:** The central carbon atom in benzophenone is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. For a molecule to be chiral based on a stereocenter, a carbon must be bonded to four different groups. Benzophenone does not have a chiral carbon. It possesses a plane of symmetry that runs through the carbonyl group, making the molecule achiral and therefore not optically active.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid. It is a planar molecule and possesses a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry. Molecules with a plane or center of symmetry are achiral and do not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on this analysis, compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will show optical isomerism, while compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
