    "To determine how long the journey will take from the astronaut's perspective, we need to use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. Here is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n### 1. Determine the Distance\nThe spacecraft is traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to Earth. The distance to the LMC is approximately 163,000 light-years.\n\n### 2. Calculate Travel Time from Earth's Perspective\nFirst, we calculate how long the journey would appear to take for an observer on Earth.\n*   **Distance (d):** 163,000 light-years\n*   **Velocity (v):** 0.99999987 * c (where 'c' is the speed of light)\n\nThe time taken (t_earth) is distance divided by velocity:\n`t_earth = 163,000 light-years / (0.99999987 * c) ≈ 163,000.21 years`\n\nFrom Earth, the journey would take slightly over 163,000 years.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)\nTime dilation is determined by the Lorentz factor, which depends on the spacecraft's velocity. The formula for the Lorentz factor is:\n\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nSubstituting the given velocity:\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.99999987c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.99999987²) ≈ 1961.16`\n\n### 4. Calculate Time from the Astronaut's Perspective\nThe time experienced by the astronaut (t_astronaut), also known as the proper time, is the time measured on Earth divided by the Lorentz factor.\n\n`t_astronaut = t_earth / γ`\n`t_astronaut ≈ 163,000.21 / 1961.16 ≈ 83.11 years`\n\nThe journey would take approximately 83.11 years from the astronaut's point of view.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nThe astronaut is 22 years old and has a lifespan of 150 years, meaning they can live for another `150 - 22 = 128` years. Since the journey takes about 83 years from their perspective, the astronaut will survive.\n\nComparing the calculated time of approximately 83.11 years with the given options, the closest answer is 81 years. The minor difference can be attributed to using a more precise distance to the LMC (around 160,000 to 163,000 light-years). If we use a distance of 160,000 light-years, the astronaut's time becomes approximately 81.58 years, which rounds to 81 or 82 years.\n\n<<<C>>>"
