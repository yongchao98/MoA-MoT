    "To find the numerical value of \"a,\" we must use the normalization condition from quantum mechanics. This principle states that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere within its allowed region of existence must be equal to 1. The information about the 10,000 identical systems reinforces that we are in a quantum mechanical scenario, but the calculation itself revolves around the wave function of a single particle.\n\nFirst, we determine the probability density function, which is the square of the magnitude of the wave function, denoted as |ψ(x)|².\n\nThe given wave function is a complex number:\nψ(x) = ( a / √(1 + x) ) - 0.5i\n\nThe real part is Re(x) = a / √(1 + x) and the imaginary part is Im(x) = -0.5.\n\nThe probability density |ψ(x)|² is calculated as [Re(x)]² + [Im(x)]²:\n|ψ(x)|² = (a / √(1 + x))² + (-0.5)²\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\nThe problem states that the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, to normalize the wave function, we must integrate the probability density from 1 to 3 and set the result equal to 1.\n\nThe normalization integral is:\n∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nNow, we solve the integral:\n∫ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = a² ∫ (1 / (1 + x)) dx + ∫ 0.25 dx\n= a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25x\n\nNext, we evaluate this result from the lower limit (x=1) to the upper limit (x=3):\n[a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3] - [a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1]\n= [a² * ln(4) + 0.75] - [a² * ln(2) + 0.25]\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n= a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + (0.75 - 0.25)\nUsing the logarithm property ln(b) - ln(c) = ln(b/c):\n= a² * ln(4/2) + 0.5\n= a² * ln(2) + 0.5\n\nFinally, we set this expression equal to 1, according to the normalization condition:\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\nNow, we solve for 'a':\na² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the approximate value for the natural logarithm of 2 (ln(2) ≈ 0.693):\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693\na² ≈ 0.7215\na ≈ √0.7215\na ≈ 0.849\n\nThis value is closest to the provided option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
