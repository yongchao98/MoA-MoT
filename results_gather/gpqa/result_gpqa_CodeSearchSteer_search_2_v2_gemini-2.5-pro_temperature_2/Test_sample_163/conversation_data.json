    "The initial analysis seems correct. The relationship derived, M ∝ P * (K_total)^3, is consistent with the principles of binary star dynamics found in the search results.\n\nSpecifically, the search results confirm the following steps:\n1.  For spectroscopic binaries, the radial velocities (v_r) can be measured from the Doppler shift of spectral lines. The amplitudes of these sinusoidal variations are K1 and K2.\n2.  Assuming circular orbits viewed edge-on (a good approximation for eclipsing binaries, which helps set sin(i)≈1), the orbital speeds are the observed radial velocity amplitudes.\n3.  The radius of each star's orbit around the common center of mass (a1, a2) can be found using the velocity and period: circumference = velocity * period, so `2 * pi * a = K * P`. This leads to `a = K*P / (2*pi)`.\n4.  The total separation `a` is the sum of the individual orbital radii, `a = a1 + a2`. Therefore, `a = (K1 + K2) * P / (2 * pi)`.\n5.  Kepler's Third Law relates the total mass (M1 + M2) to the separation (a) and the period (P): (M1 + M2) = a^3 / P^2 (in appropriate units).\n6.  Substituting the expression for `a` into Kepler's law:\n    `M_total = [( (K1 + K2) * P / (2 * pi) )^3] / P^2`\n    `M_total = (K1 + K2)^3 * P^3 / ( (2 * pi)^3 * P^2 )`\n    `M_total = P * (K1 + K2)^3 / (8 * pi^3)`\n    The above simplification needs a check. In SI units, Newton's version of Kepler's Third Law is `G * (M1+M2) * P^2 = 4 * pi^2 * a^3`.\n    So, `M1+M2 = (4 * pi^2 * a^3) / (G * P^2)`.\n    Substitute `a = P * (K1 + K2) / (2 * pi * sin(i))`:\n    `M1+M2 = (4 * pi^2) / (G * P^2) * [ ( P^3 * (K1 + K2)^3 ) / (8 * pi^3 * sin^3(i)) ]`\n    `M1+M2 = (P * (K1 + K2)^3) / (2 * pi * G * sin^3(i))`\n    My original formula was correct. `M_total = P * (K1+K2)^3 / C` where C is a constant `(2*pi*G)` assuming sin(i)=1 for eclipsing binaries.\n\nThe proportionality `M ∝ P * (K_total)^3` holds true. Now I can confidently perform the calculation.\n\n**Data:**\n*   **System 1:**\n    *   P1 = 2 years\n    *   K1 = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n*   **System 2:**\n    *   P2 = 1 year\n    *   K2 = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n`Ratio = M_sys1 / M_sys2`\n`Ratio = ( P1 * (K1_total)^3 ) / ( P2 * (K2_total)^3 )`\n`Ratio = ( 2 * (15)^3 ) / ( 1 * (25)^3 )`\n`Ratio = ( 2 * 3375 ) / ( 1 * 15625 )`\n`Ratio = 6750 / 15625`\n\nDivide both by 25:\n`6750 / 25 = 270`\n`15625 / 25 = 625`\n\nRatio = `270 / 625`\n\nDivide both by 5:\n`270 / 5 = 54`\n`625 / 5 = 125`\n\nRatio = `54 / 125`\nRatio = `0.432`\n\nThis calculated value is approximately 0.4.\n\nLet's check the given options:\nA) ~ 1.2\nB) ~ 0.7\nC) ~ 0.6\nD) ~ 0.4\n\nMy result of 0.432 strongly matches option D. The logic and formula are sound and confirmed by astrophysical principles for binary systems. No further searching is required. The answer is ready.\nFinal answer is D. I will format the answer as requested.To determine which star system is more massive, we need to calculate the total mass of each binary system. The total mass (M) of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system can be found using the orbital period (P) and the radial velocity amplitudes (K1 and K2) of the two stars.\n\n### Theoretical Basis\nFor a binary system with stars of mass M1 and M2, Kepler's Third Law can be combined with the definitions of radial velocities. Assuming circular orbits and that the systems are eclipsing (meaning the inclination angle *i* is approximately 90°, so sin(*i*) ≈ 1), the total mass of the system (M_total = M1 + M2) is given by the formula:\n\nM_total = [P * (K1 + K2)³] / (2πG)\n\nWhere:\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   K1 and K2 are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n\nTo find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we can calculate the ratio of their masses (M_sys1 / M_sys2). The constant term (2πG) will cancel out in the ratio.\n\n### System 1 Data:\n*   Period (P1) = 2 years\n*   Radial velocity amplitude of star 1 (K1a) = 10 km/s\n*   Radial velocity amplitude of star 2 (K1b) = 5 km/s\n*   Total radial velocity amplitude (K_total1) = K1a + K1b = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n\n### System 2 Data:\n*   Period (P2) = 1 year\n*   Radial velocity amplitude of star 1 (K2a) = 15 km/s\n*   Radial velocity amplitude of star 2 (K2b) = 10 km/s\n*   Total radial velocity amplitude (K_total2) = K2a + K2b = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\n### Calculation\nThe mass of a system is proportional to P * (K_total)³. We can set up the ratio as follows:\n\nRatio = M_sys1 / M_sys2 = [P1 * (K_total1)³] / [P2 * (K_total2)³]\n\nNow, we substitute the values for each system:\n\nRatio = [2 years * (15 km/s)³] / [1 year * (25 km/s)³]\n\nRatio = [2 * 3375] / [1 * 15625]\n\nRatio = 6750 / 15625\n\nTo simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor or simplify in steps. Let's divide both by 125:\n6750 / 125 = 54\n15625 / 125 = 125\n\nRatio = 54 / 125\n\nRatio = 0.432\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.432, which means the mass of system_1 is about 0.432 times the mass of system_2. This value is closest to the provided option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
