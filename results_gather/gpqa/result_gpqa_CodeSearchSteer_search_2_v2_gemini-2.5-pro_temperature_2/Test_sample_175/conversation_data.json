    "This is a quantum mechanics problem involving sequential measurements. Here is the step-by-step calculation of the required probability.\n\n**1. Normalization of the initial state**\n\nThe initial state of the system is given by the column matrix |ψ⟩ = (-1, 2, 1). First, we need to normalize this state vector. The squared norm of the state is:\n||ψ||² = ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.\n\nThe normalized state |ψ_norm⟩ is therefore:\n|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * (-1, 2, 1)\n\n**2. Measurement of observable P**\n\nThe measurement of observable P yields the value 0. The probability of this outcome is determined by the projection of the system's state onto the eigenvector of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P:**\n    The matrix for P is:\n    P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]\n    The eigenvalues λ are found by solving the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.\n    det([[ -λ, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, -λ]]) = -λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ = λ(1 - λ²) = 0.\n    The eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, and λ = -1.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector for the eigenvalue λ = 0:**\n    We need to find the vector |v⟩ such that P|v⟩ = 0|v⟩ = 0.\n    [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [[x], [y], [z]] = [,,]\n    From the first and third rows, we get (1/√2)y = 0, which implies y = 0.\n    From the second row, we get (1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0, which implies x = -z.\n    The eigenvector is of the form (k, 0, -k). We choose k=1 for simplicity, so the unnormalized eigenvector is (1, 0, -1).\n    The normalized eigenvector for λ=0, let's call it |p_0⟩, is:\n    |p_0⟩ = (1/√(1² + 0² + (-1)²)) * (1, 0, -1) = (1/√2) * (1, 0, -1).\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring P=0:**\n    The probability is the squared magnitude of the inner product of the eigenvector |p_0⟩ and the normalized initial state |ψ_norm⟩.\n    Prob(P=0) = |⟨p_0|ψ_norm⟩|²\n    ⟨p_0|ψ_norm⟩ = [(1/√2) * (1, 0, -1)] · [(1/√6) * (-1, 2, 1)]\n    = (1/√12) * [1*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1)*(1)]\n    = (1/√12) * (-2) = -2 / (2√3) = -1/√3.\n    Prob(P=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3.\n\n**3. State collapse after the first measurement**\n\nAfter measuring P=0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding normalized eigenvector, |p_0⟩.\nThe new state of the system is |ψ'⟩ = |p_0⟩ = (1/√2) * (1, 0, -1).\n\n**4. Measurement of observable Q**\n\nNow, a measurement of Q is performed on the new state |ψ'⟩. We want to find the probability of getting the result Q = -1.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector of Q for the eigenvalue λ = -1:**\n    The matrix for Q is diagonal:\n    Q = [,, [0, 0, -1]]\n    The eigenvalues are the diagonal elements: 1, 0, and -1.\n    The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue -1 is the standard basis vector |q_{-1}⟩ = (0, 0, 1). It is already normalized.\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring Q=-1:**\n    This probability is the squared magnitude of the inner product of the eigenvector |q_{-1}⟩ and the current state |ψ'⟩.\n    Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = |⟨q_{-1}|ψ'⟩|²\n    ⟨q_{-1}|ψ'⟩ = (0, 0, 1) · [(1/√2) * (1, 0, -1)]\n    = (1/√2) * [0*(1) + 0*(0) + 1*(-1)] = -1/√2.\n    Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2.\n\n**5. Total Probability**\n\nThe joint probability of measuring P=0 and then Q=-1 is the product of the probabilities calculated in the previous steps.\nP(P=0 and then Q=-1) = P(P=0) * P(Q=-1 | P=0)\n= (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.\n\n<<<C>>>"
