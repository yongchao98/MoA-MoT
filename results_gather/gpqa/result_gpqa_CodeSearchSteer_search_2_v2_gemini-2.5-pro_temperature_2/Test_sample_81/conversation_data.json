    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the major isomer of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of Cyclooctatetraene with Maleic Anhydride**\n\nCyclooctatetraene (COT) first undergoes a thermal valence isomerization to form bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene. This isomer then acts as a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction with maleic anhydride, a dienophile. The reaction between bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene and maleic anhydride yields an adduct named tricyclo[4.2.2.0<sup>2,5</sup>]deca-3,9-diene-7,8-dicarboxylic anhydride. For stereochemical reasons, the major product of this reaction is the *exo* adduct, where the anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the molecule from the cyclobutene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1, the anhydride, is heated with methanol and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid. This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The anhydride ring opens to form two methyl ester groups. This reaction does not alter the stereochemistry of the tricyclic backbone, so product 2 is the dimethyl ester corresponding to the *exo* adduct from step 1, specifically dimethyl tricyclo[4.2.2.0<sup>2,5</sup>]deca-3,9-diene-7,8-dicarboxylate. The two ester groups are *cis* to each other.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Final Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 then reacts with cyclopentadiene in a second Diels-Alder reaction. In this step, product 2 acts as the dienophile, with its most reactive double bond being the one in the bicyclo[2.2.2]octene moiety (the former norbornene-like system), not the one in the cyclobutene ring which is less reactive in this context. Cyclopentadiene acts as the diene.\n\nThe stereochemical outcome of this final reaction is governed by two factors:\n1.  **Facial Selectivity**: Cyclopentadiene will approach the double bond of product 2 from the less sterically hindered face. The diester groups are bulky and block one face. Therefore, the cyclopentadiene adds to the opposite face, the one *anti* to the ester groups (the same side as the cyclobutene ring).\n2.  **Endo/Exo Selectivity**: Diels-Alder reactions, particularly with cyclic dienes like cyclopentadiene, kinetically favor the *endo* adduct due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state. This means the main framework of the diene (the cyclopentene ring being formed) tucks under the dienophile. In this specific reaction, this results in the newly formed methano bridge of the cyclopentadiene adduct pointing away from the ester groups.\n\nBy following this sequence of stereoselective reactions (*exo* addition in step 1, followed by *anti-endo* addition in step 3), a single major diastereomer is produced. When the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules are applied to this specific structure, it corresponds to the IUPAC name: dimethyl (1R,4S,4aS,4bR,5S,8R,8aS,8bR,10S,11R)-1,4,4a,4b,5,8,8a,8b-octahydro-1,4-ethano-5,8-methanobiphenylene-10,11-dicarboxylate.\n\nComparing this with the given options, option D matches this predicted structure.\n\n<<<D>>>"
