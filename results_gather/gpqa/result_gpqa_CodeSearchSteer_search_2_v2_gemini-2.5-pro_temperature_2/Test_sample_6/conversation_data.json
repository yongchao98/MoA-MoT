    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the threshold energy for a high-energy gamma-ray to annihilate with a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon and create an electron-positron pair.\n\n### 1. The Physical Process\n\nThe reaction in question is pair production:\n$$\n\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{-} + e^{+}\n$$\nFor this reaction to happen, the total energy of the two photons in the center-of-mass frame must be at least the rest mass energy of the electron ($e^{-}$) and positron ($e^{+}$) pair.\n\n### 2. Threshold Energy Condition\n\nThe threshold energy is the minimum energy required for the reaction to occur. This occurs when the created electron and positron are at rest in the center-of-mass frame. Using the principles of special relativity, the square of the total four-momentum is an invariant quantity in all inertial frames.\n\nAt the threshold, this invariant is equal to the square of the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair.\nLet:\n*   $E_{\\gamma}$ be the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray.\n*   $E_{CMB}$ be the energy of the CMB photon.\n*   $m_e c^2$ be the rest mass energy of an electron. The positron has the same rest mass.\n\nThe threshold condition is given by the formula:\n$$\nE_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}\n$$\nThis formula applies to the case of a head-on collision between the two photons, which provides the lowest possible energy threshold for the incoming high-energy gamma-ray.\n\n### 3. Physical Constants\n\n*   **Rest Mass Energy of an Electron ($m_e c^2$)**: The value is approximately 0.511 MeV. This is equivalent to $0.511 \\times 10^6$ eV.\n*   **Average Energy of a CMB Photon ($E_{CMB}$)**: This is given in the problem as $10^{-3}$ eV. This is a typical value for the average energy of a CMB photon, which has a black-body spectrum with a temperature of about 2.725 K.\n\n### 4. Calculation\n\nNow, we substitute the values into the threshold energy equation:\n\n$E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\nFirst, square the numerator:\n$(0.511 \\times 10^6)^2 = 0.511^2 \\times (10^6)^2 \\approx 0.2611 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2$\n\nNow, perform the division:\n$E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{0.2611 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = 0.2611 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n\nTo make the number easier to read, we can write it as:\n$E_{\\gamma} = 2.611 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\n### 5. Conversion to GeV\n\nThe options are given in giga-electronvolts (GeV). We need to convert our result from eV to GeV.\n*   $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$\n\n$E_{\\gamma} (\\text{in GeV}) = \\frac{2.611 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.611 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n### 6. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated threshold energy is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV. This means that gamma-rays with energies above this value will have their lifetimes significantly limited because they will readily interact with the CMB photons permeating the universe, producing electron-positron pairs.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 1.8 * 1e5 GeV\nB) 2.6 * 1e5 GeV\nC) 9.5 * 1e4 GeV\nD) 3.9 * 1e5 GeV\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
