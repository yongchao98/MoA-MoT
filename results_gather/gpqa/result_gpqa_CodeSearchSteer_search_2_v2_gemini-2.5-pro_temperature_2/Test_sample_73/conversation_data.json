    "The correct option is C) 44%.\n\nThe phenomenon of radioactive decay is memoryless, meaning the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived. The calculation for the decay probability relies on the exponential decay law.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Determine the Decay Constant (λ):**\n    The probability *P* that an atom decays within a time *t* is given by the formula:\n    *P(t) = 1 - e<sup>-λt</sup>*, where λ is the decay constant.\n\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can use this to find λ:\n    *   0.32 = 1 - e<sup>-λ * 100</sup>\n    *   e<sup>-100λ</sup> = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\n2.  **Account for the Memoryless Property:**\n    Radioactive decay is a random process where the past does not influence the future. The fact that the atom has not decayed for 50 minutes does not change its intrinsic probability of decaying in any future time interval. Therefore, we can calculate the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes as if we were starting from time zero.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability of Decay in the Next 150 Minutes:**\n    We need to find the probability of the atom decaying in a 150-minute interval. Using the same formula with t = 150:\n    *   P(150) = 1 - e<sup>-λ * 150</sup>\n\n    To solve this without explicitly calculating λ, we can use the value of e<sup>-100λ</sup> we found in the first step:\n    *   e<sup>-150λ</sup> = (e<sup>-100λ</sup>)<sup>1.5</sup> = (0.68)<sup>1.5</sup>\n    *   (0.68)<sup>1.5</sup> ≈ 0.5607\n\n    Now, substitute this back into the probability formula:\n    *   P(150) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393\n\n4.  **Final Result:**\n    The probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is approximately 0.4393, which is 43.93%. This rounds to 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
