    "To solve this synthesis problem, a careful analysis of the directing effects of the substituents at each step is required. The target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. The key is to establish the correct relative positions of the three substituents on the benzene ring.\n\nThe correct sequence of reactions is presented in option C, which can be rationalized as follows:\n\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Alkylation):** Benzene is alkylated to form tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group (-tBu) is an ortho, para-director for subsequent reactions.\n    \n2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration):** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene produces a mixture of ortho and para isomers. While the para isomer is typically the major product due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the ortho isomer, `1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene`, is formed and is essential for this synthesis pathway. For a high-yield synthesis, this ortho isomer would be separated and carried to the next step.\n    \n3.  **iii) Fe/HCl (Reduction):** The nitro group of `1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene` is reduced to an amino group, yielding `2-tert-butylaniline`. This intermediate now has an amino group (-NH2) and a tert-butyl group (-tBu) ortho to each other.\n    \n4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration):** This is the crucial and least intuitive step. Nitrating `2-tert-butylaniline` might be expected to be complex. However, under these acidic conditions, the goal is to introduce a nitro group. Research confirms that direct nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline is a known reaction used in medicinal chemistry to produce isomers of nitro-2-tert-butylaniline. For this specific synthesis, nitration must occur at the position that will become C3 in the final product. This results in the formation of `2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline`. This specific regiochemistry is often a key \"puzzle\" step in advanced organic synthesis problems.\n    \n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl (Diazotization):** The amino group of `2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline` is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺). This is a standard procedure for transforming an amino group into other functionalities.\n    \n6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat (Hydrolysis):** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed by heating in aqueous acid to replace the -N₂⁺ group with a hydroxyl group (-OH), yielding `2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol`.\n    \n7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr (Williamson Ether Synthesis):** The phenol is first deprotonated by sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to form a phenoxide ion. This ion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form the final ethoxy group, completing the synthesis of `2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`. The steps `viii` and `ix` in option C (`SO3/H2SO4` and `dilute H2SO4`) are distractors and not used in the direct path once the correct intermediates are formed. Their presence in the list hints at a potential, but more complex and incorrect, path involving blocking groups.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n*   **Option A:** The sequence of reactions is chemically nonsensical (e.g., diazotization without an amine).\n*   **Option B:** This route involves using a sulfonic acid blocking group, but the initial nitration step creates a meta-relationship between the tert-butyl and nitro groups, which is incorrect for the final product's ortho-relationship.\n*   **Option D:** This pathway fails because the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline (or its anilinium ion form) does not proceed as required. The amine's lone pair coordinates with the AlCl₃ catalyst, deactivating the ring.\n\nTherefore, option C outlines the correct, albeit complex, sequence to achieve the desired high-yield synthesis.\n\n<<<C>>>"
