    "Here is the step-by-step calculation of the enthalpy of neutralization.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Reactions\n\nWhen the three solutions are mixed, two main exothermic (heat-releasing) reactions occur:\n*   **Neutralization:** Hydrogen ions (H⁺) from the acids (HCl and H₂SO₄) react with hydroxide ions (OH⁻) from the base (Ba(OH)₂) to form water. The standard enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and a strong base is approximately -57.1 kJ/mol.\n    `H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq) → H₂O(l)      ΔH_neut = -57.1 kJ/mol`\n*   **Precipitation:** Barium ions (Ba²⁺) from the base react with sulfate ions (SO₄²⁻) from the sulfuric acid to form a solid precipitate, barium sulfate (BaSO₄). This reaction is also exothermic. The enthalpy of precipitation for BaSO₄ is approximately -26.3 kJ/mol to -42 kJ/mol. For this calculation, we will use a common approximate value.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Moles of Reactants\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of the reactive ions (H⁺, OH⁻, Ba²⁺, and SO₄²⁻).\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (a strong monoprotic acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M (mol/L)\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.500 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.10 mol\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = 0.10 mol\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ (a strong diprotic acid):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M (mol/L)\n    *   Moles of H₂SO₄ = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = 2 × 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol\n    *   Moles of SO₄²⁻ = 0.09 mol\n\n*   **Total Moles of H⁺:**\n    *   Total H⁺ = (moles from HCl) + (moles from H₂SO₄)\n    *   Total H⁺ = 0.10 mol + 0.18 mol = 0.28 mol\n\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (a strong base):**\n    *   Volume = 200 mL = 0.200 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.5 M (mol/L)\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.200 L × 0.5 mol/L = 0.10 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol\n    *   Moles of Ba²⁺ = 0.10 mol\n\n### 3. Calculating the Heat from Neutralization\n\nThe neutralization reaction is limited by the reactant with the fewer moles (the limiting reactant).\n*   Moles of H⁺ = 0.28 mol\n*   Moles of OH⁻ = 0.20 mol\nThe limiting reactant is OH⁻. Therefore, 0.20 moles of water will be formed.\n\n*   **Enthalpy from Neutralization (ΔH₁):**\n    *   ΔH₁ = (moles of H₂O formed) × (enthalpy of neutralization)\n    *   ΔH₁ = 0.20 mol × (-57.1 kJ/mol) = -11.42 kJ\n\n### 4. Calculating the Heat from Precipitation\n\nThe precipitation reaction `Ba²⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq) → BaSO₄(s)` is also limited by the reactant with fewer moles.\n*   Moles of Ba²⁺ = 0.10 mol\n*   Moles of SO₄²⁻ = 0.09 mol\nThe limiting reactant is SO₄²⁻. Therefore, 0.09 moles of BaSO₄ will precipitate. A standard value for the enthalpy of precipitation of BaSO₄ is -42 kJ/mol.\n\n*   **Enthalpy from Precipitation (ΔH₂):**\n    *   ΔH₂ = (moles of BaSO₄ formed) × (enthalpy of precipitation)\n    *   ΔH₂ = 0.09 mol × (-42 kJ/mol) = -3.78 kJ\n\n### 5. Calculating the Total Enthalpy Change\n\nThe total enthalpy of neutralization for the mixture is the sum of the heat released from both reactions.\n\n*   **Total Enthalpy (ΔH_total):**\n    *   ΔH_total = ΔH₁ + ΔH₂\n    *   ΔH_total = -11.42 kJ + (-3.78 kJ) = -15.2 kJ\n\n*Note: Minor variations in the standard enthalpy values used for neutralization and precipitation can lead to slightly different results. For example, another source lists the enthalpy of precipitation for BaSO₄ as -26.29 kJ/mol, which would result in a different total enthalpy.*\n\n### 6. Comparing with Options\n\nThe calculated value is -15.2 kJ. Let's convert the given options to kJ to find the closest match.\n*   A) -16.0 kJ\n*   B) -11.42 kcal × 4.184 kJ/kcal ≈ -47.78 kJ\n*   C) -2.72 kcal × 4.184 kJ/kcal ≈ -11.38 kJ\n*   D) -3.80 kcal × 4.184 kJ/kcal ≈ -15.90 kJ\n\nComparing our calculated value of -15.2 kJ, we see that option A (-16.0 kJ) and the converted value from option D (-15.90 kJ) are very close. A slight difference in the assumed enthalpy of precipitation for BaSO₄ could account for this.\n\nLet's re-calculate using kcal from the start:\n*   `ΔH_neut = -13.7 kcal/mol`\n*   `ΔH₁ = 0.20 mol * (-13.7 kcal/mol) = -2.74 kcal`\n*   Enthalpy of precipitation of BaSO₄ = -42 kJ/mol / 4.184 kJ/kcal ≈ -10.04 kcal/mol\n*   `ΔH₂ = 0.09 mol * (-10.04 kcal/mol) = -0.90 kcal`\n*   `ΔH_total = -2.74 kcal + (-0.90 kcal) = -3.64 kcal`\n\nThis calculated value of -3.64 kcal is very close to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
