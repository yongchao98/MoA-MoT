    "My initial calculations were correct. The google search confirms the physics principles and formulas used.\n\n-   **Conservation of Energy**: For a pion at rest, its rest energy is converted into the total energy (rest mass energy + kinetic energy) of the decay products. `E_pi = E_mu + E_nu`.\n-   **Conservation of Momentum**: Since the pion is at rest (initial momentum is zero), the decay products (muon and neutrino) must have equal and opposite momenta. `p_mu = p_nu`.\n-   **Relativistic Formulas**: The relationship `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2` is correct for the muon, and for the massless neutrino, `E_nu = p_nu * c`. The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy (`K = E - mc^2`).\n-   **Masses**: The provided rest masses are confirmed by various sources: Pi(+) is approximately 139.6 MeV/c^2 and mu(+) is about 105.7 MeV/c^2.\n-   **Calculated Values**: A source mentions a measurement of the muon's kinetic energy at 4.13 MeV, which is very close to my calculated value of 4.12 MeV. Another paper directly reports the kinetic energy of the muon as `Tμ+ = (4. 119 84 ± 0. 000 03) MeV` and the muon momentum as `pμ+ = (29. 792 00 ± 0. 000 11) MeV/c`. This momentum value directly corresponds to the neutrino's kinetic energy, `K_nu`, which is approximately 29.8 MeV. These experimental values strongly support my calculated results.\n\nThe calculation steps were as follows:\n1.  **Energy Conservation Equation:**\n    `m_pi * c^2 = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2) + p*c`\n2.  **Solve for Momentum (p*c):**\n    `p*c = ((m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2) / (2 * m_pi*c^2)`\n    `p*c = (139.6^2 - 105.7^2) / (2 * 139.6) = (19488.16 - 11172.49) / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV`\n3.  **Kinetic Energy of Neutrino (K_nu):**\n    For a massless neutrino, `K_nu = p*c`.\n    `K_nu ≈ 29.78 MeV`, which rounds to 29.8 MeV.\n4.  **Kinetic Energy of Muon (K_mu):**\n    Can be found from the total energy released: `Q = m_pi*c^2 - m_mu*c^2 = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV`.\n    `Q = K_mu + K_nu`\n    `K_mu = Q - K_nu = 33.9 - 29.78 ≈ 4.12 MeV`.\n\nThe results (K_mu ≈ 4.12 MeV and K_nu ≈ 29.8 MeV) match option C.\n\nFinal check of all steps and information confirms the answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
