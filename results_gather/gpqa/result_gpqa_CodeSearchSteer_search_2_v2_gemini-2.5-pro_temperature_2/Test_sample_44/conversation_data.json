    "Here is the step-by-step calculation for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n**1. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nFor a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the quantized energy levels are given by:\n*   *E*ₙ = n² * (*π*²ħ² / 2m*L*²)\n\nThe problem defines the base energy unit as *E* = *π*²ħ² / 2m*L*². Therefore, the energy for each level *n* can be expressed as:\n*   *E*ₙ = n²*E*, where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\n**2. Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2 particles, which means they are fermions. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. In this system, a quantum state is defined by the energy level *n* and the spin projection (*m*ₛ = +1/2 or -1/2). This means that each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**3. Ground State Energy**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles:\n*   **Level n=1:** Can hold two particles (one spin-up, one spin-down). The energy of these two particles is 2 × *E*₁ = 2 × (1²*E*) = 2*E*.\n*   **Level n=2:** The remaining two particles will occupy this level (one spin-up, one spin-down). The energy of these two particles is 2 × *E*₂ = 2 × (2²*E*) = 2 × 4*E* = 8*E*.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n*   *E*<sub>ground</sub> = 2*E* + 8*E* = 10*E*.\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy**\n\nTo obtain the first excited state, we move one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3):\n*   **Level n=1:** Still contains two particles. Energy = 2 × *E*₁ = 2*E*.\n*   **Level n=2:** Now contains one particle. Energy = 1 × *E*₂ = 1 × (2²*E*) = 4*E*.\n*   **Level n=3:** Now contains one particle. Energy = 1 × *E*₃ = 1 × (3²*E*) = 9*E*.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n*   *E*<sub>1st excited</sub> = 2*E* + 4*E* + 9*E* = 15*E*.\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest total energy above the first excited state. We need to consider the possible single-particle excitations from the ground state:\n\n*   **Excitation A:** Move one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, one particle in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × *E*₁) + (2 × *E*₂) + (1 × *E*₃) = (1²*E*) + (2 × 2²*E*) + (1 × 3²*E*) = *E* + 8*E* + 9*E* = 18*E*.\n\n*   **Excitation B:** Move one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, one particle in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 × *E*₁) + (1 × *E*₂) + (1 × *E*₄) = (2 × 1²*E*) + (1 × 2²*E*) + (1 × 4²*E*) = 2*E* + 4*E* + 16*E* = 22*E*.\n\nComparing these possibilities, the lower energy configuration is 18*E*. Therefore, the second excited state energy is:\n*   *E*<sub>2nd excited</sub> = 18*E*.\n\nThe energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10*E*, 15*E*, and 18*E*, respectively.\n\n<<<C>>>"
