    "To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes, we must use the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of atoms among various energy levels in a system in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE).\n\n### 1. The Boltzmann Equation\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two energy levels (level 2 and level 1) is given by:\n***N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T)]***\nwhere:\n-   **N₂** and **N₁** are the populations of level 2 and level 1, respectively.\n-   **g₂** and **g₁** are the statistical weights of the levels (which are constants for a given transition).\n-   **E₂ - E₁** (**ΔE**) is the energy difference between the two levels.\n-   **k** is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n-   **T** is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nLet's define the ratio as *R*. The problem provides two temperatures:\n-   Temperature without spots (T_nospots): 6000 K\n-   Temperature with spots (T_spots): 5500 K\n\nWe are asked to find the factor of change in the ratio when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots, which can be expressed as:\n***Factor = R_nospots / R_spots***\n\nUsing the Boltzmann equation, we get:\n***Factor = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT_nospots) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT_spots) ]***\n\nThe statistical weights (g₂/g₁) cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n***Factor = exp[- (ΔE/k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) ]***\n\n### 2. Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE)\n\nThe energy difference between the levels corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given wavelength (λ = 1448 Å). The formula relating energy and wavelength is:\n***ΔE = h * c / λ***\nwhere:\n-   **h** is Planck's constant (approximately 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n-   **c** is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10⁸ m/s).\n-   **λ** is the wavelength, 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m.\n\nFirst, calculate ΔE:\n***ΔE = (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s * 3 x 10⁸ m/s) / (1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m) ≈ 1.373 x 10⁻¹⁸ J***\n\n### 3. Calculate the Factor\n\nNow, we can substitute the values into the factor equation. It is easier to first calculate the value of the term (ΔE/k):\n***ΔE / k = (1.373 x 10⁻¹⁸ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 99490 K***\n\nNext, calculate the difference in the reciprocal temperatures:\n***1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots = 1/6000 - 1/5500 = (11 - 12) / 66000 = -1 / 66000 K⁻¹***\n\nFinally, compute the factor:\n***Factor = exp[- (99490 K) * (-1 / 66000 K⁻¹) ]***\n***Factor = exp(99490 / 66000)***\n***Factor = exp(1.507) ≈ 4.51***\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.5, which aligns with option B. This result is consistent with the observation that the ratio of atoms in the two energy levels decreases when spots are present, as the lower temperature with spots leads to a lower population in the higher energy level.\n\n<<<B>>>"
