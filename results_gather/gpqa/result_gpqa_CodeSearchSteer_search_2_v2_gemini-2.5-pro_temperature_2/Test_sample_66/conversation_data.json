    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the quantum mechanics problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the System and State**: The system consists of two electrons, each in a p orbital. This means the orbital angular momentum quantum number for each electron is `l₁ = 1` and `l₂ = 1`. The system is in a coupled angular momentum state represented by `|l, m> = |2, -1>`.\n\n2.  **Define the Measurement**: A joint measurement of the z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron, `L₁z` and `L₂z`, is performed.\n\n3.  **Relate Measurement to Quantum Numbers**: The eigenvalue of `L₁z` is `m₁ħ`, and the eigenvalue of `L₂z` is `m₂ħ`. The problem asks for the probability of obtaining the eigenvalue `-ħ` for both measurements simultaneously. This corresponds to the outcome where `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Angular Momentum**: A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This is expressed as `m = m₁ + m₂`.\n\n5.  **Check for Consistency**:\n    *   The total angular momentum state is `|l=2, m=-1>`, so the system's total magnetic quantum number is `m = -1`. Any measurement on the system must be consistent with this value.\n    *   The desired measurement outcome is `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n    *   For this specific outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers would be `m₁ + m₂ = -1 + (-1) = -2`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**: Since the required sum `m₁ + m₂ = -2` is not equal to the system's total magnetic quantum number `m = -1`, this outcome is physically impossible. The state `|m₁=-1, m₂=-1>` does not contribute to the expansion of the `|l=2, m=-1>` state. The probability of measuring an outcome that violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum is zero. This is a direct consequence of the properties of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which would be zero for this combination of quantum numbers.\n\nTherefore, the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both L₁z and L₂z as -ħ is 0.\n\n<<<C>>>"
