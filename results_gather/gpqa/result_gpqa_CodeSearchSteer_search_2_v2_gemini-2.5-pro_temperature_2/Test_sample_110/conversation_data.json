    "The provided search results confirm that the reactions in question are both examples of the Michael addition.\n\nFor the first reaction, a ketone enolate acts as the Michael donor and adds to an α,β-unsaturated ester (the Michael acceptor). The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one at the only available alpha-position (C6), as the C2 position has no alpha-protons. This enolate then attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. The nomenclature for the resulting product, naming the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent on the propanoate chain, is complex but the derivation in the thought process is standard. The point of attachment to the main chain becomes carbon 1 of the substituent ring. Based on the original ketone's structure (2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one), the resulting substituent would be named (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl). This makes the full name for product A **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\nFor the second reaction, this is a nitro-Michael addition. The anion of 1-nitropropane (the nitronate, formed by deprotonation with KOH) acts as the Michael donor and attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile).\n*   **Michael Donor (from 1-nitropropane):** `CH3-CH2-CH(⁻)-NO2`\n*   **Michael Acceptor ((E)-but-2-enenitrile):** `CH3-CH=CH-CN`\nThe nucleophilic carbon from the nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile, forming a new carbon-carbon bond. Protonation of the intermediate with water yields the final product. The structure is `CH3-CH2-CH(NO2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN`. Naming this structure according to IUPAC rules gives **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these findings with the provided options:\n*   A: ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate (Correct)\n*   B: 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Correct)\n\nTherefore, option B correctly identifies both products.\n\n<<<B>>>"
