    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Description:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This implies a benzene ring with two substituents (C₆H₄).\n    *   **8 carbon atoms in total:** The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, so the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Aromatic-halogen bond:** One substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the benzene ring. This substituent has 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Carbonyl group:** The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   **Identify the structure:** The only possible structure for a 2-carbon substituent containing a carbonyl group is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n\n2.  **Determine the Compound's Structure:**\n    *   The compound is a haloacetophenone. Its general structure is X-C₆H₄-COCH₃ (where X is a halogen).\n\n3.  **Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (on the C₆H₄ ring):** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. Their chemical shift is typically between 7.0 and 8.5 ppm. The substitution pattern affects the signal's appearance:\n        *   **Para (1,4) substitution** with two different groups (like a halogen and an acetyl group) creates symmetry. This typically results in a distinct pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons (2H).\n    *   **Acetyl Group Protons (-COCH₃):**\n        *   The methyl group (CH₃) has 3 protons.\n        *   Since the adjacent carbon is a carbonyl carbon with no protons, the methyl signal will not be split. It will appear as a singlet (s).\n        *   The chemical shift for a methyl group next to a carbonyl is typically around 2.0–2.5 ppm.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n\n    *   **A) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic signals:** `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This pattern of two doublets, totaling 4H, in the aromatic region is characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring. This matches the predicted pattern for a compound like 4-bromoacetophenone or 4-chloroacetophenone. For 4-bromoacetophenone, the reported shifts are around δ 7.82 (d, 2H) and 7.61(d, 2H). For 4-chloroacetophenone, shifts are around δ 7.90 (d, 2H) and 7.44 (d, 2H).\n        *   **Aliphatic signal:** `2.3 (3H, s)`. This is a singlet integrating to 3 hydrogens at a chemical shift that is perfect for the methyl protons of an acetyl group.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This data perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **B) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This option lacks signals in the typical aromatic proton region (7.0-8.5 ppm). It is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone. While an aldehyde also contains a carbonyl group, this option doesn't fit the most direct interpretation and has a different set of aliphatic protons.\n\n    *   **D) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   A di-substituted ring should have 4 aromatic protons, not a singlet at 6.9 ppm. This pattern is inconsistent with the described molecule.\n\nBased on the analysis, option A is the only one that correctly represents the ¹H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<A>>>"
