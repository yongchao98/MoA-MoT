    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the options to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is, by definition, a planet with the same density as Earth. The average density of Earth is approximately 5.51 g/cm続.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm続:** This planet's density is explicitly given as about 5.5 g/cm続, which is virtually the same as Earth's density.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** For celestial bodies with the same composition, lower mass results in weaker gravitational self-compression. Therefore, this planet would be less dense than Earth.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** For planets of the same rocky composition, an increase in mass leads to greater gravitational compression of its materials. This results in a higher overall density. A rocky planet five times the mass of Earth will be significantly denser than Earth.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the options, the 5-Earth-mass planet with the same composition as Earth will be the densest due to the intense gravitational compression from its large mass. Its density will be notably higher than the ~5.5 g/cm続 of the planets in options (a) and (b), and also higher than the less massive planet in option (d).\n\n<<<D>>>"
