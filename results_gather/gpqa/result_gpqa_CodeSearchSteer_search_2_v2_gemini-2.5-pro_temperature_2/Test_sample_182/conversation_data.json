    "To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we first need to understand the reaction that takes place.\n\n**1. The Reactant and its Structure:**\nThe starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene:** A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4.\n*   **-carboxylic acid:** A -COOH group is attached to the ring, let's place it at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl:** A -CHO group is attached to carbon 2.\n*   **5-vinyl:** A -CH=CH₂ group is attached to carbon 5.\n\nThe reactant has several features that contribute to its index of hydrogen deficiency: one ring, a carbon-carbon double bond within the ring, another carbon-carbon double bond in the vinyl group, a carbon-oxygen double bond in the formyl group, and another carbon-oxygen double bond in the carboxylic acid group.\n\n**2. The Reaction:**\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce several functional groups to simple alkanes. Specifically:\n*   Aldehyde groups (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Carboxylic acid groups (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) are saturated to single bonds (C-C).\n*   Alcohols are also reduced to alkanes, which is a relevant intermediate step in the reduction of carbonyls and carboxylic acids.\n\n**3. The Product's Structure:**\nApplying these reductions to the starting molecule:\n*   The **carboxylic acid group** at position 1 is reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **formyl group** at position 2 is reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **double bond** in the cyclohexene ring (at C-3) is reduced to a single bond, making the ring a **cyclohexane** ring.\n*   The **vinyl group** (-CH=CH₂) at position 5 is reduced to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane with two methyl groups and one ethyl group attached to the ring. The product molecule is fully saturated except for its cyclic structure. It is a type of cycloalkane.\n\n**4. Calculating the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD):**\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) is a count of the number of rings and multiple bonds in a molecule.\n*   **Number of rings:** The product contains one cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Number of double bonds:** All the double bonds from the reactant have been reduced. The product has zero double bonds.\n*   **Number of triple bonds:** There are no triple bonds.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product is calculated as:\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of double bonds)\nIHD = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula of the reactant and product.\n*   **Reactant (C₁₀H₁₂O₃):** IHD = 10 - (12/2) + 1 = 5. (One ring, two C=C, two C=O)\n*   **Product:** The resulting structure is an isomer of 1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane. Its molecular formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n*   Using the IHD formula for the product (C₁₀H₂₀): IHD = C - H/2 + 1 = 10 - (20/2) + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1, which corresponds to the single ring in the cyclohexane structure.\n\n<<<D>>>"
