    "The reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base like sodium amide (NaNH₂), proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate known as benzyne. This reaction follows an elimination-addition mechanism. The understanding of this mechanism is often clarified using isotopic labeling experiments.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction:\n\n1.  **Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n    The strong amide base (NH₂⁻) removes a proton from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom. The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has two different ortho positions:\n    *   **Position 6:** Contains a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Position 2:** Contains a deuterium atom (D), which is an isotope of hydrogen.\n\n    Because the Carbon-Hydrogen (C-H) bond is weaker than the Carbon-Deuterium (C-D) bond, the base will preferentially remove the proton from C6. However, removal of the deuterium from C2 is also possible. This leads to the formation of two distinct benzyne intermediates:\n    *   **Intermediate A (Major):** Formed by removing H from C6 and Br from C1. This results in a benzyne with the triple bond between C1 and C6, while the deuterium remains at C2. This can be called 3-deuteriobenzyne.\n    *   **Intermediate B (Minor):** Formed by removing D from C2 and Br from C1. In this pathway, the deuterium is eliminated. The resulting benzyne has a triple bond between C1 and C2 and is not deuterated.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates**\n    The nucleophilic amide ion (NH₂⁻) then attacks the highly strained triple bond of the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia).\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuteriobenzyne):** The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n        *   Attack at C1 results in **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   Attack at C6 results in **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n    *   **Product from Intermediate B (non-deuterated benzyne):** This benzyne is symmetrical with respect to the addition.\n        *   Attack at either C1 or C2 leads to the formation of a single, non-deuterated product: **aniline**.\n\nTherefore, the reaction yields three possible organic products: 2-deuterioaniline, 3-deuterioaniline, and aniline.\n\n<<<B>>>"
