    "To determine the correct statement, each claim made by the senior scientist must be evaluated based on established chemical research and industrial practices for ethylene polymerization. The core task is to create a polyethylene with regular branches using only ethylene, which requires a dual-catalyst system: one for polymerization and one for the in-situ creation of α-olefin comonomers (e.g., 1-hexene) through oligomerization.\n\n*   **A) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.**\n    This statement is correct. Catalysts based on late transition metals like palladium (a noble metal) and nickel can polymerize ethylene via a \"chain-walking\" mechanism, which introduces branches using only ethylene as a monomer. However, these metals are significantly more expensive than alternatives like chromium or titanium, making them economically impractical for producing a high-volume commodity plastic like polyethylene.\n\n*   **B) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.**\n    This statement is also correct. The technology to produce linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) from a single ethylene feedstock, where one catalyst component trimerizes ethylene to 1-hexene which is then copolymerized, is an established industrial process. This technology is commercially used by companies including the US-based Chevron Phillips Chemical.\n\n*   **C) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.**\n    This statement is correct. Group VIa (or Group 6) contains chromium (Cr), which is the basis for the most famous and highly selective catalysts for the trimerization of ethylene into 1-hexene. This is the key \"additional reaction step\" required to generate the branches in-situ. Therefore, using a Group VIa metal catalyst is a primary method to achieve the desired polymer structure.\n\n*   **D) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.**\n    This statement is definitively **incorrect**. The \"essential additional reaction step\" is the oligomerization of ethylene to form α-olefins (the branches). The scientific literature consistently shows that the chromium catalysts used for this step require an aluminum-based co-catalyst or activator to function. Compounds such as methylaluminoxane (MAO), modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO), and other alkylaluminum species are explicitly cited as the activators used in these systems.\n\nGiven that statements A, B, and C are all factually correct and D is factually incorrect, there seems to be an issue with the premise that only one statement can be correct. However, if forced to choose the most fundamentally correct and central piece of chemical advice, Statement C describes the specific class of catalyst that is the key enabler for the desired transformation.\n\nSince the provided solution must be one of the four options and three appear to be correct, it is important to re-evaluate the prompt in an exam context, where there might be a \"most correct\" answer or a subtle inaccuracy in the seemingly correct options. However, based on extensive documentation, the falsehood of statement D is the most unambiguous finding. If we assume the question and the senior scientist's other statements are valid, statement C remains a cornerstone chemical fact for this process.\n\nFor the purpose of identifying a single correct statement from the list as presented, and having found multiple technically correct statements (A, B, C) and one definitively incorrect statement (D), there is ambiguity. However, in typical multiple-choice questions of this nature, a statement of fundamental chemical principle that enables the process is often the intended answer.\n\nLet's review the prompt again. It asks to identify the correct statement among the four. Based on the analysis, D is clearly false. A, B, and C appear correct. This is a flawed question as posed. However, if we must choose the best statement describing the chemistry required, C is an excellent choice.\n\nLet's select the option that is most fundamentally and directly related to the chemical transformation at hand, which is the use of a specific catalyst type.\n\n<<<C>>>"
