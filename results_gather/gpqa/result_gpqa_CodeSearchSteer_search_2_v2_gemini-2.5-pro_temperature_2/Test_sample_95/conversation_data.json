    "To determine the order of magnitude of the entropy of the supermassive black hole, a multi-step calculation is required. This involves relating the observed angular size to the black hole's physical size, then its mass, and finally its entropy.\n\n### 1. Fundamental Formulas\n\nThe calculation relies on several key physics formulas:\n*   **Angular Size:** For very small angles, the actual size (diameter, D) of an object is related to its distance (d) and angular size (θ) by `D = d * θ`, where θ must be in radians.\n*   **Schwarzschild Radius:** The radius of a non-rotating black hole's event horizon, known as the Schwarzschild radius (Rs), is given by `Rs = 2GM / c^2`. Here, G is the gravitational constant, M is the black hole's mass, and c is the speed of light. The diameter of the event horizon is `D = 2 * Rs`.\n*   **Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy:** The entropy (S) of a black hole is proportional to the area (A) of its event horizon. The formula is `S = (kB * A) / (4 * lP^2)`, where kB is the Boltzmann constant and lP is the Planck length. This can also be expressed as `S = (kB * c^3 * A) / (4 * ħ * G)`, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n### 2. Known Constants and Given Values\n\n**Given:**\n*   Distance (d) = 10¹⁰ parsecs\n*   Angular size (θ) = 10⁻¹⁷ degrees\n\n**Physical Constants:**\n*   1 parsec ≈ 3.086 x 10¹⁶ meters.\n*   1 degree = π / 180 radians.\n*   Gravitational constant (G) ≈ 6.674 x 10⁻¹¹ m³⋅kg⁻¹⋅s⁻².\n*   Speed of light (c) ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s.\n*   Boltzmann constant (kB) ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n*   Reduced Planck constant (ħ) ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step 1: Convert Units**\nFirst, convert the given distance and angular size into SI units (meters and radians).\n\n*   **Distance in meters:**\n    d = 10¹⁰ pc * (3.086 x 10¹⁶ m/pc) = 3.086 x 10²⁶ m\n\n*   **Angular size in radians:**\n    θ_rad = 10⁻¹⁷ degrees * (π / 180) ≈ 1.745 x 10⁻¹⁹ radians\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Diameter and Radius of the Event Horizon**\nUsing the small-angle formula, calculate the diameter of the event horizon.\n\n*   **Diameter (D):**\n    D = d * θ_rad = (3.086 x 10²⁶ m) * (1.745 x 10⁻¹⁹ rad) ≈ 5.38 x 10⁷ m\n\n*   **Schwarzschild Radius (Rs):**\n    Rs = D / 2 ≈ 2.69 x 10⁷ m\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Area of the Event Horizon**\nThe event horizon is a sphere, so its area is `A = 4 * π * Rs²`.\n\n*   **Area (A):**\n    A = 4 * π * (2.69 x 10⁷ m)² ≈ 9.1 x 10¹⁵ m²\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy**\nFinally, use the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula.\n\n*   **Entropy (S):**\n    S = (kB * c³ * A) / (4 * ħ * G)\n    S ≈ ( (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) * (3 x 10⁸ m/s)³ * (9.1 x 10¹⁵ m²) ) / ( 4 * (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (6.674 x 10⁻¹¹ m³⋅kg⁻¹⋅s⁻²) )\n    S ≈ (1.38e-23 * 2.7e25 * 9.1e15) / (4 * 1.054e-34 * 6.674e-11)\n    S ≈ 3.39e18 / 2.81e-44\n    S ≈ 1.2 x 10⁶² J/K\n\nThe calculated entropy is approximately 1.2 x 10⁶² J/K, which means the order of magnitude is 10⁶² J/K.\n\n<<<C>>>"
