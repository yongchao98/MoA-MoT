    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula. The scenario is analogous to the famous Fizeau experiment, which measured the speed of light in moving water.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference.** We have two frames of reference: the laboratory frame (let's call it S) and the frame of the moving glass (let's call it S'). The observer is at rest in the laboratory frame S.\n\n2.  **Determine the velocities.**\n    *   The glass (frame S') is moving with a velocity `v` relative to the laboratory (frame S).\n    *   The light beam is propagating through the glass. Its speed, as measured within the glass's frame of reference (S'), is `u' = c/n`. Given that the speed of light in a vacuum `c` is set to 1, the speed of light within the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n\n3.  **Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula.** The formula for adding velocities in special relativity is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`\n    Where:\n    *   `u` is the speed of the object (the light beam) relative to the stationary frame S (the laboratory). This is what we need to find.\n    *   `u'` is the speed of the object (the light beam) relative to the moving frame S' (the glass).\n    *   `v` is the speed of the moving frame S' (the glass) relative to the stationary frame S (the laboratory).\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n4.  **Substitute the known values into the formula.**\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    The formula becomes:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v / 1^2)`\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression.**\n    *   Simplify the denominator: `1 + (1/n)*v = 1 + v/n`.\n    *   The equation is now: `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`.\n    *   To eliminate the fractions within the numerator and denominator, find a common denominator for each part.\n        *   Numerator: `1/n + v = (1 + n*v) / n`\n        *   Denominator: `1 + v/n = (n + v) / n`\n    *   Now, divide the simplified numerator by the simplified denominator:\n        `u = [(1 + n*v) / n] / [(n + v) / n]`\n    *   The `n` terms in the denominators cancel out, leaving:\n        `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result matches option A. Several sources confirm that this is the correct application of the velocity addition formula for light in a moving medium.\n\n<<<A>>>"
