    "### Conclusion on the Mean Free Path\nThe scenario compares the mean free path of gas molecules colliding with each other (λ1) to the mean free path of high-energy electrons from a beam colliding with those same gas molecules (λ2). The relationship between these two values is determined by their respective collision cross-sections.\n\n1.  **Mean Free Path (MFP) Definition**: The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. It is inversely proportional to the number density of target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ): `λ = 1 / (n * σ)`.\n\n2.  **λ1 (Gas-Gas Collisions)**: This is the mean free path of a gas molecule moving through other gas molecules. The relevant cross-section, σ₁, is the kinetic cross-section for molecule-molecule collisions. This is determined by the effective physical size of the molecules. A common formula for this is `λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas)`, where σ_gas is approximately πd² (d being the molecular diameter). The factor of √2 accounts for the relative motion of the target molecules.\n\n3.  **λ2 (Electron-Gas Collisions)**: This is the mean free path of a high-energy electron (1000 kV) scattering off gas molecules. The formula is `λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_e)`, where σ_e is the scattering cross-section for an electron-molecule collision. Since the electron is moving at relativistic speeds, far faster than the thermal velocity of the gas molecules, the motion of the target molecules is negligible, and the √2 factor is not used.\n\n4.  **Comparing Collision Cross-Sections**:\n    *   A gas molecule presents a relatively large target to another gas molecule (σ₁).\n    *   A high-energy electron is a very small, penetrating particle. Its interaction (scattering) cross-section with a gas molecule (σ₂) is significantly smaller than the kinetic cross-section of two molecules. A fast electron is more likely to pass through a molecule's electron cloud without a significant interaction than another molecule is.\n\n5.  **Deriving the Relationship**: Since the number density of gas molecules (n) is the same in both scenarios, the relationship between λ1 and λ2 is dominated by the inverse of their cross-sections: `λ2 / λ1 ≈ σ₁ / σ₂`. Because σ₁ > σ₂, it directly follows that λ2 > λ1.\n\nA more detailed comparison using the formulas above gives `λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ₁) / (n * σ₂) = √2 * (σ₁ / σ₂)`. Since σ₁ is larger than σ₂, the ratio `(σ₁ / σ₂)` is greater than 1. Therefore, λ2 must be greater than λ1 by at least a factor of √2 (approximately 1.414).\n\nBased on this analysis, λ2 is significantly larger than λ1. Option A, which states λ2 ≥ 1.22 * λ1, is the only choice consistent with this physical principle.\n\n<<<A>>>"
