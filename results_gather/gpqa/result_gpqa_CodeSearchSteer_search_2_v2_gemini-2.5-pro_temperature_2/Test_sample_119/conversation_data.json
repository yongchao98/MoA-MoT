    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the relationship between the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) and the parallax itself, under the assumption of a uniform distribution of stars in the sky.\n\n### 1. Uniform Stellar Distribution and Star Counts\n\nAssuming stars are distributed uniformly throughout space, the number density of stars, represented by ρ (rho), is constant. The number of stars (N) within a sphere of a certain radius (r) from the observer can be calculated as the product of this constant density and the volume of the sphere.\n\nThe volume of a sphere is given by V = (4/3)πr³.\nTherefore, the number of stars up to a distance r is:\nN(r) = ρ * (4/3)πr³\n\nThis means that the number of stars is directly proportional to the cube of the distance (N ∝ r³).\n\n### 2. The Relationship Between Distance and Parallax\n\nStellar parallax (plx) and distance (r) are inversely proportional. This fundamental relationship in astronomy is expressed as:\nplx = 1/r  or  r = 1/plx.\n\nThis implies that stars farther away have smaller parallax angles, and closer stars have larger parallax angles.\n\n### 3. Number of Stars in a Thin Shell\n\nTo determine the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we first consider the number of stars (dN) located within a thin spherical shell at a distance r with a thickness dr.\n\nThe volume of this thin shell (dV) is approximately the surface area of the sphere (4πr²) multiplied by the shell's thickness (dr):\ndV = 4πr² dr\n\nThe number of stars within this shell is then the density multiplied by the shell's volume:\ndN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πr² dr\n\n### 4. Expressing Star Counts in Terms of Parallax\n\nNow, we need to re-express the equation for dN in terms of parallax (plx). We substitute r = 1/plx into the equation. We also need to find the differential dr in terms of d(plx).\n\nDifferentiating r with respect to plx gives:\ndr/d(plx) = -1/plx²\nSo, dr = -(1/plx²) d(plx)\n\nWhen considering the number of stars in a parallax range, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can disregard the negative sign, which merely indicates that distance and parallax are inversely related.\n|dr| = (1/plx²) d(plx)\n\n### 5. Deriving the Final Relationship\n\nBy substituting r = 1/plx and |dr| = (1/plx²) d(plx) into the equation for dN, we get:\ndN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx)\ndN = (4πρ / plx⁴) d(plx)\n\nThe question asks for \"how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx\". This is represented by the derivative dN/d(plx).\n\nFrom the equation above, we can find this relationship:\ndN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴\n\nSince 4, π, and ρ are constants, we arrive at the final proportionality:\ndN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴.\n\nThis result shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the parallax. This concept is also fundamental in understanding observational biases like the Lutz-Kelker bias.\n\n<<<D>>>"
