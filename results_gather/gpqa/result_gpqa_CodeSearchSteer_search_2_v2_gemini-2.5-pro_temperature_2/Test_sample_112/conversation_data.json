    "Here's a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadness is a result of hydrogen bonding, which is typical for carboxylic acids that often form dimers. This peak's position is centered in the same region as C-H stretches.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Combined with the broad O-H peak, this strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C). The presence of a carboxylic acid means the molecule must contain two oxygen atoms.\n\n### 2. Analysis of 1H NMR Data\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the 1H NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene functional group. Vinyl protons typically show signals in the 4-6 ppm region of the spectrum.\n\n**Conclusion from 1H NMR:** This confirms the FTIR finding of a C=C double bond.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids, corresponding to the mass of the [COOH]⁺ fragment (12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45).\n\n**Conclusion from Mass Spectrometry:** This data provides strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Molecular Formulas using Degrees of Unsaturation\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency, indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule. The formula is:\n\nDoU = C - (H/2) + (N/2) + 1\n\nwhere C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens (oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation).\n\nOur spectroscopic data confirmed the presence of:\n*   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid). This accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n*   One C=C double bond (from the alkene). This accounts for another degree of unsaturation.\n\nTherefore, the correct molecular formula must have a **Degree of Unsaturation of 2**. Let's calculate the DoU for each option:\n\n*   **A) C6H10O:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2. This has the correct DoU but only one oxygen atom, which contradicts the evidence for a carboxylic acid.\n*   **B) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1. This DoU is too low. It cannot account for both a carbonyl and an alkene double bond.\n*   **C) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2. This formula has two oxygen atoms, consistent with a carboxylic acid, and the correct degree of unsaturation (2) to account for both the C=O and C=C double bonds.\n*   **D) C6H12O:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1. This DoU is too low, and it only has one oxygen atom.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe combined spectral evidence strongly supports a structure that is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The formula **C6H10O2** is the only option that contains two oxygen atoms (required for a carboxylic acid) and has the necessary two degrees of unsaturation to accommodate both a carbonyl group and a carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n<<<C>>>"
