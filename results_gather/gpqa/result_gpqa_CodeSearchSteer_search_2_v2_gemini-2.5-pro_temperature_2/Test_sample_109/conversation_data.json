    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we must consider two factors: the star's visibility from each observatory's location and its apparent brightness.\n\n**1. Observatory Visibility**\n\nA star's visibility is determined by its declination (DEC) and the latitude of the observatory.\n*   **Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO):** Located in Chile at a latitude of about -24.6°. It can observe objects in the southern sky and down to a northern declination of approximately +65°.\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory (HIRES):** Located in Hawaii at a latitude of about +19.8°. It can observe objects in the northern sky and down to a southern declination of approximately -70°.\n\nFor a star to be seen by both observatories, its declination must lie within the common range of roughly -70° to +65°.\n\n**2. Brightness Limits**\n\nThe instruments have different limiting magnitudes:\n*   **ESPRESSO:** Can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude brighter than 17.\n*   **HIRES:** Can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude brighter than 16.\n\nTherefore, for a star to be detected by both, it must have an apparent V magnitude **brighter than 16**.\n\n### Analysis of Each Star\n\nThe apparent magnitude (m) is calculated from the absolute magnitude (M), distance (d), and interstellar extinction (A_V) using the distance modulus formula: **m = M + 5*log₁₀(d/10) + A_V**. The extinction is given by A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V).\n\n*   **Star 1:** With a declination of -75°, it is too far south to be observed by the Keck Observatory.\n\n*   **Star 2:** It has a declination of +55°, making it visible from both locations. However, its apparent V magnitude is 16.5, which is too faint for the HIRES spectrograph's limit of 16.\n\n*   **Star 3:**\n    *   **Visibility:** Its declination of +48° is within the observable range for both observatories.\n    *   **Brightness:** Its given apparent V magnitude is 15.5. This is brighter than the limit of 16 for HIRES and 17 for ESPRESSO. Thus, Star 3 is detectable by both.\n\n*   **Star 4:**\n    *   **Visibility:** Its declination of -48° is visible from both observatories.\n    *   **Brightness:** We must calculate its apparent magnitude.\n        *   Extinction (A_V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n        *   Apparent Magnitude (m_V) = 15.5 + 5*log₁₀(10/10) + 1.24 = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = **16.74 mag**.\n        *   This is fainter than the magnitude limit of 16 for HIRES.\n\n*   **Star 5:**\n    *   **Visibility:** Its declination of +60° is within the observable range for both locations.\n    *   **Brightness:** We calculate its apparent magnitude:\n        *   Apparent Magnitude (m_V) = 16.5 + 5*log₁₀(5/10) = 16.5 + 5*(-0.301) ≈ 16.5 - 1.51 = **14.99 mag**.\n        *   This is brighter than the limit of 16 for HIRES and 17 for ESPRESSO. Thus, Star 5 is detectable by both.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOnly Star 3 and Star 5 meet both the visibility and brightness criteria for both observatories.\n\n<<<C>>>"
