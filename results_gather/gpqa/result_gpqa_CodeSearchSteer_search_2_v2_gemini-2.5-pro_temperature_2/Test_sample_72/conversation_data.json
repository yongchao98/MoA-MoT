    "### Analyzing the Relativistic Motion of Two Astronauts\n\nTo determine the correct option, we will calculate the relative speed and the total energy of the system composed of two astronauts.\n\n#### Relative Speed (v_rel)\n\nThe first astronaut has a mass of 2m and travels at a speed (v₁) of 0.6c. The second astronaut has a mass of 3m and travels at a speed (v₂) of 0.5c. Both are moving in the same positive x-direction.\n\nTo find the relative speed between the two astronauts, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. In the reference frame of the second astronaut (moving at 0.5c), the first astronaut's velocity is calculated as:\n\n*   **v_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂) / c²)**\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n*   v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\n*   v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\n*   v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\n*   v_rel ≈ 0.1428c\n\nThus, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n#### Total Energy (E)\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic object is given by the equation E = γmc², where γ (the Lorentz factor) is 1 / √(1 - v²/c²). We need to calculate the total energy for each astronaut and then sum them to find the total energy of the system.\n\n**For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):**\n\n1.  First, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ₁):\n    *   γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √0.64 = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n\n2.  Next, calculate the energy (E₁):\n    *   E₁ = γ₁ * (2m) * c² = 1.25 * 2mc² = 2.5mc²\n\n**For the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):**\n\n1.  First, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ₂):\n    *   γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √0.75 = 1 / (√3 / 2) = 2 / √3 ≈ 1.1547\n\n2.  Next, calculate the energy (E₂):\n    *   E₂ = γ₂ * (3m) * c² = (2/√3) * 3mc² = (6/√3)mc² = 2√3 mc² ≈ 3.464mc²\n\n**Total Energy of the System (E_total):**\n\nThe total energy is the sum of the individual energies:\n\n*   E_total = E₁ + E₂\n*   E_total = 2.5mc² + 2√3 mc²\n*   E_total = (2.5 + 2√3)mc²\n*   E_total ≈ (2.5 + 3.464)mc²\n*   E_total ≈ 5.964mc²\n\nThe total energy of the system is approximately **5.96mc²**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on these calculations:\n*   The relative speed **v_rel ≈ 0.14c**.\n*   The total energy **E ≈ 5.96mc²**.\n\nComparing these results to the given options, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
