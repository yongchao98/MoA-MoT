    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the total number of atoms in salts A and B.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe mixture of gases formed from heating the salts was passed through three tubes, and the following was observed:\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a drying agent that absorbs water. The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution, known as limewater, absorbs acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, and NO₂. Since the weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The 0.80 g weight increase is due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO), meaning the mass gained is from oxygen atoms.\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas remained, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Identification of the Gases**\n\nFrom the analysis, the initial gas mixture from the decomposition contained:\n*   0.20 mol of water (H₂O).\n*   A gas that provided 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms to the hot copper.\n*   A gas or gases that eventually became the 0.10 mol of Gas C.\n\nLet's consider the identities of the unknown gases. Common decomposition products of salts are often nitrogen-containing gases. The gas reacting with copper must be an oxygen-containing gas but not acidic. The most likely candidates are nitrous oxide (N₂O) or oxygen (O₂).\n\nLet's hypothesize the gas that reacted with copper was nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction is:\nCu + N₂O → CuO + N₂\n\nTo produce 0.05 mol of O atoms (as CuO), 0.05 mol of N₂O must have reacted. This reaction would also produce 0.05 mol of nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\nThe final remaining gas (Gas C) was measured to be 0.10 mol. If the decomposition initially produced some inert nitrogen (N₂) and the reaction in Tube №3 also produced N₂, the amounts would add up. If we assume the original decomposition produced 0.05 mol of N₂ and the reaction of N₂O produced another 0.05 mol, the total would be 0.10 mol of N₂, matching the observation for Gas C.\n\nThis suggests the initial decomposition produced:\n*   **0.20 mol H₂O**\n*   **0.05 mol N₂O**\n*   **0.05 mol N₂**\n\nThe total mass of these products is (0.20 mol * 18 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 44 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 28 g/mol) = 3.60 g + 2.20 g + 1.40 g = 7.20 g. This perfectly matches the initial mass of the salt mixture.\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states we started with an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. We need to find two salts that would decompose to yield the determined mixture of gases. The most common salts that decompose to produce water, nitrous oxide, and nitrogen gas are ammonium salts.\n*   The thermal decomposition of ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) yields nitrous oxide and water: NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n*   The thermal decomposition of ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) yields nitrogen gas and water: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n\nLet's assume the mixture contained 'n' moles of each salt.\n*   Decomposition would yield 'n' moles of N₂O (from NH₄NO₃), 'n' moles of N₂ (from NH₄NO₂), and a total of (2n + 2n) = 4n moles of H₂O.\n*   From our gas analysis, we found 0.05 mol of N₂O, 0.05 mol of N₂, and 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n*   Comparing these values: n = 0.05 mol, and 4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. The numbers are perfectly consistent.\n\nTherefore, the initial mixture was 0.05 moles of ammonium nitrate (Salt A) and 0.05 moles of ammonium nitrite (Salt B).\n\n**4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate):** NH₄NO₃\n    *   Atoms = 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = 9 atoms\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite):** NH₄NO₂\n    *   Atoms = 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = 8 atoms\n\nThe total number of atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula unit:\nTotal Atoms = 9 (from A) + 8 (from B) = 17\n\n<<<C>>>"
