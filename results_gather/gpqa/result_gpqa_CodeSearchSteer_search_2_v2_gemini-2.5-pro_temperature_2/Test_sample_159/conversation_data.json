    "An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem `a` will approach the shape of a circle as N becomes infinitely large. In this limit, the apothem `a` becomes the radius of the circle. The problem is then transformed into finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius `a`.\n\nThe diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The angular positions of the dark rings (minima) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function.\n\nFor a circular aperture of diameter `D`, the angular positions `θ` of the minima are given by the formula:\nsin(θ) ≈ θ = m * λ / D\nwhere λ is the wavelength of the light and `m` is a coefficient corresponding to the order of the minimum.\n\nFor this problem, the N-sided polygon with an infinitely large N becomes a circle. The apothem `a` becomes the radius, so the diameter `D` of the circular aperture is `2a`.\n\nThe coefficients for the first two minima are:\n*   For the first minimum (m₁): 1.220\n*   For the second minimum (m₂): 2.233\n\nUsing the small angle approximation (tan θ ≈ θ), the angular position of the first minimum (θ₁) is:\nθ₁ = 1.220 * λ / D = 1.220 * λ / (2a) = 0.610 * λ / a.\n\nThe angular position of the second minimum (θ₂) is:\nθ₂ = 2.233 * λ / D = 2.233 * λ / (2a) ≈ 1.1165 * λ / a.\n\nThe angular distance (Δθ) between the first two minima is the difference between θ₂ and θ₁:\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁\nΔθ = (1.1165 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\nΔθ = (1.1165 - 0.610) * λ / a\nΔθ = 0.5065 * λ / a\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0.610 λ / a\nB) 0.506 λ / a\nC) 0.500 λ / a\nD) 1.220 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 0.5065 λ/a corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
