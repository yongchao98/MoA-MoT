    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\nThis reaction is the α-bromination of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine to form 2-bromocyclohexanone. This is the most likely initial product.\n\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\nWhen an α-haloketone with available α'-hydrogens, like 2-bromocyclohexanone, is treated with a strong base like NaOH, it undergoes a reaction called the **Favorskii rearrangement**. This reaction involves a ring contraction. The base abstracts a proton from the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group on the side opposite the bromine. This leads to the formation of a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate, which is then opened by the hydroxide ion to form a carboxylate. After neutralization, the product is a ring-contracted carboxylic acid. In this case, the six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to a five-membered ring.\n\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\nThionyl chloride is a standard reagent used to convert carboxylic acids into acid chlorides. Pyridine is typically added to neutralize the HCl by-product.\n\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃H)**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky and mild reducing agent. It is specifically used for the selective reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes, preventing further reduction to the corresponding primary alcohol.\n\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde\n\n**Determining the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde)**\n\nTo find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to analyze the symmetry of the cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde molecule.\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO). The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (C=O and its H), the C-H bond on the carbon of the ring where the aldehyde is attached (C1), and bisects the rest of the ring.\n\nThis symmetry makes certain pairs of atoms chemically equivalent:\n*   The carbons at position 2 and 5 are equivalent.\n*   The carbons at position 3 and 4 are equivalent.\n\nNow, let's count the distinct types of hydrogen atoms:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO)**: This hydrogen is in a unique chemical environment. (1 distinct type)\n2.  **The proton on C1**: The hydrogen atom on the carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group is also unique. (1 distinct type)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5**: The two hydrogen atoms on C2 are diastereotopic because C1 is a prochiral center. This means they are not equivalent to each other. Due to the plane of symmetry, the two hydrogens on C5 are equivalent to their counterparts on C2. Therefore, there are two distinct types of hydrogens on these two carbons. (2 distinct types)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4**: Similarly, the two hydrogen atoms on C3 are diastereotopic and thus not equivalent to each other. The plane of symmetry makes the hydrogens on C4 equivalent to their counterparts on C3. This gives another two distinct types of hydrogens. (2 distinct types)\n\nIn total, the number of chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms is: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\nThus, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
