    "To determine which of the following compounds exhibit optical activity, each compound must be assessed for chirality. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image and lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  ***(Z)*-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a plane. This plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry. It does not have any chiral centers. Therefore, it is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)*-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS), indicating a specific three-dimensional arrangement of atoms. This signifies that the molecule is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound. Chiral compounds are by definition optically active.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)*-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the molecule possesses an internal plane of symmetry that runs between the two chiral carbons because the substituents on both carbons are the same (H, CH₃, and COOH). The (R,S) configuration indicates that the two chiral centers are mirror images of each other. This type of compound is called a meso compound, which is achiral despite having chiral centers and is therefore optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)*-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule also has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. The (2R,3R) designation indicates a specific enantiomer. Unlike its (2R,3S) diastereomer, it does not have an internal plane of symmetry. This molecule is chiral and will have a non-superimposable mirror image, the (2S,3S) enantiomer. Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n5.  ***(R)*-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The designation (R) at position 1 indicates a chiral center. The carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl (-OH) group is attached to four different groups, making it a chiral center. The (R) in the name specifies a particular enantiomer, which is optically active.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)*-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: In this molecule, the three hydroxyl groups are all on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (*cis*). This molecule has a high degree of symmetry. It possesses a C3 axis of rotation and three planes of symmetry, each passing through one of the hydroxyl-bearing carbons and the opposing methylene group. Due to these planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  ***1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one***: To determine if this molecule is chiral, we check for chiral centers. The structure is CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl. Let's examine the carbons: Carbon 3 is bonded to a hydrogen and two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. No other carbon atom in the chain or the symmetrical cyclopentyl ring is chiral. The molecule has a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the compounds that are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>"
