    "### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n1.  **FTIR (Fourier-transform infrared) Spectroscopy**: The problem states there is a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ and a strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. The broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H bond in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid. The strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is indicative of the C=O (carbonyl) double bond, also consistent with a carboxylic acid. All four potential compounds are carboxylic acids, so this data confirms the functional group present but does not help distinguish between the isomers.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR (Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) Spectroscopy**: This technique provides detailed information about the structure.\n    *   **No vinyl-hydrogens**: This tells us there are no hydrogens attached to carbon-carbon double bonds, which is consistent with all four proposed saturated structures.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**: For a signal to be split in this manner, a proton must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: one proton (giving the doublet), a set of two protons (giving the triplet), and a set of three protons (giving the quartet). This implies the proton has neighbors of 1H, 2H, and 3H.\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**: For a signal to be split this way, a proton must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: one proton (giving the doublet), a set of two protons (giving one triplet), and another set of two protons (giving the other triplet). This implies the proton has neighbors of 1H, 2H, and 2H.\n\n### Evaluation of Possible Structures:\n\nLet's examine each proposed structure to see if its protons would produce both of the described complex splitting patterns. The n+1 rule helps predict these patterns; a signal is split into n+1 peaks by 'n' equivalent neighboring protons. For complex splitting, each neighboring group's effect is considered sequentially.\n\n*   **Structure A: CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\n    Let's label the relevant protons:\n    CH₃(a)-**CH(b)**(CH₂(c)H₃)-**CH(d)**(CH₂(e)H₃)-CH₂(f)-COOH\n    *   **Proton (d)**: This proton is adjacent to proton (b) (1H), the CH₂(f) group (2H), and the CH₂(e) group of the ethyl side chain (2H). Therefore, the signal for H(d) would be split by 1, 2, and 2 neighboring protons, resulting in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n    *   **Proton (b)**: This proton is adjacent to proton (d) (1H), the CH₃(a) group (3H), and the CH₂(c) group of its ethyl side chain (2H). The signal for H(b) would be split by 1, 3, and 2 neighboring protons, which gives rise to a **doublet of quartets of triplets** (or doublet of triplets of quartets, depending on the coupling constant sizes). This matches the second observed signal.\n    *   Since this structure can produce both a `dtt` and a `dtq`, it is a strong candidate.\n\n*   **Structure B: CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\n    *   Let's analyze the proton between the two methyl-bearing carbons: `-C**H**(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH`. It's adjacent to the other methine proton (1H), a methyl group (3H), and a methylene group (2H). This would indeed create a **doublet of quartets of triplets (dtq)**.\n    *   However, there is no proton in this molecule that is adjacent to three groups of protons with counts of 1H, 2H, and 2H. Therefore, a `dtt` signal is not expected. This structure is incorrect.\n\n*   **Structure C: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\n    *   The proton alpha to the carbonyl: `-C**H**(CH₃)-COOH`. This is adjacent to one methine proton and one methyl group. This would be a doublet of quartets.\n    *   The other methine proton: `CH₃CH₂-C**H**(CH₃)-`. It's adjacent to a methylene group (2H), a methine proton (1H), and a methyl group (3H). This would result in a **triplet of doublets of quartets**, which could be described as a `dtq`.\n    *   Again, no proton exists that has neighbors of 1H, 2H, and 2H. A `dtt` is not possible. This structure is incorrect.\n\n*   **Structure D: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**\n    *   Let's analyze the methine proton labeled `(c)`: `CH₃CH₂-C**H(c)**(C₂H₅)-CH-COOH`. This proton is adjacent to the other methine proton (1H), the methylene of the backbone ethyl group (2H), and the methylene of the side-chain ethyl group (2H). This proton would produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   However, let's search for a proton that could produce a `dtq` (neighbors of 1H, 2H, and 3H). No such proton exists in this structure. For example, the other methine proton is adjacent to H(c) (1H) and the methylene of its ethyl group (2H), which would be a doublet of triplets. The protons of the CH₂ in the backbone ethyl group are adjacent to a methine (1H) and a methyl (3H), which would be a doublet of quartets. This structure does not fit all the data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly structure A has protons that would exhibit both a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets splitting pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>"
