    "Here is an analysis of the provided information:\n\n*   **1H NMR Data:** The spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical environments (similar chemical shifts) and are in roughly a 1:1 ratio (equal integrals). The possibility of these being separate signals due to spin-spin coupling has been ruled out. This observation strongly suggests the presence of two similar, but magnetically non-equivalent, species in equal amounts.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images) are indistinguishable in a standard NMR experiment as they have identical chemical shifts in an achiral environment. Therefore, a mixture of enantiomers would only show one peak for the alpha-proton.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (stereoisomers that are not mirror images) have different physical properties and are distinct chemical compounds. Their corresponding protons are in different chemical environments and are expected to have different chemical shifts, resulting in separate peaks in an NMR spectrum. If present in a 1:1 mixture, these peaks would have equal integrals. This aligns perfectly with the NMR data. A common cause for diastereomers in peptides is the slow rotation around an amide bond (forming atropisomers or rotamers), particularly with proline residues, leading to cis/trans isomers.\n\n*   **LC-MS Data:** The analysis shows two separate peaks of equal intensity that are resolvable by liquid chromatography (LC). Both peaks have identical mass spectra, which corresponds to the mass of the expected peptide.\n    *   **Enantiomers** co-elute (are not separated) on a standard, achiral LC column. To separate them, a specialized chiral column or a chiral derivatizing agent would be necessary. The problem implies a standard LC-MS analysis.\n    *   **Diastereomers**, having different physical properties, are often separable on standard (achiral) LC columns. Since they are isomers, they have the same molecular weight and would produce identical mass spectra, which is consistent with the observations. The use of elevated temperature in the LC-MS might indicate that the two species are rotamers that interconvert, and the temperature is optimized to achieve separation on the chromatographic timescale.\n\n*   **Other Options:**\n    *   **\"Double coupling\"** would result in a product with a higher molecular weight than the expected molecule. The mass spectrometry data contradicts this, as the observed mass is correct.\n    *   **Contamination with a precursor** would also mean the presence of a compound with a different molecular weight. The mass spectrometry data rules this out as well, since both peaks have the same, expected mass.\n\n**Conclusion:** The presence of two species with identical mass that are separable by standard liquid chromatography and give distinct signals in an NMR spectrum is a classic signature of diastereomers.\n\n<<<B>>>"
