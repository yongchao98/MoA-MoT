    "When 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated, it undergoes a-sigmatropic rearrangement known as the Cope rearrangement. This type of reaction is common for 1,5-dienes and results in a structural isomer. The reaction proceeds through a cyclic, chair-like transition state.\n\nTo determine the product, we can follow the movement of electrons and atoms:\n1.  **Identify the reactant:** The starting molecule is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Its structure is `CH3-CH=CH-CH2-CH(C4H9)-CH=CH-CH2-CH3`.\n2.  **Locate the 1,5-diene system:** The core six-carbon system that participates in the rearrangement is `C2-C3-C4-C5-C6-C7`.\n3.  **Simulate the bond rearrangement:** In a Cope rearrangement, the sigma bond between C4 and C5 breaks, a new sigma bond forms between C2 and C7, and the double bonds shift from C2=C3 and C6=C7 to C3=C4 and C5=C6.\n4.  **Identify the resulting structure:** The atoms are reconnected to form a new molecule. To name this product, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the new double bonds.\n5.  **Name the new molecule:** The new longest carbon chain has 10 carbons (a deca- chain) with double bonds at the 1 and 5 positions. There is a methyl group on carbon 3 and an ethyl group on carbon 4.\n\nTherefore, the resulting product is 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene. This matches one of the provided options.\n\n<<<D>>>"
