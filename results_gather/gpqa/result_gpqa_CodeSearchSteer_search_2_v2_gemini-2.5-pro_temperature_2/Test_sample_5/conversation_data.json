    "To find the energy spectrum for the given potential, we first need to express the potential in Cartesian coordinates and analyze its form.\n\n**1. Convert the Potential to Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ):\n`V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)`\n\nThe relationships between Cartesian coordinates (x, y) and polar coordinates are:\n*   `x = r cos(θ)`\n*   `y = r sin(θ)`\n*   `r^2 = x^2 + y^2`\n\nSubstitute these into the potential equation:\n`V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k(r cos(θ))^2`\n`V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 kx^2`\n\nNow, combine the terms with `x^2`:\n`V(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2) kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2`\n`V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2`\n\n**2. Analyze the Schrödinger Equation with the Separated Potential**\n\nThe potential `V(x, y)` is a sum of two independent potentials, one for the x-direction and one for the y-direction:\n`V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)`\nwhere:\n*   `V_x(x) = 2kx^2 = 1/2 (4k)x^2`\n*   `V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2`\n\nThis represents a two-dimensional anisotropic quantum harmonic oscillator. Because the potential is separable, the time-independent Schrödinger equation can be separated into two one-dimensional equations, and the total energy `E` is the sum of the energies from the x and y components: `E = E_x + E_y`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy Spectrum for Each Dimension**\n\nThe energy spectrum for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential `V(q) = 1/2 mω^2 q^2` is given by:\n`E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω`, where `ω = sqrt(k_eff/m)` is the angular frequency.\n\n*   **For the x-direction:**\n    The effective spring constant is `k_x = 4k`.\n    The angular frequency is `ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)`.\n    The energy eigenvalues for the x-component are:\n    `E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m) = (2n_x + 1)ħ * sqrt(k/m)`\n\n*   **For the y-direction:**\n    The effective spring constant is `k_y = k`.\n    The angular frequency is `ω_y = sqrt(k/m)`.\n    The energy eigenvalues for the y-component are:\n    `E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)`\n\n**4. Sum the Energies**\n\nThe total energy `E` is the sum `E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}`:\n`E = (2n_x + 1)ħ * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)`\n`E = [(2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2)] ħ * sqrt(k/m)`\n`E = (2n_x + n_y + 1 + 1/2) ħ * sqrt(k/m)`\n`E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ħ * sqrt(k/m)`\n\nThis result corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
