    "Here's a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct electric field magnitude at point P:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity of the uncharged conductor will attract free electrons from the conductor. This results in a negative charge of `-q` being induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Charge:** The conductor was initially electrically neutral. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a corresponding positive charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor to maintain overall neutrality.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage Effect):** A key property of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium is that the conducting material shields the regions outside it from the electric fields of charges located inside. This means the arrangement of the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the cavity's surface has no direct effect on the electric field outside the conductor.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Due to the spherical shape of the conductor and the shielding effect, the induced charge `+q` on the outer surface will distribute itself uniformly, regardless of the position of the charge inside the cavity (`s` and `r` are irrelevant for the external field).\n\n5.  **Shell Theorem:** For any point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the electric field is identical to that of a single point charge equal to the total charge of the distribution, located at its center. In this case, the uniformly distributed charge `+q` on the outer surface acts as if it were a point charge `+q` located at the center of the large spherical conductor.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:** Point P is at a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor. Using Coulomb's Law (which is derived from Gauss's Law for this situation), the electric field at point P is determined solely by the effective point charge `+q` at the center and the distance `L`. The other parameters like `l`, `s`, and `Î¸` are not relevant for calculating the field outside the conductor.\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
