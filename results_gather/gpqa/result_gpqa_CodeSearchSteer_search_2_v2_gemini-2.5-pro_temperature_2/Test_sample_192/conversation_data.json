    "To determine how the number of stars changes with distance, we first need to understand the relationship between parallax and distance, and then relate it to the given information about the number of stars.\n\n1.  **Parallax and Distance:** Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (r) to a star. This fundamental relationship in astronomy is expressed as `d = 1/p`, where 'd' is the distance in parsecs and 'p' is the parallax angle in arcseconds. Therefore, we can state the proportionality:\n    `plx ∝ 1/r`\n\n2.  **Number of Stars and Parallax:** The problem states that the number of stars (N) in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as:\n    `N ∝ 1/plx⁵`\n\n3.  **Connecting the Relationships:** We can substitute the parallax-distance relationship into the equation for the number of stars.\n    Since `plx ∝ 1/r`, it follows that `plx⁵ ∝ (1/r)⁵ = 1/r⁵`.\n    Now, substitute this into the expression for N:\n    `N ∝ 1 / (1/r⁵)`\n    This simplifies to:\n    `N ∝ r⁵`\n    This means the total cumulative number of stars up to a distance `r` is proportional to the distance raised to the fifth power.\n\n4.  **Number of Stars per Unit Distance:** The question asks how the number of stars changes *per unit range of distance*, which is not the total number (N) but the rate of change of N with respect to r (dN/dr). To find this, we differentiate N with respect to r.\n    If we express the proportionality as an equation `N = k * r⁵` (where k is a constant of proportionality), we can differentiate it:\n    `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r⁵)`\n    `dN/dr = 5 * k * r⁴`\n\n    From this derivative, we can see the proportionality for the number of stars per unit range of distance:\n    `dN/dr ∝ r⁴`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance with a proportionality of r⁴.\n\n<<<D>>>"
