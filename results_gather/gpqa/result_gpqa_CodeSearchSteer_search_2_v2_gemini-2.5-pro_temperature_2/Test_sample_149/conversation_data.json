    "The step-by-step analysis leads to the final product.\n\n1.  **Identify the Starting Material:** The molecular formula is C8H9NO. The ¹H-NMR data corresponds to 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n    *   `9.72 (t, 1H)`: Aldehyde proton (-CHO) coupled to a CH2 group.\n    *   `6.98 (d, 2H)` and `6.51 (d, 2H)`: A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   `6.27 (bs, 2H)`: A primary amine group (-NH2).\n    *   `3.66 (d, 2H)`: A methylene group (-CH2-) coupled to the aldehyde proton.\n    The structure is H₂N-C₆H₄-CH₂-CHO.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction Sequence:**\n    *   **Reagents 1 and 2 (NaNO₂ + HCl, then H₂O):** This is a two-step process to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol. The amine group (-NH2) on the benzene ring is first converted to a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻), which is then hydrolyzed with water to an alcohol (-OH) group.\n        *   Intermediate product: 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CHO).\n\n    *   **Reagent 3 (aq. KOH, Heat):** This represents a base-catalyzed aldol condensation. 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde has acidic α-protons (on the -CH₂- group adjacent to the aldehyde) and will undergo self-condensation. The reaction involves an initial aldol addition to form a β-hydroxy aldehyde, followed by dehydration (elimination of water), which is promoted by heat.\n        *   **Aldol Addition:** Two molecules of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde react. One forms an enolate which acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of the second molecule. The addition product is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This corresponds to option (D).\n        *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The term \"condensation\" implies the loss of a small molecule, in this case, water. The heat supplied in the reaction conditions favors the elimination of water from the aldol adduct to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The aldol adduct (3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal) eliminates water to form 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n3.  **Identify the Final Product:** The question asks for the final product after reacting with the full set of reagents, including heat. Heat drives the aldol addition product to the dehydrated condensation product. The final product is the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde formed after dehydration.\n\n*   Adduct (product of step 3a): `HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH(CHO)-C₆H₄-OH` (3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal)\n*   Final Product (product of step 3b, dehydration): `HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CH=C(C₆H₄-OH)-CHO` (2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal).\n\nThis final structure matches the name given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
