    "To identify the correct reactants, let's analyze each reaction separately.\n\n**Reaction A: A + H₂SO₄ → 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-one**\n\nThis reaction involves the treatment of a reactant 'A' with sulfuric acid to yield a spiroketone. This transformation is characteristic of a **Pinacol rearrangement**, an acid-catalyzed rearrangement of a 1,2-diol (also known as a vicinal diol or glycol). The mechanism involves the protonation of one hydroxyl group, loss of water to form a carbocation, followed by a 1,2-alkyl shift to form a more stable oxonium ion, which then deprotonates to give the ketone product. The rearrangement of cyclic diols to form spirocyclic ketones is a well-known application of this reaction.\n\nLet's examine the options for reactant A:\n*   **A = 2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol:** This is a substituted decalin-diol, a type of 1,2-diol on a fused ring system. This structure is a suitable precursor for a Pinacol rearrangement to form the spiro[4.5]decanone ring system. The acid would catalyze the rearrangement of the decalin skeleton into the spirocyclic skeleton.\n*   **A = 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol:** This is the corresponding alcohol of the ketone product. Treatment with sulfuric acid would likely lead to dehydration (elimination of water to form an alkene), not oxidation to a ketone.\n\nTherefore, reactant A is **2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol**. This eliminates options B and D.\n\n**Reaction B: B + BuLi + H⁺ → 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol**\n\nThis reaction involves a strong base, n-butyllithium (BuLi), followed by an acidic workup (H⁺) to produce a homoallylic alcohol (an alcohol where the hydroxyl group is on the third carbon from a C=C double bond).\n\nLet's evaluate the remaining options for reactant B (from choices A and C):\n*   **B = 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-one:** This is a ketone. BuLi is a potent nucleophile and would attack the carbonyl carbon, adding a butyl group. The product would be a tertiary alcohol, 1-butyl-4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol. This does not match the desired product.\n*   **B = (((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene:** This is an allylic ether, also known as benzyl prenyl ether. When treated with a strong base like BuLi, an allylic ether can undergo a **-Wittig rearrangement**. This is a concerted, pericyclic reaction where a carbanion formed adjacent to the ether oxygen rearranges to form a homoallylic alcohol. Let's trace the mechanism:\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** BuLi removes a proton from the carbon that is both benzylic and alpha to the ether oxygen (Ph-C**H₂**-O-), as this is the most acidic position, to form a carbanion.\n    2.  **Rearrangement:** A concerted-sigmatropic shift occurs. A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the carbanion and the terminal carbon of the allyl group (the C(CH₃)₂ group), the O-CH₂ bond breaks, and the double bond shifts.\n    3.  The intermediate is the alkoxide of 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol.\n    4.  **Protonation:** The acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the alkoxide to yield the final alcohol product, 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol.\n\nThis reaction sequence correctly yields the specified product. Therefore, reactant B is **(((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Reactant A is **2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol**.\n*   Reactant B is **(((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
