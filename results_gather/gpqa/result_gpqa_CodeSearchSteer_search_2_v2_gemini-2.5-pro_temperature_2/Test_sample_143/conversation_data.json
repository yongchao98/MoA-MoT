    "To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we need to calculate its lifetime in the laboratory frame and its velocity.\n\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    The Lorentz factor is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy (m).\n    *   E_X = 8 GeV\n    *   m_X = 1.2 GeV\n    *   γ = E_X / m_X = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 20/3 ≈ 6.67\n\n2.  **Calculate the particle's velocity (v):**\n    The velocity is related to the Lorentz factor. We can express it as a fraction of the speed of light, c, using β = v/c.\n    *   β = √(1 - 1/γ²) = √(1 - 1/(20/3)²) = √(1 - 9/400) = √(391/400) ≈ 0.98867\n    *   So, the particle's velocity is approximately 98.9% of the speed of light.\n\n3.  **Calculate the proper lifetime (τ):**\n    The proper lifetime is the lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame. It is inversely proportional to its decay width (Γ) according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.\n    *   Γ_X = 320 MeV = 0.320 GeV\n    *   The reduced Planck constant (ħ) is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻²⁵ GeV·s.\n    *   τ = ħ / Γ_X = (6.582 x 10⁻²⁵ GeV·s) / 0.320 GeV ≈ 2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s\n\n4.  **Calculate the mean decay distance (d):**\n    In the laboratory frame, the particle's lifetime is dilated by the Lorentz factor (t_lab = γ * τ). The distance it travels during this time is its velocity multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime.\n    *   d = v * t_lab = (β * c) * (γ * τ)\n    *   d = γ * β * c * τ\n    *   d ≈ (20/3) * 0.98867 * (3.00 x 10⁸ m/s) * (2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s)\n    *   d ≈ 6.667 * 0.98867 * (6.171 x 10⁻¹⁶ m)\n    *   d ≈ 6.591 * (6.171 x 10⁻¹⁶ m) ≈ 4.067 x 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nA more precise calculation using the relation `d = (pc/mc²) * (cħ/Γ)` where `pc = sqrt(E² - (mc²)²)`:\n*   `pc` = √(8² - 1.2²) GeV = √62.56 GeV ≈ 7.909 GeV\n*   `ħc` ≈ 1.973 x 10⁻¹⁶ GeV·m\n*   d = (√62.56 / 1.2) * (1.973 x 10⁻¹⁶ GeV·m / 0.32 GeV)\n*   d = (7.909 / 1.2) * (6.166 x 10⁻¹⁶ m)\n*   d = 6.591 * 6.166 x 10⁻¹⁶ m ≈ 4.064 x 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nBoth calculations yield a result extremely close to option D. The minor differences arise from the precision of the physical constants used.\n\nComparing our calculated value of approximately 4.064 x 10⁻¹⁵ m with the given options:\nA) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁶ m (Incorrect exponent)\nB) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁵ m (Incorrect value)\nC) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁶ m (Incorrect exponent and value)\nD) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁵ m (Correct value and exponent)\n\nThe calculation matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
