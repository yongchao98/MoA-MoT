    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1.\n\n### **1. Understand the Relationship Between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it absorbs from its host star. The formula for equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity (L), the planet's albedo (A), and its orbital distance (a). The relationship is:\n\nT_eq ∝ [(1-A)/a²]^(1/4)\n\nGiven that the albedo (A) is the same for all three planets (A = 0.3) and they orbit the same star (constant L), the formula simplifies to:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1/a^(1/2) or T_eq ∝ 1/√a\n\nThis implies that the orbital distance (a) is inversely proportional to the square of the equilibrium temperature:\n\na ∝ 1/T_eq²\n\n### **2. Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Distances**\nWe are given the following temperature ratios:\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4\n*   T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3\n\nUsing the relationship from Step 1, we can find the ratios of the orbital distances:\n*   a2 / a1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2)² = (1.4)² = 1.96\n*   a3 / a2 = (T_eq2 / T_eq3)² = (2.3)² = 5.29\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet3 to Planet1 (a3 / a1), we multiply these two ratios:\n*   a3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1) = 5.29 * 1.96 ≈ 10.37\n\nSo, Planet3's orbital distance is about 10.4 times larger than Planet1's.\n\n### **3. Apply Kepler's Third Law**\nKepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) of its orbit. For the circular orbits mentioned in the problem, the semi-major axis is the orbital distance.\n\nP² ∝ a³\nThis can also be written as P ∝ a^(3/2).\n\n### **4. Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Periods**\nUsing the relationship from Kepler's Third Law and the orbital distance ratio calculated in Step 2, we can find the ratio of the orbital periods of Planet3 and Planet1 (P3 / P1):\n\nP3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2)\nP3 / P1 = (10.37)^(1.5)\n\nCalculating this value:\nP3 / P1 ≈ 33.44\n\nThus, the orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1. The information about the planet masses and the TTV method of discovery are not necessary for this specific calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
