    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as an extension of the Standard Model, incorporating higher-dimensional operators to parametrize the effects of new physics at a higher energy scale. The construction of the SMEFT Lagrangian is based on a set of fundamental principles and symmetries.\n\nThe operators in SMEFT are built from the Standard Model fields and must respect the following symmetries:\n\n*   **Lorentz and Poincare Symmetry:** The SMEFT Lagrangian is constructed to be an infinite series of local, higher-dimensional operators that obey Poincare symmetry. Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz transformations (boosts and rotations) and spacetime translations, is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime in quantum field theory. Requiring the theory to be Lorentz invariant ensures that the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers.\n\n*   **CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in quantum field theory which states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined transformation of Charge conjugation (C), Parity (P), and Time reversal (T). As SMEFT is formulated as a Lorentz-invariant local effective field theory, it must respect CPT symmetry.\n\nHowever, **CP symmetry** is not a required symmetry for all operators in SMEFT. In fact, SMEFT provides a framework for parametrizing new sources of CP violation beyond what is present in the Standard Model. There is extensive research dedicated to classifying and studying the phenomenological consequences of CP-violating operators within SMEFT.\n\nTherefore, of the options provided, Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT.\n\n<<<D>>>"
