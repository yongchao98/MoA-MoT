    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the expectation value of the operator O = 10σz + 5σx for a spin-half particle in the given state.\n\n### 1. Define the State and the Operator\n\nThe state of the spin-half particle is a linear superposition of the spin-up |↑⟩ and spin-down |↓⟩ states:\n|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩\n\nIn vector notation, with the basis where |↑⟩ =ᵀ and |↓⟩ =ᵀ, the state vector is:\n|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2]ᵀ\n\nThe operator for which we want to find the expectation value is:\nO = 10σz + 5σx\n\n### 2. Recall the Pauli Matrices\n\nThe Pauli matrices in the z-basis are defined as follows.\n*   **σz** (spin projection along the z-axis):\n    σz = [, [0, -1]]\n*   **σx** (spin projection along the x-axis):\n    σx = [,]\n\n### 3. Calculate the Expectation Value\n\nThe expectation value of an operator O for a state |ψ⟩ is given by the formula ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩.\nWe can calculate this in two ways:\n\n**Method 1: Calculate the expectation value for each part of the operator separately.**\n\nThe expectation value is linear, so we have:\n⟨O⟩ = ⟨10σz + 5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩\n\nFirst, we calculate ⟨σz⟩ = ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩:\nSince |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively (σz|↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩ and σz|↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩), the calculation is straightforward. The probability of measuring spin-up is |0.5|² = 0.25, and the probability of measuring spin-down is |(√3)/2|² = 0.75.\n⟨σz⟩ = (Probability of spin-up) × (+1) + (Probability of spin-down) × (-1)\n⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5\n\nNext, we calculate ⟨σx⟩ = ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.\nWe need to compute σx|ψ⟩:\nσx|ψ⟩ = σx (0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩)\nUsing σx|↑⟩ = |↓⟩ and σx|↓⟩ = |↑⟩, we get:\nσx|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↓⟩ + (√3)/2|↑⟩\n\nNow, we compute the inner product ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩:\n⟨ψ| = 0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓|\n⟨σx⟩ = (0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓|) * ((√3)/2|↑⟩ + 0.5|↓⟩)\n⟨σx⟩ = (0.5 * √3/2)⟨↑|↑⟩ + (0.5 * 0.5)⟨↑|↓⟩ + ((√3)/2 * √3/2)⟨↓|↑⟩ + ((√3)/2 * 0.5)⟨↓|↓⟩\nUsing the orthogonality relations (⟨↑|↓⟩ = 0) and normalization (⟨↑|↑⟩ = 1, ⟨↓|↓⟩ = 1), we get:\n⟨σx⟩ = √3/4 + 0 + 0 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2 ≈ 0.866\n\nFinally, we combine the results:\n⟨O⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (√3/2) = -5 + 2.5√3\nUsing √3 ≈ 1.732:\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732 = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67\n\n**Method 2: Use matrix mechanics for the full operator.**\n\nFirst, construct the matrix for the operator O:\nO = 10 * [, [0, -1]] + 5 * [,]\nO = [, [0, -10]] + [,]\nO = [, [5, -10]]\n\nThe state vector is |ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2]ᵀ, and its conjugate transpose is ⟨ψ| = [0.5, √3/2].\nNow, calculate ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩:\n⟨O⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [, [5, -10]] * [0.5, √3/2]ᵀ\n\nFirst, multiply the matrix and the column vector:\n[, [5, -10]] * [0.5, √3/2]ᵀ = [10*0.5 + 5*(√3/2), 5*0.5 - 10*(√3/2)]ᵀ = [5 + 2.5√3, 2.5 - 5√3]ᵀ\n\nNext, multiply the row vector by the resulting column vector:\n⟨O⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [5 + 2.5√3, 2.5 - 5√3]ᵀ\n⟨O⟩ = 0.5 * (5 + 2.5√3) + (√3/2) * (2.5 - 5√3)\n⟨O⟩ = 2.5 + 1.25√3 + 1.25√3 - (5*3)/2\n⟨O⟩ = 2.5 + 2.5√3 - 7.5\n⟨O⟩ = -5 + 2.5√3\n\nAs before, this is approximately -0.67.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe expectation value is approximately -0.67. Rounding to one decimal place, we get -0.7.\n\n<<<C>>>"
