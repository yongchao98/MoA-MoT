    "To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ and the renormalizability of the theory, we must analyze the dimensions of each component in the provided Lagrangian term.\n\nThe Lagrangian density, in 4-dimensional spacetime, must have a mass dimension of +4 for the action, $S = \\int d^4x \\mathcal{L}$, to be dimensionless.\n\nThe mass dimensions of the individual components of the interaction Lagrangian $\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$ are as follows:\n*   **Lagrangian Density ($\\mathcal{L}_{int}$)**: $[\\mathcal{L}_{int}]_M = 4$.\n*   **Fermion Fields ($\\psi, \\bar{\\psi}$)**: From the kinetic term for a Dirac field, $\\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m)\\psi$, and knowing that $[\\mathcal{L}]_M = 4$ and $[\\partial_\\mu]_M=1$, the mass dimension of a fermion field is determined to be $[\\psi]_M = [\\bar{\\psi}]_M = 3/2$.\n*   **Field Strength Tensor ($F^{\\mu\\nu}$)**: The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is proportional to $F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$. For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, the field strength tensor must have a mass dimension of $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 2$.\n*   **Sigma Tensor ($\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$)**: The term $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}=\\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_{\\mu},\\gamma_{\\nu}]$ is constructed from gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. Therefore, $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ is also dimensionless, meaning $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 0$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the mass dimension of κ:\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}]_M = [\\kappa]_M + [\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M + [\\psi]_M + [F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M$\n$4 = [\\kappa]_M + 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2$\n$4 = [\\kappa]_M + 3 + 2$\n$4 = [\\kappa]_M + 5$\n$[\\kappa]_M = -1$\n\n**Renormalizability:**\n\nA theory's renormalizability is related to the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n*   If all coupling constants have a mass dimension greater than or equal to zero, the theory is considered renormalizable (or super-renormalizable).\n*   If any coupling constant has a negative mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable. This is because, in perturbation theory, higher-order corrections would be increasingly divergent, requiring an infinite number of counter-terms and thus stripping the theory of its predictive power.\n\nSince we found that $[\\kappa]_M = -1$, the theory described by this interaction is non-renormalizable.\n\nTherefore, the mass dimension of κ is -1 and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
