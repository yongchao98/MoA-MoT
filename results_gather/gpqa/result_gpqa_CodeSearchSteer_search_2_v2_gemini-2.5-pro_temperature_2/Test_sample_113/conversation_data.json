    "### Analysis of the Reactions:\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. The nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate. For the reaction to be completed and to form the final product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, this intermediate needs to be protonated. Reagent 'A' serves as the proton source. While this reaction can be catalyzed by base, an acidic workup is a common method to protonate the alkoxide. Therefore, a strong acid like H₃O⁺ is a suitable choice for reagent A.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis reaction shows the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-C≡N) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation can be achieved under either strong acidic or strong basic conditions, typically with heating. The nitrile is first hydrolyzed to an amide, which is then further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid. Given the options, 'B' represents the catalyst for the hydrolysis in water.\n*   **HCl** is a strong acid and is a standard reagent used to catalyze the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids when heated under reflux.\n*   **CH₃COOH** (acetic acid) is a weak acid and generally not effective for this type of hydrolysis, which requires more forceful conditions.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Reagent **A** should be a proton source for the cyanohydrin formation, making **H₃O⁺** a correct choice.\n*   Reagent **B** should be a strong acid to effectively hydrolyze the nitrile, making **HCl** the correct choice.\n\nTherefore, the combination that fits both reactions is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\n<<<A>>>"
