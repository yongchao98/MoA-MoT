    "The correct answer is D. All other statements are correct. Here is a breakdown of why statement D is incorrect:\n\n*   **Statement A is correct.** Studies have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a protein can induce apoptosis by activating caspase-8, a key initiator of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. This activation occurs without altering the levels of Bcl-2, a crucial regulator of the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway. While the extrinsic pathway can subsequently trigger the intrinsic pathway, the initial mechanism of induction by ORF3a is through the extrinsic route.\n\n*   **Statement B is correct.** Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, use a -1 programmed ribosomal frameshift (-1 PRF) to synthesize the ORF1ab polyprotein from two overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b). This process requires the ribosome to pause at a \"slippery sequence\" and shift back one nucleotide, a process stimulated by a downstream RNA pseudoknot structure. Structural analyses have confirmed that the pseudoknot structures of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share the same overall conformation.\n\n*   **Statement C is correct.** Research has indicated a correlation between the efficiency of ribosomal frameshifting and the conformational plasticity of the stimulating RNA pseudoknot—its tendency to fold into alternative structures. While a simple linear correlation might be an oversimplification, the principle that frameshifting efficiency correlates with the dynamic conformational landscape rather than just mechanical stability is supported. Furthermore, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshift signals can adopt multiple conformations under tension, which is consistent with other pseudoknots that promote similar frameshifting rates.\n\n*   **Statement D is incorrect.** The nsp10 and nsp14 proteins of SARS-CoV-2 do form a heterodimeric complex, and the N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14, activated by nsp10, functions as a 3' to 5' exoribonuclease involved in a proofreading or mismatch repair mechanism. However, the statement incorrectly claims that this complex *prevents* the breakdown of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). In fact, the opposite is true. The nsp10/nsp14 complex is a nuclease that actively **degrades** or hydrolyzes dsRNA substrates. This activity is crucial for removing mismatched nucleotides during replication to ensure genome fidelity.\n\n<<<D>>>"
