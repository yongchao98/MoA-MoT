    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of peaks in each chromatogram.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction I**\n\n1.  **Reactant and Reagent:** The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone that possesses a single chiral center at the C5 position with (S) configuration. It is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, which reduces the ketone group at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This is followed by an acidic workup.\n\n2.  **Product Formation and Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new chiral center. Since the starting molecule is enantiomerically pure and contains a pre-existing chiral center at C5, the hydride can attack the carbonyl from two different faces. This leads to the formation of two products that are diastereomers of each other. The stereochemistry at C5 remains unchanged. The two products are (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n\n*   **Product 1:** (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Product 2:** (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n\nThese two molecules are diastereomers.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction II**\n\n1.  **Reactant and Reagent:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone), which is an achiral diketone. It is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBHâ‚„), which reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, followed by an acidic workup.\n\n2.  **Product Formation and Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the two ketone groups at C2 and C4 creates two new chiral centers. The resulting product is pentane-2,4-diol. We must consider all possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n    The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are enantiomers of each other. The reduction of an achiral starting material with an achiral reagent results in a racemic mixture of these enantiomers.\n    The (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) forms are the same molecule, which possesses a plane of symmetry and is therefore a meso compound.\n\n    Thus, Reaction II produces three stereoisomers:\n*   **Product 3:** (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Product 4:** (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Product 5:** (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso compound)\n\n### **Chromatographic Analysis of the Combined Products**\n\nThe mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers from the two reactions.\n\n1.  **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties, including polarity, and can be separated.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties (in an achiral environment) and cannot be separated; they elute together as a single peak.\n\n    Let's analyze the combined products:\n    *   Products 1 and 2 ((3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) are diastereomers and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n    *   Products 3 and 4 ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) are enantiomers and will co-elute, producing **one peak**.\n    *   Product 5 (the meso compound) is a diastereomer of products 3 and 4, so it will have a different retention time, resulting in a **separate peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (methoxy-alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (diols), ensuring they are resolved from each other.\n\n    Therefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC will be 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (from Rxn II enantiomers) + 1 (from Rxn II meso) = **4 peaks**.\n\n2.  **Chiral Stationary Phase HPLC (Chiral Column):**\n    *   This technique is designed to separate stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n    *   A chiral column can distinguish between all five stereoisomers produced because they are all structurally unique.\n\n    The five distinct stereoisomers are:\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 1)\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 2)\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3)\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4)\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso) (Peak 5)\n\n    Each of these compounds will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, resulting in distinct retention times. Therefore, the chromatogram will show **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>"
