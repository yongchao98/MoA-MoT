    "To determine the minimum energy of the system, we must calculate the total electrostatic potential energy. The system consists of two components for the energy calculation: the interaction between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere, and the interactions among the 12 charges on the sphere themselves.\n\nThe total potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies of all pairs of charges. The potential energy between two point charges, q₁ and q₂, separated by a distance r, is given by U = k * (q₁ * q₂) / r.\n\n**System Parameters:**\n*   Number of identical particles: 13\n*   Charge of each particle (q): 2e, where e is the elementary charge.\n*   Elementary charge (e): 1.602176634 x 10⁻¹⁹ C.\n*   Charge q: 2 * 1.602176634 x 10⁻¹⁹ C = 3.204353268 x 10⁻¹⁹ C.\n*   Coulomb's constant (k): 8.9875517923 x 10⁹ N·m²/C².\n*   Distance of the 12 particles from point P (R): 2 m.\n\n**Part 1: Energy of Interaction with the Central Charge**\n\nThe first part is the potential energy from the interaction between the central charge (q_c) and the 12 charges (q_s) on the sphere. Since each of the 12 charges is at the same distance R from the central charge, this energy (U_cs) is:\n\nU_cs = 12 * (k * q_c * q_s / R) = 12 * k * q² / R\n\nSubstituting the values:\nU_cs = 12 * (8.9875517923 x 10⁹ * (3.204353268 x 10⁻¹⁹)²) / 2\nU_cs = 6 * (9.2285805 x 10⁻²⁸) J = 5.5371483 x 10⁻²⁷ J\n\n**Part 2: Energy of Interactions between the 12 Charges on the Sphere**\n\nTo achieve minimum energy, the 12 charges on the surface of the sphere will arrange themselves to maximize their mutual separation. This is a well-known problem in physics called the \"Thomson problem\". For N=12, the configuration of minimum energy corresponds to the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n\nThe potential energy of this configuration (U_ss) can be expressed as:\n\nU_ss = (k * q² / R) * E₁₂\n\nWhere E₁₂ is a dimensionless constant representing the sum of inverse distances for the icosahedral arrangement on a unit sphere. The distances between vertices of an icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius R are:\n*   30 pairs of adjacent vertices separated by a distance `a`.\n*   30 pairs separated by a distance `aφ` (where φ is the golden ratio, ≈ 1.618).\n*   6 pairs of antipodal vertices separated by the diameter `2R`.\n\nThe exact value of E₁₂ for the icosahedral configuration is given by the formula:\n\nE₁₂ = 15φ * √(φ+2) + 3 ≈ 49.16637\n\nNow we can calculate U_ss:\nU_ss = ( (8.9875517923 x 10⁹ * (3.204353268 x 10⁻¹⁹)²) / 2 ) * 49.16637\nU_ss = (4.61429025 x 10⁻²⁸) * 49.16637 J\nU_ss ≈ 2.26881 x 10⁻²⁶ J\n\n**Total Minimum Energy**\n\nThe total minimum energy of the system is the sum of these two parts:\n\nU_total = U_cs + U_ss\nU_total = 5.5371483 x 10⁻²⁷ J + 2.26881 x 10⁻²⁶ J\nU_total = 0.55371483 x 10⁻²⁶ J + 2.26881 x 10⁻²⁶ J\nU_total ≈ 2.82252 x 10⁻²⁶ J\n\nWhen comparing this result with the given options:\n*   A) 7.056 x 10⁻²⁷ J\n*   B) 2.822 x 10⁻²⁶ J\n*   C) 5.645 x 10⁻²⁶ J\n*   D) 122.330 J\n\nThe calculated value of 2.82252 x 10⁻²⁶ J is extremely close to option B. The minor difference (about 0.018%) is likely due to the precision of the physical constants used in the problem's formulation. Truncating the calculated result to three decimal places gives 2.822 x 10⁻²⁶ J.\n\n<<<B>>>"
