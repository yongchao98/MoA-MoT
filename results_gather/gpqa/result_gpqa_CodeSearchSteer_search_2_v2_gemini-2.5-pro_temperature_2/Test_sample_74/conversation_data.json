  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein.

    "To determine the reason for the failed protein expression, the provided DNA sequence must be analyzed. The analysis involves translating the DNA sequence into its corresponding amino acid sequence and identifying any anomalies that would prevent the synthesis of the full-length protein.\n\nThe provided DNA sequence is:\n5'-**ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC**AAATGACTCTGGAA...-3'\n\n1.  **Analyze the N-terminus and the antigenic tag**: The plan was to create a recombinant protein with an N-terminal influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag. The standard amino acid sequence for an HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. The DNA is translated starting from the first `ATG` codon, which serves as the start signal and codes for Methionine (M).\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (M)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n    *   `GTT` -> Valine (V)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GCC` -> Alanine (A)\n    The translated sequence is M-YPYDVPDYA. This corresponds to the start codon followed by a correct HA tag sequence. Therefore, there is no missense mutation in the antigenic determinant. This rules out option A.\n\n2.  **Continue translation of the sequence**: Following the HA tag sequence, the translation proceeds to the next codons.\n    *   `AAA` -> Lysine (K)\n    *   `TGA` -> **STOP**\n    The sequence contains a `TGA` codon immediately after the codon for Lysine.\n\n3.  **Identify the effect of the `TGA` codon**: In the standard genetic code, `TGA`, `TAA`, and `UAG` are stop codons. When a ribosome encounters a stop codon during translation, it terminates protein synthesis and releases the nascent polypeptide chain. In this case, the ribosome would synthesize a very short peptide (M-YPYDVPDYA-K) and then stop. The full GADD45G protein would not be made. This directly explains why the protein could not be overexpressed.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the given options**:\n    *   **A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation**: This is incorrect. The DNA sequence for the HA tag is correct.\n    *   **B) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse**: The lack of a corresponding tRNA is how stop codons function to terminate translation. This is a feature of the genetic code, not a species-specific error. Furthermore, the codon in question is `TGA`, not `UAA`.\n    *   **C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain**: While linkers can be important, the presence of a premature stop codon is a much more direct and definitive cause for the lack of a full-length protein. Synthesis is being halted, not completed and then degraded.\n    *   **D) The ribosome terminated the translation early**: This is correct. The presence of the `TGA` stop codon immediately following the tag sequence caused premature termination of translation.\n\nThe annoying realization is that an inadvertent stop codon was introduced into the genetic construct, preventing the synthesis of the desired protein.\n\n<<<D>>>"
