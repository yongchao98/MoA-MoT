    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Normalize the initial state |α>**\n\nThe state `|α>` is given as proportional to `(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`. We can write this as:\n`|α> = C * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n\nTo normalize the state, the inner product `<α|α>` must be equal to 1. The bra `<α|` is:\n`<α| = C* * [(1-i)<up| + (2+i)<down|]`\n\nNow, we calculate the inner product:\n`<α|α> = |C|² * [< (1-i)<up| + (2+i)<down| >] * [<(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> >]`\n`<α|α> = |C|² * [ (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i) ]`\n`<α|α> = |C|² * [ (1² - i²) + (2² - i²) ]`\n`<α|α> = |C|² * [ (1 - (-1)) + (4 - (-1)) ]`\n`<α|α> = |C|² * [ 2 + 5 ] = 7|C|²`\n\nFor normalization, `<α|α> = 1`, so `7|C|² = 1`, which gives `|C|² = 1/7`. We can choose `C = 1/√7`.\n\nThe normalized state is:\n`|α> = (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n\nIn vector notation, where `|up> = [1, 0]ᵀ` and `|down> = [0, 1]ᵀ`, the state is:\n`|α> = (1/√7) * [1+i, 2-i]ᵀ`\n\n**2. Determine the matrix representation of the operator A**\n\nThe problem states that the matrix elements are `Aij = ħ/2` if `i ≠ j` and `0` otherwise. For a 2-state system (spin up and down), this is a 2x2 matrix:\n`A₁₁ = 0`\n`A₂₂ = 0`\n`A₁₂ = ħ/2`\n`A₂₁ = ħ/2`\n\nSo the matrix A is:\n`A = [ 0, ħ/2; ħ/2, 0 ] = (ħ/2) * [ 0, 1; 1, 0 ]`\nThis matrix is `(ħ/2)` times the Pauli matrix σₓ.\n\n**3. Find the eigenvalues and eigenstates of A**\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([ -λ, ħ/2; ħ/2, -λ ]) = 0`\n`(-λ)(-λ) - (ħ/2)(ħ/2) = 0`\n`λ² - (ħ/2)² = 0`\n`λ² = (ħ/2)²`\nThe eigenvalues are `λ₁ = +ħ/2` and `λ₂ = -ħ/2`.\n\nNow we find the corresponding normalized eigenstates:\n\n*   For `λ₁ = +ħ/2`:\n    `(ħ/2) * [ 0, 1; 1, 0 ] * [a, b]ᵀ = (ħ/2) * [a, b]ᵀ`\n    `[b, a]ᵀ = [a, b]ᵀ`\n    This implies `b = a`. The eigenvector is proportional to `[1, 1]ᵀ`. Normalizing it gives the eigenstate:\n    `|v₁> = (1/√2) * [1, 1]ᵀ = (1/√2) * (|up> + |down>)`\n\n*   For `λ₂ = -ħ/2`:\n    `(ħ/2) * [ 0, 1; 1, 0 ] * [a, b]ᵀ = -(ħ/2) * [a, b]ᵀ`\n    `[b, a]ᵀ = [-a, -b]ᵀ`\n    This implies `b = -a`. The eigenvector is proportional to `[1, -1]ᵀ`. Normalizing it gives the eigenstate:\n    `|v₂> = (1/√2) * [1, -1]ᵀ = (1/√2) * (|up> - |down>)`\n\n**4. Calculate the probabilities**\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue `λᵢ` is given by `P(λᵢ) = |<vᵢ|α>|²`.\n\n*   Probability `P₁` of measuring `λ₁ = +ħ/2`:\n    `<v₁| = (1/√2) * (<up| + <down|)`\n    `<v₁|α> = (1/√2) * (<up| + <down|) * (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n    `<v₁|α> = (1/√14) * [1*(1+i) + 1*(2-i)]`\n    `<v₁|α> = (1/√14) * (1 + i + 2 - i) = 3/√14`\n    `P₁ = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.6428`\n\n*   Probability `P₂` of measuring `λ₂ = -ħ/2`:\n    `<v₂| = (1/√2) * (<up| - <down|)`\n    `<v₂|α> = (1/√2) * (<up| - <down|) * (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n    `<v₂|α> = (1/√14) * [1*(1+i) - 1*(2-i)]`\n    `<v₂|α> = (1/√14) * (1 + i - 2 + i) = (-1 + 2i)/√14`\n    `P₂ = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1 + 4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571`\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n**5. Find the average value of the operator**\n\nThe average (or expectation) value of the operator A is `<A> = <α|A|α>`. It can also be calculated using the eigenvalues and their probabilities: `<A> = P₁λ₁ + P₂λ₂`.\n\n`<A> = (9/14)(+ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2)`\n`<A> = (ħ/28) * (9 - 5)`\n`<A> = 4ħ/28 = ħ/7`\n\nComparing our results:\n*   Probabilities: ≈ 0.64 and ≈ 0.36\n*   Average value: `ħ/7`\n\nThese results match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
