    "To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of the electron, we can use the principles of quantum mechanics.\n\nFirst, we apply Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp). The principle states:\n\nΔx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n\nTo find the *minimum* uncertainty, we can use the equality:\n\nΔp = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n\nGiven the uncertainty in the electron's location, Δx = 0.1 nm = 1 x 10⁻¹⁰ m, we can calculate the minimum uncertainty in its momentum:\n\nΔp = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 ⋅ 1 x 10⁻¹⁰ m) ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\nNext, we need to relate the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) to the uncertainty in energy (ΔE). For a particle, the relationship between a small change in momentum and the resulting change in energy is given by:\n\nΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp\n\nHere, v is the velocity of the particle. This relationship is derived from the relativistic energy-momentum equation and holds true where `v` represents the group velocity of the electron's wave packet, which is equal to its particle velocity.\n\nNow, we can substitute the known values into this equation:\n- v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s\n- Δp ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\nΔE ≈ (2 x 10⁸ m/s) ⋅ (5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s)\nΔE ≈ 10.54 x 10⁻¹⁷ J\nΔE ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nThis calculated value is approximately 10⁻¹⁶ J, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
