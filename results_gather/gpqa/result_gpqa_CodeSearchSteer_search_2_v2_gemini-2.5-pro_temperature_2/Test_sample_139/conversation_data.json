    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B**: The prompt states that B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\". This is 3.85 °C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is a very strong match, so we can confidently identify **B as D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Identify Precipitate G**: G is a precipitate that, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This indicates that G is a deuterated compound that decomposes upon heating to yield heavy water. A likely candidate is a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)ₓ, which would decompose into a metal oxide and D₂O.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X, Liquid Y, and Gas W**: The problem describes a violent reaction between substance X and liquid Y, producing a precipitate (G) and a gas (W).\n    *   **Analog of X**: A close analog of X is a common reagent in organic chemistry. This points towards powerful reducing agents like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) or Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). Their deuterated versions, LiAlD₄ and NaBD₄, fit the description of \"incorporating a heavier isotope\".\n    *   **Reaction with Keto Acid**: A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) is reduced by these agents to a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which contains 2 oxygen atoms. This matches the clue perfectly. Therefore, X is a complex metal deuteride.\n    *   **The Violent Reaction**: Let's hypothesize the reaction. To produce G (a metal deuteroxide) which then yields B (D₂O), the source of deuterium must be both from X and the liquid Y. So, let's assume **X = LiAlD₄** and **Y = D₂O**.\n    *   The reaction `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O` would be violent and produce LiOD (soluble), Al(OD)₃ (precipitate), and D₂ (gas). Let's check if this fits all the clues.\n    *   **Precipitate G**: Aluminum deuteroxide, **Al(OD)₃**, is a gelatinous precipitate, which is consistent with the reaction of LiAlH₄ with water forming Al(OH)₃. This is a better fit for a precipitate than B(OD)₃ from the reaction of NaBD₄, as boric acid is more soluble. Heating G, 2Al(OD)₃, would produce Al₂O₃ and 3D₂O (substance B), which is consistent.\n    *   **Gas W**: The gas produced is Deuterium, **D₂**. A deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This perfectly matches the description of gas W, \"whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n\nBased on this deduction, all pieces of the puzzle fit together:\n*   **Substance X**: LiAlD₄ (Lithium aluminum deuteride)\n*   **Liquid Y**: D₂O (Heavy water)\n*   **Gas W**: D₂ (Deuterium gas)\n*   **Precipitate G**: Al(OD)₃ (Aluminum deuteroxide)\n*   **Substance B**: D₂O (Heavy water)\n\n### Calculation\n\nThe final question is: \"Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n\n1.  **Substance X** is **LiAlD₄**.\n2.  The **elements** present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n3.  The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n4.  The **heaviest element** is Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n5.  We will use integer masses for the isotopes involved: Mass of Deuterium (D or ²H) = 2 amu; Mass of the most stable isotope of Aluminum (²⁷Al) = 27 amu.\n6.  The prompt asks for the sum of the cumulative masses. We must account for all atoms of these elements in the formula LiAlD₄.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium)**: There are 4 deuterium atoms.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 amu = 8 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum)**: There is 1 aluminum atom.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 amu = 27 amu.\n7.  **Final Sum**: The cumulative mass of the lightest and heaviest elements is the sum of these two values.\n    *   Total = 8 amu + 27 amu = 35 amu.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
