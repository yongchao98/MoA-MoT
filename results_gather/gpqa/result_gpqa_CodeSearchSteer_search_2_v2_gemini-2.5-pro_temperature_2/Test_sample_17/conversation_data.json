    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.\n\nThe standard notation for elemental abundance, [X/Y], is defined as:\n[X/Y] = log₁₀(Nₓ/Nᵧ)ₛₜₐᵣ - log₁₀(Nₓ/Nᵧ)ₛᵤₙ\nwhere Nₓ and Nᵧ are the number densities of elements X and Y, respectively.\n\nThis can also be expressed in terms of abundances relative to Hydrogen (H):\n[X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H]\n\nWe are asked to find the ratio of silicon atoms, which corresponds to the ratio of the silicon number abundance in Star_1 to that in Star_2, i.e., (n_Si/n_H)₁ / (n_Si/n_H)₂.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance ratio for Star_1 ([Si/H]₁).**\n\nWe are given:\n*   [Fe/H]₁ = 0 dex\n*   [Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3 dex\n\nUsing the relationship [X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H], we can write:\n[Si/Fe]₁ = [Si/H]₁ - [Fe/H]₁\n0.3 = [Si/H]₁ - 0\nTherefore, [Si/H]₁ = 0.3 dex.\n\nBy definition, [Si/H]₁ = log₁₀((n_Si/n_H)₁) - log₁₀((n_Si/n_H)ₛᵤₙ).\nSo, log₁₀((n_Si/n_H)₁) = 0.3 + log₁₀((n_Si/n_H)ₛᵤₙ).\nThis gives us the abundance of silicon in Star_1 relative to the Sun:\n(n_Si/n_H)₁ = 10⁰·³ × (n_Si/n_H)ₛᵤₙ.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance ratio for Star_2 ([Si/H]₂).**\n\nWe are given:\n*   [Mg/H]₂ = 0 dex\n*   [Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3 dex\n\nUsing the same relationship:\n[Mg/Si]₂ = [Mg/H]₂ - [Si/H]₂\n0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]₂\nTherefore, [Si/H]₂ = -0.3 dex.\n\nBy definition, [Si/H]₂ = log₁₀((n_Si/n_H)₂) - log₁₀((n_Si/n_H)ₛᵤₙ).\nSo, log₁₀((n_Si/n_H)₂) = -0.3 + log₁₀((n_Si/n_H)ₛᵤₙ).\nThis gives us the abundance of silicon in Star_2 relative to the Sun:\n(n_Si/n_H)₂ = 10⁻⁰·³ × (n_Si/n_H)ₛᵤₙ.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2.**\n\nWe need to compute the ratio (n_Si/n_H)₁ / (n_Si/n_H)₂:\nRatio = [10⁰·³ × (n_Si/n_H)ₛᵤₙ] / [10⁻⁰·³ × (n_Si/n_H)ₛᵤₙ]\n\nThe solar silicon abundance term (n_Si/n_H)ₛᵤₙ cancels out:\nRatio = 10⁰·³ / 10⁻⁰·³\nRatio = 10^(0.3 - (-0.3))\nRatio = 10⁰·⁶\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\nRatio ≈ 3.981\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9.\n\nThe information about the masses of the stars and the specific solar abundances of iron and magnesium is not required for the final calculation of the ratio.\n\n<<<D>>>"
