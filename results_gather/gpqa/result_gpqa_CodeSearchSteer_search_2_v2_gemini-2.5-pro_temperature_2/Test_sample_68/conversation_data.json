    "Here is the step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physics\n\nThe problem requires us to determine the minimum spatial resolution a detector needs to observe at least 30% of the decays of a moving particle. This involves concepts from special relativity and particle decay statistics.\n\n*   **Time Dilation:** An unstable particle moving at relativistic speeds will have a longer lifetime in the laboratory's frame of reference compared to its own rest frame.\n*   **Decay Length:** Due to its extended lifetime and high speed, the particle will travel a certain distance in the lab before it decays. This average distance is known as the mean decay length.\n*   **Exponential Decay:** Particle decay is a random, exponential process. The probability that a particle survives for a time *t* is given by an exponential function. To \"observe\" a decay, the detector's resolution must be smaller than the particle's travel distance. The problem is interpreted as finding the resolution `d` such that at least 30% of particles travel a distance greater than `d` before decaying.\n\n### 2. Calculation Steps\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n\nThe Lorentz factor relates the total energy (E) of a particle to its rest mass (m₀).\n\n*   Given: E = 27 GeV, m₀ = 3.41 GeV/c²\n*   Formula: E = γ * m₀ * c²\n*   Calculation: γ = E / m₀ = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV = **7.918**\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Particle's Velocity (v)**\n\nThe velocity is calculated from the Lorentz factor. It's often more convenient to calculate the product βγ, where β = v/c.\n\n*   Formula: pc = √[E² - (m₀c²)²] where p is the momentum.\n*   Calculation: pc = √[27² - 3.41²] = √[729 - 11.6281] = √[717.3719] ≈ **26.78 GeV**\n*   From p = γm₀v = γm₀(βc), we get βγ = p / m₀ = (pc) / (m₀c²)\n*   Calculation: βγ = 26.78 GeV / 3.41 GeV = **7.853**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Mean Decay Length in the Lab Frame (λ)**\n\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying, taking time dilation into account.\n\n*   Given: Proper lifetime τ₀ = 8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s\n*   Formula for mean lab lifetime: τ = γτ₀.\n*   Formula for mean decay length: λ = vτ = v(γτ₀) = (βc)γτ₀ = (βγ) * c * τ₀.\n*   Calculation: λ = 7.853 * (3 × 10⁸ m/s) * (8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s) ≈ **1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Minimum Resolution**\n\nThe decay length follows an exponential distribution. The probability that a particle travels a distance *x* or more before decaying is P(x) = exp(-x/λ). To observe at least 30% of the decays, we need to find the resolution `d` such that 30% of particles have a decay length greater than `d`.\n\n*   Condition: exp(-d/λ) = 0.3\n*   Solving for d: d = -λ * ln(0.3)\n*   Calculation: d = -(1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) * ln(0.3) ≈ (1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) * 1.204 ≈ **2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m**\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated minimum resolution required is approximately 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m. Comparing this value with the given multiple-choice options:\n\n*   A) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n*   B) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n*   C) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n*   D) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n\nThe value 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m is closest in magnitude and value to option B. The slight difference may arise from rounding in the problem's given values or options. If we assume the resolution from option B, `d = 2.08 * 1e-6 m`, the fraction of observed decays would be exp(-2.08/1.885) ≈ exp(-1.10) ≈ 0.33, or 33%, which satisfies the condition of observing \"at least 30%\".\n\n<<<B>>>"
