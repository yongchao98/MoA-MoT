    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Define the Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus of mass M is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is `M*c² = 300 GeV`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   `m1` is the more massive fragment: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the fragment rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   The kinetic energies of the fragments are `T1` and `T2`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\n\nFirst, we determine the rest-mass energies for `m1` and `m2`.\n\n*   The total rest-mass energy of the fragments is:\n    `(m1 + m2) * c² = 0.99 * M * c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We have the relation `m1 = 2 * m2`, which implies `m1*c² = 2 * m2*c²`.\n*   Substituting this into the sum:\n    `2 * m2*c² + m2*c² = 297 GeV`\n    `3 * m2*c² = 297 GeV`\n    `m2*c² = 99 GeV`\n*   Therefore, the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is:\n    `m1*c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Determine the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe total kinetic energy `(Q)` released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy, due to the conservation of energy.\n\n*   `Q = T1 + T2 = M*c² - (m1*c² + m2*c²) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2*m)`, where `p` is momentum.\n\n*   By the conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n*   Therefore, we can write the kinetic energies as:\n    `T1_classical = p² / (2 * m1)`\n    `T2_classical = p² / (2 * m2)`\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses:\n    `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1 / 2`.\n    So, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`:\n    `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T1\n\nFor the relativistic calculation, the relationship between total energy `(E)`, momentum `(p)`, and rest-mass `(m)` is `E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²`. The kinetic energy is `T = E - m*c²`.\n\n*   From the energy-momentum relation, `(p*c)² = E² - (m*c²)²`.\n*   Also, `E = T + m*c²`, so `(p*c)² = (T + m*c²)² - (m*c²)² = T² + 2*T*m*c²`.\n*   Again, momentum is conserved: `|p1| = |p2|`, which means `(p1*c)² = (p2*c)²`.\n*   Therefore:\n    `T1² + 2 * T1 * (m1*c²) = T2² + 2 * T2 * (m2*c²)`.\n*   We substitute `T2 = 3 - T1`, `m1*c² = 198 GeV`, and `m2*c² = 99 GeV`:\n    `T1² + 2 * T1 * (198) = (3 - T1)² + 2 * (3 - T1) * (99)`\n    `T1² + 396 * T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1²) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n    `T1² + 396 * T1 = 603 - 204*T1 + T1²`\n*   The `T1²` terms cancel out:\n    `396 * T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n    `600 * T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation for T1 is:\n\n*   Difference = `T1 - T1_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\nFinally, we convert this difference to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
