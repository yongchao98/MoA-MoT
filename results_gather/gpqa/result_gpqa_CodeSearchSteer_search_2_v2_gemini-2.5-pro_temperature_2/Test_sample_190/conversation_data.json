    "The four-step synthesis transforms 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one into the final product, Product 4. Let's analyze each step of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the Alcohol**\nThe starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, is first treated with sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, which deprotonates the most acidic proton—the one on the hydroxyl group of the alcohol. This creates a nucleophilic alkoxide. This alkoxide then reacts with benzyl bromide (BnBr) in a Williamson ether synthesis. The result, **Product 1**, is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. In this step, the alcohol is converted to a benzyl ether, which serves as a protecting group.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of a Tosylhydrazone**\nProduct 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also known as tosyl hydrazide) and a catalytic amount of acid. The ketone functional group condenses with the hydrazide to form **Product 2**, which is a tosylhydrazone: N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Deoxygenation via the Shapiro Reaction**\nThe tosylhydrazone (Product 2) is then subjected to the Shapiro reaction. Treatment with two equivalents of a strong base, n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), at low temperature results in the formation of a dianion. This intermediate collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas and the tosyl group, to create a vinyllithium species. An aqueous workup with ammonium chloride then quenches this intermediate, protonating it to form an alkene. This reaction effectively removes the original ketone, replacing it with a carbon-carbon double bond. **Product 3** is therefore 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\nFinally, Product 3 is stirred with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂). This step involves catalytic hydrogenation, which has two effects:\n1.  **Alkene Reduction**: Both carbon-carbon double bonds—the one in the cyclohexene ring and the one in the isopropenyl side chain—are reduced to single bonds. This converts the cyclohexene ring to a cyclohexane ring and the isopropenyl group to an isopropyl group.\n2.  **Hydrogenolysis of the Benzyl Ether**: The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved by the H₂/Pd-C reagent, a process called hydrogenolysis. This regenerates the primary alcohol and produces toluene as a byproduct.\n\nCombining these transformations, the final structure, **Product 4**, has an isopropyl group at position 5 and a hydroxymethyl group at position 3 of a cyclohexane ring. Therefore, Product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the correct structure for Product 4 corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
