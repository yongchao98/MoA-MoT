    "To determine the correct transition route and probability for the decay of a hydrogen atom from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via two dipole transitions, we must first analyze the allowed transitions based on the electric dipole selection rules and then consider the probabilities of the possible decay paths.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Transition Route\n\nThe decay occurs in two steps, involving an intermediate state. The selection rules for electric dipole transitions are:\n*   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n\n**First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n\nThe initial state is $|n=3, l=0, m=0\\rangle$. Applying the selection rules:\n*   Since the initial orbital angular momentum is $l=0$, the final state must have $l'=1$ (as $\\Delta l = +1$ is the only possibility).\n*   Since the initial magnetic quantum number is $m=0$, the final state can have $m' = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   The options provided suggest the intermediate principal quantum number is $n'=2$.\n\nThus, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n**Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\nNow, we check if the possible intermediate states can transition to the final state $|n=1, l=0, m=0\\rangle$:\n*   From $|2,1,0\\rangle$: $\\Delta l = 0-1 = -1$ and $\\Delta m = 0-0 = 0$. This transition is allowed.\n*   From $|2,1,1\\rangle$: $\\Delta l = 0-1 = -1$ and $\\Delta m = 0-1 = -1$. This transition is allowed.\n*   From $|2,1,-1\\rangle$: $\\Delta l = 0-1 = -1$ and $\\Delta m = 0 - (-1) = +1$. This transition is allowed.\n\nAll the routes listed in the options ($|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, and $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$) are valid according to the selection rules. The distinguishing factor is the associated probability.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the Probability\n\nThe question asks for the probability corresponding to a specific transition route. This is determined by the branching ratio for that specific path in the cascade decay.\n\n*   **Step 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$**\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (a 3s orbital) is spherically symmetric. In a spontaneous decay, there is no preferred direction. Therefore, the atom is equally likely to transition to any of the three allowed $m'$ substates of the $l'=1$ level. The three possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. The probability of populating any one of these specific states is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Step 2: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    Once the atom is in one of the intermediate $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (a 2p orbital), it will decay to a lower energy state. The only state with lower energy that satisfies the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the 1s ground state). Therefore, given that the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the probability of it transitioning to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is 1.\n\n**Conclusion on Probability**\n\nThe overall probability of a specific cascade, for example, $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n$P(\\text{route}) = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n\n$P(\\text{route}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nThis reasoning applies to all three possible routes involving the intermediate $n=2$ level. Each specific route has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$  and $\\frac{2}{3}$\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\nand $\\frac{1}{4}$\n\nOption B provides both a valid transition route and the correct corresponding probability.\n\n<<<B>>>"
