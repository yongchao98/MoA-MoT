    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can use the principles of planetary science, specifically the formula for equilibrium temperature and Kepler's Third Law.\n\n### Equilibrium Temperature\n\nA planet's equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is the theoretical temperature it would have if it were a perfect black body, heated only by its parent star. It is determined by the balance between the energy absorbed from the star and the energy radiated back into space. The formula is related to the star's properties and the planet's distance from the star. The key relationship for this problem is how the equilibrium temperature depends on the semi-major axis (a) of the planet's orbit. For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-major axis is equal to the orbital radius.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance:\n\n`T_eq ∝ (1/a)^(1/2)`\n\n### Kepler's Third Law\n\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) of its orbit. For planets orbiting the same star, this can be written as:\n\n`P² ∝ a³`\n\nFrom this, we can express the semi-major axis in terms of the orbital period:\n\n`a ∝ P^(2/3)`\n\n### Calculation\n\nWe want to find the ratio T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2).\n\nFirst, let's establish the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital period. By substituting the relationship from Kepler's Third Law into the equilibrium temperature relation, we get:\n\n`T_eq ∝ (1 / P^(2/3))^(1/2)`\n`T_eq ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)`\n\nThis shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\nNow, we can set up the ratio for Planet_4 and Planet_2:\n\n`T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)`\n\nThe problem states that the orbital periods of the five planets are in a ratio of 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5. Therefore, the ratio of the periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4 is:\n\n`P_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5`\n\nNow, substitute this into our temperature ratio equation:\n\n`T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`\n\nTo simplify the calculation:\n\n`2 / 3.5 = 2 / (7/2) = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714`\n\nSo, the final calculation is:\n\n`Ratio = (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.8298`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the ratio is approximately 0.83.\n\nThe problem states that the planets have the same albedo, which simplifies the calculation, as the albedo terms cancel out when taking the ratio. The mention of the TTV (Transit Timing Variation) method is background information on how such resonant systems are often detected and does not affect the calculation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
