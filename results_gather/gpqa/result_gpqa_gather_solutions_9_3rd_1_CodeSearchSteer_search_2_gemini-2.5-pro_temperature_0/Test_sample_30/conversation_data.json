The methyl group (-CH₃) is an *ortho, para*-director. In multi-step synthesis problems, it is conventional to assume the major product is carried forward. Due to less steric hindrance at the para position compared to the ortho positions, the major product is p-nitrotoluene.\n*   **Conclusion:** Product 1 is **p-nitrotoluene** (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2.**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (p-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an oxidation reaction of the benzylic methyl group. The key to determining the product is to consider the next reaction step. Step 3 is a reaction with acetone and base, which is a classic Claisen-Schmidt condensation. This reaction requires an aldehyde as one of the reactants. Therefore, the most logical and intended pathway is the oxidation of the methyl group to an aldehyde, not all the way to a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion:** Product 2 is **p-nitrobenzaldehyde** (4-nitrobenzaldehyde).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3.**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, known as the **Claisen-Schmidt condensation**. The base (NaOH) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from acetone to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde (which has no α-hydrogens and cannot self-condense). The resulting aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loss of H₂O) to form a highly stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone. The *trans* (E) isomer is the major product due to its greater thermodynamic stability.\n*   **Conclusion:** Product 3 is **(E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the molecular symmetry group of Product 3.**\n*   **Structure:** The final product is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. Its structure is `O₂N-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** To determine the point group, we must identify the symmetry elements present in the molecule.\n    *   The molecule has an extensive conjugated π-system (nitro group, benzene ring, C=C double bond, C=O double bond). To maximize orbital overlap, the main framework of the molecule is essentially **planar**.\n    *   **Identity (E):** All molecules possess this element.\n    *   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** The plane containing the planar framework of the molecule is a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Proper Axis of Rotation (Cₙ, n>1):** There are no axes of rotation. The molecule is not symmetrical end-to-end; one end has a nitro group, and the other has an acetyl group. Therefore, there is no C₂ axis.\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion.\n*   **Point Group:** A molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe molecular symmetry group of product 3 is Cs. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Toluene is treated with a mixture of nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a classic electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically the nitration of toluene. The methyl group (-CH₃) is an ortho, para-directing group. Due to steric hindrance at the ortho positions, the major product is the para-substituted isomer. In a multi-step synthesis problem, it is standard to assume the major product is carried forward.\n*   **Conclusion:** Product 1 is **p-nitrotoluene** (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (p-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an oxidation of the benzylic methyl group. The key is to determine the final oxidation state. The subsequent reaction (Step 3) involves acetone and a base, which is a characteristic Claisen-Schmidt condensation. This reaction requires an aldehyde as one of the starting materials. Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that the methyl group is oxidized to an aldehyde, not all the way to a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion:** Product 2 is **p-nitrobenzaldehyde** (4-nitrobenzaldehyde).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. The base removes an acidic α-hydrogen from acetone to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde (which has no α-hydrogens and cannot self-condense). The resulting aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration to form a highly stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone. The trans (E) isomer is the major product due to greater thermodynamic stability.\n*   **Conclusion:** Product 3 is **(E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the molecular symmetry group of Product 3**\n*   **Molecule:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n*   **Structure:** O₂N-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** To determine the point group, we must identify the symmetry elements present in the molecule.\n    *   **Planarity:** The molecule has an extensive conjugated π-system (nitro group, benzene ring, C=C double bond, C=O double bond).

A 180° rotation does not result in an identical molecule because the two ends are different (a nitro group versus an acetyl group).\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion.\n*   **Point Group Assignment:** A molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe chemical analysis consistently leads to (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one as the final product.

The methyl group (-CH₃) is an *ortho, para*-director. In multi-step synthesis problems, it is conventional to assume the major product is carried forward. Due to less steric hindrance at the para position compared to the ortho positions, the major product is p-nitrotoluene.\n*   **Conclusion:** Product 1 is **p-nitrotoluene** (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2.**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (p-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an oxidation reaction of the benzylic methyl group. The key to determining the product is to consider the next reaction step. Step 3 is a reaction with acetone and base, which is a classic Claisen-Schmidt condensation. This reaction requires an aldehyde as one of the reactants. Therefore, the most logical and intended pathway is the oxidation of the methyl group to an aldehyde, not all the way to a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion:** Product 2 is **p-nitrobenzaldehyde** (4-nitrobenzaldehyde).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3.**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, known as the **Claisen-Schmidt condensation**. The base (NaOH) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from acetone to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde (which has no α-hydrogens and cannot self-condense). The resulting aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loss of H₂O) to form a highly stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone. The *trans* (E) isomer is the major product due to its greater thermodynamic stability.\n*   **Conclusion:** Product 3 is **(E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the molecular symmetry group of Product 3.**\n*   **Structure:** The final product is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. Its structure is `O₂N-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** To determine the point group, we must identify the symmetry elements present in the molecule.\n    *   The molecule has an extensive conjugated π-system (nitro group, benzene ring, C=C double bond, C=O double bond). To maximize orbital overlap, the main framework of the molecule is essentially **planar**.\n    *   **Identity (E):** All molecules possess this element.\n    *   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** The plane containing the planar framework of the molecule is a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Proper Axis of Rotation (Cₙ, n>1):** There are no axes of rotation. The molecule is not symmetrical end-to-end; one end has a nitro group, and the other has an acetyl group. Therefore, there is no C₂ axis.\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion.\n*   **Point Group:** A molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe molecular symmetry group of product 3 is Cs. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Toluene is treated with a mixture of nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a classic electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically the nitration of toluene. The methyl group (-CH₃) is an ortho, para-directing group. Due to steric hindrance at the ortho positions, the major product is the para-substituted isomer. In a multi-step synthesis problem, it is standard to assume the major product is carried forward.\n*   **Conclusion:** Product 1 is **p-nitrotoluene** (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (p-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an oxidation of the benzylic methyl group. The key is to determine the final oxidation state. The subsequent reaction (Step 3) involves acetone and a base, which is a characteristic Claisen-Schmidt condensation. This reaction requires an aldehyde as one of the starting materials. Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that the methyl group is oxidized to an aldehyde, not all the way to a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion:** Product 2 is **p-nitrobenzaldehyde** (4-nitrobenzaldehyde).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. The base removes an acidic α-hydrogen from acetone to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde (which has no α-hydrogens and cannot self-condense). The resulting aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration to form a highly stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone. The trans (E) isomer is the major product due to greater thermodynamic stability.\n*   **Conclusion:** Product 3 is **(E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the molecular symmetry group of Product 3**\n*   **Molecule:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n*   **Structure:** O₂N-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** To determine the point group, we must identify the symmetry elements present in the molecule.\n    *   **Planarity:** The molecule has an extensive conjugated π-system (nitro group, benzene ring, C=C double bond, C=O double bond).

A 180° rotation does not result in an identical molecule because the two ends are different (a nitro group versus an acetyl group).\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion.\n*   **Point Group Assignment:** A molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe chemical analysis consistently leads to (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one as the final product.

The key point of consideration is the extent of the oxidation. While strong oxidizing agents can convert the methyl group to a carboxylic acid, the context of the subsequent reaction is crucial. The next step involves acetone and a base, which is a characteristic Claisen-Schmidt condensation. This reaction requires an aldehyde as a reactant. Therefore, the most chemically logical conclusion is that the oxidation of the methyl group stops at the aldehyde stage.\n*   **Conclusion:** Product 2 is **p-nitrobenzaldehyde** (4-nitrobenzaldehyde).

The base (NaOH) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from acetone to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde (which has no α-hydrogens and cannot self-condense). The resulting aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration to form a highly stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone.
