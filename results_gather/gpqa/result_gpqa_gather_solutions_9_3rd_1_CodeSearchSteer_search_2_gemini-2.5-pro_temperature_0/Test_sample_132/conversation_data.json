A systematic analysis will clarify the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Calculate Moles of Buffer Components:**\n    The first step is to determine the number of moles of the weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻) that form the buffer.\n    *   Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄) = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Moles of HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O) = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n2.  **Calculate Initial Molar Concentrations:**\n    The concentrations are found by dividing the moles of each component by the total volume of the solution in liters.\n    *   Volume = 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n3.  **Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]:**\n    The solution is a buffer system controlled by the H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ conjugate pair. This equilibrium is governed by the second acid dissociation constant, Ka₂.\n    *   Equilibrium: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    Rearranging the formula to solve for [H⁺]:\n    *   [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    *   [H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n4.  **Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]:**\n    The orthophosphate ion is formed in the third dissociation step, which is governed by Ka₃. The concentration of this ion will be very small and dependent on the [H⁺] established by the main buffer.\n    *   Equilibrium: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    Rearranging the formula to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Hydrate:** It is essential to use the molar mass for the hydrated salt, Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (177.99 g/mol), as specified in the problem. All candidate answers correctly did this.\n*   **Correct Ka Sequence:** The calculation must use Ka₂ to find the [H⁺] of the main buffer system and then use Ka₃ to find the concentration of the minor species, [PO₄³⁻]. All candidate answers correctly followed this logical sequence.\n*   **Calculation Accuracy:** The numerical calculation is robust. All candidate answers that showed their work arrived at the same numerical result of approximately 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n*   **Option Matching:** This is the most critical point and the source of all discrepancies among the candidate answers. The calculated value of **6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M** must be matched to the original list of options provided in the question.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M, which rounds to **6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M**.\n\nComparing this result to the provided options:\nA) **6.24x10⁻⁷ M**\nB) 5.48x10⁻⁷ M\nC) 2.81x10⁻⁷ M\nD) 3.97x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on an analysis of the provided answers, there is a strong consensus on the calculation method and the final numerical result. The primary discrepancy lies in matching the calculated value to the correct lettered option, as many candidate answers appear to be referencing a different set of options than the one provided in the prompt.\n\nHere is a definitive step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Chemical System:** The solution contains KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O. These salts dissociate to form a buffer solution composed of the weak acid H₂PO₄⁻ (dihydrogen phosphate) and its conjugate base HPO₄²⁻ (hydrogen phosphate). The goal is to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, PO₄³⁻.\n\n2.  **Calculate Moles of Buffer Components:**\n    *   Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄) = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol.\n    *   Moles of HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O) = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol.\n\n3.  **Calculate Initial Concentrations:**\n    *   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.20000 L.\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M.\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]:** The buffer's [H⁺] is governed by the equilibrium between the acid and its conjugate base, which corresponds to the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (Ka₂).\n    *   Equilibrium: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   Equilibrium expression: Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   Rearranging to solve for [H⁺]:\n        [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n        [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n        [H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n5.  **Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]:** The orthophosphate ion is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid, which is governed by Ka₃.\n    *   Equilibrium: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   Equilibrium expression: Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   Rearranging to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   Using the values calculated previously:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n        [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Hydrate:** It is essential to use the molar mass of the hydrated salt, Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (177.99 g/mol), as specified in the problem.\n*   **Volume Conversion:** The volume must be converted from cm³ to Liters (200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L) for molarity calculations.\n*   **Correct Ka Values:** The calculation is a two-step process. Ka₂ must be used to find the [H⁺] of the H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ buffer. Subsequently, Ka₃ must be used with that [H⁺] to find the final [PO₄³⁻].\n*   **Buffer Approximation:** The assumption that the initial concentrations of the buffer components are equal to their equilibrium concentrations is valid because the Ka values are small and the common ion effect suppresses dissociation.\n*   **Matching to Options:** The final calculated value, 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M, rounds to 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M. This numerical result must be carefully matched to the options provided in the original question prompt:\n    A) 2.81x10⁻⁷ M\n    B) 5.48x10⁻⁷ M\n    C) 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\n    D) 3.97x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated value corresponds directly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this problem by following a systematic, step-by-step chemical calculation. The analysis of the candidate answers reveals that while the calculation itself is generally performed correctly, there is significant confusion in matching the final numerical result to the correct lettered option. My plan will address this explicitly.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Calculate Moles and Concentrations:** I will first calculate the number of moles for each of the two salts (KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O) using their given masses and molar masses. Then, I will use the total volume of the solution (200.00 cm³) to find the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components, [H₂PO₄⁻] and [HPO₄²⁻].\n2.  **Calculate Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]:** The solution is a buffer, so its [H⁺] is determined by the equilibrium between the weak acid H₂PO₄⁻ and its conjugate base HPO₄²⁻. I will use the equilibrium expression for the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (Ka₂) to find [H⁺].\n3.  **Calculate Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]:** The target ion, PO₄³⁻, is formed in the third dissociation step. I will use the equilibrium expression for Ka₃, along with the [H⁺] calculated in the previous step, to find the final concentration of [PO₄³⁻].\n4.  **Final Verification:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations precisely. The script will print the final calculated value and then compare it against the original options provided in the question to determine the correct choice.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Hydrate:** It is crucial to use the molar mass of the hydrated salt, Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (177.99 g/mol), as specified in the problem.\n*   **Volume Conversion:** The volume must be converted from cm³ to Liters for molarity calculations (200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L).\n*   **Correct Ka Values:** The calculation for [H⁺] must use Ka₂ (6.2x10⁻⁸) because the primary buffer pair is H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻. The final calculation for [PO₄³⁻] must use Ka₃ (1.8x10⁻¹²), as it governs the formation of that ion.\n*   **Option Matching:** The most significant source of error among the candidate answers was mismatching the calculated numerical result with the lettered options. The final step must be a careful comparison of the calculated value to the original options provided in the prompt.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_orthophosphate_concentration():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the chemistry problem by following a step-by-step equilibrium calculation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Step 1: Define given values and calculate initial concentrations ---\n    # Given data\n    mass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # g\n    mw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # g/mol\n    mass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00  # g\n    mw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99  # g/mol\n    volume_L = 200.00 / 1000.0  # Convert cm3 to L\n\n    # Acid dissociation constants\n    Ka2 = 6.2e-8\n    Ka3 = 1.8e-12\n\n    # Calculate moles\n    moles_h2po4 = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\n    moles_hpo4 = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\n\n    # Calculate initial concentrations\n    conc_h2po4 = moles_h2po4 / volume_L\n    conc_hpo4 = moles_hpo4 / volume_L\n\n    print(f\"Initial concentration [H2PO4-] = {conc_h2po4:.5f} M\")\n    print(f\"Initial concentration [HPO4^2-] = {conc_hpo4:.5f} M\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate hydrogen ion concentration [H+] using Ka2 ---\n    # Equilibrium: H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2-\n    # [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\n    conc_h_plus = Ka2 * (conc_h2po4 / conc_hpo4)\n    print(f\"Calculated hydrogen ion concentration [H+] = {conc_h_plus:.3e} M\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # --- Step 3: Calculate orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-] using Ka3 ---\n    # Equilibrium: HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-\n    # [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\n    conc_po4 = (Ka3 * conc_hpo4) / conc_h_plus\n    print(f\"Final calculated concentration [PO4^3-] = {conc_po4:.3e} M\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # --- Step 4: Compare with the given options ---\n    print(\"Comparing the result with the original options:\")\n    options = {\n        \"A\": 2.81e-7,\n        \"B\": 3.97e-7,\n        \"C\": 5.48e-7,\n        \"D\": 6.24e-7\n    }\n\n    # Find the best match\n    best_match = ''\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    for key, value in options.items():\n        if abs(value - conc_po4) < min_diff:\n            min_diff = abs(value - conc_po4)\n            best_match = key\n    \n    print(f\"A) 2.81x10^-7 M\")\n    print(f\"B) 3.97x10^-7 M\")\n    print(f\"C) 5.48x10^-7 M\")\n    print(f\"D) 6.24x10^-7 M\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe calculated value {conc_po4:.3e} M is closest to option {best_match} ({options[best_match]:.3e} M).\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncalculate_orthophosphate_concentration()\n```\n<<<D>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: Initial concentration [H2PO4-] = 0.03674 M\nInitial concentration [HPO4^2-] = 0.02809 M\n----------------------------------------\nCalculated hydrogen ion concentration [H+] = 8.109e-08 M\n----------------------------------------\nFinal calculated concentration [PO4^3-] = 6.236e-07 M\n----------------------------------------\nComparing the result with the original options:\nA) 2.81x10^-7 M\nB) 3.97x10^-7 M\nC) 5.48x10^-7 M\nD) 6.24x10^-7 M\n\nThe calculated value 6.236e-07 M is closest to option D (6.240e-07 M).\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis problem requires a two-step equilibrium calculation to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) in a buffer solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Chemical System:** The solution contains KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O.

The goal is to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, PO₄³⁻.\n\n2.  **Calculate Moles of Buffer Components:**\n    *   Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄) = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol.\n    *   Moles of HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O) = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol.\n\n3.  **Calculate Initial Concentrations:**\n    *   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.20000 L.\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M.\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]:** The buffer's [H⁺] is governed by the equilibrium between the acid and its conjugate base, which corresponds to the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (Ka₂).\n    *   Equilibrium: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   Equilibrium expression: Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   Rearranging to solve for [H⁺]:\n        [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n        [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n        [H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n5.  **Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]:** The orthophosphate ion is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid, which is governed by Ka₃.\n    *   Equilibrium: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   Equilibrium expression: Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   Rearranging to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   Using the values calculated previously:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n        [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Hydrate:** It is essential to use the molar mass of the hydrated salt, Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (177.99 g/mol), as specified in the problem.\n*   **Volume Conversion:** The volume must be converted from cm³ to Liters (200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L) for molarity calculations.\n*   **Correct Ka Values:** The calculation is a two-step process. Ka₂ must be used to find the [H⁺] of the H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ buffer. Subsequently, Ka₃ must be used with that [H⁺] to find the final [PO₄³⁻].\n*   **Buffer Approximation:** The assumption that the initial concentrations of the buffer components are equal to their equilibrium concentrations is valid because the Ka values are small and the common ion effect suppresses dissociation.\n*   **Matching to Options:** The final calculated value, 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M, rounds to 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M. This numerical result must be carefully matched to the options provided in the original question prompt:\n    A) 2.81x10⁻⁷ M\n    B) 5.48x10⁻⁷ M\n    C) 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\n    D) 3.97x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated value corresponds directly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this problem by following a systematic, step-by-step chemical calculation. The analysis of the candidate answers reveals that while the calculation itself is generally performed correctly, there is significant confusion in matching the final numerical result to the correct lettered option. My plan will address this explicitly.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Calculate Moles and Concentrations:** I will first calculate the number of moles for each of the two salts (KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O) using their given masses and molar masses. Then, I will use the total volume of the solution (200.00 cm³) to find the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components, [H₂PO₄⁻] and [HPO₄²⁻].\n2.  **Calculate Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]:** The solution is a buffer, so its [H⁺] is determined by the equilibrium between the weak acid H₂PO₄⁻ and its conjugate base HPO₄²⁻. I will use the equilibrium expression for the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (Ka₂) to find [H⁺].\n3.  **Calculate Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]:** The target ion, PO₄³⁻, is formed in the third dissociation step. I will use the equilibrium expression for Ka₃, along with the [H⁺] calculated in the previous step, to find the final concentration of [PO₄³⁻].\n4.  **Final Verification:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations precisely. The script will print the final calculated value and then compare it against the original options provided in the question to determine the correct choice.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Hydrate:** It is crucial to use the molar mass of the hydrated salt, Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (177.99 g/mol), as specified in the problem.\n*   **Volume Conversion:** The volume must be converted from cm³ to Liters for molarity calculations (200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L).\n*   **Correct Ka Values:** The calculation for [H⁺] must use Ka₂ (6.2x10⁻⁸) because the primary buffer pair is H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻. The final calculation for [PO₄³⁻] must use Ka₃ (1.8x10⁻¹²), as it governs the formation of that ion.\n*   **Option Matching:** The most significant source of error among the candidate answers was mismatching the calculated numerical result with the lettered options. The final step must be a careful comparison of the calculated value to the original options provided in the prompt.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_orthophosphate_concentration():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the chemistry problem by following a step-by-step equilibrium calculation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Step 1: Define given values and calculate initial concentrations ---\n    # Given data\n    mass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # g\n    mw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # g/mol\n    mass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00  # g\n    mw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99  # g/mol\n    volume_L = 200.00 / 1000.0  # Convert cm3 to L\n\n    # Acid dissociation constants\n    Ka2 = 6.2e-8\n    Ka3 = 1.8e-12\n\n    # Calculate moles\n    moles_h2po4 = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\n    moles_hpo4 = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\n\n    # Calculate initial concentrations\n    conc_h2po4 = moles_h2po4 / volume_L\n    conc_hpo4 = moles_hpo4 / volume_L\n\n    print(f\"Initial concentration [H2PO4-] = {conc_h2po4:.5f} M\")\n    print(f\"Initial concentration [HPO4^2-] = {conc_hpo4:.5f} M\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate hydrogen ion concentration [H+] using Ka2 ---\n    # Equilibrium: H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2-\n    # [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\n    conc_h_plus = Ka2 * (conc_h2po4 / conc_hpo4)\n    print(f\"Calculated hydrogen ion concentration [H+] = {conc_h_plus:.3e} M\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # --- Step 3: Calculate orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-] using Ka3 ---\n    # Equilibrium: HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-\n    # [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\n    conc_po4 = (Ka3 * conc_hpo4) / conc_h_plus\n    print(f\"Final calculated concentration [PO4^3-] = {conc_po4:.3e} M\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # --- Step 4: Compare with the given options ---\n    print(\"Comparing the result with the original options:\")\n    options = {\n        \"A\": 2.81e-7,\n        \"B\": 3.97e-7,\n        \"C\": 5.48e-7,\n        \"D\": 6.24e-7\n    }\n\n    # Find the best match\n    best_match = ''\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    for key, value in options.items():\n        if abs(value - conc_po4) < min_diff:\n            min_diff = abs(value - conc_po4)\n            best_match = key\n    \n    print(f\"A) 2.81x10^-7 M\")\n    print(f\"B) 3.97x10^-7 M\")\n    print(f\"C) 5.48x10^-7 M\")\n    print(f\"D) 6.24x10^-7 M\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe calculated value {conc_po4:.3e} M is closest to option {best_match} ({options[best_match]:.3e} M).\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncalculate_orthophosphate_concentration()\n```\n<<<D>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: Initial concentration [H2PO4-] = 0.03674 M\nInitial concentration [HPO4^2-] = 0.02809 M\n----------------------------------------\nCalculated hydrogen ion concentration [H+] = 8.109e-08 M\n----------------------------------------\nFinal calculated concentration [PO4^3-] = 6.236e-07 M\n----------------------------------------\nComparing the result with the original options:\nA) 2.81x10^-7 M\nB) 3.97x10^-7 M\nC) 5.48x10^-7 M\nD) 6.24x10^-7 M\n\nThe calculated value 6.236e-07 M is closest to option D (6.240e-07 M).\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis problem requires a two-step equilibrium calculation to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) in a buffer solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Chemical System:** The solution contains KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O.

This final matching step is critical for selecting the right answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Moles and Initial Concentrations\nFirst, we must determine the molar concentrations of the two primary phosphate species in the solution, which are the weak acid dihydrogen phosphate (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base hydrogen phosphate (HPO₄²⁻).\n\n*   **Moles of H₂PO₄⁻** (from KH₂PO₄):\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n*   **Moles of HPO₄²⁻** (from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O):\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n*   **Volume of Solution**:\n    *   200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L\n*   **Initial Concentrations**:\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]\nThe solution is a buffer, and its hydrogen ion concentration is determined by the equilibrium between the weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻). This equilibrium is described by the second dissociation constant of phosphoric acid, Ka₂.\n\n*   **Equilibrium**: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n*   **Equilibrium Expression**: Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n\nWe can rearrange this expression to solve for [H⁺]:\n*   [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n*   [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n*   [H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed in the next dissociation step, which involves the deprotonation of HPO₄²⁻. This equilibrium is described by the third dissociation constant, Ka₃.\n\n*   **Equilibrium**: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n*   **Equilibrium Expression**: Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\nWe rearrange this expression to solve for our target, [PO₄³⁻]:\n*   [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n*   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n*   [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer Selection\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M. Rounding to three significant figures (consistent with the given data) gives **6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M**.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\nB) 2.81x10⁻⁷ M\nC) 3.97x10⁻⁷ M\nD) 5.48x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Molar Mass of Hydrate:** It is crucial to use the molar mass of the hydrated salt, Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (177.99 g/mol), as provided in the problem, not the anhydrous form.\n2.  **Correct Ka Values:** The calculation is a two-step process. Ka₂ must be used to find the [H⁺] of the H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ buffer. Subsequently, Ka₃ must be used with that [H⁺] to find the [PO₄³⁻] from the HPO₄²⁻ dissociation.\n3.  **Buffer Approximations:** It is valid to use the initial calculated concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ in the equilibrium expressions because they are part of a buffer, and the dissociation constants are very small, meaning their concentrations do not change significantly.\n4.  **Option Matching:** As seen in the candidate answers, a common source of error can be correctly calculating the numerical value but then matching it to the wrong lettered option. A careful final comparison is necessary.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on an analysis of the provided answers and an independent verification of the calculation, here is a step-by-step breakdown and the final decision.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the problem as a two-step equilibrium calculation involving a buffer solution. The consensus on the method is strong and accurate.\n\n1.  **Calculate Moles and Initial Concentrations:** The first step is to determine the molar concentrations of the buffer components, H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄) and HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O).\n    *   Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Moles of HPO₄²⁻ = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n    *   Volume = 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n2.  **Calculate Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]:** The buffer's [H⁺] is determined by the equilibrium between the weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻). This is governed by the second dissociation constant, Ka₂.\n    *   Equilibrium: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n3.  **Calculate Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]:** The target ion, PO₄³⁻, is formed in the next dissociation step, which is governed by Ka₃.\n    *   Equilibrium: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M) ≈ 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n4.  **Final Result:** The calculated concentration, when rounded to three significant figures (consistent with the given data), is **6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Hydrate:** It is essential to use the molar mass of the hydrated salt, Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (177.99 g/mol), as specified in the problem, not the molar mass of the anhydrous form. All candidate answers correctly did this.\n*   **Correct Ka Values:** The calculation must be performed in two steps using the correct dissociation constants. Ka₂ must be used to find the [H⁺] of the H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ buffer. Subsequently, Ka₃ must be used with that [H⁺] to find the [PO₄³⁻]. Using the wrong Ka at either step would produce an incorrect result.\n*   **Buffer Approximations:** The assumption that the initial concentrations of the buffer components are equal to their equilibrium concentrations is valid. This is because they are in a buffer solution (suppressing dissociation) and the Ka values are small.\n*   **Matching Calculation to Options:** The calculated numerical value is ~6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M. A final, crucial step is to match this value to the correct lettered option provided in the original question. The candidate answers show significant confusion here, likely due to variations in the options they were shown. Based on the options provided in the prompt (A, B, C, D), the calculated value corresponds to option D.\n\nThe calculation is robust and consistently yields 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
