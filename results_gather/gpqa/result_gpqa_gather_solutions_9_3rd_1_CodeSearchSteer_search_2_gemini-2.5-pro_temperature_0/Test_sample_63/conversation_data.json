  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nAn equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n\nA) 17\nB) 13\nC) 19\nD) 15\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, synthesizing the logic from the provided candidate answers.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products of Decomposition and Their Quantities**\n\nThe problem describes heating a 7.20 g mixture of salts and analyzing the resulting gases by passing them through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of CuO. This mass increase is the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the elements in the products must have come from the original salts. We can calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The remaining mass must be nitrogen. We can verify this by mass conservation.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of N = Total initial mass - Mass(H) - Mass(O) = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   This is consistent with the 0.10 mol of remaining gas being N₂, which contains 0.20 mol of N atoms.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. The overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined salts is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply by 20, which gives **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThis means that the sum of the chemical formulas of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B is N₄H₈O₅. Since the salts are composed of N, H, and O and decompose into gases, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. We need to find two such salts whose formulas add up to N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   **Candidate Salt 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its chemical formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Candidate Salt 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Its chemical formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nLet's sum their formulas:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**.\nThis is a perfect match. Therefore, the two salts in the equimolar mixture are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means we sum the atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\n**Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\n**5. Select the Final Answer**\n\nThe calculated total number of atoms is 17. Matching this with the given options:\nA) 15\nB) 13\nC) 17\nD) 19\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products\nThe first step, consistently applied across all candidate answers, is to determine the identity and molar amounts of the gaseous products from the experimental data.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube absorbs acidic gases. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases (like CO₂) were formed. This indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper to form CuO. This mass is purely the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar Mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the other gases are removed, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**. Given the context, this inert gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### 2. Determination of the Elemental Composition\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, the elements in the products must have come from the original 7.20 g salt mixture.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The remaining mass must be nitrogen. We can verify this by mass balance:\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of N = Total Mass - Mass(H) - Mass(O) = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   This is consistent with the 0.10 mol of N₂ gas collected.\n\n### 3. Identification of Salts A and B\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. The overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined formula of (A + B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo get a simple integer ratio, we divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply by 4 to clear the decimal:\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25  =>  **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nThe combined chemical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**. The salts are composed of N, H, and O and decompose into gases, which strongly suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. The two common salts whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅ are:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃), which has the formula **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂), which has the formula **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nSumming their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match.\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This is the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\n**Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\n### 5. Final Decision\nThe unanimous and well-supported calculation across all provided answers is that the total number of atoms is 17. The options given are A) 13, B) 17, C) 19, and D) 15. The correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy thinking process to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem**: I will break down the chemical process described into individual steps to analyze the data provided. The goal is to identify the composition of the initial salt mixture.\n2.  **Analyze the Products**:\n    *   The mass increase in Tube 1 (3.60 g) is due to the absorption of water (H₂O). I will calculate the moles of H₂O from this mass.\n    *   The lack of mass change in Tube 2 indicates no acidic gases (like CO₂) were formed. This tells me the salts likely do not contain carbon.\n    *   The mass increase in Tube 3 (0.80 g) is due to oxygen atoms reacting with copper. I will calculate the moles of oxygen atoms from this mass.\n    *   The remaining gas C (2.24 L at STP) is inert. I will calculate its moles. Based on the context of decomposing nitrogen salts, this is almost certainly N₂.\n3.  **Determine Elemental Composition**: Using the moles of the products (H₂O, O atoms, N₂), I will calculate the total moles of each element (H, N, O) present in the original 7.20 g mixture. I will then perform a mass balance check to ensure the sum of the masses of the calculated elements equals the initial mass of the mixture.\n4.  **Identify the Salts**:\n    *   From the total moles of each element, I will determine the simplest whole-number molar ratio of N:H:O in the combined formula of (Salt A + Salt B).\n    *   Since the problem states the mixture is equimolar, this ratio represents the combined formula of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B.\n    *   Based on the elements present (N, H, O) and the fact that they are salts, I will deduce that they are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. I will find two common salts that sum to the derived combined formula.\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**: Once the identities of Salt A and Salt B are confirmed, I will count the number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt and add them together to get the total number of atoms.\n6.  **Code Implementation**: I will translate these steps into a Python script. The script will perform the calculations and print the final answer clearly.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the chemistry problem by analyzing the decomposition products to determine\n    the original salts and then calculating the total number of atoms.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Analyze the products and calculate their moles\n    mass_h2o = 3.60  # g, from tube 1\n    mass_o_atoms_cu = 0.80  # g, from tube 3\n    volume_gas_c_stp = 2.24  # L\n\n    # Molar masses and constants\n    MOLAR_MASS_H2O = 18.015  # g/mol\n    MOLAR_MASS_O = 15.999    # g/mol\n    MOLAR_VOLUME_STP = 22.4  # L/mol\n    MOLAR_MASS_N = 14.007    # g/mol\n    MOLAR_MASS_H = 1.008     # g/mol\n\n    # Moles of products\n    moles_h2o = mass_h2o / MOLAR_MASS_H2O\n    moles_o_atoms_from_cu = mass_o_atoms_cu / MOLAR_MASS_O\n    moles_gas_c = volume_gas_c_stp / MOLAR_VOLUME_STP\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the original mixture\n    # Moles of Hydrogen atoms from H2O\n    moles_h_total = moles_h2o * 2\n    # Moles of Oxygen atoms from H2O and the reaction with Copper\n    moles_o_total = moles_h2o + moles_o_atoms_from_cu\n    # Moles of Nitrogen atoms.

Analyze the Products and Their Quantities**\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of a salt mixture and the subsequent analysis of the gaseous products. We can determine the identity and molar amounts of each product from the experimental data.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon or sulfur that would form acidic oxides.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of CuO. This mass increase is purely the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the other gases are removed, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   Given the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts and its inertness, this gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Salt Mixture**\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the original 7.20 g salt mixture. We can calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** We can find the mass of nitrogen by subtracting the mass of hydrogen and oxygen from the total mass.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of N = Total Mass - Mass(H) - Mass(O) = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   This is consistent with the final product being 0.10 mol of N₂ gas (0.10 mol × 2 = 0.20 mol N atoms).\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\nThe problem states the mixture is **equimolar**. This means the combined chemical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B must have an elemental ratio of N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n\n*   To get the simplest integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20):\n    N : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n*   To eliminate the decimal, multiply the entire ratio by 4:\n    N : H : O = **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nSo, the combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**. We need to find two common salts composed of N, H, and O that decompose into gases and whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅. The most logical candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n\n*   **Candidate Salt 1:** Ammonium nitrate, **NH₄NO₃**. Its chemical formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Candidate Salt 2:** Ammonium nitrite, **NH₄NO₂**. Its chemical formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nLet's sum their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis result corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and conservation of mass to identify the unknown salts and then count their atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Products and Calculate Their Moles**\n\nThe gaseous products from the decomposition are passed through a series of tubes, allowing us to identify and quantify them.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This mass increase is solely due to the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar Mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the other gases are removed, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   Given its inertness and the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts, this gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the original 7.20 g salt mixture. We can now calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the final 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\nTo verify, let's calculate the total mass from these elements:\n*   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n*   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming our analysis.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. The overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined salts is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. To find the simplest integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\n*   Ratio = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n*   Multiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio: **N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**\n\nThis means that the sum of the chemical formulas of one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nSince the salts are composed of N, H, and O and decompose into gases, they are very likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. We need to find two such salts whose formulas add up to N₄H₈O₅.

The data from these tubes allow us to determine the composition of the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, we can conclude that **no acidic gases were produced**. This indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO).

Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases (like CO₂) were produced. This indicates the salts are likely composed only of nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot Cu):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms reacting with the copper to form CuO.\n    *   Molar Mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   Molar volume at STP is 22.4 L/mol.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.

We can calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The remaining mass must be nitrogen. We can verify this by mass balance.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of N = Total Mass - Mass(H) - Mass(O) = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Moles of N = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   This is consistent with the 0.10 mol of N₂ gas found (0.10 mol N₂ contains 0.20 mol N atoms).\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. The overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined salts is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply by 20, which gives **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThis means that the sum of the chemical formulas of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B is N₄H₈O₅. Since the salts are composed of N, H, and O and decompose into gases, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. We need to find two such salts whose formulas add up to N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   **Candidate Salt 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its chemical formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Candidate Salt 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Its chemical formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nLet's sum their formulas:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**.\nThis is a perfect match. Therefore, the two salts in the equimolar mixture are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means we sum the atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\n**Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n**1.

I will verify each step of this path to ensure its correctness.\n\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Decomposition**\n    *   **Tube 1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂):** Absorbs H₂O. Mass increase = 3.60 g.\n        *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**. This is correct and consistent across all answers.\n    *   **Tube 2 (Ca(OH)₂):** Absorbs acidic gases. No weight change.\n        *   Conclusion: No acidic gases were produced.

This increase is the mass of oxygen atoms that formed CuO.\n        *   Molar Mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**. This is correct and consistent.\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** 2.24 L at STP.\n        *   Molar Volume at STP = 22.4 L/mol.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**. This is correct and consistent.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture**\n    *   Based on the products, the original salts contain only Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n    *   **Moles of H atoms:** All H is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n        *   Moles H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Moles of O atoms:** Oxygen is in the H₂O and the gas that reacted with Cu.\n        *   Moles O = (from H₂O) + (from Tube 3) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n    *   **Moles of N atoms:** The remaining mass must be nitrogen. We can verify this by mass balance.\n        *   Mass H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n        *   Mass O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n        *   Mass N = Total Mass - Mass H - Mass O = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n        *   Moles N = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   This elemental composition is calculated correctly and consistently in all answers. The fact that 0.20 mol of N atoms corresponds to 0.10 mol of N₂ gas confirms that Gas C is N₂.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify Salts A and B**\n    *   The mixture is equimolar. The molar ratio of elements in the combined formula unit (A+B) is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n    *   To get the simplest integer ratio, divide by 0.20 (giving 1 : 2 : 1.25) and then multiply by 4.\n    *   The integer ratio is **N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**.\n    *   The combined formula for (A+B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n    *   The task is to find two common ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions that sum to this formula.\n        *   Salt A: Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) -> Formula: **N₂H₄O₃**\n        *   Salt B: Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) -> Formula: **N₂H₄O₂**\n    *   Sum: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N₄H₈O₅. This is a perfect match.\n    *   The identification of the salts as ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite is correct and consistent across all answers.\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in one formula unit of each).\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n    *   Total atoms = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n    *   This calculation is also performed correctly in the reasoning of every candidate answer.\n\n**2.

The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube absorbs acidic gases. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases (like CO₂) were formed. This strongly suggests the original salts do not contain carbon.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increased by 0.80 g. This is due to oxygen atoms reacting with the copper to form CuO. Therefore, the mass increase is the mass of the oxygen that was present as a gas.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n        *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**. Given the context, this inert gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture:**\n    By the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have originated from the initial 7.20 g salt mixture.\n    *   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n        *   Total moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n        *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in two products: the water and the gas that reacted with copper.\n        *   Total moles of O atoms = (moles from H₂O) + (moles from reaction with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B:**\n    The problem states the mixture was **equimolar**. This means the molar ratio of the elements we calculated (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) corresponds to the combined formula of one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B.\n    *   To find the simplest integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20):\n        N : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n    *   To eliminate the decimal, we multiply the entire ratio by 4:\n        **N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**\n    *   The combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.

    "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nAn equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n\nA) 17\nB) 13\nC) 19\nD) 15\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, synthesizing the logic from the provided candidate answers.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products of Decomposition and Their Quantities**\n\nThe problem describes heating a 7.20 g mixture of salts and analyzing the resulting gases by passing them through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of CuO. This mass increase is the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the elements in the products must have come from the original salts. We can calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The remaining mass must be nitrogen. We can verify this by mass conservation.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of N = Total initial mass - Mass(H) - Mass(O) = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   This is consistent with the 0.10 mol of remaining gas being N₂, which contains 0.20 mol of N atoms.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. The overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined salts is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply by 20, which gives **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThis means that the sum of the chemical formulas of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B is N₄H₈O₅. Since the salts are composed of N, H, and O and decompose into gases, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. We need to find two such salts whose formulas add up to N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   **Candidate Salt 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its chemical formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Candidate Salt 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Its chemical formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nLet's sum their formulas:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**.\nThis is a perfect match. Therefore, the two salts in the equimolar mixture are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means we sum the atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\n**Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\n**5. Select the Final Answer**\n\nThe calculated total number of atoms is 17. Matching this with the given options:\nA) 15\nB) 13\nC) 17\nD) 19\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products\nThe first step, consistently applied across all candidate answers, is to determine the identity and molar amounts of the gaseous products from the experimental data.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube absorbs acidic gases. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases (like CO₂) were formed. This indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper to form CuO. This mass is purely the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar Mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the other gases are removed, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**. Given the context, this inert gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### 2. Determination of the Elemental Composition\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, the elements in the products must have come from the original 7.20 g salt mixture.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The remaining mass must be nitrogen. We can verify this by mass balance:\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of N = Total Mass - Mass(H) - Mass(O) = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   This is consistent with the 0.10 mol of N₂ gas collected.\n\n### 3. Identification of Salts A and B\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. The overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined formula of (A + B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo get a simple integer ratio, we divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply by 4 to clear the decimal:\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25  =>  **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nThe combined chemical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**. The salts are composed of N, H, and O and decompose into gases, which strongly suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. The two common salts whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅ are:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃), which has the formula **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂), which has the formula **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nSumming their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match.\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This is the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\n**Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\n### 5. Final Decision\nThe unanimous and well-supported calculation across all provided answers is that the total number of atoms is 17. The options given are A) 13, B) 17, C) 19, and D) 15. The correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy thinking process to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem**: I will break down the chemical process described into individual steps to analyze the data provided. The goal is to identify the composition of the initial salt mixture.\n2.  **Analyze the Products**:\n    *   The mass increase in Tube 1 (3.60 g) is due to the absorption of water (H₂O). I will calculate the moles of H₂O from this mass.\n    *   The lack of mass change in Tube 2 indicates no acidic gases (like CO₂) were formed. This tells me the salts likely do not contain carbon.\n    *   The mass increase in Tube 3 (0.80 g) is due to oxygen atoms reacting with copper. I will calculate the moles of oxygen atoms from this mass.\n    *   The remaining gas C (2.24 L at STP) is inert. I will calculate its moles. Based on the context of decomposing nitrogen salts, this is almost certainly N₂.\n3.  **Determine Elemental Composition**: Using the moles of the products (H₂O, O atoms, N₂), I will calculate the total moles of each element (H, N, O) present in the original 7.20 g mixture. I will then perform a mass balance check to ensure the sum of the masses of the calculated elements equals the initial mass of the mixture.\n4.  **Identify the Salts**:\n    *   From the total moles of each element, I will determine the simplest whole-number molar ratio of N:H:O in the combined formula of (Salt A + Salt B).\n    *   Since the problem states the mixture is equimolar, this ratio represents the combined formula of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B.\n    *   Based on the elements present (N, H, O) and the fact that they are salts, I will deduce that they are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. I will find two common salts that sum to the derived combined formula.\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**: Once the identities of Salt A and Salt B are confirmed, I will count the number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt and add them together to get the total number of atoms.\n6.  **Code Implementation**: I will translate these steps into a Python script. The script will perform the calculations and print the final answer clearly.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the chemistry problem by analyzing the decomposition products to determine\n    the original salts and then calculating the total number of atoms.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Analyze the products and calculate their moles\n    mass_h2o = 3.60  # g, from tube 1\n    mass_o_atoms_cu = 0.80  # g, from tube 3\n    volume_gas_c_stp = 2.24  # L\n\n    # Molar masses and constants\n    MOLAR_MASS_H2O = 18.015  # g/mol\n    MOLAR_MASS_O = 15.999    # g/mol\n    MOLAR_VOLUME_STP = 22.4  # L/mol\n    MOLAR_MASS_N = 14.007    # g/mol\n    MOLAR_MASS_H = 1.008     # g/mol\n\n    # Moles of products\n    moles_h2o = mass_h2o / MOLAR_MASS_H2O\n    moles_o_atoms_from_cu = mass_o_atoms_cu / MOLAR_MASS_O\n    moles_gas_c = volume_gas_c_stp / MOLAR_VOLUME_STP\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the original mixture\n    # Moles of Hydrogen atoms from H2O\n    moles_h_total = moles_h2o * 2\n    # Moles of Oxygen atoms from H2O and the reaction with Copper\n    moles_o_total = moles_h2o + moles_o_atoms_from_cu\n    # Moles of Nitrogen atoms.

Analyze the Products and Their Quantities**\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of a salt mixture and the subsequent analysis of the gaseous products. We can determine the identity and molar amounts of each product from the experimental data.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon or sulfur that would form acidic oxides.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of CuO. This mass increase is purely the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the other gases are removed, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   Given the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts and its inertness, this gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Salt Mixture**\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the original 7.20 g salt mixture. We can calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** We can find the mass of nitrogen by subtracting the mass of hydrogen and oxygen from the total mass.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of N = Total Mass - Mass(H) - Mass(O) = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   This is consistent with the final product being 0.10 mol of N₂ gas (0.10 mol × 2 = 0.20 mol N atoms).\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\nThe problem states the mixture is **equimolar**. This means the combined chemical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B must have an elemental ratio of N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n\n*   To get the simplest integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20):\n    N : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n*   To eliminate the decimal, multiply the entire ratio by 4:\n    N : H : O = **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nSo, the combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**. We need to find two common salts composed of N, H, and O that decompose into gases and whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅. The most logical candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n\n*   **Candidate Salt 1:** Ammonium nitrate, **NH₄NO₃**. Its chemical formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Candidate Salt 2:** Ammonium nitrite, **NH₄NO₂**. Its chemical formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nLet's sum their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**4.

This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis result corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and conservation of mass to identify the unknown salts and then count their atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Products and Calculate Their Moles**\n\nThe gaseous products from the decomposition are passed through a series of tubes, allowing us to identify and quantify them.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).

This indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This mass increase is solely due to the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar Mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the other gases are removed, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   Given its inertness and the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts, this gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the original 7.20 g salt mixture. We can now calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the final 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\nTo verify, let's calculate the total mass from these elements:\n*   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n*   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming our analysis.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was equimolar.

We need to find two such salts whose formulas add up to N₄H₈O₅. The most common and logical candidates are:\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** Formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** Formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nLet's sum their formulas:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**.\nThis is a perfect match.

Analyze the Products of Decomposition and Their Quantities**\n\nThe problem describes heating a 7.20 g mixture of salts and analyzing the resulting gases by passing them through a series of tubes. The changes in the tubes allow us to identify the products and their quantities.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, **no acidic gases were formed**. This rules out salts containing carbonate or other anions that would produce acidic gases upon decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of CuO. This mass increase is purely the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   This inert gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂), a common decomposition product of nitrogen-containing salts.\n\n**2.

We can verify this by mass balance.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of N = Total Mass - Mass(H) - Mass(O) = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Moles of N = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   This is consistent with the 0.10 mol of N₂ gas found (0.10 mol N₂ contains 0.20 mol N atoms).\n\n**3.

To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply by 20, which gives **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThis means that the sum of the chemical formulas of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B is N₄H₈O₅. Since the salts are composed of N, H, and O and decompose into gases, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. We need to find two such salts whose formulas add up to N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   **Candidate Salt 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃.

Its chemical formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nLet's sum their formulas:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**.\nThis is a perfect match. Therefore, the two salts in the equimolar mixture are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**4.

We can verify this by mass balance.\n        *   Mass H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n        *   Mass O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n        *   Mass N = Total Mass - Mass H - Mass O = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n        *   Moles N = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   This elemental composition is calculated correctly and consistently in all answers. The fact that 0.20 mol of N atoms corresponds to 0.10 mol of N₂ gas confirms that Gas C is N₂.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify Salts A and B**\n    *   The mixture is equimolar.
