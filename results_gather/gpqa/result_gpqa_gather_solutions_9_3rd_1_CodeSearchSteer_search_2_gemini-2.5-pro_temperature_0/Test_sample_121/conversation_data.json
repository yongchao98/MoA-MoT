The α-carbon of acetic acid is brominated.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Product 1 + ethanol, H₂SO₄ → Product 2:** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid group is converted into an ethyl ester using ethanol and an acid catalyst.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Product 2 + NaCN → Product 3:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Product 3 + excess NaH + 1,5-dibromopentane → Product 4:** This is a tandem reaction involving two deprotonations and two alkylations, resulting in cyclization.\n    *   First, the strong base sodium hydride (NaH) removes one of the acidic protons from the carbon atom situated between the electron-withdrawing cyano (-CN) and ethoxycarbonyl (-COOEt) groups.\n    *   The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   The use of *excess* NaH ensures that the second, and now only, proton on that α-carbon is also removed.\n    *   This new carbanion undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the carbon chain to form a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe core of the question is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃), attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This rapid flipping creates a time-averaged structure that possesses an *effective* plane of symmetry. This plane passes through C1, the two substituents, and the opposite carbon, C4. Protons that can be interchanged by this plane of symmetry are chemically equivalent, while those that cannot are distinct. We must also account for diastereotopicity.\n\n*   **Counting the Distinct Signals:**\n\n    1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are related by the molecule's effective plane of symmetry, making them enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent and give a single signal. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   The effective plane of symmetry makes the carbons C2 and C6 equivalent, and C3 and C5 equivalent. C4 is unique as it lies on the plane.\n        *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** On any single carbon (like C2), the axial and equatorial protons are in different spatial environments. They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. Because C2 and C6 are equivalent by symmetry, the two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial-like protons are equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** from these four protons.\n        *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons give rise to **2 distinct signals** (one for the two axial-like protons, one for the two equatorial-like protons).\n        *   **Protons on C4:** The two protons on C4 are also diastereotopic. One is axial-like and one is equatorial-like, and they are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation. Therefore, they are chemically distinct. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n        *   *Total from cyclohexane ring = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Part 3: Final Calculation**\n\nBy summing the distinct signals from all parts of the molecule, we get:\n*   Signals from ethyl group: 2\n*   Signals from cyclohexane ring: 6\n*   **Total distinct signals = 2 + 6 = 8**\n\nThe question asks for the number of distinct hydrogen signals, which we have determined to be 8. The options provided are:\nA) 8\nB) 5\nC) 12\nD) 10\n\nThe calculated number of signals, 8, corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe synthesis proceeds through four distinct steps. The identity of the product at each step is crucial.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid → Product 1**\n    *   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is treated with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride. This is a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) type reaction, which causes bromination at the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group).\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 → Product 2**\n    *   **Reaction:** Bromoacetic acid is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid is converted into an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3**\n    *   **Reaction:** Ethyl bromoacetate is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). This is a classic Sₙ2 nucleophilic substitution, where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 → Product 4**\n    *   **Reaction:** Ethyl cyanoacetate is treated with *excess* sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane. This is a tandem reaction.\n    *   **Analysis:** The protons on the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups are acidic. The strong base (NaH) removes one proton to form a carbanion. This carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane. The use of \"excess\" NaH ensures the second proton on that carbon is also removed, and the resulting carbanion performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the carbon chain to form a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe central task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals for **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry at room temperature.\n\n**Careful Points for Analysis:**\n\n*   **Conformational Averaging:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping, which creates a time-averaged structure for NMR analysis.\n*   **Symmetry:** The final product has two different substituents (-CN and -COOCH₂CH₃) on C1. This makes C1 a chiral center, and the molecule technically lacks a plane of symmetry. However, two valid models can be used to analyze the structure, and both lead to the same conclusion.\n\n**Model A: The \"Effective Symmetry\" Approach (Common Textbook Method)**\n\nThis model assumes the rapid ring-flipping creates an *effective* plane of symmetry passing through C1 and C4.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent due to rotation. **(1 signal)**\n    *   The two protons of the methylene (-OCH₂-) group are enantiotopic due to the effective symmetry plane. In a standard achiral solvent, they are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   The symmetry plane makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2 & C6:** The axial and equatorial protons on any single carbon are diastereotopic (chemically distinct). The symmetry makes the two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) equivalent, and the two equatorial protons equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 & C5:** The same logic applies, giving **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** The two protons on C4 are diastereotopic and not equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Count (Model A):** 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = **8 signals**.\n\n**Model B: The \"Rigorous Chirality\" Approach**\n\nThis model correctly identifies the molecule as chiral and analyzes the consequences, assuming rapid ring-flipping.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n    *   The methylene (-OCH₂-) group is adjacent to a chiral center (C1), making its two protons diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. **(2 signals)**\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   The lack of symmetry means C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6 are all in unique chemical environments.\n    *   Rapid ring-flipping averages the axial and equatorial protons for each distinct carbon. This results in five separate signals, one for each of the five CH₂ groups on the ring. **(5 signals)**\n\n*   **Total Count (Model B):** 1 + 2 + 5 = **8 signals**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBoth chemically sound methods of analysis converge on the same result. The molecule has 8 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms. Based on the provided options:\nA) 5\nB) 10\nC) 12\nD) 8\n\nThe correct answer is 8.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first determine the structure of the final product by carefully following the multi-step reaction sequence. Then, I will analyze the symmetry of this final molecule to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments, which corresponds to the number of signals in its ¹H NMR spectrum. The key will be to consider the effects of conformational averaging (chair-flipping) and stereotopicity (enantiotopic vs. diastereotopic protons). Finally, I will sum the number of distinct signals and match it to the provided multiple-choice options to select the correct answer.\n\nHere is the step-by-step execution:\n\n1.  **Reaction Analysis to Find Product 4:**\n    *   **Step 1:** Acetic acid undergoes α-bromination (a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky type reaction) to yield **bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)**.\n    *   **Step 2:** Bromoacetic acid undergoes Fischer esterification with ethanol to yield **ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Step 3:** Ethyl bromoacetate undergoes an Sₙ2 reaction with sodium cyanide, yielding **ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Step 4:** Ethyl cyanoacetate is deprotonated twice by excess NaH and reacts with 1,5-dibromopentane in a tandem alkylation-cyclization to form a six-membered ring. The final product is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Analysis of Product 4:**\n    *   The structure is a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents (-CN and -COOCH₂CH₃) on C1.\n    *   At room temperature, the rapid chair-flipping of the ring creates a time-averaged plane of symmetry passing through C1 and C4.\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the terminal **-CH₃** group are equivalent. (1 signal)\n        *   The two protons of the **-OCH₂-** group are enantiotopic due to the plane of symmetry. In a standard NMR experiment, they are chemically equivalent. (1 signal)\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n        *   The symmetry plane makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5.\n        *   **C2/C6 Protons:** The axial and equatorial protons on these carbons are diastereotopic. The two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent to each other. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   **C3/C5 Protons:** The same logic applies. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   **C4 Protons:** The two protons on C4 are diastereotopic and thus not equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n3.  **Total Signal Count:**\n    *   Total = (1 + 1) from ethyl group + (2 + 2 + 2) from ring = **8 signals**.\n\n4.  **Matching with Options:**\n    *   The options are A) 12, B) 10, C) 8, D) 5.\n    *   The calculated number of signals, 8, corresponds to option C.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1.

This number corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires a two-part analysis: first, determining the structure of the final product from the multi-step synthesis, and second, analyzing that structure to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms for its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Part 1: Determining the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe synthesis proceeds through four distinct steps:\n\n1.  **Acetic acid + Br₂, pyridine, acetic anhydride → Product 1:** This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid, a reaction analogous to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The α-carbon of acetic acid (the methyl group) is brominated.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Product 1 + ethanol, H₂SO₄ → Product 2:** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid group reacts with ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Product 2 + NaCN → Product 3:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Product 3 + excess NaH + 1,5-dibromopentane → Product 4:** This is a tandem reaction involving deprotonation, alkylation, and finally, cyclization.\n    *   The α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate (the CH₂ group) is acidic due to the two adjacent electron-withdrawing groups (-CN and -COOEt).\n    *   The strong base, sodium hydride (NaH), removes one of the acidic protons to form a carbanion.\n    *   This carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   The use of *excess* NaH ensures that the second, and now only, proton on that α-carbon is also removed.\n    *   The new carbanion undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the carbon chain to form a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Part 2: ¹H NMR Analysis of Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**\n\nThe core of the question is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in the final product. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃), attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** For the purpose of a standard room-temperature ¹H NMR spectrum, we consider the time-averaged structure that results from rapid chair-chair interconversion. This rapid flipping creates an *effective* plane of symmetry that passes through C1, the two substituents, and the opposite carbon, C4. Protons that can be interchanged by this symmetry operation are chemically equivalent, while those that cannot are distinct. We must also account for protons that are diastereotopic.\n\nLet's count the distinct proton environments based on this model:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are related by the effective plane of symmetry, making them enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes the ring positions C2 and C6 equivalent. Likewise, C3 and C5 are equivalent. C4 is unique as it lies on the plane.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** On any single carbon of the ring (e.g., C2), the axial and equatorial protons are in different chemical environments. They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. Because C2 and C6 are equivalent by symmetry, the two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** from these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons give rise to **2 distinct signals** (one for the two axial protons, one for the two equatorial protons).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two attached protons (one axial, one equatorial in any given conformation) are diastereotopic. They are in different chemical environments relative to the rest of the molecule and are not interchangeable. Therefore, they give **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Total from cyclohexane ring = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Conclusion: Total Number of Signals**\n\nBy summing the distinct signals from all parts of the molecule, we get:\n*   Signals from ethyl group: 2\n*   Signals from cyclohexane ring: 6\n*   **Total distinct signals = 2 + 6 = 8**\n\nThis calculated number matches option C from the provided list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (Product 4)**\n\nThe synthesis involves four sequential reactions. All candidate answers correctly identify the product of each step.\n\n1.  **Acetic acid → Product 1:** The reaction of acetic acid with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride is an α-bromination, a variant of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. This replaces one of the α-hydrogens with a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Product 1 → Product 2:** The reaction of bromoacetic acid with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) is a Fischer esterification, which converts the carboxylic acid into an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Product 2 → Product 3:** The reaction of ethyl bromoacetate with sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2), where the cyanide ion displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Product 3 → Product 4:** The reaction of ethyl cyanoacetate with *excess* sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane is a tandem alkylation-cyclization. The CH₂ group in ethyl cyanoacetate is acidic. The excess NaH ensures both protons are removed sequentially, allowing for two alkylations. The first deprotonation is followed by an attack on one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane. The second deprotonation is followed by an intramolecular attack on the other end of the carbon chain, closing a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe central task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry and stereochemistry at room temperature, where rapid conformational changes occur.\n\n**Careful Points for Analysis:**\n\n*   **Symmetry and Chirality:** The final product has two different substituents (-CN and -COOCH₂CH₃) on carbon 1 (C1) of the cyclohexane ring. This makes C1 a chiral center, and therefore the entire molecule is chiral and lacks a true plane of symmetry.\n*   **Conformational Averaging:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The ¹H NMR spectrum reflects a time-averaged structure.\n*   **Diastereotopicity:** Protons that are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation or rapid process are chemically distinct (diastereotopic) and give separate signals. This is crucial for CH₂ groups in chiral molecules or adjacent to stereocenters.\n\n**Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Signals:**\n\nThere are two chemically sound models to analyze this molecule, both of which, importantly, lead to the same conclusion.\n\n**Model A: The \"Effective Symmetry\" Approach (Most Common Textbook Method)**\nThis model assumes that rapid ring-flipping creates a time-averaged \"effective\" plane of symmetry passing through C1 and C4.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three -CH₃ protons are equivalent due to free rotation. **(1 signal)**\n    *   The two -OCH₂- protons are made enantiotopic by the effective symmetry plane. In a standard achiral solvent, they are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   The symmetry plane makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2/C6:** The axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic. The two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3/C5:** The same logic applies, giving **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** The two protons on C4 are diastereotopic and not interchangeable, giving **2 signals**.\n*   **Total (Model A):** 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = **8 signals**.\n\n**Model B: The \"Rigorous Chirality with Rapid Flip\" Approach**\nThis model correctly identifies the molecule as chiral from the outset.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three -CH₃ protons are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n    *   Because the molecule is chiral, the two -OCH₂- protons are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. **(2 signals)**\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   The lack of symmetry means C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6 are all in unique chemical environments.\n    *   Rapid chair-flipping averages the signals of the axial and equatorial protons on *each* carbon.\n    *   This results in five distinct, time-averaged signals, one for each of the five unique CH₂ groups. **(5 signals)**\n*   **Total (Model B):** 1 + 2 + 5 = **8 signals**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBoth rigorous and standard textbook analyses converge on the same result. The overwhelming consensus from the candidate answers, based on their chemical reasoning, is that there are 8 distinct hydrogen signals. The analyses leading to other numbers (like 12 or 5) are based on inconsistent assumptions or oversimplifications.\n\nThe calculated number of signals is 8. Matching this to the provided options:\nA) 10\nB) 12\nC) 5\nD) 8\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe synthesis involves four sequential reactions. The identity of the product at each step is crucial.\n\n1.  **Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.** This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid, a reaction analogous to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The product is **bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)**.\n2.  **Product 1 is heated with ethanol and sulfuric acid.** This is a classic Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid is converted to its ethyl ester. The product is **ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n3.  **Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide.** This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) displaces the bromide ion. The product is **ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n4.  **Product 3 is treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane.** This is a tandem reaction. Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, deprotonates the highly acidic α-carbon (the CH₂ between the cyano and ester groups). The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane. The use of *excess* NaH ensures the second α-proton is also removed, and the new carbanion performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the carbon chain to form a stable six-membered ring. The final product is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of the Final Product**\n\nThe central task is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry at room temperature, where the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion.\n\n**Careful Points for Analysis:**\n\n*   **Time-Averaged Symmetry:** Due to rapid ring flipping, the NMR spectrum reflects a time-averaged structure. This creates an *effective* plane of symmetry that passes through the substituted carbon (C1), the opposite carbon (C4), and the two substituents on C1.\n*   **Chemical Equivalence:** Protons that can be interchanged by a symmetry operation (like the effective plane) or by rapid rotation are chemically equivalent.\n*   **Diastereotopicity:** Protons on the same CH₂ group can be chemically distinct if they are diastereotopic. In a cyclohexane ring, axial and equatorial protons on the same carbon are diastereotopic.\n\n**Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Signals:**\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (**-CH₃**) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (**-OCH₂-**) are related by the effective plane of symmetry, making them enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The effective symmetry plane makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The axial and equatorial protons on C2 are diastereotopic. The symmetry makes the axial proton on C2 equivalent to the axial proton on C6, and the equatorial proton on C2 equivalent to the equatorial proton on C6. This results in **2 distinct signals** for these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons give rise to **2 distinct signals** (one for the two axial-like protons, one for the two equatorial-like protons).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (one axial-like, one equatorial-like) are not interchangeable. They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Calculation**\n\nBy summing the distinct signals from all parts of the molecule, we get:\n*   Signals from ethyl group: 1 + 1 = 2\n*   Signals from cyclohexane ring: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6\n*   **Total distinct signals = 2 + 6 = 8**\n\nThis analysis, which correctly balances the concepts of time-averaged symmetry and diastereotopicity, is the standard and most chemically sound approach for this type of problem. The result of 8 signals matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem requires a two-part analysis: first, determining the structure of the final product from the multi-step synthesis, and second, analyzing that structure to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms for its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe reaction sequence proceeds as follows, and is correctly identified by all candidate answers:\n\n1.  **Acetic acid → Product 1:** The reaction of acetic acid with bromine (Br₂) and a catalyst like pyridine is an α-bromination (a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky type reaction). This replaces one of the α-hydrogens with a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1 is Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).**\n\n2.  **Product 1 → Product 2:** The reaction of bromoacetic acid with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a strong acid catalyst (H₂SO₄) is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid is converted into an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2 is Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).**\n\n3.  **Product 2 → Product 3:** The reaction of ethyl bromoacetate with sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3 is Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).**\n\n4.  **Product 3 → Product 4:** This is the most complex step, a tandem alkylation-cyclization.\n    *   The protons on the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₂CH₃) groups are acidic. The strong base, sodium hydride (NaH), removes one of these protons to form a carbanion.\n    *   This carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    *   The problem specifies *excess* NaH, which removes the second, remaining acidic proton from the same carbon.\n    *   This new carbanion undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain to displace the second bromide ion and form a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **The final product (4) is Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.**\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe central task is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry at room temperature, where the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion.\n\n**Key Points for Analysis:**\n*   **Symmetry:** The rapid ring-flipping creates a time-averaged structure. For counting NMR signals, this structure can be considered to have an effective plane of symmetry that passes through the substituted carbon (C1), the opposite carbon (C4), and the two substituents on C1.\n*   **Stereotopicity:** Protons on the same carbon (geminal protons) are not necessarily equivalent. If they cannot be interchanged by a symmetry operation, they are diastereotopic and will give distinct NMR signals.\n\n**Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Signals:**\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (**-CH₃**) are equivalent due to rapid rotation around the C-C bond. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (**-OCH₂-**) are related by the effective plane of symmetry. This makes them enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The effective symmetry plane makes the ring positions C2 and C6 equivalent, and positions C3 and C5 equivalent.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The axial and equatorial protons on any single ring carbon are diastereotopic. The symmetry plane makes the two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** from these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons give rise to **2 distinct signals** (one for the two axial-type protons, one for the two equatorial-type protons).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the symmetry plane. However, its two attached protons (one axial-type, one equatorial-type) are diastereotopic because they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. They are not interchangeable. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\nSumming the distinct signals from all parts of the molecule:\n*   Signals from ethyl group: 1 + 1 = 2\n*   Signals from cyclohexane ring: 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) = 6\n*   **Total distinct signals = 2 + 6 = 8**\n\nThis analysis correctly balances the concepts of time-averaged symmetry from conformational changes and the principle of stereotopicity, leading to the most accurate answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part 1: Determining the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe synthesis involves four sequential reactions.

Our calculated value of 8 corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis problem requires a two-stage analysis. First, we must determine the chemical structure of the final product (4) by following the four-step reaction sequence. Second, we must analyze the structure of product 4 to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments, which corresponds to the number of signals in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Part 1: Determining the Structure of the Final Product**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid → Product 1**\n    *   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is treated with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride. This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid, analogous to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 → Product 2**\n    *   **Reaction:** Bromoacetic acid is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a Fischer esterification.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3**\n    *   **Reaction:** Ethyl bromoacetate is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) where the cyanide ion displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 → Product 4**\n    *   **Reaction:** Ethyl cyanoacetate is treated with *excess* sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane. This is a tandem reaction.\n        *   NaH, a strong base, removes an acidic proton from the α-carbon (the CH₂ between the -CN and -COOEt groups).\n        *   The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        *   The excess NaH removes the second α-proton.\n        *   The new carbanion undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the carbon chain to form a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Part 2: ¹H NMR Analysis of Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**\n\nThe key to this part is to analyze the molecule's symmetry to determine which protons are chemically equivalent. At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This leads to a time-averaged structure that we must analyze. There are two common and valid models for this analysis, both of which lead to the same conclusion.\n\n**Model A: The \"Effective Symmetry Plane\" Model (Standard Textbook Approach)**\n\nThis model assumes that rapid ring-flipping creates an effective plane of symmetry that passes through C1 (the substituted carbon), C4 (the opposite carbon), and the two substituents on C1.\n\n*   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal **-CH₃** group are equivalent due to free rotation. **(1 signal)**\n    *   The two protons of the **-OCH₂-** group are enantiotopic due to the plane of symmetry. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, they are chemically equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n\n*   **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   The symmetry plane makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The axial and equatorial protons on C2 are diastereotopic (chemically distinct). The symmetry makes the two axial protons (on C2 and C6) equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons equivalent to each other. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons give **2 signals** (one for the two axials, one for the two equatorials).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** The two protons on C4 are also diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Count:** 1 (CH₃) + 1 (OCH₂) + 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = **8 signals**.\n\n**Model B: The \"Chiral Molecule with Rapid Flip\" Model**\n\nThis model correctly identifies that C1 is a chiral center, so the molecule has no true plane of symmetry. It then considers the effect of rapid ring-flipping.\n\n*   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the **-CH₃** group are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n    *   The **-OCH₂-** group is adjacent to a chiral center, making its two protons diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. **(2 signals)**\n\n*   **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   Because there is no symmetry, all five CH₂ groups of the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are in unique chemical environments.\n    *   Rapid chair-flipping averages the signals of the axial and equatorial protons on each *single* carbon. Therefore, each of the five unique CH₂ groups gives one time-averaged signal. This gives **5 signals** from the ring.\n\n*   **Total Count:** 1 (CH₃) + 2 (OCH₂) + 5 (ring) = **8 signals**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBoth chemically sound models for analyzing the molecule's ¹H NMR spectrum converge on the same answer: **8 distinct hydrogen signals**. The provided candidate answers unanimously agree on this number, although they differ on the corresponding letter choice. Based on the question's options (A) 12, B) 10, C) 8, D) 5), the correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (Product 4)**\n\nThe problem describes a four-step organic synthesis. The identity of the final product is crucial for answering the question.\n\n1.  **Acetic acid → Product 1:** The reaction of acetic acid with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride is an α-bromination, a variant of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. This reaction replaces one of the α-hydrogens with a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1 is Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).**\n\n2.  **Product 1 → Product 2:** The reaction of bromoacetic acid with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid group is converted into an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2 is Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).**\n\n3.  **Product 2 → Product 3:** The reaction of ethyl bromoacetate with sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3 is Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).**\n\n4.  **Product 3 → Product 4:** This is the most complex step, involving a tandem alkylation and cyclization.\n    *   The protons on the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups are acidic. Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, removes one of these protons to form a carbanion.\n    *   This carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule, displacing a bromide ion.\n    *   The problem specifies the use of *excess* NaH, which is key. This ensures that the second, remaining proton on the α-carbon is also removed, forming a new carbanion.\n    *   This new carbanion undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the carbon chain to displace the second bromide ion and form a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4 is Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.**\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry and the chemical environment of each proton.\n\n**Key Points for Analysis:**\n\n*   **Conformational Averaging:** At room temperature, cyclohexane rings undergo rapid chair-chair interconversion. The NMR spectrum shows a time-averaged picture of these conformations.\n*   **Symmetry:** This rapid flipping creates an *effective* plane of symmetry that passes through the substituted carbon (C1), the opposite carbon (C4), and the two substituents on C1.\n*   **Stereotopicity:** Protons that are not interchangeable through rotation or symmetry are chemically distinct. Protons on the same CH₂ group can be distinct if they are diastereotopic.\n\n**Counting the Distinct Proton Environments:**\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (**-CH₃**) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (**-OCH₂-**) are related by the effective plane of symmetry, making them enantiotopic. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, they are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from the ethyl group: 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** On any single carbon (like C2), the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic (in different chemical environments). The symmetry plane makes the two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** from these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons give rise to **2 distinct signals** (one for the two axial protons, one for the two equatorial protons).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (one axial, one equatorial) are diastereotopic because they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. They are not interchangeable and are therefore chemically distinct. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Total from the cyclohexane ring: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Step 3: Final Calculation**\n\nBy summing the distinct signals from all parts of the molecule, we get:\n*   Signals from ethyl group: 2\n*   Signals from cyclohexane ring: 6\n*   **Total distinct signals = 2 + 6 = 8**\n\nThis analysis, which correctly applies the principles of conformational averaging and stereotopicity, is the standard and most chemically sound approach for this type of problem. The calculated number of signals is 8. This corresponds to option D in the provided list.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part 1: Determining the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe synthesis involves four sequential reactions. All candidate answers correctly identified the product of each step.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid → Product 1**\n    *   **Reaction:** Acetic acid is treated with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride. This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid, analogous to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 → Product 2**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 1 is heated with ethanol and sulfuric acid. This is a Fischer esterification, converting the carboxylic acid into an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) where the cyanide ion displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 → Product 4**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 3 is treated with *excess* sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane. This is a tandem alkylation and cyclization. The strong base (NaH) deprotonates the acidic α-carbon. The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane. The excess base removes the second α-proton, and the new carbanion performs an intramolecular attack to close a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product (4):** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyzing the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe central task is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals for ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry and the chemical environment of each proton.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Conformational Dynamics:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The observed NMR spectrum is a time-average of these conformations.\n*   **Symmetry:** The two substituents on C1 (a cyano group, -CN, and an ethoxycarbonyl group, -COOCH₂CH₃) are different. This makes C1 a chiral center, and the molecule as a whole is chiral, meaning it lacks a true plane of symmetry.\n*   **Stereotopicity:** Protons that are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation are chemically distinct (diastereotopic) and give separate NMR signals. This is particularly important for the two protons on a single CH₂ group in a chiral molecule or on a cyclohexane ring (axial vs. equatorial).\n\n**Counting the Distinct Signals:**\n\nThe most common and chemically sound method for analyzing such a molecule in an academic context is to consider the *time-averaged* symmetry and the resulting chemical equivalences.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   **-CH₃:** The three protons of the terminal methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **-OCH₂-:** Due to the rapid ring flipping, an *effective* plane of symmetry is established that passes through C1 and C4. This plane renders the two protons of the methylene group enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The effective plane of symmetry makes the ring positions C2 and C6 equivalent, and positions C3 and C5 equivalent.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** On any single carbon (like C2), the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic and thus distinct. The symmetry plane makes the axial proton on C2 equivalent to the axial proton on C6, and the equatorial proton on C2 equivalent to the equatorial proton on C6. This results in **2 signals** for these four protons (one for the axial pair, one for the equatorial pair).\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons give rise to **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the effective symmetry plane. However, its two protons (one axial-like, one equatorial-like) are not interchangeable. They are diastereotopic because they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. Therefore, they are chemically distinct and give **2 signals**.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\n\nSumming the signals from all distinct proton environments:\n*   Signals from ethyl group: 1 (-CH₃) + 1 (-OCH₂-) = 2 signals\n*   Signals from cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = 6 signals\n*   **Total Distinct Signals = 2 + 6 = 8**\n\nThis conclusion is robust, as alternative rigorous models that account for the molecule's chirality also converge on the answer of 8 signals. Based on the provided options (A) 12, B) 10, C) 8, D) 5), the correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part 1: Determining the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe synthesis involves four sequential reactions.

This plane passes through the substituted carbon (C1), the opposite carbon (C4), and the two substituents on C1.\n*   **Chemical Equivalence:** Protons that can be interchanged by a symmetry operation (like the effective plane) or by rapid bond rotation are chemically equivalent and produce a single NMR signal.\n*   **Diastereotopicity:** Protons on the same CH₂ group can be chemically non-equivalent if they cannot be interchanged by rotation or symmetry.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, incorporating the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Part 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nAll candidate answers correctly trace the four-step synthesis. The process is as follows:\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid → Product 1**: The reaction of acetic acid with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride is an **α-bromination**, a variant of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. This replaces a hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group with a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1**: Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 → Product 2**: The reaction of bromoacetic acid with ethanol and sulfuric acid is a **Fischer esterification**, which converts the carboxylic acid into an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2**: Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3**: The reaction of ethyl bromoacetate with sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a **nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2)**, where the cyanide ion displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3**: Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 → Product 4**: The reaction of ethyl cyanoacetate with *excess* sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane is a **tandem alkylation-cyclization**. The excess NaH ensures both acidic protons on the central carbon are used in two successive alkylations, leading to the formation of a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4**: Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe central task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires careful consideration of several key principles.\n\n**Careful Points for Analysis:**\n\n*   **Conformational Dynamics**: At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The ¹H NMR spectrum reflects a time-averaged structure, not a single static conformation.\n*   **Symmetry and Stereotopicity**: The final product has two different substituents (-CN and -COOCH₂CH₃) on carbon C1. This makes C1 a chiral center, and the molecule as a whole is chiral. This lack of true symmetry means that protons on the same CH₂ group (geminal protons) are often diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.\n*   **Analytical Models**: As shown in the candidate answers, there are two valid models for analyzing this molecule, both of which reassuringly lead to the same conclusion.\n\n    *   **Model A (The \"Effective Symmetry Plane\" Approach):** This common textbook method assumes that rapid ring-flipping creates a time-averaged *effective* plane of symmetry passing through C1 and C4.\n        *   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):** The three -CH₃ protons are equivalent (1 signal).

The two -OCH₂- protons are adjacent to a chiral center, making them diastereotopic and thus distinct (2 signals). Total = **3 signals**.\n        *   **Cyclohexane Ring:** The lack of symmetry means all five CH₂ groups (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are in unique chemical environments.

The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Product 3 + excess NaH + 1,5-dibromopentane → Product 4:** This is a tandem reaction involving two deprotonations and two alkylations, resulting in cyclization.\n    *   First, the strong base sodium hydride (NaH) removes one of the acidic protons from the carbon atom situated between the electron-withdrawing cyano (-CN) and ethoxycarbonyl (-COOEt) groups.\n    *   The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   The use of *excess* NaH ensures that the second, and now only, proton on that α-carbon is also removed.\n    *   This new carbanion undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the carbon chain to form a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe core of the question is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃), attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This rapid flipping creates a time-averaged structure that possesses an *effective* plane of symmetry. This plane passes through C1, the two substituents, and the opposite carbon, C4. Protons that can be interchanged by this plane of symmetry are chemically equivalent, while those that cannot are distinct. We must also account for diastereotopicity.\n\n*   **Counting the Distinct Signals:**\n\n    1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are related by the molecule's effective plane of symmetry, making them enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent and give a single signal. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   The effective plane of symmetry makes the carbons C2 and C6 equivalent, and C3 and C5 equivalent. C4 is unique as it lies on the plane.\n        *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** On any single carbon (like C2), the axial and equatorial protons are in different spatial environments. They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. Because C2 and C6 are equivalent by symmetry, the two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial-like protons are equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** from these four protons.\n        *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons give rise to **2 distinct signals** (one for the two axial-like protons, one for the two equatorial-like protons).\n        *   **Protons on C4:** The two protons on C4 are also diastereotopic. One is axial-like and one is equatorial-like, and they are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation. Therefore, they are chemically distinct. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n        *   *Total from cyclohexane ring = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Part 3: Final Calculation**\n\nBy summing the distinct signals from all parts of the molecule, we get:\n*   Signals from ethyl group: 2\n*   Signals from cyclohexane ring: 6\n*   **Total distinct signals = 2 + 6 = 8**\n\nThe question asks for the number of distinct hydrogen signals, which we have determined to be 8. The options provided are:\nA) 8\nB) 5\nC) 12\nD) 10\n\nThe calculated number of signals, 8, corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe synthesis proceeds through four distinct steps. The identity of the product at each step is crucial.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid → Product 1**\n    *   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is treated with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride. This is a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) type reaction, which causes bromination at the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group).\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 → Product 2**\n    *   **Reaction:** Bromoacetic acid is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid is converted into an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3**\n    *   **Reaction:** Ethyl bromoacetate is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). This is a classic Sₙ2 nucleophilic substitution, where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 → Product 4**\n    *   **Reaction:** Ethyl cyanoacetate is treated with *excess* sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane. This is a tandem reaction.\n    *   **Analysis:** The protons on the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups are acidic. The strong base (NaH) removes one proton to form a carbanion. This carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane. The use of \"excess\" NaH ensures the second proton on that carbon is also removed, and the resulting carbanion performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the carbon chain to form a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe central task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals for **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry at room temperature.\n\n**Careful Points for Analysis:**\n\n*   **Conformational Averaging:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping, which creates a time-averaged structure for NMR analysis.\n*   **Symmetry:** The final product has two different substituents (-CN and -COOCH₂CH₃) on C1. This makes C1 a chiral center, and the molecule technically lacks a plane of symmetry. However, two valid models can be used to analyze the structure, and both lead to the same conclusion.\n\n**Model A: The \"Effective Symmetry\" Approach (Common Textbook Method)**\n\nThis model assumes the rapid ring-flipping creates an *effective* plane of symmetry passing through C1 and C4.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent due to rotation. **(1 signal)**\n    *   The two protons of the methylene (-OCH₂-) group are enantiotopic due to the effective symmetry plane. In a standard achiral solvent, they are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   The symmetry plane makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2 & C6:** The axial and equatorial protons on any single carbon are diastereotopic (chemically distinct). The symmetry makes the two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) equivalent, and the two equatorial protons equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 & C5:** The same logic applies, giving **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** The two protons on C4 are diastereotopic and not equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Count (Model A):** 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = **8 signals**.\n\n**Model B: The \"Rigorous Chirality\" Approach**\n\nThis model correctly identifies the molecule as chiral and analyzes the consequences, assuming rapid ring-flipping.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n    *   The methylene (-OCH₂-) group is adjacent to a chiral center (C1), making its two protons diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. **(2 signals)**\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   The lack of symmetry means C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6 are all in unique chemical environments.\n    *   Rapid ring-flipping averages the axial and equatorial protons for each distinct carbon. This results in five separate signals, one for each of the five CH₂ groups on the ring. **(5 signals)**\n\n*   **Total Count (Model B):** 1 + 2 + 5 = **8 signals**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBoth chemically sound methods of analysis converge on the same result. The molecule has 8 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms. Based on the provided options:\nA) 5\nB) 10\nC) 12\nD) 8\n\nThe correct answer is 8.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first determine the structure of the final product by carefully following the multi-step reaction sequence. Then, I will analyze the symmetry of this final molecule to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments, which corresponds to the number of signals in its ¹H NMR spectrum. The key will be to consider the effects of conformational averaging (chair-flipping) and stereotopicity (enantiotopic vs. diastereotopic protons). Finally, I will sum the number of distinct signals and match it to the provided multiple-choice options to select the correct answer.\n\nHere is the step-by-step execution:\n\n1.  **Reaction Analysis to Find Product 4:**\n    *   **Step 1:** Acetic acid undergoes α-bromination (a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky type reaction) to yield **bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)**.\n    *   **Step 2:** Bromoacetic acid undergoes Fischer esterification with ethanol to yield **ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Step 3:** Ethyl bromoacetate undergoes an Sₙ2 reaction with sodium cyanide, yielding **ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Step 4:** Ethyl cyanoacetate is deprotonated twice by excess NaH and reacts with 1,5-dibromopentane in a tandem alkylation-cyclization to form a six-membered ring. The final product is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Analysis of Product 4:**\n    *   The structure is a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents (-CN and -COOCH₂CH₃) on C1.\n    *   At room temperature, the rapid chair-flipping of the ring creates a time-averaged plane of symmetry passing through C1 and C4.\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the terminal **-CH₃** group are equivalent. (1 signal)\n        *   The two protons of the **-OCH₂-** group are enantiotopic due to the plane of symmetry. In a standard NMR experiment, they are chemically equivalent. (1 signal)\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n        *   The symmetry plane makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5.\n        *   **C2/C6 Protons:** The axial and equatorial protons on these carbons are diastereotopic. The two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent to each other. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   **C3/C5 Protons:** The same logic applies. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   **C4 Protons:** The two protons on C4 are diastereotopic and thus not equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n3.  **Total Signal Count:**\n    *   Total = (1 + 1) from ethyl group + (2 + 2 + 2) from ring = **8 signals**.\n\n4.  **Matching with Options:**\n    *   The options are A) 12, B) 10, C) 8, D) 5.\n    *   The calculated number of signals, 8, corresponds to option C.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1.

The α-carbon of acetic acid (the methyl group) is brominated.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Product 1 + ethanol, H₂SO₄ → Product 2:** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid group reacts with ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Product 2 + NaCN → Product 3:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Product 3 + excess NaH + 1,5-dibromopentane → Product 4:** This is a tandem reaction involving deprotonation, alkylation, and finally, cyclization.\n    *   The α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate (the CH₂ group) is acidic due to the two adjacent electron-withdrawing groups (-CN and -COOEt).\n    *   The strong base, sodium hydride (NaH), removes one of the acidic protons to form a carbanion.\n    *   This carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   The use of *excess* NaH ensures that the second, and now only, proton on that α-carbon is also removed.\n    *   The new carbanion undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the carbon chain to form a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Part 2: ¹H NMR Analysis of Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**\n\nThe core of the question is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in the final product. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃), attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** For the purpose of a standard room-temperature ¹H NMR spectrum, we consider the time-averaged structure that results from rapid chair-chair interconversion. This rapid flipping creates an *effective* plane of symmetry that passes through C1, the two substituents, and the opposite carbon, C4. Protons that can be interchanged by this symmetry operation are chemically equivalent, while those that cannot are distinct. We must also account for protons that are diastereotopic.\n\nLet's count the distinct proton environments based on this model:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are related by the effective plane of symmetry, making them enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes the ring positions C2 and C6 equivalent. Likewise, C3 and C5 are equivalent. C4 is unique as it lies on the plane.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** On any single carbon of the ring (e.g., C2), the axial and equatorial protons are in different chemical environments. They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. Because C2 and C6 are equivalent by symmetry, the two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** from these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons give rise to **2 distinct signals** (one for the two axial protons, one for the two equatorial protons).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two attached protons (one axial, one equatorial in any given conformation) are diastereotopic. They are in different chemical environments relative to the rest of the molecule and are not interchangeable. Therefore, they give **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Total from cyclohexane ring = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Conclusion: Total Number of Signals**\n\nBy summing the distinct signals from all parts of the molecule, we get:\n*   Signals from ethyl group: 2\n*   Signals from cyclohexane ring: 6\n*   **Total distinct signals = 2 + 6 = 8**\n\nThis calculated number matches option C from the provided list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (Product 4)**\n\nThe synthesis involves four sequential reactions. All candidate answers correctly identify the product of each step.\n\n1.  **Acetic acid → Product 1:** The reaction of acetic acid with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride is an α-bromination, a variant of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. This replaces one of the α-hydrogens with a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Product 1 → Product 2:** The reaction of bromoacetic acid with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) is a Fischer esterification, which converts the carboxylic acid into an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Product 2 → Product 3:** The reaction of ethyl bromoacetate with sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2), where the cyanide ion displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Product 3 → Product 4:** The reaction of ethyl cyanoacetate with *excess* sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane is a tandem alkylation-cyclization. The CH₂ group in ethyl cyanoacetate is acidic. The excess NaH ensures both protons are removed sequentially, allowing for two alkylations. The first deprotonation is followed by an attack on one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane. The second deprotonation is followed by an intramolecular attack on the other end of the carbon chain, closing a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe central task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry and stereochemistry at room temperature, where rapid conformational changes occur.\n\n**Careful Points for Analysis:**\n\n*   **Symmetry and Chirality:** The final product has two different substituents (-CN and -COOCH₂CH₃) on carbon 1 (C1) of the cyclohexane ring. This makes C1 a chiral center, and therefore the entire molecule is chiral and lacks a true plane of symmetry.\n*   **Conformational Averaging:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The ¹H NMR spectrum reflects a time-averaged structure.\n*   **Diastereotopicity:** Protons that are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation or rapid process are chemically distinct (diastereotopic) and give separate signals. This is crucial for CH₂ groups in chiral molecules or adjacent to stereocenters.\n\n**Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Signals:**\n\nThere are two chemically sound models to analyze this molecule, both of which, importantly, lead to the same conclusion.\n\n**Model A: The \"Effective Symmetry\" Approach (Most Common Textbook Method)**\nThis model assumes that rapid ring-flipping creates a time-averaged \"effective\" plane of symmetry passing through C1 and C4.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three -CH₃ protons are equivalent due to free rotation. **(1 signal)**\n    *   The two -OCH₂- protons are made enantiotopic by the effective symmetry plane. In a standard achiral solvent, they are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   The symmetry plane makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2/C6:** The axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic. The two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3/C5:** The same logic applies, giving **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** The two protons on C4 are diastereotopic and not interchangeable, giving **2 signals**.\n*   **Total (Model A):** 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = **8 signals**.\n\n**Model B: The \"Rigorous Chirality with Rapid Flip\" Approach**\nThis model correctly identifies the molecule as chiral from the outset.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three -CH₃ protons are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n    *   Because the molecule is chiral, the two -OCH₂- protons are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. **(2 signals)**\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   The lack of symmetry means C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6 are all in unique chemical environments.\n    *   Rapid chair-flipping averages the signals of the axial and equatorial protons on *each* carbon.\n    *   This results in five distinct, time-averaged signals, one for each of the five unique CH₂ groups. **(5 signals)**\n*   **Total (Model B):** 1 + 2 + 5 = **8 signals**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBoth rigorous and standard textbook analyses converge on the same result. The overwhelming consensus from the candidate answers, based on their chemical reasoning, is that there are 8 distinct hydrogen signals. The analyses leading to other numbers (like 12 or 5) are based on inconsistent assumptions or oversimplifications.\n\nThe calculated number of signals is 8. Matching this to the provided options:\nA) 10\nB) 12\nC) 5\nD) 8\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe synthesis involves four sequential reactions. The identity of the product at each step is crucial.\n\n1.  **Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.** This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid, a reaction analogous to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The product is **bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)**.\n2.  **Product 1 is heated with ethanol and sulfuric acid.** This is a classic Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid is converted to its ethyl ester. The product is **ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n3.  **Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide.** This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) displaces the bromide ion. The product is **ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n4.  **Product 3 is treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane.** This is a tandem reaction. Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, deprotonates the highly acidic α-carbon (the CH₂ between the cyano and ester groups). The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane. The use of *excess* NaH ensures the second α-proton is also removed, and the new carbanion performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the carbon chain to form a stable six-membered ring. The final product is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of the Final Product**\n\nThe central task is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry at room temperature, where the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion.\n\n**Careful Points for Analysis:**\n\n*   **Time-Averaged Symmetry:** Due to rapid ring flipping, the NMR spectrum reflects a time-averaged structure. This creates an *effective* plane of symmetry that passes through the substituted carbon (C1), the opposite carbon (C4), and the two substituents on C1.\n*   **Chemical Equivalence:** Protons that can be interchanged by a symmetry operation (like the effective plane) or by rapid rotation are chemically equivalent.\n*   **Diastereotopicity:** Protons on the same CH₂ group can be chemically distinct if they are diastereotopic. In a cyclohexane ring, axial and equatorial protons on the same carbon are diastereotopic.\n\n**Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Signals:**\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (**-CH₃**) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (**-OCH₂-**) are related by the effective plane of symmetry, making them enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The effective symmetry plane makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The axial and equatorial protons on C2 are diastereotopic. The symmetry makes the axial proton on C2 equivalent to the axial proton on C6, and the equatorial proton on C2 equivalent to the equatorial proton on C6. This results in **2 distinct signals** for these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons give rise to **2 distinct signals** (one for the two axial-like protons, one for the two equatorial-like protons).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (one axial-like, one equatorial-like) are not interchangeable. They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Calculation**\n\nBy summing the distinct signals from all parts of the molecule, we get:\n*   Signals from ethyl group: 1 + 1 = 2\n*   Signals from cyclohexane ring: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6\n*   **Total distinct signals = 2 + 6 = 8**\n\nThis analysis, which correctly balances the concepts of time-averaged symmetry and diastereotopicity, is the standard and most chemically sound approach for this type of problem. The result of 8 signals matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem requires a two-part analysis: first, determining the structure of the final product from the multi-step synthesis, and second, analyzing that structure to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms for its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe reaction sequence proceeds as follows, and is correctly identified by all candidate answers:\n\n1.  **Acetic acid → Product 1:** The reaction of acetic acid with bromine (Br₂) and a catalyst like pyridine is an α-bromination (a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky type reaction). This replaces one of the α-hydrogens with a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1 is Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).**\n\n2.  **Product 1 → Product 2:** The reaction of bromoacetic acid with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a strong acid catalyst (H₂SO₄) is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid is converted into an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2 is Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).**\n\n3.  **Product 2 → Product 3:** The reaction of ethyl bromoacetate with sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3 is Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).**\n\n4.  **Product 3 → Product 4:** This is the most complex step, a tandem alkylation-cyclization.\n    *   The protons on the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₂CH₃) groups are acidic. The strong base, sodium hydride (NaH), removes one of these protons to form a carbanion.\n    *   This carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    *   The problem specifies *excess* NaH, which removes the second, remaining acidic proton from the same carbon.\n    *   This new carbanion undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain to displace the second bromide ion and form a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **The final product (4) is Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.**\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe central task is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry at room temperature, where the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion.\n\n**Key Points for Analysis:**\n*   **Symmetry:** The rapid ring-flipping creates a time-averaged structure. For counting NMR signals, this structure can be considered to have an effective plane of symmetry that passes through the substituted carbon (C1), the opposite carbon (C4), and the two substituents on C1.\n*   **Stereotopicity:** Protons on the same carbon (geminal protons) are not necessarily equivalent. If they cannot be interchanged by a symmetry operation, they are diastereotopic and will give distinct NMR signals.\n\n**Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Signals:**\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (**-CH₃**) are equivalent due to rapid rotation around the C-C bond. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (**-OCH₂-**) are related by the effective plane of symmetry. This makes them enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The effective symmetry plane makes the ring positions C2 and C6 equivalent, and positions C3 and C5 equivalent.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The axial and equatorial protons on any single ring carbon are diastereotopic. The symmetry plane makes the two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** from these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons give rise to **2 distinct signals** (one for the two axial-type protons, one for the two equatorial-type protons).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the symmetry plane. However, its two attached protons (one axial-type, one equatorial-type) are diastereotopic because they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. They are not interchangeable. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\nSumming the distinct signals from all parts of the molecule:\n*   Signals from ethyl group: 1 + 1 = 2\n*   Signals from cyclohexane ring: 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) = 6\n*   **Total distinct signals = 2 + 6 = 8**\n\nThis analysis correctly balances the concepts of time-averaged symmetry from conformational changes and the principle of stereotopicity, leading to the most accurate answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part 1: Determining the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe synthesis involves four sequential reactions.

The four protons on these two carbons give rise to **2 distinct signals** (one for the two axial protons, one for the two equatorial protons).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (one axial, one equatorial) are in different environments relative to the rest of the molecule. They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Total from cyclohexane ring = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Part 3: Final Calculation**\n\nBy summing the distinct signals from all parts of the molecule, we get:\n*   Signals from ethyl group: 2\n*   Signals from cyclohexane ring: 6\n*   **Total distinct signals = 2 + 6 = 8**\n\nThis analysis is robust, as alternative valid models (e.g., considering the molecule as chiral with rapid ring-flipping) also converge on the same answer of 8 signals.\n\nThe options are A) 8, B) 5, C) 10, D) 12. Our calculated value of 8 corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis problem requires a two-stage analysis. First, we must determine the chemical structure of the final product (4) by following the four-step reaction sequence. Second, we must analyze the structure of product 4 to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments, which corresponds to the number of signals in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Part 1: Determining the Structure of the Final Product**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid → Product 1**\n    *   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is treated with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride. This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid, analogous to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 → Product 2**\n    *   **Reaction:** Bromoacetic acid is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a Fischer esterification.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3**\n    *   **Reaction:** Ethyl bromoacetate is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) where the cyanide ion displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 → Product 4**\n    *   **Reaction:** Ethyl cyanoacetate is treated with *excess* sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane. This is a tandem reaction.\n        *   NaH, a strong base, removes an acidic proton from the α-carbon (the CH₂ between the -CN and -COOEt groups).\n        *   The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        *   The excess NaH removes the second α-proton.\n        *   The new carbanion undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the carbon chain to form a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Part 2: ¹H NMR Analysis of Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**\n\nThe key to this part is to analyze the molecule's symmetry to determine which protons are chemically equivalent. At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This leads to a time-averaged structure that we must analyze. There are two common and valid models for this analysis, both of which lead to the same conclusion.\n\n**Model A: The \"Effective Symmetry Plane\" Model (Standard Textbook Approach)**\n\nThis model assumes that rapid ring-flipping creates an effective plane of symmetry that passes through C1 (the substituted carbon), C4 (the opposite carbon), and the two substituents on C1.\n\n*   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal **-CH₃** group are equivalent due to free rotation. **(1 signal)**\n    *   The two protons of the **-OCH₂-** group are enantiotopic due to the plane of symmetry. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, they are chemically equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n\n*   **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   The symmetry plane makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The axial and equatorial protons on C2 are diastereotopic (chemically distinct). The symmetry makes the two axial protons (on C2 and C6) equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons equivalent to each other. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons give **2 signals** (one for the two axials, one for the two equatorials).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** The two protons on C4 are also diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Count:** 1 (CH₃) + 1 (OCH₂) + 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = **8 signals**.\n\n**Model B: The \"Chiral Molecule with Rapid Flip\" Model**\n\nThis model correctly identifies that C1 is a chiral center, so the molecule has no true plane of symmetry. It then considers the effect of rapid ring-flipping.\n\n*   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the **-CH₃** group are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n    *   The **-OCH₂-** group is adjacent to a chiral center, making its two protons diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. **(2 signals)**\n\n*   **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   Because there is no symmetry, all five CH₂ groups of the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are in unique chemical environments.\n    *   Rapid chair-flipping averages the signals of the axial and equatorial protons on each *single* carbon. Therefore, each of the five unique CH₂ groups gives one time-averaged signal. This gives **5 signals** from the ring.\n\n*   **Total Count:** 1 (CH₃) + 2 (OCH₂) + 5 (ring) = **8 signals**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBoth chemically sound models for analyzing the molecule's ¹H NMR spectrum converge on the same answer: **8 distinct hydrogen signals**. The provided candidate answers unanimously agree on this number, although they differ on the corresponding letter choice. Based on the question's options (A) 12, B) 10, C) 8, D) 5), the correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (Product 4)**\n\nThe problem describes a four-step organic synthesis. The identity of the final product is crucial for answering the question.\n\n1.  **Acetic acid → Product 1:** The reaction of acetic acid with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride is an α-bromination, a variant of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. This reaction replaces one of the α-hydrogens with a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1 is Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).**\n\n2.  **Product 1 → Product 2:** The reaction of bromoacetic acid with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid group is converted into an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2 is Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).**\n\n3.  **Product 2 → Product 3:** The reaction of ethyl bromoacetate with sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3 is Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).**\n\n4.  **Product 3 → Product 4:** This is the most complex step, involving a tandem alkylation and cyclization.\n    *   The protons on the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups are acidic. Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, removes one of these protons to form a carbanion.\n    *   This carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule, displacing a bromide ion.\n    *   The problem specifies the use of *excess* NaH, which is key. This ensures that the second, remaining proton on the α-carbon is also removed, forming a new carbanion.\n    *   This new carbanion undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the carbon chain to displace the second bromide ion and form a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4 is Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.**\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry and the chemical environment of each proton.\n\n**Key Points for Analysis:**\n\n*   **Conformational Averaging:** At room temperature, cyclohexane rings undergo rapid chair-chair interconversion. The NMR spectrum shows a time-averaged picture of these conformations.\n*   **Symmetry:** This rapid flipping creates an *effective* plane of symmetry that passes through the substituted carbon (C1), the opposite carbon (C4), and the two substituents on C1.\n*   **Stereotopicity:** Protons that are not interchangeable through rotation or symmetry are chemically distinct. Protons on the same CH₂ group can be distinct if they are diastereotopic.\n\n**Counting the Distinct Proton Environments:**\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (**-CH₃**) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (**-OCH₂-**) are related by the effective plane of symmetry, making them enantiotopic. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, they are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from the ethyl group: 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** On any single carbon (like C2), the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic (in different chemical environments). The symmetry plane makes the two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** from these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons give rise to **2 distinct signals** (one for the two axial protons, one for the two equatorial protons).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (one axial, one equatorial) are diastereotopic because they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. They are not interchangeable and are therefore chemically distinct. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Total from the cyclohexane ring: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Step 3: Final Calculation**\n\nBy summing the distinct signals from all parts of the molecule, we get:\n*   Signals from ethyl group: 2\n*   Signals from cyclohexane ring: 6\n*   **Total distinct signals = 2 + 6 = 8**\n\nThis analysis, which correctly applies the principles of conformational averaging and stereotopicity, is the standard and most chemically sound approach for this type of problem. The calculated number of signals is 8. This corresponds to option D in the provided list.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part 1: Determining the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe synthesis involves four sequential reactions. All candidate answers correctly identified the product of each step.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid → Product 1**\n    *   **Reaction:** Acetic acid is treated with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride. This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid, analogous to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 → Product 2**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 1 is heated with ethanol and sulfuric acid. This is a Fischer esterification, converting the carboxylic acid into an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) where the cyanide ion displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 → Product 4**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 3 is treated with *excess* sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane. This is a tandem alkylation and cyclization. The strong base (NaH) deprotonates the acidic α-carbon. The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane. The excess base removes the second α-proton, and the new carbanion performs an intramolecular attack to close a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product (4):** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyzing the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe central task is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals for ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry and the chemical environment of each proton.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Conformational Dynamics:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The observed NMR spectrum is a time-average of these conformations.\n*   **Symmetry:** The two substituents on C1 (a cyano group, -CN, and an ethoxycarbonyl group, -COOCH₂CH₃) are different. This makes C1 a chiral center, and the molecule as a whole is chiral, meaning it lacks a true plane of symmetry.\n*   **Stereotopicity:** Protons that are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation are chemically distinct (diastereotopic) and give separate NMR signals. This is particularly important for the two protons on a single CH₂ group in a chiral molecule or on a cyclohexane ring (axial vs. equatorial).\n\n**Counting the Distinct Signals:**\n\nThe most common and chemically sound method for analyzing such a molecule in an academic context is to consider the *time-averaged* symmetry and the resulting chemical equivalences.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   **-CH₃:** The three protons of the terminal methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **-OCH₂-:** Due to the rapid ring flipping, an *effective* plane of symmetry is established that passes through C1 and C4. This plane renders the two protons of the methylene group enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The effective plane of symmetry makes the ring positions C2 and C6 equivalent, and positions C3 and C5 equivalent.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** On any single carbon (like C2), the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic and thus distinct. The symmetry plane makes the axial proton on C2 equivalent to the axial proton on C6, and the equatorial proton on C2 equivalent to the equatorial proton on C6. This results in **2 signals** for these four protons (one for the axial pair, one for the equatorial pair).\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons give rise to **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the effective symmetry plane. However, its two protons (one axial-like, one equatorial-like) are not interchangeable. They are diastereotopic because they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. Therefore, they are chemically distinct and give **2 signals**.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\n\nSumming the signals from all distinct proton environments:\n*   Signals from ethyl group: 1 (-CH₃) + 1 (-OCH₂-) = 2 signals\n*   Signals from cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = 6 signals\n*   **Total Distinct Signals = 2 + 6 = 8**\n\nThis conclusion is robust, as alternative rigorous models that account for the molecule's chirality also converge on the answer of 8 signals. Based on the provided options (A) 12, B) 10, C) 8, D) 5), the correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part 1: Determining the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe synthesis involves four sequential reactions.

This creates a time-averaged structure that is used for NMR analysis.\n*   **Symmetry:** The most common and accepted model for this type of molecule assumes the rapid ring-flipping creates an *effective plane of symmetry*. This plane passes through the substituted carbon (C1), the opposite carbon (C4), and the two substituents on C1.\n*   **Chemical Equivalence:** Protons that can be interchanged by a symmetry operation (like the effective plane) or by rapid bond rotation are chemically equivalent and produce a single NMR signal.\n*   **Diastereotopicity:** Protons on the same CH₂ group can be chemically non-equivalent if they cannot be interchanged by rotation or symmetry. These are called diastereotopic protons and give rise to separate signals. This is a key point for cyclohexane rings.\n\n**Counting the Distinct Signals:**\n\nBased on the effective plane of symmetry model:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (**-CH₃**) are equivalent due to free rotation.
