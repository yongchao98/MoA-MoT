The goal is to identify how many of the listed compounds are optically active. A compound is optically active if it is chiral (its mirror image is non-superimposable) and it is not present as a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers (a racemic mixture). When a specific stereoisomer is named (e.g., using R/S notation), we assume it is a pure sample.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is an alkene. The atoms of the C=C double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This plane acts as an internal plane of symmetry for the molecule, making it achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This indicates that a single, specific enantiomer of a chiral molecule is being described. A pure enantiomer is, by definition, optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (C2 and C3) but is structurally symmetrical. The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in an internal element of symmetry (a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion). This makes it a **meso compound**, which is achiral despite having chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks any internal symmetry elements. It is a chiral molecule, and the name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, and two different paths around the ring (`-CH2-CH=CH-` vs. `-CH2-CH2-CH=`). The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the all-cis isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. This molecule is highly symmetrical and possesses multiple planes of symmetry (e.g., a plane passing through one C-OH group and the opposite CH₂ group). The presence of symmetry planes makes it achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An analysis of the structure `(CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl` reveals no chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. The molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n**Final Count:**\nThe compounds that are optically active are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the final answer, I will systematically analyze each compound for optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a 50:50 mixture of its enantiomers (a racemic mixture). A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which typically means it lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. When a specific stereoisomer is named (e.g., using (R) or (S) descriptors), it implies a pure sample that will be optically active if the molecule itself is chiral.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This is an alkene. The atoms of the C=C double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This plane acts as an internal plane of symmetry for the molecule, making it achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`, which define the absolute configuration at chiral centers. This indicates that a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule is being described. A single enantiomer is, by definition, optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (C2 and C3) but is structurally symmetrical. The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in an internal element of symmetry (a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion). This type of compound is called a meso compound, which is achiral despite having chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and the name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, and two different paths around the ring due to the double bond. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the all-`cis` isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring.

The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An analysis of this molecule's structure, `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`, reveals no chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. The molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n**Summary:**\nBased on the analysis, the following three compounds are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to systematically analyze each of the seven chemical compounds to determine if they will exhibit optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral (non-superimposable on its mirror image) and is not a meso compound or a racemic mixture. The presence of stereochemical descriptors like (R) or (S) in a name indicates that we are considering a single, specific stereoisomer, which will be optically active if the molecule itself is chiral.\n\nI will go through each compound one by one, determine its status, and count the number of optically active ones.

This indicates that a single enantiomer of a chiral compound is being described. A pure sample of a single enantiomer is, by definition, optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (at C2 and C3) but is symmetrical in its overall structure. The `(2R,3S)` configuration creates an internal plane of symmetry (or a center of inversion), making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and the name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, and two different paths around the ring (`-CH2-CH=CH-` vs. `-CH2-CH2-CH=`). The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the all-cis isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. This molecule is highly symmetrical and possesses multiple planes of symmetry. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An analysis of this molecule's structure, `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`, reveals no chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. The molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n**Summary:**\nBased on the analysis, the following three compounds are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
