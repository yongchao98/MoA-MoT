Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the multi-step synthesis pathway. The goal is to determine the structure of the final product, E.\n\n*   **Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**\n    *   This is a thioacetal protection of the aldehyde group in propionaldehyde.\n    *   Product A is **2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane** (or 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane, depending on the exact dithiol used, but this detail does not affect the final outcome).\n\n*   **Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n    *   This is a deprotonation using the strong base butyllithium (BuLi). The proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms is acidic and is removed to create a nucleophilic carbanion. This is a classic \"umpolung\" (polarity reversal) step.\n    *   Product B is the **lithiated carbanion of A**.\n\n*   **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks bromoethane in an Sₙ2 reaction, adding a second ethyl group.\n    *   Product C is **2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane**.\n\n*   **Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    *   This is the deprotection of the thioacetal, regenerating the carbonyl group.\n    *   Product D is the ketone formed from the central carbon and its two ethyl substituents: **3-pentanone** ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=O).\n\n*   **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    *   This is a Wittig reaction. A phosphorus ylide is first formed from 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr) and PPh₃/BuLi. This ylide, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃, then reacts with the ketone D (3-pentanone).\n    *   The reaction replaces the C=O double bond with a C=C double bond.\n    *   Product E is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**, with the structure (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂.\n\n**2. ¹³C-NMR Analysis of the Final Product (E)**\n\nThe final product is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene. To determine the number of ¹³C-NMR signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure of E:**\n    ```\n          CH₃-CH₂       CH₂-CH₃\n                 \\     /\n                  C = C\n                 /     \\\n          CH₃-CH₂       CH₂-CH₃\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** The molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses a center of symmetry at the midpoint of the C=C bond. This symmetry makes all four ethyl groups chemically equivalent.\n\n*   **Counting Unique Carbon Environments:**\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (C=C):** The two carbons of the central double bond are equivalent due to symmetry. This will produce **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** Since all four ethyl groups are equivalent, the four methylene carbons are also chemically equivalent. This will produce a **second signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃):** Similarly, the four terminal methyl carbons are all chemically equivalent. This will produce a **third signal**.\n\nIn total, there are three distinct types of carbon environments in the molecule. Therefore, the ¹³C-NMR spectrum of product E will show **3 signals**.\n\n**3. Careful Points and Conclusion**\n\n*   **Reaction Pathway:** The synthesis involves a sequence of well-established reactions: protection, umpolung, alkylation, deprotection, and the Wittig reaction. Correctly identifying each step is crucial.\n*   **Symmetry:** The key to solving the NMR part of the problem is recognizing the high degree of symmetry in the final product, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\n*   **Consensus:** All provided candidate answers, despite some confusion in labeling the final options, correctly deduce that the final product has 3 unique carbon environments and thus 3 ¹³C-NMR signals.\n\nThe calculated number of signals is 3. Matching this to the options provided in the question:\nA) 11\nB) 3\nC) 6\nD) 8\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step determination of the final answer.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the multi-step synthesis pathway.\n\n*   **Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**\n    This is a thioacetal protection of the aldehyde group in propionaldehyde. The product, A, is **2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane**.\n\n*   **Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n    Butyllithium (BuLi), a strong base, removes the acidic proton from the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (C2). This creates a nucleophilic carbanion, B, in a classic \"umpolung\" (polarity reversal) reaction.\n\n*   **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n    The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks bromoethane, adding a second ethyl group to the C2 position. The product, C, is **2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane**.\n\n*   **Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    This is a deprotection step where the thioacetal is hydrolyzed back to a carbonyl group. The product, D, is **3-pentanone** (diethyl ketone).\n\n*   **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    This is a Wittig reaction. A phosphorus ylide is formed from 3-bromopentane, which then reacts with the ketone (D). The C=O double bond of 3-pentanone is replaced by a C=C double bond from the ylide, which also has a (CH₃CH₂)₂C= structure. The final product, E, is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n### **2. ¹³C-NMR Analysis of the Final Product (E)**\n\nThe structure of the final product, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, is as follows:\n```\n      CH₃-CH₂   CH₂-CH₃\n               \\ /\n                C=C\n               / \\\n      CH₃-CH₂   CH₂-CH₃\n```\nTo determine the number of ¹³C-NMR signals, we must identify the number of chemically non-equivalent carbon atoms by analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a center of symmetry at the midpoint of the C=C double bond, which makes the four ethyl groups chemically equivalent.\n\n*   **Counting Unique Carbon Environments:**\n    1.  The two carbons of the central **C=C** double bond are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one signal**.\n    2.  The four methylene carbons (**-CH₂-**) of the ethyl groups are all chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. This will produce a **second signal**.\n    3.  The four terminal methyl carbons (**-CH₃**) of the ethyl groups are also all chemically equivalent. This will produce a **third signal**.\n\nIn total, there are three distinct types of carbon environments in the molecule. Therefore, the ¹³C-NMR spectrum of product E will show **3 signals**.\n\n### **3. Conclusion**\n\nThe unanimous conclusion from the chemical analysis performed by all candidate answers is that the final product, E, has **3** unique carbon environments.\n\nMatching this result with the options provided in the question:\nA) 6\nB) 11\nC) 3\nD) 8\n\nThe calculated number of signals (3) corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first synthesize the information from all the provided candidate answers to establish a consensus on the chemical transformations and the structure of the final product. All candidate answers correctly identify the reaction sequence and the final product, which provides a strong foundation.\n\nNext, I will analyze the structure of the final product, focusing on its symmetry, which is the key to determining the number of unique carbon environments for 13C-NMR spectroscopy. All candidate answers also agree on this analysis, concluding there are 3 unique signals.\n\nFinally, I will match this number of signals (3) to the options provided in the original question prompt (A) 3, B) 8, C) 6, D) 11). The discrepancies in the candidate answers' final letter choices are due to them being presented with different option orderings. I will resolve this by using the definitive list from the prompt. The correct answer is the option that corresponds to the number 3.\n\nI will then encapsulate this step-by-step reasoning into a Python script that prints the logical flow and the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the number of 13C-NMR signals for the final product E\n    by analyzing the reaction sequence and the symmetry of the product.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Determine the structure of the final product, E.\n    # The reaction sequence is:\n    # 1.

Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe problem requires us to follow a five-step organic synthesis to identify the final product, E, and then determine the number of signals in its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ ---> A**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a thioacetal protection of the aldehyde group in propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) using 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) and a Lewis acid catalyst (BF₃).\n    *   **Product A:** 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n*   **Step 2: A + BuLi ---> B**\n    *   **Reaction:** Butyllithium (BuLi) is a very strong base that removes the most acidic proton from A. This is the proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (C2), creating a nucleophilic carbanion. This is a classic example of \"umpolung\" (polarity reversal).\n    *   **Product B:** The lithiated carbanion of 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n*   **Step 3: B + Bromoethane ---> C**\n    *   **Reaction:** The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br) in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   **Product C:** 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n*   **Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ ---> D**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is the deprotection of the thioacetal group using mercuric chloride in aqueous acid, which hydrolyzes the thioacetal back to a carbonyl group.\n    *   **Product D:** The ketone formed is 3-pentanone (also known as diethyl ketone), (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O.\n\n*   **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi ---> E**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a Wittig reaction. First, a phosphorus ylide is formed from 3-bromopentane, triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), and BuLi. The ylide is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃. This ylide then reacts with the ketone D (3-pentanone). The oxygen of the ketone's carbonyl group is replaced by the carbon group from the ylide.\n    *   **Product E:** The reaction is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O + (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃ → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂. The final product is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹³C-NMR Spectrum of Product E**\n\nThe final product, E, is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene. To find the number of ¹³C-NMR signals, we must identify the number of chemically non-equivalent carbon atoms by analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure of E:**\n    ```\n          CH₃-CH₂       CH₂-CH₃\n                 \\     /\n                  C = C\n                 /     \\\n          CH₃-CH₂       CH₂-CH₃\n    ```\n\n*   **Careful Point: Symmetry Analysis**\n    The molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses a C₂ axis of rotation that passes through the center of the C=C double bond. This symmetry makes the four ethyl groups chemically equivalent.\n\n*   **Counting Unique Carbon Environments:**\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (=C<):** The two carbons of the central double bond are in identical chemical environments due to the molecule's symmetry. This will produce **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** Since all four ethyl groups are equivalent, the four methylene carbons are also chemically equivalent. This will produce a **second signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃):** Similarly, the four terminal methyl carbons of the ethyl groups are all chemically equivalent. This will produce a **third signal**.\n\nIn total, there are only three distinct types of carbon environments in the molecule. Therefore, the ¹³C-NMR spectrum of product E will show **3 signals**.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence consistently leads to 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene as the final product.

Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe problem outlines a five-step organic synthesis. The first step is to determine the structure of the final product, E.\n\n*   **Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**\n    *   This is a standard protection reaction. The aldehyde group of propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) reacts with 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst (BF₃) to form a cyclic thioacetal.\n    *   **Product A is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane.**\n\n*   **Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n    *   Butyllithium (BuLi) is a very strong base. It removes the most acidic proton from A, which is the proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (C2). This creates a nucleophilic carbanion. This reaction is a classic example of \"Umpolung\" (polarity reversal), often used in Corey-Seebach synthesis.\n    *   **Product B is the lithiated carbanion of 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane.**\n\n*   **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br) in an Sₙ2 reaction. This adds a second ethyl group to the C2 position.\n    *   **Product C is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane.**\n\n*   **Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    *   This step is the deprotection of the thioacetal group. The use of mercury(II) chloride in aqueous acid hydrolyzes the thioacetal, regenerating the carbonyl group.\n    *   The resulting ketone has two ethyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon. **Product D is 3-pentanone** (also known as diethyl ketone), (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O.\n\n*   **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    *   This is a Wittig reaction, which is used to convert a ketone or aldehyde into an alkene.\n    *   First, the Wittig ylide is formed. Triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) reacts with 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr), and the resulting phosphonium salt is deprotonated by BuLi to form the ylide: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃.\n    *   The ylide then reacts with the ketone D (3-pentanone). The oxygen atom of the ketone is replaced by the carbon group from the ylide.\n    *   The reaction is: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O + (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃ → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ + Ph₃P=O.\n    *   **Product E is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.**\n\n**2. ¹³C-NMR Analysis of the Final Product (E)**\n\nThe next step is to determine the number of signals in the ¹³C-NMR spectrum of product E, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene. This requires analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure of E:**\n    ```\n          CH₃-CH₂       CH₂-CH₃\n                 \\     /\n                  C = C\n                 /     \\\n          CH₃-CH₂       CH₂-CH₃\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** The molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses a center of symmetry at the midpoint of the C=C double bond, as well as a C₂ rotational axis perpendicular to the bond. This high degree of symmetry makes several groups of carbon atoms chemically equivalent.\n\n*   **Counting Unique Carbon Environments:**\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (C=C):** The two carbons of the central double bond are in identical chemical environments due to the molecule's symmetry. They will produce **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** All four ethyl groups are equivalent. Consequently, the four methylene carbons are also chemically equivalent.

The definitive list of options is the one provided in the original question prompt:\n    *   A) 3\n    *   B) 8\n    *   C) 6\n    *   D) 11\n\nBased on the unanimous and correct chemical analysis that the number of signals is 3, this value corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe first step is to determine the structure of the final product, E, by analyzing the five-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**\n    *   This reaction protects the aldehyde group of propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) using 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) to form a cyclic thioacetal.\n    *   Product A is **2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane**.\n\n*   **Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n    *   Butyllithium (BuLi) is a strong base that removes the acidic proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (C2). This creates a nucleophilic carbanion, a key step in Corey-Seebach \"umpolung\" chemistry.\n    *   Product B is the **lithiated carbanion of 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane**.\n\n*   **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks bromoethane in an Sₙ2 reaction, adding a second ethyl group to the C2 position.\n    *   Product C is **2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane**.\n\n*   **Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    *   This is a deprotection step. The thioacetal is hydrolyzed using mercuric chloride in aqueous acid to regenerate the carbonyl group.\n    *   Product D is **3-pentanone** (also known as diethyl ketone), (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O.\n\n*   **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    *   This is a Wittig reaction. First, a phosphorus ylide is formed from 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr), triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), and BuLi. The ylide is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃.\n    *   This ylide then reacts with the ketone D (3-pentanone). The oxygen atom of the ketone is replaced by the carbon group from the ylide.\n    *   The final product E is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂, which is named **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹³C-NMR Spectrum of Product E**\n\nThe next step is to determine the number of signals in the ¹³C-NMR spectrum of the final product, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene. This requires analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure of E:**\n    ```\n          CH₃-CH₂       CH₂-CH₃\n                 \\     /\n                  C = C\n                 /     \\\n          CH₃-CH₂       CH₂-CH₃\n    ```\n\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** The molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a center of symmetry at the midpoint of the C=C double bond and a C₂ axis of rotation perpendicular to the bond. This symmetry makes all four ethyl groups chemically equivalent.\n\n*   **Counting Unique Carbon Environments:**\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (C=C):** The two carbons of the central double bond are in identical chemical environments due to the molecule's symmetry. This will produce **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** Since all four ethyl groups are equivalent, the four methylene carbons are also chemically equivalent. This will produce a **second signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃):** Similarly, the four terminal methyl carbons of the ethyl groups are all chemically equivalent. This will produce a **third signal**.\n\nIn total, there are three distinct types of carbon environments in the molecule. Therefore, the ¹³C-NMR spectrum of product E will show **3 signals**.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe chemical analysis, which is unanimously agreed upon by all candidate answers, shows that the final product will have 3 signals in its ¹³C-NMR spectrum.

Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe core of the problem is to correctly identify the structure of the final product, E, by following a five-step synthesis.\n\n*   **Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**\n    *   This reaction protects the aldehyde group of propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) using 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT). This is a standard formation of a cyclic thioacetal.\n    *   **Product A is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane.**\n\n*   **Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n    *   Butyllithium (BuLi) is a very strong base that removes the most acidic proton from A. The proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (C2) is acidic (pKa ≈ 31) because the resulting negative charge is stabilized by the sulfur atoms. This creates a nucleophilic carbanion. This reaction is a classic example of \"umpolung\" (polarity reversal), often called the Corey-Seebach reaction.\n    *   **Product B is the lithiated carbanion of 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane.**\n\n*   **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br) in an Sₙ2 reaction, adding a second ethyl group to the C2 position.\n    *   **Product C is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane.**\n\n*   **Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    *   This is a deprotection step. The thioacetal is hydrolyzed using mercuric chloride in aqueous acid to regenerate the carbonyl group.\n    *   The C2 carbon of the dithiane, which is bonded to two ethyl groups, is converted back to a carbonyl.\n    *   **Product D is 3-pentanone** (also known as diethyl ketone), (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O.\n\n*   **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    *   This is a Wittig reaction. First, a phosphorus ylide is formed from 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr), triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), and BuLi. The ylide is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃.\n    *   This ylide then reacts with the ketone D (3-pentanone). The oxygen atom of the ketone's carbonyl group is replaced by the carbon group from the ylide.\n    *   The reaction is: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O + (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃ → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ + Ph₃P=O.\n    *   **Product E is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.**\n\nThis reaction pathway is correctly identified by all candidate answers, indicating a strong consensus on the structure of the final product.\n\n**2. ¹³C-NMR Analysis of the Final Product (E)**\n\nThe next step is to determine the number of signals in the ¹³C-NMR spectrum of E, which is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene. This depends on the number of chemically non-equivalent carbon atoms, which is determined by the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure of E:**\n    ```\n          CH₃-CH₂       CH₂-CH₃\n                 \\     /\n                  C = C\n                 /     \\\n          CH₃-CH₂       CH₂-CH₃\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** The molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a C₂ axis of rotation passing through the center of the C=C double bond and perpendicular to it. This symmetry makes the four ethyl groups chemically equivalent.\n\n*   **Counting Unique Carbon Environments:**\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (C=C):** The two carbons of the central double bond are in identical chemical environments due to the molecule's symmetry. This will produce **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** Since all four ethyl groups are equivalent, the four methylene carbons are also chemically equivalent. This will produce a **second signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃):** Similarly, the four terminal methyl carbons of the ethyl groups are all chemically equivalent. This will produce a **third signal**.\n\nIn total, there are only three distinct types of carbon environments in the molecule. Therefore, the ¹³C-NMR spectrum of 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene will show **3 signals**. All candidate answers also correctly reached this conclusion.\n\n**3.

Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe first task is to determine the chemical structure of the final product, E, by following the five-step synthesis.\n\n*   **Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**\n    *   This reaction protects the aldehyde group of propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) using 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT). This forms a cyclic thioacetal.\n    *   Product A is **2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane**.\n\n*   **Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n    *   Butyllithium (BuLi) is a strong base that removes the most acidic proton from A. This is the proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (C2), creating a nucleophilic carbanion. This is a classic Corey-Seebach \"umpolung\" (polarity reversal) reaction.\n    *   Product B is the **lithiated carbanion of 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane**.\n\n*   **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br) in an Sₙ2 reaction, adding a second ethyl group to the C2 position.\n    *   Product C is **2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane**.\n\n*   **Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    *   This step is the deprotection of the thioacetal group. The C-S bonds are hydrolyzed using mercuric chloride in aqueous acid, regenerating the carbonyl group.\n    *   Product D is the ketone formed from the C2 carbon and its two ethyl substituents, which is **3-pentanone** (diethyl ketone), (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O.\n\n*   **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    *   This is a Wittig reaction. First, a phosphorus ylide is formed from 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr), triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), and BuLi. The ylide is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃.\n    *   This ylide then reacts with the ketone D (3-pentanone). The oxygen atom of the ketone is replaced by the carbon group from the ylide.\n    *   The final product E is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂. The systematic name is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n**2. ¹³C-NMR Analysis of the Final Product (E)**\n\nThe structure of the final product, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, is highly symmetrical:\n```\n      CH₃-CH₂   CH₂-CH₃\n               \\ /\n                C=C\n               / \\\n      CH₃-CH₂   CH₂-CH₃\n```\nTo find the number of ¹³C-NMR signals, we must identify the number of chemically non-equivalent carbon atoms by analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a center of symmetry at the midpoint of the C=C double bond and a C₂ axis of rotation perpendicular to it. This high degree of symmetry makes all four ethyl groups chemically equivalent.\n\n*   **Counting Unique Carbon Environments:**\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (C=C):** The two carbons of the central double bond are in identical chemical environments due to symmetry. This will produce **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** Since all four ethyl groups are equivalent, the four methylene carbons are also chemically equivalent. This will produce a **second signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃):** Similarly, the four terminal methyl carbons of the ethyl groups are all chemically equivalent. This will produce a **third signal**.\n\nIn total, there are only three distinct types of carbon environments in the molecule. Therefore, the ¹³C-NMR spectrum of product E will show **3 signals**.\n\n**3.

This creates a nucleophilic carbanion, B, in a process known as \"umpolung\" or polarity reversal.\n\n*   **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n    The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks bromoethane in an Sₙ2 reaction, which adds a second ethyl group to the C2 position. The product, C, is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n*   **Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    This step is the deprotection of the thioacetal. The protecting group is removed using mercuric chloride in an aqueous acidic solution, which regenerates the carbonyl group. The resulting ketone, D, is 3-pentanone ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=O).\n\n*   **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    This is a Wittig reaction. A phosphorus ylide is first prepared from 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr), triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), and BuLi. This ylide, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃, then reacts with the ketone D (3-pentanone). The reaction replaces the C=O double bond of the ketone with a C=C double bond from the ylide. The final product, E, is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n**2. ¹³C-NMR Analysis of the Final Product (E)**\n\nThe structure of the final product, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, is highly symmetrical:\n```\n      CH₃-CH₂   CH₂-CH₃\n               \\ /\n                C=C\n               / \\\n      CH₃-CH₂   CH₂-CH₃\n```\nTo find the number of ¹³C-NMR signals, we must identify the number of chemically non-equivalent carbon atoms by analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry, including a C₂ rotational axis that passes through the center of the C=C double bond. This symmetry makes all four ethyl groups chemically equivalent.\n*   **Counting Unique Carbon Environments:**\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (C=C):** The two carbons of the central double bond are in identical chemical environments due to the molecule's symmetry.

This is the proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (C2), creating a nucleophilic carbanion. This is a classic example of \"umpolung\" (polarity reversal).\n    *   **Product B:** The lithiated carbanion of 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n*   **Step 3: B + Bromoethane ---> C**\n    *   **Reaction:** The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br) in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   **Product C:** 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n*   **Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ ---> D**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is the deprotection of the thioacetal group using mercuric chloride in aqueous acid, which hydrolyzes the thioacetal back to a carbonyl group.\n    *   **Product D:** The ketone formed is 3-pentanone (also known as diethyl ketone), (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O.\n\n*   **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi ---> E**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a Wittig reaction.
