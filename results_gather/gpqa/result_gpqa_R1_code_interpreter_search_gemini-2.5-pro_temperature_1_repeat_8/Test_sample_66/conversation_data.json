    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the System and State:**\n    *   The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. For a p-orbital, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=1$. So, for the two electrons, we have $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$.\n    *   The possible magnetic quantum numbers for each electron are $m_1 \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ and $m_2 \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The system is in a specific coupled angular momentum state given by $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. This means the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$, and the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum is $m=-1$.\n\n2.  **Understand the Measurement:**\n    *   A measurement of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed.\n    *   The eigenvalues of these operators are $m_1\\hbar$ and $m_2\\hbar$, respectively.\n    *   We want to find the joint probability of getting the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for *both* $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. This corresponds to the measurement outcome where $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\n3.  **Relate Coupled and Uncoupled States:**\n    *   The state of the system $|l, m\\rangle$ is given in the \"coupled basis.\" The measurement outcomes are defined by the states in the \"uncoupled basis,\" which are denoted as $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle$ or simply $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ since $l_1$ and $l_2$ are fixed at 1.\n    *   The probability of measuring a specific outcome $(m_1, m_2)$ when the system is in state $|l, m\\rangle$ is given by the square of the projection of the system state onto the outcome state:\n        $P(m_1, m_2) = |\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle|^2$\n    *   The term $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ is known as a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\n4.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum (The Selection Rule):**\n    *   The total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual components: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   This implies that the corresponding quantum numbers must also add up: $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    *   A fundamental property of the addition of angular momentum (and of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients) is that the coefficient $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ is non-zero *only if* the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is satisfied. If $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$, the coefficient is zero.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability for the Specific Outcome:**\n    *   The initial state of the system is $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. Here, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   The desired measurement outcome is $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Let's check if the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is satisfied for this outcome.\n    *   The sum of the outcome's magnetic quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Comparing this to the system's magnetic quantum number: $-2 \\neq -1$.\n    *   Since $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ must be zero.\n    *   Therefore, the probability of this measurement is:\n        $P(m_1=-1, m_2=-1) = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle|^2 = 0^2 = 0$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIt is impossible to measure $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ simultaneously when the system is in a state with a total magnetic quantum number of $m = -1$. The conservation of the z-component of angular momentum forbids this outcome. Thus, the probability is zero.\n\n<<<C>>>"
