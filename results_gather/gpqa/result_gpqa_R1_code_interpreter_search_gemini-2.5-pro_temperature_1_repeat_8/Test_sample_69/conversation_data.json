    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E.\n\n**1. Analyze the Clues to Identify the Chemical Species**\n\n*   **Clue 3: C + H₂O -> A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.**\n    This is the most chemically specific clue. The hydrolysis of a single substance (C) to regenerate a solid element (A) and produce two different acids is characteristic of a disproportionation reaction. This strongly suggests that C is a non-metal sub-halide.\n\n    Let's test candidates for the central element of A and C:\n    *   **Hypothesis: Sulfur.** Let A be Sulfur (S), a solid. A common sub-halide is disulfur dichloride, S₂Cl₂.\n        *   Hydrolysis of S₂Cl₂: 2 S₂Cl₂ + 3 H₂O → 3 S(s) + H₂SO₃(aq) + 4 HCl(aq).\n        *   This perfectly matches the clue:\n            *   **A = Sulfur (S)**, a solid element, is regenerated.\n            *   **C = Disulfur dichloride (S₂Cl₂)**, an orange-yellow liquid often described as reddish or amber. This fits \"bright red product C\".\n            *   **F = Hydrochloric acid (HCl)**, a strong acid.\n            *   **G = Sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃)**, a weak acid.\n    *   This hypothesis is very strong. Based on this, we can also identify gas **B** as **Chlorine (Cl₂)**, since C is a chloride.\n\n*   **Clue 4: D + B (1:1 ratio) -> H (solvent)**\n    *   We identified B as Cl₂. So, the reaction is: D + Cl₂ → H (solvent).\n    *   A common reaction of a gas (D) with chlorine in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent is the addition of chlorine to ethylene.\n    *   Reaction: C₂H₄ (gas) + Cl₂ (gas) → CH₂ClCH₂Cl (liquid).\n    *   This fits perfectly.\n        *   **D = Ethylene (C₂H₄)**.\n        *   **H = 1,2-dichloroethane**, a widely used solvent.\n\n*   **Clue 2: C + 2 equivalents of gas D -> produces the extremely hazardous product E**\n    *   We have identified C = S₂Cl₂ and D = C₂H₄.\n    *   Let's check the reaction: S₂Cl₂ + 2 C₂H₄ → E.\n    *   This is the well-known Levinstein process, the primary industrial method for producing mustard gas.\n    *   Reaction: S₂Cl₂ + 2 C₂H₄ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂ + S.\n    *   The product is **E = Mustard gas (bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide)**, which is infamous for its use as a chemical warfare agent and is extremely hazardous. The reaction also co-produces sulfur (A), which is consistent with the problem statement that E is produced.\n    *   This confirms the identities of C, D, and E.\n\n*   **Clue 1: reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C**\n    *   A = S (exists as S₈ rings), B = Cl₂, C = S₂Cl₂.\n    *   The actual synthesis is: S₈ + 4 Cl₂ → 4 S₂Cl₂.\n    *   The stoichiometric ratio is 1:4, not 1:8 as stated in the clue. This appears to be an error or a red herring in the problem description. However, all other four clues fit together with remarkable consistency, so we can confidently proceed with the identities we've deduced.\n\n**2. Summary of Identified Species**\n*   **A**: Sulfur (S)\n*   **B**: Chlorine (Cl₂)\n*   **C**: Disulfur dichloride (S₂Cl₂)\n*   **D**: Ethylene (C₂H₄)\n*   **E**: Mustard gas (S(CH₂CH₂)₂Cl)\n*   **F**: Hydrochloric acid (HCl)\n*   **G**: Sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃)\n*   **H**: 1,2-dichloroethane (C₂H₄Cl₂)\n\n**3. Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E**\n\n*   The question asks for the molecular symmetry group of **E = Mustard gas, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂**.\n*   The structure is Cl-CH₂-CH₂-S-CH₂-CH₂-Cl.\n*   This molecule is flexible due to rotation around the single bonds (S-C and C-C). To assign a point group, we consider its most stable conformation.\n*   The molecule consists of a central sulfur atom bonded to two chloroethyl groups. The C-S-C linkage is bent, similar to water or dimethyl ether.\n*   Due to the flexibility, several conformers exist. Gas-phase electron diffraction studies and computational chemistry have shown that the lowest energy (most stable) conformer does not have a plane of symmetry (like Cₛ or C₂ᵥ) but instead possesses a single two-fold axis of rotation (C₂).\n*   This C₂ axis passes through the sulfur atom and relates the two chloroethyl \"arms\" to each other. The presence of only a C₂ axis and the identity element (E) means the molecule is chiral and belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\n**4. Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe determined point group for E (mustard gas) is C₂. This corresponds to option D.\n\nA) D∞h (linear with inversion center, e.g., CO₂)\nB) C2v (planar with two mirror planes, e.g., H₂O)\nC) D4h (square planar, e.g., XeF₄)\nD) C2 (contains only a two-fold rotation axis)\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
