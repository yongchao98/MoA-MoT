    "An isotropic three-dimensional harmonic oscillator is described by the potential $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$, where $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$. The time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system can be separated in Cartesian coordinates into three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator equations.\n\nThe Hamiltonian is:\n$H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$\n$H = \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x^2\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 y^2\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 z^2\\right)$\n$H = H_x + H_y + H_z$\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator are given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n\nFor the three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the three independent oscillators:\n$E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n$E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$\n\nLet the principal quantum number be $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels are then given by:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n\nWe need to find the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state. Let's list the first few energy levels:\n\n1.  **Ground State:**\n    *   $n = 0$. The only possible combination of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ is $(0, 0, 0)$.\n    *   Energy: $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{3}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n    *   Degeneracy is 1.\n\n2.  **First Excited State:**\n    *   $n = 1$. The possible combinations for $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ are $(1, 0, 0)$, $(0, 1, 0)$, and $(0, 0, 1)$.\n    *   Energy: $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{5}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n    *   Degeneracy is 3.\n\n3.  **Second Excited State:**\n    *   $n = 2$. The possible combinations for $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ are:\n        *   Permutations of $(2, 0, 0)$: $(2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2)$ (3 states)\n        *   Permutations of $(1, 1, 0)$: $(1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1)$ (3 states)\n    *   Energy: $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{7}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n    *   Total degeneracy is $3 + 3 = 6$.\n\n4.  **Third Excited State:**\n    *   $n = 3$. We need to find all combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3.\n        *   Permutations of $(3, 0, 0)$: $(3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3)$ (3 states)\n        *   Permutations of $(2, 1, 0)$: $(2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2)$ (6 states)\n        *   The combination $(1, 1, 1)$ (1 state)\n    *   Energy: $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n    *   The total number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy (the degeneracy) is the sum of the number of states: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\nThe degeneracy $g_n$ of the $n$-th energy level can also be calculated using the formula:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\nFor the third excited state, $n=3$:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\nSo, for the third excited state:\n*   Energy is $\\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n*   The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) is 10.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10\nB) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3\nC) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3\nD) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10\n\nOption D matches our calculated energy and degeneracy.\n\n<<<D>>>"
