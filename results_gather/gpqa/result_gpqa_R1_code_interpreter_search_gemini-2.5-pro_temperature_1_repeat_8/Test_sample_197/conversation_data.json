    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** We have a solution containing cobalt(II) ions (`Co^2+`) and thiocyanate ions (`SCN-`). These ions react to form a series of complexes: `[Co(SCN)]^+`, `[Co(SCN)_2]`, `[Co(SCN)_3]^-`, and `[Co(SCN)_4]^(2-)`. The total concentration of all cobalt-containing species is given as `c(Co) = 10^-2 M`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the percentage of the **dithiocyanato cobalt(II)** complex, which is `[Co(SCN)_2]`, relative to the total cobalt concentration.\n\n3.  **Use Stability Constants:** The formation of these complexes is described by overall stability constants (`β_n`):\n    *   `Co^(2+) + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)]^+`\n        `β_1 = [[Co(SCN)]^+] / ([Co^(2+)] * [SCN^-]) = 9`\n    *   `Co^(2+) + 2 SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_2]`\n        `β_2 = [[Co(SCN)_2]] / ([Co^(2+)] * [SCN^-]^2) = 40`\n    *   `Co^(2+) + 3 SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_3]^-`\n        `β_3 = [[Co(SCN)_3]^-] / ([Co^(2+)] * [SCN^-]^3) = 63`\n    *   `Co^(2+) + 4 SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_4]^(2-)`\n        `β_4 = [[Co(SCN)_4]^(2-)] / ([Co^(2+)] * [SCN^-]^4) = 16`\n\n4.  **Formulate the Total Concentration:** The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free `Co^2+` ion and all its complexes:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^(2+)] + [[Co(SCN)]^+] + [[Co(SCN)_2]] + [[Co(SCN)_3]^-] + [[Co(SCN)_4]^(2-)]`\n\n5.  **Express Concentrations in Terms of [Co^2+]**: We can rearrange the stability constant equations to express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co^(2+)]`, and the free thiocyanate concentration, `[SCN^-]`.\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]^+] = β_1 * [Co^(2+)] * [SCN^-]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)_2]] = β_2 * [Co^(2+)] * [SCN^-]^2`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)_3]^-] = β_3 * [Co^(2+)] * [SCN^-]^3`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)_4]^(2-)] = β_4 * [Co^(2+)] * [SCN^-]^4`\n\n6.  **Develop the Distribution Coefficient (α):** The fraction of a specific complex, `[Co(SCN)_n]`, also known as its distribution coefficient `α_n`, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration. We are interested in `α_2` for `[Co(SCN)_2]`.\n    `α_2 = [[Co(SCN)_2]] / c(Co)`\n\n    By substituting the expressions from step 5 into the total concentration equation from step 4, we get:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^(2+)] * (1 + β_1[SCN^-] + β_2[SCN^-]^2 + β_3[SCN^-]^3 + β_4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\n    Now we can write the formula for `α_2`:\n    `α_2 = (β_2 * [Co^(2+)] * [SCN^-]^2) / ([Co^(2+)] * (1 + β_1[SCN^-] + β_2[SCN^-]^2 + β_3[SCN^-]^3 + β_4[SCN^-]^4))`\n\n    The `[Co^(2+)]` term cancels out, simplifying the equation:\n    `α_2 = (β_2 * [SCN^-]^2) / (1 + β_1[SCN^-] + β_2[SCN^-]^2 + β_3[SCN^-]^3 + β_4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\n    Note that the total cobalt concentration `c(Co) = 10^-2 M` is not needed for this calculation, as the fraction depends only on the free ligand concentration. We assume the given `[SCN^-] = 0.1 M` is the free equilibrium concentration.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Result:** Now, we plug the given values into the formula for `α_2`.\n    *   `[SCN^-] = 0.1` M\n    *   `β_1 = 9`, `β_2 = 40`, `β_3 = 63`, `β_4 = 16`\n\n    First, calculate each term in the denominator:\n    *   Term 0 (for `Co^(2+)`): `1`\n    *   Term 1 (for `[Co(SCN)]^+`): `β_1 * [SCN^-]^1 = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n    *   Term 2 (for `[Co(SCN)_2]`): `β_2 * [SCN^-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n    *   Term 3 (for `[Co(SCN)_3]^-`): `β_3 * [SCN^-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n    *   Term 4 (for `[Co(SCN)_4]^(2-)`): `β_4 * [SCN^-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\n    The denominator is the sum of these terms:\n    `Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n    The numerator is the term for the species of interest, `[Co(SCN)_2]`, which is `0.4`.\n\n    `α_2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n8.  **Convert to Percentage:** To get the percentage, multiply the fraction by 100:\n    `Percentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis matches option B. The following python code confirms the calculation.\n\n```python\n# Given values for the stability constants and ligand concentration\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_concentration = 0.1\n\n# The formula for the fraction of the n-th complex (alpha_n) is:\n# alpha_n = (beta_n * [L]^n) / (1 + sum(beta_i * [L]^i for i=1 to N))\n# We want to find the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2.\n\n# Numerator for alpha_2\nnumerator = beta2 * (scn_concentration ** 2)\n\n# Denominator is the sum of all relative concentrations\ndenominator = 1 + \\\n              (beta1 * scn_concentration**1) + \\\n              (beta2 * scn_concentration**2) + \\\n              (beta3 * scn_concentration**3) + \\\n              (beta4 * scn_concentration**4)\n\n# Calculate the fraction (alpha_2)\nalpha_2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha_2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the percentage of the `[Co(SCN)_2]` complex relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species. This percentage is equivalent to the distribution coefficient (`α_2`) of the `[Co(SCN)_2]` species, multiplied by 100.\n\nThe distribution coefficient `α_n` for a complex `ML_n` is given by the formula:\nα_n = ([ML_n]) / C_M\nwhere C_M is the total concentration of the metal ion M.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co(II) ion and all its thiocyanato complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^(2-)`\n\nUsing the overall stability constants (`β_n`), we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co^2+]` and the free thiocyanate ligand concentration `[SCN^-]`:\n`[Co(SCN)_n] = β_n * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^n` (where `β_0 = 1`)\n\nSubstituting these into the total concentration equation and factoring out `[Co^2+]` gives:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β_1[SCN^-] + β_2[SCN^-]^2 + β_3[SCN^-]^3 + β_4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\nThe fraction of the `[Co(SCN)_2]` complex, `α_2`, is:\n`α_2 = [Co(SCN)_2] / c(Co)`\n`α_2 = (β_2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β_1[SCN^-] + β_2[SCN^-]^2 + β_3[SCN^-]^3 + β_4[SCN^-]^4))`\n\nThe `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, so the fraction depends only on the free ligand concentration `[SCN^-]`, which is given as 0.1 M. The total cobalt concentration `c(Co) = 10^-2 M` is not needed for this calculation.\n\nThe formula simplifies to:\n`α_2 = (β_2 * [SCN^-]^2) / (1 + β_1[SCN^-] + β_2[SCN^-]^2 + β_3[SCN^-]^3 + β_4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\nNow we plug in the given values:\n*   `[SCN^-] = 0.1` M\n*   `β_1 = 9`\n*   `β_2 = 40`\n*   `β_3 = 63`\n*   `β_4 = 16`\n\nCalculate the numerator:\nNumerator = `β_2 * [SCN^-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\nCalculate the terms in the denominator:\n*   1\n*   `β_1 * [SCN^-]^1 = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n*   `β_2 * [SCN^-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 0.4`\n*   `β_3 * [SCN^-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 0.063`\n*   `β_4 * [SCN^-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 0.0016`\n\nSum the terms in the denominator:\nDenominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nCalculate the fraction `α_2`:\n`α_2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThe calculation performed by the Python code confirms this result (`16.916...%`). This value corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
