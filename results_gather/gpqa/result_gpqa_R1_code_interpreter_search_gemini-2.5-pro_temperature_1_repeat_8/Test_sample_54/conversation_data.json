    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Total Number of Protons (Integration)**\n\n*   The problem provides signals with the following integrations: 1H, 1H, 3H, and 3H.\n*   Summing these up gives a total of 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8 protons in the molecule.\n*   Now let's determine the total number of protons for each of the possible compounds:\n    *   **Propenyl acetate (CH₃COOCH=CHCH₃)**: The acetate part (CH₃CO) has 3 protons. The propenyl part (C₃H₅) has 5 protons. Total = 3 + 5 = 8 protons.\n    *   **Butenyl acetate (CH₃COOCH=CHCH₂CH₃)**: The acetate part (CH₃CO) has 3 protons. The butenyl part (C₄H₇) has 7 protons. Total = 3 + 7 = 10 protons.\n*   Since the NMR data shows a total of 8 protons, we can confidently eliminate both Cis-butenyl acetate (A) and Trans-butenyl acetate (B). The unknown compound must be a propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze Individual Signals**\n\nWe are left with two possibilities: Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. Let's analyze the chemical shifts, splitting patterns (multiplicity), and coupling constants (J) to distinguish between them.\n\nThe general structure is CH₃(a)-COO-CH(b)=CH(c)-CH₃(d).\n\n*   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This corresponds to a methyl (CH₃) group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (C=O), as found in an acetate.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** This indicates that these three protons have no adjacent non-equivalent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Assignment:** This signal is definitively from the acetate methyl group, CH₃(a). This is consistent with both remaining options.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** A single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is in the alkene (vinylic) region. The downfield shift is due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent electronegative oxygen atom. This proton is CH(b).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This proton is coupled to one other proton, which must be the other vinylic proton, CH(c).\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the most critical piece of information for determining stereochemistry. The coupling constant between two protons across a double bond is highly dependent on their geometry:\n        *   **Trans coupling:** J = 12-18 Hz (protons on opposite sides)\n        *   **Cis coupling:** J = 6-12 Hz (protons on the same side)\n    *   A J value of 16.0 Hz falls squarely in the *trans* range. This strongly indicates that the two vinylic protons, H(b) and H(c), are in a trans configuration.\n\n*   **Signal 3: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** A single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** Also in the vinylic region. This is the other vinylic proton, CH(c).\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This means the proton is split by two different sets of neighboring protons.\n        *   The **doublet (d)** comes from coupling to the single proton H(b). The coupling constant for this interaction would be 16.0 Hz.\n        *   The **quartet (q)** comes from coupling to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group, CH₃(d) (since n+1=4, n=3).\n\n*   **Signal 4: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** A methyl group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is a typical value for an allylic methyl group (a methyl group attached to a double bond). This is CH₃(d).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This indicates the methyl group is coupled to one adjacent proton, which is H(c).\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis of all signals is perfectly consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate. The key piece of evidence is the large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) between the vinylic protons, which is characteristic of a *trans* double bond. If the compound were Cis-propenyl acetate, this coupling constant would be significantly smaller (around 6-12 Hz).\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
