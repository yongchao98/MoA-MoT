As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the phenotypes of the single mutants:**\n    *   Wild-type (WT) has 100% resistance.\n    *   The `g2` mutant shows a complete loss of resistance (0%). This is the most severe phenotype, suggesting that the G2 gene product is absolutely essential for the resistance pathway.\n    *   The `g1` mutant shows a partial loss of resistance (75% remains). This means G1 contributes to resistance but is not as critical as G2.\n    *   The `g3` mutant also shows a partial loss of resistance (50% remains). G3's contribution seems more significant than G1's, but still less than G2's.\n\n2.  **Analyze the phenotypes of the double mutants to determine epistasis:**\n    *   Epistasis occurs when the phenotype of a double mutant (`genex_geney`) is identical to the phenotype of one of the single mutants (`genex` or `geney`). The gene whose phenotype is expressed in the double mutant is called **epistatic**.\n    *   **g1g2 mutant:** Resistance is 0%. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant (0%), not the `g1` single mutant (75%). Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**. This suggests G2 acts upstream of G1, or G2 is a master regulator required for the function of the entire pathway that includes G1.\n    *   **g2g3 mutant:** Resistance is 0%. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant (0%), not the `g3` single mutant (50%). Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G3**. This further supports the idea that G2 is an upstream regulator of G3 as well.\n    *   **Conclusion from epistasis:** Since G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and we know at least one gene is a transcription factor, G2 is the strongest candidate for the **transcription factor** that activates both G1 and G3.\n\n3.  **Analyze the interaction between G1 and G3:**\n    *   **g1g3 mutant:** Resistance is 10%. This phenotype is different from both the `g1` mutant (75%) and the `g3` mutant (50%). Because the phenotype is not the same as either single mutant, there is no epistasis between G1 and G3.\n    *   Instead, the double mutant phenotype (10% resistance) is much more severe than either single mutant phenotype. This is a classic example of a **synergistic interaction**. Synergy often occurs when two genes perform parallel or partially overlapping functions (a form of **gene redundancy**). When only one gene is knocked out, the other can partially compensate. When both are knocked out, the function is almost completely lost.\n    *   This supports a model where G1 and G3 act in two parallel branches of the resistance pathway, both of which are activated by the G2 transcription factor.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the given options based on the derived conclusions:**\n    *   **Conclusion 1:** G2 is the transcription factor. (This rules out option A).\n    *   **Conclusion 2:** G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.\n    *   **Conclusion 3:** G1 and G3 have a synergistic interaction, which can be described as partial gene redundancy. There is no epistasis between G1 and G3.\n\n    Let's re-examine the remaining options:\n    *   **A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.** Incorrect. G1 is not the transcription factor.\n    *   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.** Incorrect. G3 is not epistatic to G1.\n    *   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.** Incorrect. G1 is not epistatic to G3. Also, we cannot confirm pleiotropy from the given data.\n    *   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.** This option correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor and correctly describes the relationship between G1 and G3 as gene redundancy (which explains their synergistic effect). The final clause, \"G1 is epistatic towards G3,\" is incorrect based on the data. However, compared to the other options, this one contains the most correct and relevant conclusions derived from the experiment. It is the \"best fit\" answer, likely assuming a mistake in the final clause of the option.\n\n<<<D>>>"
