    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Reaction with Sodium Hydride (NaH) followed by Benzyl Bromide (BnBr)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains three functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagent 1 (NaH):** Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will react with the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH will deprotonate the hydroxymethyl group to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    *   R-CH2OH + NaH → R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + H₂(g)\n*   **Reagent 2 (Benzyl Bromide, BnBr):** The resulting alkoxide is a strong nucleophile. It will attack the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis, which serves to protect the alcohol group.\n    *   R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + PhCH₂Br → R-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph + NaBr\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted into a benzyl ether. The ketone and alkene groups are unreacted.\n    *   **Structure of Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction with p-Toluenesulfonyl Hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 1):** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **Reagents:** p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide, in the presence of an acid catalyst (HCl), reacts with ketones and aldehydes to form a tosylhydrazone. This is a condensation reaction where the ketone's oxygen atom is replaced by the =N-NHTs group.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone at the C1 position is converted into a tosylhydrazone.\n    *   **Structure of Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction with n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous Ammonium Chloride (NH₄Cl)**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 2):** The tosylhydrazone formed in the previous step.\n*   **Reagents:** This set of reagents is characteristic of the **Shapiro reaction**. The tosylhydrazone is treated with a strong base (at least two equivalents of n-BuLi) at low temperature.\n    1.  The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the acidic N-H proton of the hydrazone.\n    2.  The second equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates an α-proton (a proton on a carbon adjacent to the carbon of the original ketone). There are two α-carbons, C2 and C6. Deprotonation at the less substituted carbon (C6) is kinetically favored, especially at low temperatures.\n    3.  This dianion then collapses, eliminating lithium p-toluenesulfinate and nitrogen gas (N₂) to form a vinyllithium intermediate where the double bond is between C1 and C6.\n    4.  The final workup with aqueous ammonium chloride (a mild proton source) quenches the vinyllithium, protonating it to form a stable alkene.\n*   **Overall transformation:** The Shapiro reaction effectively reduces a ketone to an alkene, with the double bond forming at the less substituted position under kinetic control.\n*   **Product 3:** The C=N-NHTs group at C1 is replaced by a C=C double bond between C1 and C6. The benzyl ether and isopropenyl groups are unaffected.\n    *   **Structure of Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction with Palladium on Carbon (Pd/C) under a Hydrogen Atmosphere (H₂)**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 3):** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagents:** Catalytic hydrogenation with H₂/Pd-C is a powerful reduction method. It will reduce carbon-carbon double bonds and also cleave benzyl ethers via hydrogenolysis.\n*   **Transformations:**\n    1.  **Reduction of Alkenes:** Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will be hydrogenated (saturated).\n        *   Cyclohexene ring → Cyclohexane ring.\n        *   Isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] → Isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂].\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The C-O bond of the benzyl ether is cleaved by hydrogen, converting the ether back into an alcohol and producing toluene as a byproduct.\n        *   (Benzyloxy)methyl group [-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph] → Hydroxymethyl group [-CH₂-OH].\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group. Tracing their positions from the start, they are at C3 and C5 relative to the original ketone, which means they are in a 1,3-relationship to each other on the final cyclohexane ring.\n    *   **Structure of Product 4:** 3-isopropylcyclohexylmethanol. This name indicates a methanol (CH₃OH) where one hydrogen on the carbon has been replaced by a 3-isopropylcyclohexyl group. This is the same as a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) attached to a cyclohexane ring that has an isopropyl group at the 3-position.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing this final structure to the given options:\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. Involves different reactions and misses the hydrogenolysis step.\n*   B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This perfectly matches the structure derived from the reaction sequence.\n*   C) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if the final hydrogenolysis step did not occur.\n*   D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This structure implies the Shapiro reaction did not occur.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>"
