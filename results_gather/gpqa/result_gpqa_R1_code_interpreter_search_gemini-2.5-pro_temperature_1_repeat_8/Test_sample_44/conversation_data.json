    "This problem requires us to determine the energies of the ground state and the first two excited states for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles within a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n**1. Understand the System and Particles**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Since they have half-integer spin, they are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state for a particle in this well is defined by its energy level (principal quantum number `n`) and its spin projection (`m_s`, which can be +1/2 or -1/2). This means each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length `L` are given by:\n    `E_n = (n^2 * pi^2 * h_bar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)` where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines the energy unit `E = (pi^2 * h_bar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`. Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be simplified to:\n    `E_n = n^2 * E`\n\n**2. Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we must fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **n = 1 level:** We can place two particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n    *   Energy contribution = `2 * E_1 = 2 * (1^2 * E) = 2E`.\n*   **n = 2 level:** We place the remaining two particles in the next lowest level.\n    *   Energy contribution = `2 * E_2 = 2 * (2^2 * E) = 2 * 4E = 8E`.\n*   **Total Ground State Energy:**\n    *   `E_ground = (Energy from n=1) + (Energy from n=2) = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n    *   The configuration is (n=1)²(n=2)².\n\n**3. Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is typically achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   **Ground state configuration:** (n=1)²(n=2)².\n*   **Highest Occupied Level:** n=2.\n*   **Lowest Unoccupied Level:** n=3.\n*   We promote one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   **First excited state configuration:** (n=1)²(n=2)¹(n=3)¹.\n*   **Total First Excited State Energy:**\n    *   `E_1st = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)`\n    *   `E_1st = (2 * 1^2 * E) + (1 * 2^2 * E) + (1 * 3^2 * E)`\n    *   `E_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We must consider all possible excitations that would have a higher energy than the first excited state.\n\nLet's list the possible low-energy configurations and their total energies:\n*   **Ground State:** (n=1)²(n=2)² -> `2*E_1 + 2*E_2 = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n*   **First Excitation:** (n=1)²(n=2)¹(n=3)¹ -> `2*E_1 + 1*E_2 + 1*E_3 = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`. (This is the First Excited State).\n*   **Next Possible Excitation:** Consider promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: (n=1)¹(n=2)²(n=3)¹.\n    *   Energy = `1*E_1 + 2*E_2 + 1*E_3 = 1E + 2*(4E) + 9E = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n*   **Another Possible Excitation:** Consider promoting both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: (n=1)²(n=3)².\n    *   Energy = `2*E_1 + 2*E_3 = 2E + 2*(9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, ...), the lowest is 15E and the second lowest is 18E.\n\n*   **Total Second Excited State Energy:** `E_2nd = 18E`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Second Excited State: 18E\n\nThis sequence matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
