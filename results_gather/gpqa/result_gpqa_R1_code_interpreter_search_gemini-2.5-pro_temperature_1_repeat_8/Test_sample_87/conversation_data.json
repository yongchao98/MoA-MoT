    "The user is asking to identify a specific immunological process based on a described experiment.\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental setup:**\n    *   **Antigen:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins (delivered orally).\n    *   **Location:** The gastrointestinal tract, specifically Peyer's patches. Peyer's patches are secondary lymphoid organs crucial for initiating immune responses to intestinal antigens.\n    *   **Cells of interest:** Proliferating cells isolated from the Peyer's patches. Proliferation (clonal expansion) is a hallmark of an adaptive immune response after antigen recognition.\n    *   **Key finding:** High variability is observed in the *variable heavy chain gene* of these proliferating cells.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the options based on the key finding:**\n    *   **A) Class switching recombination:** This process alters the *constant* region of the heavy chain, not the variable region. It changes the antibody isotype (e.g., IgM to IgA), which affects its function, but not its antigen-binding site. Therefore, this does not explain the variability in the *variable* gene.\n    *   **B) VDJ recombination:** This process generates the initial diversity of the antigen receptor genes (including the variable heavy chain) in developing B cells within the *primary* lymphoid organs (bone marrow). This happens *before* the B cell encounters an antigen. The scenario describes cells that are already in a secondary lymphoid organ and are proliferating *in response* to an antigen. VDJ recombination is not the process causing variability at this stage.\n    *   **C) Complement activation:** This is a part of the innate immune system's protein cascade. It helps clear pathogens but does not involve any genetic changes in B cells.\n    *   **D) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This process specifically occurs in activated B cells within germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches) following antigen stimulation. SHM introduces point mutations at a high rate into the genes encoding the *variable regions* of antibodies (both heavy and light chains). This leads to \"high variability\" and is the basis for affinity maturation, where B cells with higher affinity antibodies are selected to proliferate. This perfectly matches the observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating cells in a Peyer's patch after an antigenic challenge.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The described process, where proliferating B cells in a secondary lymphoid organ exhibit high variability in their variable heavy chain gene after encountering an antigen, is the definition of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
