    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Part 1: Identifying Compound A (Does not show tautomerism)**\n\nThe question asks to identify which compound between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not exhibit tautomerism.\n\n1.  **Understanding Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one alpha-hydrogen. An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to an alpha-carbon, which is the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **Analyzing Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   The structure of p-benzoquinone is a six-membered ring containing two ketone groups at opposite positions (positions 1 and 4) and two carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   Let's identify the alpha-carbons. The carbons adjacent to the C=O at position 1 are C2 and C6. The carbons adjacent to the C=O at position 4 are C3 and C5.\n    *   In the benzoquinone ring, all these alpha-carbons (C2, C3, C5, C6) are part of a C=C double bond. They are sp²-hybridized and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them.\n    *   Since benzoquinone lacks alpha-hydrogens, it cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   The structure of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   Let's identify the alpha-carbons. For each carbonyl group, the adjacent carbons are alpha-carbons. For example, for the C=O at position 1, the alpha-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 each have two hydrogen atoms. These are alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   Because it possesses alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it tautomerizes to form its enol, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic compound and thus highly stable.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part 1:** Benzoquinone does not have alpha-hydrogens and thus does not show tautomerism. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does.\n    *   Therefore, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying Compound B (Shows optical isomerism)**\n\nThe question asks to identify which compound between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism.\n\n1.  **Understanding Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the -OH group.\n    *   The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   Since all four attached groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n    *   A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n3.  **Analyzing Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   The structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are in a *trans* position relative to the C=C double bond.\n    *   To check for chirality, we look for chiral centers or overall molecular asymmetry.\n    *   There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The carbons of the double bond are sp²-hybridized.\n    *   The molecule possesses a center of inversion and a plane of symmetry. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   Since dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part 2:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and is optically active. Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and not optically active.\n    *   Therefore, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Combination**\n\n*   Compound **A** (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound **B** (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
