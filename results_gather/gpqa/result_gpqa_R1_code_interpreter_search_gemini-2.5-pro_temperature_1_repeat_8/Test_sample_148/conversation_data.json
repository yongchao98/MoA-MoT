    "*   **Analysis of the Provided Information:**\n    1.  **Â¹H NMR Data:** The spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton.\n        *   They have similar chemical shifts.\n        *   Their combined integral is 1H, and they are roughly equal in size, suggesting a ~1:1 mixture of two species.\n        *   Spin-spin coupling is not the cause, meaning these two peaks represent two chemically non-equivalent environments for the alpha-proton.\n    2.  **LC-MS Data:**\n        *   The analysis shows two separate peaks in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace, indicating two different compounds or isomers that can be separated based on their physical properties (like polarity).\n        *   The fact that they separate even at \"elevated temperature\" suggests a significant energy barrier between the two forms.\n        *   The mass spectrometry (MS) data for both peaks is identical and matches the expected product. This rules out impurities with a different molecular weight (like precursors or side-products).\n\n*   **Evaluation of the Options:**\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other.\n        *   They have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   **NMR:** Because they are chemically non-equivalent, diastereomers will give different NMR spectra. It is expected that corresponding protons (like the alpha-proton) would have different chemical shifts, leading to two separate peaks. This matches the observation.\n        *   **LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereomers can be separated by standard chromatography techniques like LC. This would result in two peaks. Since they are isomers, they have the same mass, which would lead to identical mass spectra. This also matches the observation.\n        *   A very common source of diastereomerism in peptides is **cis-trans isomerism** about the amide bond. Due to the partial double-bond character of the C-N amide bond, rotation is restricted. This can lead to stable *cis* and *trans* conformers. These conformers are a type of diastereomer (specifically, atropisomers or rotamers). The alpha-proton's chemical environment is different in the cis and trans forms, explaining the two NMR peaks. The two conformers can also be separated by LC, explaining the two LC peaks.\n\n    *   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n        *   A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular weight. The MS data shows both peaks have the same mass as the expected product, ruling this option out.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.\n        *   In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable and give identical spectra. You would only see one peak for the alpha-proton, not two.\n        *   On a standard (achiral) LC column, enantiomers co-elute as a single peak.\n        *   Therefore, this option is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n        *   This is not a standard term, but if it implies a side reaction where, for example, an extra amino acid has been added, the product would have a different mass. This contradicts the MS data.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The evidence strongly points to the presence of two diastereomers. The two NMR peaks arise because the alpha-proton is in a different chemical environment in each diastereomer. The two LC peaks arise because the diastereomers have different physical properties and can be chromatographically separated. The identical mass spectra confirm they are isomers. In the context of a peptide, this phenomenon is most commonly caused by slow interconversion between cis and trans conformers around an amide bond. These conformers are diastereomers.\n\n<<<A>>>"
