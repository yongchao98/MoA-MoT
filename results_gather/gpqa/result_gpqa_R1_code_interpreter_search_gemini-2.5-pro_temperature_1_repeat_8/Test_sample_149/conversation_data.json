    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO) from the given NMR data.**\n\n*   **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The formula for DoU is: C + 1 - H/2 - X/2 + N/2\n    *   DoU = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O) or a ring.\n\n*   **Analyze the ¹H-NMR spectrum:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates that the aldehyde proton is coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1 rule, 2+1=3), meaning it's next to a CH₂ group. This confirms the presence of a -CH₂-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the CH₂ group adjacent to the aldehyde. The splitting, a doublet (d), confirms it's coupled to the single aldehyde proton (1+1=2). Its chemical shift is consistent with a benzylic position (a CH₂ group attached to a benzene ring).\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to two protons. Given the presence of nitrogen in the molecular formula, this signal is characteristic of a primary amine group (-NH₂).\n\n*   **Assemble the structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   One substituent is the -CH₂-CHO group.\n    *   The other substituent is the -NH₂ group.\n    *   The resulting structure is 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal.\n    *   Let's check if the formula matches: C₆H₄ (from the ring core) + C₂H₃O (from -CH₂CHO) + NH₂ = C₈H₉NO. The formula is correct.\n\nThe starting compound is **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reagents 1 & 2: NaNO₂ + HCl, then H₂O**\n    1.  The first step (NaNO₂ + HCl, at low temperature) is the **diazotization** of the primary aromatic amine. The -NH₂ group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n    2.  The second step (H₂O, often with warming) involves the **hydrolysis** of the diazonium salt. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (N₂) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group from water.\n    *   The product after these two steps is **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal**.\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    1.  The intermediate, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal, is an aldehyde that possesses acidic α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH₂- group).\n    2.  Aqueous KOH is a strong base, and the reaction is heated. These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**.\n    3.  **Mechanism:**\n        *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an α-proton from one molecule of the aldehyde to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. After protonation, this forms an aldol addition product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option C).\n        *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** Because the reaction is heated, the aldol addition product is not the final product. It undergoes dehydration (elimination of a water molecule). The acidic α-proton is removed, and the β-hydroxyl group is eliminated, forming a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n    4.  **Final Product:** The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal results in the formation of **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This structure matches option A.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reaction sequence converts 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal to 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal, which then undergoes a self-aldol condensation (due to the base and heat) to yield 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal as the final product.\n\n<<<A>>>"
