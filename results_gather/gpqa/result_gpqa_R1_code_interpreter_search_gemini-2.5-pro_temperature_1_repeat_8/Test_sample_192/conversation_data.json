    "The user wants to find the relationship between the number of stars per unit distance (`dN/dr`) and the distance (`r`), given the relationship between the number of stars per unit parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) and the parallax (`plx`).\n\n1.  **Given Information:** The number of stars varies with parallax as `1/plx^5`. This can be written as the number of stars per unit parallax interval:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5` or `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n\n2.  **Goal:** We need to find how the number of stars per unit distance (`dN/dr`) depends on the distance (`r`).\n\n3.  **Key Relationship:** The parallax (`plx`) of a star is inversely proportional to its distance (`r`). The formula is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n\n4.  **Connecting the Rates:** To convert the rate of change with respect to parallax to the rate of change with respect to distance, we use the chain rule from calculus:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the derivative `d(plx)/dr`:** We need to differentiate the parallax-distance relationship with respect to distance.\n    *   `plx = r⁻¹`\n    *   `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    *   For proportionality, we are interested in the magnitude, so `|d(plx)/dr| ∝ 1/r²`\n\n6.  **Substitute into the Chain Rule:** Now, we substitute the known proportionalities into the chain rule equation.\n    *   `dN/dr ∝ (dN/d(plx)) * (1/r²)`\n    *   We know `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵`, so:\n    *   `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx⁵) * (1/r²)`\n\n7.  **Express everything in terms of `r`:** To get the final relationship, we replace `plx` with its equivalent in terms of `r` (`plx = 1/r`).\n    *   `1/plx⁵ = 1 / (1/r)⁵ = 1 / (1/r⁵) = r⁵`\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute this back into our expression for `dN/dr`.\n    *   `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²)`\n    *   `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n    *   `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky per unit range of distance changes as `r³`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
