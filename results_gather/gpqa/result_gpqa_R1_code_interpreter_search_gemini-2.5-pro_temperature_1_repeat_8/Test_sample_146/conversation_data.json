    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical process and conservation laws.**\n    The problem describes the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) into four new particles, two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n    $p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$\n    In this particle interaction, both energy and momentum are conserved.\n\n2.  **Analyze the initial state (before annihilation).**\n    *   The system consists of a proton and an antiproton.\n    *   The antiproton is described as \"slowly moving\". This implies its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy.\n    *   It is standard in such problems to assume the proton is a stationary target. Therefore, the total initial kinetic energy of the system is negligible.\n    *   The total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n    *   The rest mass of a proton ($m_p$) is equal to the rest mass of an antiproton ($m_{\\bar{p}}$). The rest energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   Since both particles are at rest or moving very slowly, the total initial momentum ($P_i$) is approximately zero.\n\n3.  **Analyze the final state (after annihilation).**\n    *   The final state consists of four particles: $2A^+$ and $2A^-$.\n    *   Let the mass of each of these particles be $m_A$. We are given $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   By the conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the four final particles ($P_f$) must be equal to the initial momentum. So, $P_f \\approx 0$.\n    *   The total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the relativistic energies of the four A particles.\n    *   The problem asks for \"the velocity of particle A\", which suggests that all four product particles have the same speed, and thus the same energy. This corresponds to a symmetric distribution of the final products.\n    *   Let the energy of a single particle A be $E_A$. Then the total final energy is $E_f = 4 E_A$.\n\n4.  **Apply the conservation of energy.**\n    *   $E_i = E_f$\n    *   $1876 \\text{ MeV} = 4 E_A$\n    *   Solving for the energy of a single particle A:\n        $E_A = \\frac{1876 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the velocity.**\n    *   The total relativistic energy of a particle is given by the equation $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   We can find the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5633$.\n    *   Now, we solve for the velocity $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n        $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Substitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4091} = \\sqrt{0.5909}$\n        $\\beta \\approx 0.7687$.\n    *   Therefore, the velocity of particle A is $v = 0.7687c$.\n\n6.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    *   A) 0.77c\n    *   B) 0.91c\n    *   C) 0.86c\n    *   D) 0.96c\n    The calculated velocity $v \\approx 0.77c$ matches option A.\n\nTo ensure precision, we can use a more accurate value for the proton's rest energy ($m_p c^2 = 938.272$ MeV) and perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nm_p_c2 = 938.272  # Rest mass energy of a proton in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300      # Rest mass energy of particle A in MeV\n\n# Initial Energy: Annihilation of a proton and an antiproton at rest.\nE_initial = 2 * m_p_c2\n\n# Final Energy: Distributed equally among 4 particles of type A.\nE_A = E_initial / 4\n\n# Relativistic energy E_A = gamma * m_A_c2\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor gamma.\ngamma = E_A / m_A_c2\n\n# From gamma, calculate beta = v/c.\n# beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - 1 / (gamma**2))\n\nprint(f\"Velocity of particle A (as a fraction of c): {beta:.4f}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nVelocity of particle A (as a fraction of c): 0.7688\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculation confirms that the velocity is approximately 0.7688c, which rounds to 0.77c.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principles:** The annihilation process is governed by the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n2.  **Analyze the initial state (before annihilation):**\n    *   The system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is a common approximation in particle physics problems, meaning its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can assume both the proton and the antiproton are effectively at rest.\n    *   Therefore, the total initial momentum of the system is zero ($P_{initial} = 0$).\n    *   The total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton. The rest mass of a proton is equal to the rest mass of an antiproton.\n    *   The rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938 MeV.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the final state (after annihilation):**\n    *   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since $A^+$ and $A^-$ are a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same mass, $m_A$. We are given $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   By the conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero ($P_{final} = 0$).\n    *   The initial energy of 1876 MeV is converted into the total energy of the four A particles. To conserve momentum, the particles must fly off in different directions such that their vector momenta sum to zero. The problem asks for \"the velocity of particle A,\" implying that all four final particles have the same speed and thus the same kinetic energy. This happens in the most symmetric outcome where the energy is distributed equally among them.\n    *   The total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the relativistic energies of the four particles: $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A$.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    *   $1876 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times E_A$\n    *   Solving for the energy of a single particle A:\n        $E_A = \\frac{1876 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the velocity:**\n    *   The total relativistic energy of a particle is given by the formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   We can now find the Lorentz factor for particle A:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5633$\n    *   Next, we solve for the velocity $v$ (or more conveniently, $\\beta = v/c$) using the definition of $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n        $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Plugging in the value of $\\gamma$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4091} = \\sqrt{0.5909}$\n        $\\beta \\approx 0.7687$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.7687c$.\n    *   Comparing this result with the given options:\n        A) 0.77c\n        B) 0.91c\n        C) 0.86c\n        D) 0.96c\n    *   The calculated value is closest to 0.77c. The python code output of 0.7688 further confirms this.\n\n<<<A>>>"
