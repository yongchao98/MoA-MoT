    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This indicates a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents.\n*   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O)\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means one substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's denote it as -X.\n\nNow, let's assemble the pieces:\n*   We have a halogen substituent (-X).\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. The only stable and common functional group that fits this description is an **acetyl group** (-COCH3).\n\nSo, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. Its general structure is X-C6H4-COCH3. This structure has 6 carbons in the ring, 1 carbon in the carbonyl group, and 1 carbon in the methyl group, for a total of 8 carbons. This is consistent with all the information provided.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for the Deduced Structure**\n\nA haloacetophenone molecule (X-C6H4-COCH3) has two types of protons that will give signals in the 1H NMR spectrum:\n*   **Methyl Protons (-CH3)**: The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with. Therefore, they will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The chemical shift of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (a methyl ketone) is typically in the range of 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n*   **Aromatic Protons (-C6H4-)**: There are 4 protons on the benzene ring. Their chemical shift and splitting pattern depend on the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para).\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Data in the Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on our prediction:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet for 3 protons at 2.3 ppm. This perfectly matches our prediction for the acetyl methyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: These are two doublets in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm), each integrating to 2 protons. This pattern is characteristic of a **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring, where the symmetry results in two sets of equivalent protons. The total number of aromatic protons is 2H + 2H = 4H, which is correct.\n    *   This option is a strong candidate for para-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   `9.9 (1H, s)`: A signal around 9-10 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde** proton (-CHO), not a ketone. Our deduced structure is a ketone. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks signals in the typical aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The shifts at 4.6-4.8 ppm are too low for standard aromatic protons. Also, the `1.3 (2H, s)` signal does not match the 3H singlet of a methyl group. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   Similar to option C, this spectrum lacks the characteristic aromatic proton signals. The chemical shift of the 3H singlet at 1.3 ppm is too low for a methyl ketone. This option is incorrect.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nOnly option A provides a 1H NMR spectrum that is consistent with the deduced structure of a haloacetophenone. The pattern specifically points to a **para-substituted** isomer (e.g., 4'-chloroacetophenone or 4'-bromoacetophenone).\n\n<<<A>>>"
