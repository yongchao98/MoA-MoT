    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem involves two key concepts from modern physics:\n    *   **Radioactive Decay:** The number of particles `N` decreases exponentially over time. The decay rate is determined by the particle's mean lifetime.\n    *   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** A moving particle's lifetime appears longer to a stationary observer (in the lab frame) than its lifetime in its own rest frame (proper lifetime).\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equations:**\n    *   Let `N_0` be the initial number of particles created at the center.\n    *   The number of particles `N(t)` remaining after a time `t` in the laboratory frame is given by the decay law:\n        `N(t) = N_0 * exp(-t / tau_lab)`\n        where `tau_lab` is the mean lifetime of the particles as measured in the lab.\n\n    *   The lifetime in the lab frame (`tau_lab`) is related to the proper lifetime (`tau_0`, the lifetime in the particle's own rest frame) by the time dilation formula:\n        `tau_lab = gamma * tau_0`\n        where `gamma` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n    *   The time it takes for a particle to travel from the center to the detector wall (a distance `R`) is:\n        `t = R / v`\n        where `v` is the particle's velocity.\n\n    *   The problem states the particles are \"ultra-relativistic\". This means their velocity `v` is extremely close to the speed of light `c`. So, we can make the excellent approximation `v ≈ c`.\n        `t ≈ R / c`\n\n3.  **Combine the Equations to find the Fraction of Surviving Particles:**\n    *   The fraction `f` of particles that reach the detector is `N(t) / N_0`.\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `t` and `tau_lab` into the decay equation:\n        `f = N(t) / N_0 = exp(-t / tau_lab) = exp( -(R/c) / (gamma * tau_0) )`\n\n4.  **Find a Constant Relationship:**\n    *   Let's rearrange the equation to isolate the terms that change (`gamma` and `f`) from the terms that are constant (`R`, `c`, `tau_0`).\n    *   Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(f) = - (R / (c * tau_0)) * (1 / gamma)`\n    *   Rearrange:\n        `gamma * ln(f) = -R / (c * tau_0)`\n    *   To work with positive numbers, use the property `ln(f) = -ln(1/f)`:\n        `gamma * [-ln(1/f)] = -R / (c * tau_0)`\n        `gamma * ln(1/f) = R / (c * tau_0)`\n    *   The right side of the equation, `R / (c * tau_0)`, is a constant for this specific particle type and detector setup. Let's call it `K`.\n        `gamma * ln(1/f) = K` (Constant)\n\n5.  **Apply the Relationship to the Two Scenarios:**\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `gamma_1 = 20`, and the fraction reaching the wall is `f_1 = 1/3`.\n        `20 * ln(1 / (1/3)) = K`\n        `20 * ln(3) = K`\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:** We need to find `gamma_2` for which the fraction is `f_2 = 2/3`.\n        `gamma_2 * ln(1 / (2/3)) = K`\n        `gamma_2 * ln(3/2) = K`\n\n6.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`gamma_2`):**\n    *   Since both expressions are equal to the same constant `K`, we can set them equal to each other:\n        `gamma_2 * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)`\n    *   Now, solve for `gamma_2`:\n        `gamma_2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   We can use a calculator or a simple script to find the value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values from the problem\ngamma_1 = 20.0\nf_1 = 1.0/3.0\nf_2 = 2.0/3.0\n\n# The relationship is gamma * ln(1/f) = constant\n# So, gamma_2 * ln(1/f_2) = gamma_1 * ln(1/f_1)\n# Solving for gamma_2:\n# gamma_2 = gamma_1 * ln(1/f_1) / ln(1/f_2)\n\ngamma_2 = gamma_1 * math.log(1/f_1) / math.log(1/f_2)\n\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n\n54.1901366423993\n\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2.

    "The problem relates the survival fraction of decaying particles to their Lorentz factor. The survival fraction `f` after traveling a time `t` is given by the radioactive decay law:\n\n`f = exp(-t / τ_lab)`\n\nWhere `τ_lab` is the particle's mean lifetime in the laboratory frame.\n\nThis lab-frame lifetime is related to the particle's proper lifetime `τ₀` (its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the time dilation formula from special relativity:\n\n`τ_lab = γ * τ₀`\n\nwhere `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\nThe particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time `t` it takes to travel the detector radius `R` is:\n\n`t ≈ R / c`\n\nSubstituting the expressions for `t` and `τ_lab` into the survival fraction equation, we get:\n\n`f = exp( -(R/c) / (γ * τ₀) )`\n\nNow, let's rearrange this equation by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n`ln(f) = -R / (c * γ * τ₀)`\n\nMultiplying both sides by `γ`, we find a key relationship:\n\n`γ * ln(f) = -R / (c * τ₀)`\n\nThe right side of the equation, `-R / (c * τ₀)`, is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup. Therefore, for any two scenarios, the product `γ * ln(f)` must be the same.\n\n`γ₁ * ln(f₁) = γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\nWe are given two scenarios:\n*   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, and `f₁ = 1/3` (one third of particles reach the detector).\n*   **Scenario 2:** `γ₂ = ?`, and `f₂ = 2/3` (two thirds of particles reach the detector).\n\nNow we can plug these values into our relationship and solve for `γ₂`:\n\n`20 * ln(1/3) = γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(1/3) / ln(2/3)`\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms (`ln(1/x) = -ln(x)` and `ln(x/y) = ln(x) - ln(y)`):\n\n`γ₂ = 20 * [-ln(3)] / [-ln(3/2)]`\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\nCalculating the values:\n`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n`ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThis value is very close to 54. The Python code execution confirmed this calculation, yielding a result of approximately 54.19.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 54\nB) 28\nC) 68\nD) 40\n\nThe closest answer is 54.\n\n<<<A>>>"
