    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of distinct signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction is an α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. Acetic acid has one α-carbon with three hydrogens. One of these α-hydrogens will be replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl 2-bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction (SN2). The cyanide ion (CN⁻), a good nucleophile, displaces the bromide ion from the primary carbon.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a variation of the malonic ester synthesis used for ring formation.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate. The hydrogens on the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOCH2CH3) groups are acidic because the resulting anion is stabilized by both groups.\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + H₂\n    2.  **First Alkylation (Intermolecular):** The resulting carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The product from the first alkylation still has one acidic α-hydrogen. Since NaH is in excess, this proton is also removed.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → Na⁺[NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ + H₂\n    4.  **Second Alkylation (Intramolecular):** The newly formed carbanion attacks the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a cyclic compound. The ring is formed from the α-carbon and the five carbons of the pentane chain, resulting in a 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-(ethoxycarbonyl)cyclohexane.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n```\n      EtOOC   CN\n           \\ /\n            C(1)\n           / \\\n      H2C(6)--CH2(2)\n      |       |\n      H2C(5)--CH2(3)\n           \\ /\n           CH2(4)\n```\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry and the chemical equivalence of the protons. The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens, which requires us to identify all sets of protons that are not interchangeable through symmetry operations or rapid conformational changes. This means we should consider the protons in a fixed chair conformation, where axial and equatorial positions are distinct.\n\n1.  **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ethoxycarbonyl group. This symmetry makes the right and left sides of the ring equivalent.\n    *   C2 is equivalent to C6.\n    *   C3 is equivalent to C5.\n\n2.  **Proton Environments:**\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-OCH2CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH3) group are equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene (-OCH2-) group are enantiotopic because they are related by the molecule's plane of symmetry. Enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR solvent. They will produce **1 signal**.\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons (in a static chair conformation):**\n        *   On any given -CH2- group in a substituted cyclohexane ring, the axial (ax) and equatorial (eq) protons are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.\n        *   **C2 and C6:** These carbons are equivalent. The two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other. The two equatorial protons are also equivalent to each other. However, the axial set and the equatorial set are distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   **C3 and C5:** Similarly, these carbons are equivalent. The axial protons on C3/C5 give one signal, and the equatorial protons give another. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   **C4:** This carbon is unique. Its axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic and distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n3.  **Total Count:**\n    *   Ethyl -CH3: 1 signal\n    *   Ethyl -OCH2-: 1 signal\n    *   Ring C2/C6 protons: 2 signals (ax and eq)\n    *   Ring C3/C5 protons: 2 signals (ax and eq)\n    *   Ring C4 protons: 2 signals (ax and eq)\n    *   **Total = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 distinct hydrogen signals.**\n\nThe note in the question, \"...the desired answer is the number of chemically distinct hydrogens,\" supports this detailed analysis over a simplified model that assumes fast ring-flipping (which would average the axial/equatorial signals and lead to only 5 signals).\n\n<<<B>>>"
