    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane for the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$.\n\n**1. Define the Operator and the Direction**\n\nThe operator $\\vec{P}$ is given by its components:\n$P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n$P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n$P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\nThis is the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S}$ for a spin-1/2 particle like a muon.\n\nThe direction vector $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane. We can parameterize this direction using a single angle $\\theta$, which represents the angle the vector makes with the positive z-axis. The components of the unit vector $\\vec{n}$ are:\n$n_x = \\sin\\theta$\n$n_y = 0$\n$n_z = \\cos\\theta$\nSo, $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n**2. Construct the Operator along the Direction** $\\vec{n}$\n\nThe operator for the component of $\\vec{P}$ along $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n$P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n$P_n = (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x) \\sin\\theta + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y) (0) + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z) \\cos\\theta$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta)$\n\nNow, substitute the matrix representations of the Pauli matrices $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_z$:\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**3. Set up the Eigenvalue Equation**\n\nWe are looking for the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ that corresponds to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n$P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe can cancel the factor of $\\hbar/2$ from both sides:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis matrix equation gives us a system of two linear equations:\n1.  $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n2.  $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\n**4. Solve for the Eigenvector Components**\n\nLet's solve the first equation for the ratio $b/a$:\n$b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta$\n$b \\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\nNow, we use the trigonometric half-angle identities:\n*   $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n*   $\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $b/a$:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nSo, we have $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$. The eigenvector is of the form:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = a \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**5. Normalize the Eigenvector**\n\nTo find the value of $a$, we normalize the eigenvector, meaning we set its norm (length) to 1. The squared norm is $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$.\n$|a|^2 \\left( 1^2 + (\\tan(\\theta/2))^2 \\right) = 1$\n$|a|^2 (1 + \\tan^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\n\nUsing the identity $1 + \\tan^2(x) = \\sec^2(x)$:\n$|a|^2 \\sec^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\n$|a|^2 = \\frac{1}{\\sec^2(\\theta/2)} = \\cos^2(\\theta/2)$\n$|a| = |\\cos(\\theta/2)|$\n\nBy convention, we choose the normalization constant to be real and positive, so we take $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$. Now we find $b$:\n$b = a \\tan(\\theta/2) = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\sin(\\theta/2)$\n\nThus, the normalized eigenvector is:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe elements of this eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. Comparing this with the given options, we find that it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
