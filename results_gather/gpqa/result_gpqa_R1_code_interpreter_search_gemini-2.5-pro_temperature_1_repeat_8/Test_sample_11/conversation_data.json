    "This problem involves the decay of a stationary particle, so we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum in the context of special relativity.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The decay is `Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu`.\n2.  **Define the system's state before and after the decay.** We'll work in a system of units where the speed of light `c=1`. In these units, mass, momentum, and energy are all measured in MeV.\n\n    *   **Initial State:** The pion (`Pi(+)`) is at rest.\n        *   Total energy before, `E_initial = m_pi` (its rest energy).\n        *   Total momentum before, `p_initial = 0`.\n        *   Given `m_pi = 139.6 MeV`.\n\n    *   **Final State:** The products are a muon (`mu(+)`) and a neutrino (`nu`).\n        *   Let their total energies be `E_mu` and `E_nu`.\n        *   Let their momenta be `p_mu` and `p_nu`.\n        *   Total energy after, `E_final = E_mu + E_nu`.\n        *   Total momentum after, `p_final = p_mu + p_nu`.\n        *   Given `m_mu = 105.7 MeV`. We assume the neutrino is massless, so `m_nu = 0`.\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Momentum:**\n    `p_initial = p_final`\n    `0 = p_mu + p_nu`\n    This implies that the muon and the neutrino move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    Let `p = |p_mu| = |p_nu|`.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    `E_initial = E_final`\n    `m_pi = E_mu + E_nu`  (Equation 1)\n\n5.  **Use the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E² = p² + m²`.\n\n    *   For the muon (`mu+`):\n        `E_mu² = p² + m_mu²`  (Equation 2)\n\n    *   For the massless neutrino (`nu`):\n        `E_nu² = p² + m_nu² = p² + 0`\n        `E_nu = p`  (Equation 3)\n\n6.  **Solve the system of equations:**\n    *   From Equation 3, we know the neutrino's energy is equal to its momentum. Since it's massless, its total energy is all kinetic energy. So, `KE_nu = E_nu = p`.\n    *   Substitute `p = E_nu` into Equation 2:\n        `E_mu² = E_nu² + m_mu²`\n    *   From Equation 1, express `E_mu` as `E_mu = m_pi - E_nu`.\n    *   Substitute this expression for `E_mu` into the equation above:\n        `(m_pi - E_nu)² = E_nu² + m_mu²`\n    *   Expand the left side:\n        `m_pi² - 2*m_pi*E_nu + E_nu² = E_nu² + m_mu²`\n    *   The `E_nu²` terms on both sides cancel out:\n        `m_pi² - 2*m_pi*E_nu = m_mu²`\n    *   Rearrange to solve for `E_nu`:\n        `2*m_pi*E_nu = m_pi² - m_mu²`\n        `E_nu = (m_pi² - m_mu²) / (2 * m_pi)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the numerical values:**\n    *   Calculate the neutrino's kinetic energy (`KE_nu = E_nu`):\n        `KE_nu = (139.6² - 105.7²) / (2 * 139.6)`\n        `KE_nu = (19488.16 - 11172.49) / 279.2`\n        `KE_nu = 8315.67 / 279.2`\n        `KE_nu ≈ 29.78 MeV`\n\n    *   Calculate the muon's kinetic energy (`KE_mu`). The total kinetic energy released in the decay (Q-value) is `Q = m_pi - m_mu`. This energy is shared between the products: `Q = KE_mu + KE_nu`.\n        `KE_mu = Q - KE_nu`\n        `KE_mu = (m_pi - m_mu) - KE_nu`\n        `KE_mu = (139.6 - 105.7) - 29.78`\n        `KE_mu = 33.9 - 29.78`\n        `KE_mu ≈ 4.12 MeV`\n\n8.  **Compare with the options:**\n    The calculated kinetic energies are `KE_mu ≈ 4.12 MeV` and `KE_nu ≈ 29.78 MeV`.\n    The options are:\n    A) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n    B) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\n    C) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n    D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n\n    Our calculated values `(4.12 MeV, 29.78 MeV)` match option D, with a minor rounding difference for the neutrino's energy. The code execution confirms these results.\n\n<<<D>>>"
