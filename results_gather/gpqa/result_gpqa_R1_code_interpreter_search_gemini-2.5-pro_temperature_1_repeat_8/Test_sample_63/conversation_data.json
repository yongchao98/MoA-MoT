    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the reactions in the tubes to identify the gaseous products.**\n    *   The gas mixture is passed through three tubes in sequence.\n    *   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂.** This is a strong dehydrating agent. It absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution (limewater).** This solution is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. The problem states its weight did not change. This implies that no acidic gas like CO₂ was produced, or if any was produced, it was neutralized by a basic gas produced in an equimolar amount (unlikely given the setup), or the gas passing through was neutral.\n    *   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper (Cu).** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing agents, most commonly O₂ or nitrogen oxides. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that combined with the copper.\n        *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** 2.24 L of gas at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure) remained.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol. This gas is inert to all previous reagents, suggesting it is likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Reconstruct the composition of the gas mixture before Tube №3.**\n    *   The gas that reacted with copper contained 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms. This could be from O₂ (0.025 mol) or from a nitrogen oxide like N₂O (0.05 mol).\n    *   Let's consider the reaction with hot copper.\n        *   If the gas was O₂, the reaction is `2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO`.\n        *   If the gas was N₂O, the reaction is `Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂`. This reaction is known to occur over hot copper.\n    *   Let's analyze the amount of Gas C (N₂). We have 0.10 mol of N₂ at the end.\n    *   If the gas reacting with Cu was N₂O, then 0.05 mol of N₂O would have reacted (since it contains 0.05 mol of O atoms). This reaction would produce 0.05 mol of N₂.\n    *   This means that the 0.10 mol of final N₂ is composed of 0.05 mol produced from the N₂O decomposition and another 0.05 mol that was present in the original gas mixture.\n    *   This hypothesis fits all the numbers: The gas mixture from the initial heating consisted of:\n        *   0.20 mol H₂O (absorbed in tube 1)\n        *   0.05 mol N₂O (reacted in tube 3)\n        *   0.05 mol N₂ (passed through unreacted)\n\n3.  **Identify salts A and B based on the decomposition products.**\n    *   We need to find two salts (A and B) that, when heated, produce N₂, N₂O, and H₂O. The salts are in an equimolar mixture.\n    *   The decomposition of ammonium salts often produces these gases:\n        *   Ammonium nitrite: `NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O`\n        *   Ammonium nitrate: `NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O`\n    *   Let's assume A is `NH₄NO₂` and B is `NH₄NO₃`. Let `n` be the number of moles of each salt in the equimolar mixture.\n    *   From `n` moles of `NH₄NO₂`, we get `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n    *   From `n` moles of `NH₄NO₃`, we get `n` moles of N₂O and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n    *   Total products would be: `n` mol N₂, `n` mol N₂O, and `(2n + 2n) = 4n` mol H₂O.\n    *   Comparing with our derived amounts:\n        *   Moles N₂ = `n` = 0.05 mol\n        *   Moles N₂O = `n` = 0.05 mol\n        *   Moles H₂O = `4n` = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol\n    *   These values match perfectly with what we deduced from the experimental results.\n\n4.  **Verify the initial mass.**\n    *   We have 0.05 mol of `NH₄NO₂` and 0.05 mol of `NH₄NO₃`.\n    *   Molar mass of `NH₄NO₂` = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 2(16) = 64 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of `NH₄NO₃` = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 3(16) = 80 g/mol.\n    *   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80 g/mol) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   This matches the given initial mass. Our identification of salts A and B is correct.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in their chemical formulas.\n    *   Salt A: `NH₄NO₂`. Number of atoms = 2(N) + 4(H) + 2(O) = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n    *   Salt B: `NH₄NO₃`. Number of atoms = 2(N) + 4(H) + 3(O) = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n```python\n# The reasoning confirms that salts are NH4NO2 and NH4NO3.\n# The question is to find the total number of atoms in the formulas of these two salts.\n\n# Atoms in NH4NO2 (Salt A)\n# N: 2, H: 4, O: 2\natoms_A = 2 + 4 + 2\n\n# Atoms in NH4NO3 (Salt B)\n# N: 2, H: 4, O: 3\natoms_B = 2 + 4 + 3\n\n# Total atoms\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\nprint(total_atoms)\n```",
    "1.  **Analyze the experimental data to identify the products of the decomposition.**\n    *   An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g is heated. This produces a mixture of gases.\n    *   The gases are passed through a series of tubes.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This absorbs water. The mass increase is 3.60 g.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O is 1.008*2 + 16.00 ≈ 18.016 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.016 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is a test for acidic gases like CO₂. The mass did not change, which means no acidic gas was present, or it was neutralized by an equimolar amount of a basic gas. Since the only likely basic gas from common salt decomposition is NH₃, and it would react with water to form NH₄OH, which would then react with CO₂, this scenario is complex but possible. However, the simplest explanation is that no net acidic gas was produced.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increased by 0.80 g. Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass increase is due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO), meaning the mass gain is from oxygen atoms.\n        *   Molar mass of O is 16.00 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   This oxygen must have come from an oxygen-containing gas. Common gases that react with hot copper this way are O₂ or nitrogen oxides like N₂O. The reaction with N₂O is `Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂`. This reaction transfers one oxygen atom from N₂O to Cu. Therefore, 0.05 moles of N₂O would have reacted.\n    *   **Remaining gas C:** 2.24 L at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure).\n        *   1 mole of any gas at STP occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n        *   This gas C did not react with any of the previous reagents. This strongly suggests it is Nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Reconstruct the composition of the initial gas mixture.**\n    *   Based on the analysis above, the gases produced by heating the salts were:\n        *   0.20 mol of H₂O\n        *   0.05 mol of N₂O (which reacted in tube 3)\n        *   0.10 mol of N₂ (the final remaining gas)\n    *   However, if the reacting gas was N₂O, the reaction `Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂` would produce N₂. If 0.05 mol of N₂O reacted, it would produce 0.05 mol of N₂.\n    *   This means the final 0.10 mol of N₂ consists of 0.05 mol produced from N₂O and 0.05 mol that was present in the original gas mixture.\n    *   So, the initial gas mixture from the decomposition was:\n        *   0.20 mol H₂O\n        *   0.05 mol N₂O\n        *   0.05 mol N₂\n\n3.  **Identify the salts A and B.**\n    *   We need two salts that decompose upon heating to produce H₂O, N₂O, and N₂. Ammonium salts are excellent candidates.\n    *   Consider the decomposition of ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite:\n        *   Ammonium nitrate: `NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n        *   Ammonium nitrite: `NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n    *   The problem states the mixture of salts A and B is equimolar. Let's assume there are `n` moles of salt A and `n` moles of salt B.\n    *   If Salt A is `NH₄NO₂` and Salt B is `NH₄NO₃`:\n        *   From `n` moles of `NH₄NO₂`, we get `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n        *   From `n` moles of `NH₄NO₃`, we get `n` moles of N₂O and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n    *   Total products: `n` mol N₂, `n` mol N₂O, and `4n` mol H₂O.\n    *   Comparing this with our derived quantities:\n        *   Moles of N₂ = 0.05 mol  => `n = 0.05`\n        *   Moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol => `n = 0.05`\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 0.20 mol => `4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20`.\n    *   The molar quantities match perfectly. So, the salts are ammonium nitrite (`NH₄NO₂`) and ammonium nitrate (`NH₄NO₃`).\n\n4.  **Verify the initial mass.**\n    *   Molar mass of `NH₄NO₂` = 14.01 + 4(1.01) + 14.01 + 2(16.00) = 64.05 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of `NH₄NO₃` = 14.01 + 4(1.01) + 14.01 + 3(16.00) = 80.05 g/mol.\n    *   Total mass = (moles of A * Molar Mass of A) + (moles of B * Molar Mass of B)\n    *   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 64.05 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80.05 g/mol) = 3.2025 g + 4.0025 g = 7.205 g.\n    *   This is very close to the given mass of 7.20 g, confirming our identification of the salts.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total number of atoms in the formulas of the salts.**\n    *   Salt A: `NH₄NO₂`. It contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms. Total atoms = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.\n    *   Salt B: `NH₄NO₃`. It contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms. Total atoms = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9.\n    *   The total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of atoms in their formulas: 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThe calculation performed by the Python code confirms this result.\nTotal atoms = (atoms in `NH₄NO₂`) + (atoms in `NH₄NO₃`) = 8 + 9 = 17.\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
