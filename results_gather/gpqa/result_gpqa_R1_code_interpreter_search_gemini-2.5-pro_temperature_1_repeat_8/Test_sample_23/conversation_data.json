    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let's determine its general formula, CₓHᵧ.\n    *   Mass % of H = (Atomic Mass of H * y) / (Molecular Mass of CₓHᵧ) * 100\n    *   14.28% is very close to 1/7 (1 / 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n    *   Let's assume the percentage is derived from integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1).\n    *   Mass % of H = (1 * y) / (12 * x + 1 * y) = 1/7\n    *   7y = 12x + y\n    *   6y = 12x\n    *   y = 2x\n    *   So, the empirical formula of Z is CH₂, and the general formula is CₙH₂ₙ. This formula corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   We are also told that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent that fits this description is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hydrogenation Reactions**\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X (which contains two liquids, A and B) gives *only* substance Z.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y (which contains two liquids, C and D) gives *only* substance Z.\n    *   This is a crucial clue. It means that all four substances (A, B, C, and D) have the same carbon skeleton as Z. Since Z is cyclohexane (a six-membered ring), A, B, C, and D must also be compounds with a six-membered carbon ring.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction (X → Y)**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (A + B).\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   Mixture X is heated with platinum (a catalyst for hydrogenation/dehydrogenation) to form mixture Y. This reaction is described as a disproportionation.\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two *other* liquids (C + D).\n    *   Mixture Y *does not* decolorize bromine water. This implies that C and D are saturated compounds or are aromatic.\n    *   A classic example of a disproportionation reaction for cyclic compounds on a platinum catalyst is the conversion of cyclohexene to cyclohexane and benzene: 3 C₆H₁₀ → 2 C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆. However, this reaction does not produce an equimolar mixture.\n    *   To get an equimolar mixture (C + D), the reaction must involve the two different components of mixture X reacting with each other: A + B → C + D.\n    *   This is a catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction, which is a type of disproportionation. One molecule is reduced (gains hydrogen) and the other is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n    *   So, one component of X is reduced to C, and the other is oxidized to D.\n    *   We know C and D do not decolorize bromine water and have a C₆ ring skeleton. We also know from step 1 that Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is a constituent of mixture Y. So, let's say C = Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Cyclohexane is saturated and does not react with bromine water.\n    *   What is D? It must be a C₆ ring compound that is the result of oxidation (losing hydrogen) and does not react with bromine water. The most stable, hydrogen-deficient C₆ ring compound is benzene (C₆H₆). Benzene does not react with bromine water under these conditions.\n    *   So, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and Benzene (C₆H₆). This fits all the criteria for Y.\n\n4.  **Determine the Composition of Mixture X**\n    *   The reaction is A + B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   A and B are the two liquids in mixture X. They are unsaturated C₆-ring compounds. The problem also states they do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   By the law of conservation of mass, the atoms on the left side of the equation must equal the atoms on the right side.\n    *   Total Hydrogen atoms in reactants = Total Hydrogen atoms in products.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in Cyclohexane) + (H atoms in Benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   This means the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of liquid A and one molecule of liquid B is 18.\n\n5.  **Final Check and Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   Our calculation shows this to be 18.\n    *   This corresponds to option C.\n    *   (For completeness, a plausible pair for A and B would be cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). Both have a C₆-ring, are unsaturated, and lack conjugated bonds. Their total hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18. In the reaction, cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is oxidized to benzene.)\n\nThe core logic relies on identifying the products of the disproportionation reaction (Y) and then applying the principle of atom conservation.\n\n```python\n# The problem is solved by chemical reasoning.\n# The final step is to sum the number of hydrogen atoms in the products of the disproportionation.\n# Product 1: Cyclohexane (C6H12) -> 12 hydrogen atoms\n# Product 2: Benzene (C6H6) -> 6 hydrogen atoms\n# By conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must be the same.\n# Reactants are the two liquids in mixture X.\nh_atoms_in_cyclohexane = 12\nh_atoms_in_benzene = 6\ntotal_h_atoms_in_X = h_atoms_in_cyclohexane + h_atoms_in_benzene\nprint(total_h_atoms_in_X)\n```\n\n18\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem requires a step-by-step deduction based on the chemical reactions described.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let's determine its empirical formula.\n    *   The mass percentage of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. This suggests that for every 7 units of mass, 1 unit is from hydrogen and 6 units are from carbon.\n    *   Let the formula be CₓHᵧ. The molar mass is 12x + y.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is y / (12x + y) = 1/7.\n    *   Cross-multiplying gives 7y = 12x + y, which simplifies to 6y = 12x, or y = 2x.\n    *   The empirical formula is CH₂, and the general formula is CₙH₂ₙ. This formula corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen. This means it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   We are also told that Z is a constituent of mixture Y and is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Let's verify this fits the description. The formula C₆H₁₂ matches CₙH₂ₙ with n=6. Cyclohexane is a saturated cycloalkane and a common solvent. So, Z is cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hydrogenation Reaction:**\n    *   Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* cyclohexane (Z).\n    *   This is a critical clue. It means that all components of both mixtures have a six-carbon ring skeleton. When they are fully saturated with hydrogen, they all become cyclohexane.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction (X → Y):**\n    *   Mixture X (containing two liquids, let's call them A and B) is heated with platinum to form mixture Y. This is described as a disproportionation reaction. In this context (on a metal catalyst like Pt), it's a catalytic hydrogen transfer. One molecule is reduced (gains hydrogen), and another is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning its components (A and B) are unsaturated (they contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   Mixture Y (containing two liquids, C and D) does *not* decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   We already know that one component of Y is cyclohexane (Z), which is C₆H₁₂. Cyclohexane is saturated and does not react with bromine water. Let's say C = Cyclohexane.\n    *   The other component, D, must be the result of oxidation (dehydrogenation) of a C₆ ring compound and must also not decolorize bromine water. The most stable, fully dehydrogenated C₆ ring is benzene (C₆H₆). Benzene is aromatic and does not react with bromine water under these conditions.\n    *   The problem states that X and Y are equimolar mixtures. The disproportionation of a single compound (e.g., 3 cyclohexene → 2 cyclohexane + 1 benzene) does not produce an equimolar mixture. Therefore, the reaction must involve the two different components of X reacting in a 1:1 molar ratio to produce the products in a 1:1 molar ratio:\n        A + B → Cyclohexane (C) + Benzene (D)\n    *   So, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n\n4.  **Determine the Total Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X:**\n    *   The reaction is: A + B → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆\n    *   According to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the equation.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of A and one molecule of B) must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\nLet's use a Python script to perform the final addition.\n```python\n# Number of hydrogen atoms in cyclohexane (C6H12)\nh_in_cyclohexane = 12\n# Number of hydrogen atoms in benzene (C6H6)\nh_in_benzene = 6\n# According to the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms\n# in the two liquids of mixture X is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in the products.\ntotal_h_in_mixture_X = h_in_cyclohexane + h_in_benzene\nprint(total_h_in_mixture_X)\n```\n<<<C>>>",
    "The reasoning is as follows:\n\n1.  **Determine the identity of hydrocarbon Z.**\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%, which is equivalent to 14.28/100 ≈ 1/7.\n    *   Let the molecular formula of the hydrocarbon be CₓHᵧ.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: (mass of H) / (total mass) = (1.008 * y) / (12.01 * x + 1.008 * y).\n    *   Using approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12), we get: y / (12x + y) = 1/7.\n    *   This simplifies to 7y = 12x + y, which gives 6y = 12x, or y = 2x.\n    *   The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. This formula can represent an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂. This fits the formula CₙH₂ₙ (with n=6) and all other descriptions. So, Z is cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Determine the composition of mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X.\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water (meaning they are saturated or aromatic).\n    *   Substance Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n    *   The reaction X → Y is a disproportionation on a platinum catalyst. For cyclic C₆ compounds, this is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One molecule is hydrogenated (gains H), and another is dehydrogenated (loses H).\n    *   Since one product is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), the fully hydrogenated product, the other product must be the fully dehydrogenated C₆ ring, which is benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   Benzene is aromatic and does not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n\n3.  **Relate mixture X to mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them A and B) that undergoes disproportionation to form mixture Y.\n    *   The reaction is: A + B → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆.\n    *   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms on the reactant side must equal the total number of atoms on the product side.\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms.**\n    *   Total H atoms in reactants (A + B) = Total H atoms in products (cyclohexane + benzene).\n    *   Total H atoms = (Number of H in C₆H₁₂) + (Number of H in C₆H₆).\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
