    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physical System and the Method of Images\n\nWe have a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A \"grounded\" sphere means its electric potential is held at zero.\n\nThis problem is solved using the **method of images**. We can replace the conducting sphere with an \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location `b` inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must produce a potential of zero everywhere on the surface where the sphere was.\n\n### 2. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center are given by the standard formulas:\n\n*   **Position of the image charge:** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of the image charge:** `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n\nThe image charge `q'` is located on the line connecting the center and the original charge `q`. Since `d > R` (the charge is outside the sphere), it follows that `b < R`, so the image charge is located inside the sphere, as required.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. This work is done against the force exerted on `q` by the induced charges on the sphere. According to the method of images, this force is exactly the same as the force exerted by the image charge `q'` on the real charge `q`.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy.\n\n#### Method 1: Integrating the Force\n\n1.  Let the charge `q` be at an arbitrary distance `x` from the center of the sphere as it is brought in from infinity.\n2.  At this position `x`, the image charge is `q' = -qR/x` and its position is `b = R^2/x`.\n3.  The distance between the charge `q` (at `x`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `x - b = x - R^2/x`.\n4.  The force exerted by the image charge on the real charge `q` is attractive:\n    `F(x) = k * q * q' / (x - b)^2`\n    `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n    `F(x) = - (k * q^2 * R / x) / ((x^2 - R^2)/x)^2`\n    `F(x) = - (k * q^2 * R / x) * (x^2 / (x^2 - R^2)^2)`\n    `F(x) = - k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n5.  The potential energy `U(d)` is the work done by the field to bring the charge from infinity to `d`, which is `U(d) = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F(x) dx`. It's often easier to calculate it as `U(d) = ∫(from d to ∞) F(x) dx`.\n    `U(d) = ∫(from d to ∞) [- k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    `U(d) = -k * q^2 * R * ∫(from d to ∞) [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n6.  To solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`, or `x dx = du/2`.\n    `∫ x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx = ∫ (1/u^2) * (du/2) = (1/2) * (-1/u) = -1 / (2 * (x^2 - R^2))`\n7.  Now, we apply the limits of integration:\n    `U(d) = -k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2 * (x^2 - R^2)) ]` from `d` to `∞`\n    `U(d) = -k * q^2 * R * [ (lim x->∞ -1 / (2 * (x^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2 * (d^2 - R^2))) ]`\n    `U(d) = -k * q^2 * R * [ 0 + 1 / (2 * (d^2 - R^2)) ]`\n    `U(d) = - (k * q^2 * R) / (2 * (d^2 - R^2))`\n\n#### Method 2: Using the Potential of the Image Charge\n\nA more direct method recognizes that the interaction energy `U` of a charge `q` with an induced charge distribution on a conductor is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`. The factor of 1/2 is crucial and arises because the induced charge distribution is created by `q` itself.\n\n1.  `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` (at distance `d`) due to the induced charges on the sphere.\n2.  This potential is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n3.  The distance between the location of `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b = R^2/d`) is `d - b = d - R^2/d`.\n4.  The potential is:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    `V_induced = - (k * q * R) / (d^2 - R^2)`\n5.  Now, we calculate the potential energy:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [ - (k * q * R) / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result for the net potential energy of the system:\n\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
