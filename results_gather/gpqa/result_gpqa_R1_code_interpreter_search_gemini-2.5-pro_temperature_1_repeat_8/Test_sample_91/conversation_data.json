    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Chemical Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule to determine its molecular formula and the number of each type of chemical bond.\n\nThe chemical name given is `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`.\n\nLet's break it down and count the atoms:\n*   `(CH3)2C=`: A carbon atom double-bonded to another carbon, and also single-bonded to two methyl (CH3) groups. This part has 3 Carbon atoms and 6 Hydrogen atoms.\n*   `=CH-`: A carbon atom, part of the double bond, bonded to one Hydrogen. This part has 1 Carbon atom and 1 Hydrogen atom.\n*   `-CH2-`: A methylene group. This has 1 Carbon atom and 2 Hydrogen atoms.\n*   `-CH(CH3)-`: A carbon atom bonded to one Hydrogen and one methyl (CH3) group. This part has 2 Carbon atoms and 4 Hydrogen atoms.\n*   `-CH2-`: Another methylene group. This has 1 Carbon atom and 2 Hydrogen atoms.\n*   `-CH=`: A carbon atom, part of a double bond, bonded to one Hydrogen. This has 1 Carbon atom and 1 Hydrogen atom.\n*   `=C(CH3)2`: A carbon atom, part of the double bond, single-bonded to two methyl (CH3) groups. This has 3 Carbon atoms and 6 Hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Total Atom Count:**\n*   **Carbon (C):** 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 atoms\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 atoms\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n### **2. Count the Chemical Bonds**\n\nNow, we count the number of each type of bond in the molecule:\n*   **C-H bonds:** The count is the same as the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly shows two double bonds (`C=C`). So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:** We need to count all the single bonds between carbon atoms.\n    *   In the first `(CH3)2C` group: 2 bonds (C-CH3)\n    *   Between the main chain carbons: `C=C-C-C-C-C=C`. There are 4 single bonds here.\n    *   In the `-CH(CH3)-` group: 1 bond (C-CH3)\n    *   In the last `C(CH3)2` group: 2 bonds (C-CH3)\n    *   Total C-C bonds = 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**Bond Summary:**\n*   C-H bonds: 22\n*   C-C bonds: 9\n*   C=C bonds: 2\n\n### **3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants**\n\nThe formation of C12H22 occurs from its constituent elements in their standard states:\n`12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)`\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) can be calculated as:\n`ΔHf = [Enthalpy of atomization of reactants] - [Total bond energy of the product]`\n\nFirst, calculate the energy required to turn the reactants into gaseous atoms:\n*   **Atomize Carbon:** `12 C(s) → 12 C(g)`\n    *   Energy = 12 mol * (Enthalpy of atomization of C) = 12 * 1000 kJ = 12000 kJ\n*   **Atomize Hydrogen:** `11 H2(g) → 22 H(g)` (This means breaking 11 H-H bonds)\n    *   Energy = 11 mol * (Bond energy of H-H) = 11 * 100 kJ = 1100 kJ\n\n**Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants** = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Product**\n\nNext, calculate the energy released when the gaseous atoms combine to form one mole of the product, C12H22. This is the sum of all the bond energies in the molecule.\n\n*   **Energy from C-C bonds:** 9 * (BE of C-C) = 9 * 200 kJ = 1800 kJ\n*   **Energy from C=C bonds:** 2 * (BE of C=C) = 2 * 300 kJ = 600 kJ\n*   **Energy from C-H bonds:** 22 * (BE of C-H) = 22 * 400 kJ = 8800 kJ\n\n**Total bond energy of the product** = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n### **5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf)**\n\nNow we can calculate the enthalpy of formation:\n`ΔHf = (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Total bond energy of product)`\n`ΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = 1900 kJ/mol`\n\n### **6. Convert to kJ/g**\n\nThe options provided are in kJ/g or have different numerical values. Let's convert our result from kJ/mol to kJ/g to see if it matches any option.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:**\n    *   Mass = (12 * Atomic Mass of C) + (22 * Atomic Mass of H)\n    *   Mass = (12 * 12 g/mol) + (22 * 1 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**\n*   **Enthalpy in kJ/g:**\n    *   ΔHf (kJ/g) = ΔHf (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    *   ΔHf (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ 11.4457 kJ/g\n\nThis value `11.44 kJ/g` matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
