    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for calculating DBE is C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (2/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds).\n    *   The remaining degree of unsaturation is likely a carbonyl group (C=O), which is consistent with the IR data.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH2)**. A primary amide (-CONH2) could also show two bands, but this, combined with other data, points strongly to an amine. This evidence makes option A (a secondary amide) unlikely.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a **carbonyl group (C=O)**. The frequency is typical for an ester, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for a simple amide (usually < 1690 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester like in option D (usually > 1750 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two groups on the ring are different, one being electron-donating and the other electron-withdrawing.\n        *   The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is consistent with protons ortho to an electron-donating group (like -NH2).\n        *   The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is consistent with protons ortho to an electron-withdrawing group (like an ester, -COOR).\n    *   This observation eliminates option **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**, which is 1,3-disubstituted (meta).\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region and Other Signals:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet combination is the signature of an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**. Crucially, the chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is very downfield, indicating the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, as in an **ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3)** found in an ester.\n    *   This eliminates option **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, where the ethyl group is part of a propionate chain (-C(=O)CH2CH3). In that case, the quartet for the -CH2- group would be much further upfield, around 2.5 ppm.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH2)**. This confirms the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Remaining Options**\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This compound has a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR and one N-H proton in the NMR. The data shows a primary amine (-NH2). So, this is incorrect.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring with a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   **Formula:** C9H11NO2. (Correct)\n    *   **IR:** Has a primary amine (two N-H bands) and a conjugated ester (C=O at ~1720 cm⁻¹). (Matches)\n    *   **NMR:** Shows a para-substituted ring (two doublets), an ethyl group attached to oxygen (t at 1.2, q at 4.5 ppm), and a primary amine signal (broad singlet, 2H). (Matches perfectly)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll the provided spectral data are fully consistent with the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
