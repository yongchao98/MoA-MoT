    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant**\n\n*   **Name:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Structure:**\n    *   `cyclohex`: A six-membered carbon ring.\n    *   `carboxylic acid`: A -COOH group. By convention, this is at position C1.\n    *   `-3-ene`: A carbon-carbon double bond between C3 and C4 of the ring.\n    *   `2-formyl`: A -CHO (aldehyde) group at position C2.\n    *   `5-vinyl`: A -CH=CH₂ group at position C5.\n*   **Molecular Formula Calculation:**\n    *   Carbon atoms (C):\n        *   6 in the cyclohexane ring.\n        *   1 in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n        *   1 in the formyl group (-CHO).\n        *   2 in the vinyl group (-CH=CH₂).\n        *   Total Carbons = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n    *   Hydrogen atoms (H):\n        *   On the ring: C1(H), C2(H), C3(H), C4(H), C5(H), C6(H₂). Total = 7 H.\n        *   In the substituents: -COOH(1H), -CHO(1H), -CH=CH₂(3H). Total = 5 H.\n        *   Total Hydrogens = 7 + 5 = 12.\n    *   Oxygen atoms (O):\n        *   2 in the carboxylic acid group.\n        *   1 in the formyl group.\n        *   Total Oxygens = 3.\n    *   The molecular formula of the reactant is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce a wide variety of functional groups to the corresponding alkane. Specifically, it will:\n    *   Reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   Reduce the aldehyde/formyl group (-CHO) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   Reduce all carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C). This applies to both the double bond in the ring and the one in the vinyl group.\n*   The reaction will remove all oxygen atoms and saturate all multiple bonds. The carbon skeleton, including the ring, will remain intact.\n\n**3. Determine the Product**\n\n*   Starting with the C₁₀ skeleton of the reactant, let's see what each part becomes:\n    *   The `cyclohexene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` at C1 becomes a `methyl group`.\n    *   The `formyl group` at C2 becomes a `methyl group`.\n    *   The `vinyl group` at C5 becomes an `ethyl group` (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **Product Name:** The resulting molecule is **1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane**.\n*   **Product Molecular Formula:**\n    *   The product is a substituted cycloalkane. A saturated, monocyclic hydrocarbon has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   The total number of carbons is 10 (6 in the ring + 1 from the first methyl + 1 from the second methyl + 2 from the ethyl). So, n=10.\n    *   The molecular formula is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. It can be calculated from the molecular formula.\n\n*   **Formula:** IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    (Note: Halogens are treated like H, Nitrogens add to the count, and Oxygens are ignored).\n*   **Calculation for the product (C₁₀H₂₀):**\n    *   C = 10\n    *   H = 20\n    *   IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\n    *   IHD = 11 - 10\n    *   IHD = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the IHD by inspecting the final structure:\n*   1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane has:\n    *   Number of rings = 1\n    *   Number of double bonds = 0\n    *   Number of triple bonds = 0\n*   IHD = (number of rings) + (number of double bonds) + 2*(number of triple bonds)\n*   IHD = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1. This value corresponds to the presence of the single ring in the cyclohexane structure.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 5\nB) 3\nC) 0\nD) 1\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
