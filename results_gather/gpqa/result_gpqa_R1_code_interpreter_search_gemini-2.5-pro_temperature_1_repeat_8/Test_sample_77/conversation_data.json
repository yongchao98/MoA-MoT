    "This question asks for the scalar and vector potentials, V and A, generated by a moving point charge q. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key idea is that the electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, c. Therefore, the potentials at a field point $\\vec{r}$ at time t depend on the state of the charge (its position and velocity) at an earlier time, known as the retarded time, $t_r$.\n\n1.  **Definitions and Setup:**\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t)$: The trajectory of the point charge q as a function of time.\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The position vector of the observation point (field point).\n    *   $t$: The time of observation.\n    *   $t_r$: The retarded time. This is the time at which the electromagnetic signal must have been emitted from the charge to reach the observer at $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$. The time difference $(t - t_r)$ is the time taken for light to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$: The distance from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point.\n    *   The condition for the retarded time is given by the distance light travels: $d = c(t - t_r)$. The problem states $t > t_r$, which confirms we are dealing with retarded (causal) potentials.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}\\Big|_{t=t_r}$: The velocity of the charge evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   Constants: $c$ (speed of light), $\\epsilon_o$ (permittivity of free space), $\\mu_o$ (permeability of free space).\n\n2.  **Derivation of the Potentials (Liénard-Wiechert Potentials):**\n    The potentials for a moving point charge are derived from the general formulas for retarded potentials by treating the charge as a point-like distribution.\n    The general retarded scalar potential is:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$ where $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$.\n\n    For a point charge q moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge density is $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$. Performing the integration over this delta function distribution, accounting for the fact that the retarded time itself depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$, yields a correction factor in the denominator.\n\n    The resulting scalar potential is:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}|(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\cdot \\hat{d})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n    where the notation $[...]_{t_r}$ means all quantities inside (s, v, d) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$, and $\\hat{d} = \\frac{\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}|} = \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d}$.\n\n    Let's simplify the denominator using the problem's notation:\n    Denominator = $|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}|(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}|}) = d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n    So, the scalar potential is:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    Similarly, the vector potential is found from the general formula:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    with the current density $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q\\vec{v}(t')\\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$.\n    The calculation is analogous to the one for V, with the charge q in the numerator replaced by $q\\vec{v}$:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}|(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\cdot \\hat{d})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\n    Simplifying the denominator as before:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n3.  **Comparison with the Options:**\n    Let's compare our derived expressions with the given options.\n    Our derived potentials are:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\n    *   **A)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$. This is incorrect. The expression for V is the static Coulomb potential, which does not account for retardation or the motion of the charge in the denominator.\n    *   **B)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$. This exactly matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n    *   **C)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$. This is incorrect for the same reason as A, and the expression for $\\vec{A}$ is also wrong.\n    *   **D)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$. This has the wrong sign in the denominator. A positive sign would correspond to \"advanced potentials\" ($t < t_r$), which are generally discarded as they violate causality. The problem specifies $t > t_r$, corresponding to retarded potentials, which requires a minus sign.\n\nTherefore, option B provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. It is also worth noting that the potentials are related by $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$, which can be verified from the expressions in option B using the relation $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o \\epsilon_o)$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
