    "*   **Step 1: Understand the concept of optical isomerism.**\n    Optical isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism. It occurs when a molecule is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common test for chirality is the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Molecules that exhibit optical isomerism are called optically active.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze each compound for chirality.**\n\n    1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n        *   This is a biphenyl derivative. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single bond.\n        *   The positions ortho to the single bond (positions 2, 2', 6, 6') are substituted with large groups: two nitro groups (-NO₂) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH₃).\n        *   These bulky groups cause significant steric hindrance, which prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond that connects them.\n        *   This restricted rotation locks the molecule into a specific, non-planar conformation.\n        *   Because the substitution pattern is not symmetric with respect to a plane bisecting the molecule (e.g., the groups at 2 and 6 are different from those at 2' and 6'), the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n        *   This type of chirality, arising from restricted rotation about a single bond, is called **atropisomerism**. The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable enantiomers.\n        *   Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n    2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (methyl lactate)**:\n        *   The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n        *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n        *   This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n            1.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n            2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n            4.  a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        *   A carbon atom bonded to four different groups is a **chiral center** (or stereocenter).\n        *   The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral.\n        *   Therefore, this compound exists as a pair of enantiomers and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n    3.  **benzophenone**:\n        *   The chemical structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O.\n        *   The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom, so it is sp² hybridized and bonded to only three groups (two phenyl rings and one oxygen). It cannot be a chiral center.\n        *   The molecule is not planar, but the two phenyl rings can rotate. In any stable conformation, the molecule possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry passing through the C=O bond. More importantly, it is possible to find a conformation that has a plane of symmetry which contains the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n        *   A molecule with a plane of symmetry is **achiral** and cannot be optically active. Its mirror image is superimposable on the original molecule.\n        *   Therefore, this compound does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n    4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n        *   The chemical structure is the *trans* isomer of CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n        *   The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond.\n        *   Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore **achiral**.\n        *   This molecule also has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C bond.\n        *   Molecules with a center of inversion are always achiral. (This compound exhibits geometric isomerism with its *cis* counterpart, dimethyl maleate, but not optical isomerism).\n        *   Therefore, this compound does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Step 3: Conclude based on the analysis.**\n    *   Compound 1 shows optical isomerism (due to atropisomerism).\n    *   Compound 2 shows optical isomerism (due to a chiral center).\n    *   Compound 3 is achiral.\n    *   Compound 4 is achiral.\n    *   Thus, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
