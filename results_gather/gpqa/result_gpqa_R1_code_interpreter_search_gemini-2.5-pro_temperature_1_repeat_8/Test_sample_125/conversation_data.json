    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S).\n    *   The structure is CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3.\n    *   C5 is the chiral center.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:** The carbonyl carbon (C3) is prochiral. The attack of the hydride ion (H‚Åª) from LAH can occur from two different faces of the planar carbonyl group. This reduction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n    *   Since there is already a chiral center at C5, the two possible outcomes of the attack on C3 will result in the formation of two diastereomers.\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two products are formed, and they are diastereomers of each other.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral diketone.\n    *   The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Product:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:** This molecule has two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** The molecule is symmetric. Let's check for a meso compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry. The (2R, 4S) form has such a plane of symmetry (and is identical to the (2S, 4R) form). Therefore, it is a single, achiral meso compound.\n*   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are enantiomers of each other. Since the starting material and the reagent are both achiral, there is no preference for the formation of one enantiomer over the other. They will be produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and one meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the Products and Analyze by HPLC**\n\nThe combined mixture from both reactions contains five distinct chemical compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It is an achiral technique.\n*   **Enantiomers**, such as (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, have identical physical properties (including polarity) in an achiral environment. Therefore, they will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers**, such as (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, have different physical properties and will be separated into two distinct peaks.\n*   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the chiral pentane-2,4-diols. It has different physical properties and will be separated from them, appearing as its own peak.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C7H16O2) are constitutional isomers of the products from Reaction II (C5H12O2). They are structurally different and will have different polarities, so they will be separated from the products of Reaction II.\n\nCounting the peaks for normal-phase HPLC:\n*   Peak 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   Peak 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   Peak 3: The racemic mixture of (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (elute together)\n*   Peak 4: meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n**Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 4**\n\n**Step 5: Predict the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n*   The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with each enantiomer, forming transient diastereomeric complexes of different stabilities, which leads to different retention times.\n*   Therefore, a chiral HPLC column can separate all five distinct stereoisomers present in the mixture.\n\nCounting the peaks for chiral HPLC:\n*   Peak 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   Peak 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (diastereomer of peak 1)\n*   Peak 3: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   Peak 4: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomer of peak 3)\n*   Peak 5: meso-pentane-2,4-diol (diastereomer of peaks 3 & 4)\n**Total peaks in chiral HPLC = 5**\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
