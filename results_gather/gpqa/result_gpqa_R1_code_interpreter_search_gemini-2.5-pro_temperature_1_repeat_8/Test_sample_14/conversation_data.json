    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to compare the transit probabilities of two exoplanets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, to determine which one is a better target for observation. We need to calculate the ratio of their probabilities (Prob_1 / Prob_2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Transit Probability Formula:** For a planet on a circular orbit, the geometric probability of a transit is given by the ratio of the host star's radius (R_s) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (a).\n    *   `Prob = R_s / a`\n\n3.  **Set up the Probability Ratio:** We can write the probabilities for each planet and then find their ratio.\n    *   `Prob_1 = R_s1 / a_1` (for Planet_1)\n    *   `Prob_2 = R_s2 / a_2` (for Planet_2)\n    *   The ratio is `Prob_1 / Prob_2 = (R_s1 / a_1) / (R_s2 / a_2) = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (a_2 / a_1)`\n\n4.  **Incorporate Given Information:** Let's use the information provided in the problem description.\n    *   The host stars have the same radii: `R_s1 = R_s2`.\n    *   This simplifies the ratio significantly: `Prob_1 / Prob_2 = 1 * (a_2 / a_1) = a_2 / a_1`.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the transit probabilities is simply the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes. To find out which planet is preferred, we need to compare `a_1` and `a_2`.\n\n5.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Known Quantities:** We don't have the values for the semi-major axes directly. However, we have information about the orbital periods (P) and the stellar masses (M_s). We can use Kepler's Third Law to connect these variables.\n    *   Kepler's Third Law: `P^2 ∝ a^3 / M_s` (assuming the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's mass, which is a standard assumption for Earth-like planets).\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`: `a^3 ∝ M_s * P^2`\n    *   Therefore, `a ∝ (M_s * P^2)^(1/3)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes:** Now we can substitute this proportionality into our probability ratio expression.\n    *   `a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * P2^2) / (M_s1 * P1^2) ]^(1/3)`\n\n7.  **Substitute the Specific Relationships:** The problem provides the following relationships:\n    *   The orbital period of Planet_2 is three times that of Planet_1: `P2 = 3 * P1`.\n    *   The mass of Star_1 is twice that of Star_2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`.\n\n8.  **Solve the Equation:** Substitute these into the ratio for the semi-major axes:\n    *   `a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * (3 * P1)^2) / ((2 * M_s2) * P1^2) ]^(1/3)`\n    *   `a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * 9 * P1^2) / (2 * M_s2 * P1^2) ]^(1/3)`\n    *   Cancel out the common terms (`M_s2` and `P1^2`):\n    *   `a_2 / a_1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n9.  **Final Calculation:** The ratio of the probabilities is equal to this value. We can compute it to find the numerical factor.\n    *   `Prob_1 / Prob_2 = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the cube root of 4.5\nratio = 4.5**(1/3)\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n1.6509640014529433\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculation shows that `Prob_1 / Prob_2 ≈ 1.65`. This means the transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred target for observation.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The transit probability (Prob) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by the ratio of the host star's radius (R_s) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (a):\n\nProb = R_s / a\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the probabilities for Planet_1 and Planet_2:\n\nRatio = Prob_1 / Prob_2 = (R_s1 / a_1) / (R_s2 / a_2)\n\nRearranging this gives:\n\nRatio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (a_2 / a_1)\n\nFrom the problem statement, we know that both host stars have the same radii, so R_s1 = R_s2. This simplifies the equation to:\n\nRatio = a_2 / a_1\n\nTo find the semi-major axes (a), we use Kepler's Third Law, which states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a^3) and inversely proportional to the mass of the host star (M_s):\n\nP^2 ∝ a^3 / M_s\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for 'a':\n\na^3 ∝ P^2 * M_s\na ∝ (P^2 * M_s)^(1/3)\n\nNow we can substitute this relationship back into our ratio equation:\n\nRatio = a_2 / a_1 = [ (P2^2 * M_s2) / (P1^2 * M_s1) ]^(1/3)\n\nThe problem gives us the following relationships:\n*   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2: P2 = 3 * P1.\n*   The mass of the host star of Planet_1 is twice that of the host star of Planet_2: M_s1 = 2 * M_s2.\n\nLet's substitute these into the equation:\n\nRatio = [ ((3 * P1)^2 * M_s2) / (P1^2 * (2 * M_s2)) ]^(1/3)\nRatio = [ (9 * P1^2 * M_s2) / (2 * P1^2 * M_s2) ]^(1/3)\n\nWe can cancel out the P1^2 and M_s2 terms from the numerator and denominator:\n\nRatio = (9 / 2)^(1/3)\nRatio = (4.5)^(1/3)\n\nThe code output confirms the calculation: `(4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65`.\n\nThis means that `Prob_1 / Prob_2 ≈ 1.65`, so the probability of Planet_1 transiting is about 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred observation target.\n\n<<<B>>>"
