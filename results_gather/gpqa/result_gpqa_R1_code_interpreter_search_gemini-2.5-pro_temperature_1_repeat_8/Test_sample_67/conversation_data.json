    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    The problem states that the spin-1/2 particle's magnetic moment, **μ**, is initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction, **B₀** = B **ẑ**. The Hamiltonian for this initial situation is H₀ = -**μ** · **B₀**. The energy is minimized when **μ** is parallel to **B₀**. Since **μ** = γ**S** = γS_z **ẑ** and S_z for a spin-1/2 particle can be +ħ/2 (spin-up) or -ħ/2 (spin-down), the energy levels are E = -γS_zB. The lowest energy state (most stable alignment) corresponds to the largest positive value of S_z, which is S_z = +ħ/2. This state is called the spin-up state along the z-axis, denoted as |+z>. Therefore, the initial state of the particle at t=0 is |ψ(0)> = |+z>.\n\n2.  **Identify the New Hamiltonian:**\n    At t=0, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to point along the +Y direction, with the same magnitude B. The new magnetic field is **B** = B **ŷ**. The particle's evolution for t > 0 is governed by the new Hamiltonian, H:\n    H = -**μ** · **B** = - (γ**S**) · (B **ŷ**) = -γB S_y\n    where S_y is the y-component of the spin operator.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Time Evolution of Expectation Values (Larmor Precession):**\n    The time evolution of the expectation value of the spin vector, <**S**>, is described by the equation:\n    d<**S**>/dt = γ(<**S**> x **B**)\n    This equation describes the precession of the spin vector <**S**> around the magnetic field **B** with an angular frequency known as the Larmor frequency.\n\n4.  **Solve the Equations of Motion:**\n    Let's write out the components of the precession equation with **B** = B **ŷ**:\n    d<**S**>/dt = γ(<S_x>**x̂** + <S_y>**ŷ** + <S_z>**ẑ**) x (B **ŷ**)\n    d<**S**>/dt = γB [ <S_x> (**x̂** x **ŷ**) + <S_y> (**ŷ** x **ŷ**) + <S_z> (**ẑ** x **ŷ**) ]\n    Using the cross product rules (**x̂** x **ŷ** = **ẑ**, **ŷ** x **ŷ** = 0, **ẑ** x **ŷ** = -**x̂**):\n    d<**S**>/dt = γB [ <S_x> **ẑ** - <S_z> **x̂** ]\n\n    This vector equation gives us three scalar differential equations for the components of <**S**>:\n    (i) d<S_x>/dt = -γB <S_z>\n    (ii) d<S_y>/dt = 0\n    (iii) d<S_z>/dt = γB <S_x>\n\n5.  **Find the Oscillation Frequency for <S_z>:**\n    We are interested in the oscillation of the z-component, <S_z>. We can combine equations (i) and (iii) to find a single equation for <S_z>. Take the time derivative of equation (iii):\n    d²<S_z>/dt² = γB (d<S_x>/dt)\n\n    Now, substitute equation (i) into this new equation:\n    d²<S_z>/dt² = γB (-γB <S_z>)\n    d²<S_z>/dt² = -(γB)² <S_z>\n\n    This is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, d²x/dt² = -ω²x, where ω is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n    By comparing our equation for <S_z> with the standard form, we can identify the angular frequency of oscillation:\n    ω = γB\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The expectation value of the z-component of the spin, <S_z(t)>, oscillates with an angular frequency of ω = γB. Since the z-component of the magnetic moment is directly proportional to the z-component of the spin (μ_z = γS_z), its expectation value, <μ_z(t)>, will oscillate at the exact same frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is γB.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B/2\nC) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nD) gamma*B\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
