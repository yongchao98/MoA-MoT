    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical Principle:** The problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method to detect exoplanets. This method relies on the Doppler effect. An orbiting planet causes its host star to \"wobble\" around their common center of mass. This wobble induces a periodic shift in the star's spectral lines. The magnitude of this wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) along our line of sight.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude:** The relationship between the observed wavelength shift and the radial velocity is given by the Doppler formula:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$\n    where $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    The amplitude of the periodic wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$) is therefore directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity ($K_{star}$).\n    $K_{star} \\propto \\Delta \\lambda_{max}$\n\n    Given the wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n    $\\Delta \\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom\n    $\\Delta \\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom\n    The ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes is:\n    $\\frac{K_{star, 2}}{K_{star, 1}} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_2}{\\Delta \\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n3.  **Derive the Formula for Radial Velocity Amplitude ($K_{star}$):** We need to express $K_{star}$ in terms of the physical parameters of the star-planet system (masses and orbital period).\n    *   For a circular orbit, the star's velocity is $v_{star} = \\frac{2\\pi a_{star}}{P}$, where $a_{star}$ is the radius of the star's orbit around the center of mass and $P$ is the orbital period.\n    *   The observed radial velocity amplitude is $K_{star} = v_{star} \\sin(i) = \\frac{2\\pi a_{star} \\sin(i)}{P}$, where $i$ is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight.\n    *   From the definition of the center of mass: $M_{star} a_{star} = m_{planet} a_{planet}$. Thus, $a_{star} = \\frac{m_{planet}}{M_{star}} a_{planet}$.\n    *   Substituting this into the equation for $K_{star}$: $K_{star} = \\frac{2\\pi \\sin(i)}{P} \\frac{m_{planet}}{M_{star}} a_{planet}$.\n    *   Now, we use Kepler's Third Law. For a planet orbiting a much more massive star ($m_{planet} \\ll M_{star}$), the law is $P^2 \\approx \\frac{4\\pi^2 a_{planet}^3}{G M_{star}}$.\n    *   We can solve this for $a_{planet}$: $a_{planet} \\approx \\left( \\frac{G M_{star} P^2}{4\\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3}$.\n    *   Substitute this expression for $a_{planet}$ back into the equation for $K_{star}$:\n        $K_{star} \\approx \\frac{2\\pi m_{planet} \\sin(i)}{P M_{star}} \\left( \\frac{G M_{star} P^2}{4\\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3}$\n    *   Simplifying this expression reveals the proportionality:\n        $K_{star} \\propto \\frac{m_{planet} \\sin(i)}{M_{star}^{2/3} P^{1/3}}$\n\n4.  **Apply the Proportionality to the Specific Problem:**\n    The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star, 1} = M_{star, 2}$.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: In RV studies, the measured quantity is the minimum mass, $m_{planet} \\sin(i)$. So, we assume $m_{planet, 1} \\sin(i_1) = m_{planet, 2} \\sin(i_2)$.\n\n    With these parameters being constant for both systems, the proportionality simplifies to:\n    $K_{star} \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods:**\n    We can write the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes as:\n    $\\frac{K_{star, 2}}{K_{star, 1}} = \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\right)^{-1/3} = \\left( \\frac{P_1}{P_2} \\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    From step 2, we know $\\frac{K_{star, 2}}{K_{star, 1}} = 1.4$.\n    So, $1.4 = \\left( \\frac{P_1}{P_2} \\right)^{1/3}$.\n\n    To find the ratio of the periods, $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$, we first cube both sides:\n    $1.4^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n    $2.744 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n\n    Finally, we take the reciprocal to get the desired ratio:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{1}{2.744}$\n\n6.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    Let's compute the final numerical value.\n```python\n# The ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes K2/K1 is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts.\nratio_K = 7 / 5\n\n# The relationship between K and the period P is K is proportional to P^(-1/3).\n# So, K2/K1 = (P2/P1)^(-1/3) = (P1/P2)^(1/3).\n# We want to find P2/P1.\n# (P1/P2) = (K2/K1)^3\nratio_P1_over_P2 = ratio_K**3\n\n# P2/P1 is the reciprocal of P1/P2.\nratio_P2_over_P1 = 1 / ratio_P1_over_P2\n\nprint(ratio_P2_over_P1)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.3644314868804665\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.36.

    "The problem asks for the ratio of the orbital periods of two exoplanets, $P_2/P_1$. We are given information from the radial velocity (RV) method.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process:\n\n1.  **Relate Observed Data to Physical Quantities:** The RV method measures the periodic shift in a star's spectral lines due to the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The amplitude of this wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, is directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, $K_{star}$.\n    *   $K_{star} \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ratio of Stellar Velocity Amplitudes:**\n    We are given the wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n    *   For planet #1: $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom\n    *   For planet #2: $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom\n\n    The ratio of the stellar radial velocity amplitudes is therefore:\n    $\\frac{K_{star,2}}{K_{star,1}} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n3.  **Derive the Relationship between Velocity Amplitude and Orbital Period:**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity amplitude ($K_{star}$) can be expressed in terms of the system's parameters: the planet's mass ($m_p$), the star's mass ($M_{star}$), the orbital period ($P$), and the inclination of the orbit ($i$). The formula is:\n    $K_{star} = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n    This formula combines the definition of velocity, the center of mass relationship, and Kepler's Third Law.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Relationship Based on Given Information:**\n    The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star,1} = M_{star,2}$.\n    *   The planets have masses similar to Neptune. In the context of RV measurements, the measurable quantity is the minimum mass, $m_p \\sin(i)$. The statement implies that this value is approximately the same for both planets: $m_{p,1} \\sin(i_1) \\approx m_{p,2} \\sin(i_2)$.\n\n    Since $m_p \\sin(i)$ and $M_{star}$ are the same for both systems, they can be treated as constants in the proportionality. The relationship simplifies to:\n    $K_{star} \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$ or $K_{star} \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Ratio of Orbital Periods:**\n    We can now write the ratio of the velocity amplitudes in terms of the periods:\n    $\\frac{K_{star,2}}{K_{star,1}} = \\frac{P_2^{-1/3}}{P_1^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    Substitute the value of the velocity ratio we found in step 2:\n    $1.4 = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    To find the desired ratio, $P_2/P_1$, we first solve for $P_1/P_2$ by cubing both sides of the equation:\n    $(1.4)^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n    $2.744 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n\n    Finally, take the reciprocal to get the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{1}{2.744}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\approx 0.3644$\n\n    This value is closest to option A.\n\n### Final Answer Generation:\nThe reasoning process is complete, and the calculation provides a clear answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
