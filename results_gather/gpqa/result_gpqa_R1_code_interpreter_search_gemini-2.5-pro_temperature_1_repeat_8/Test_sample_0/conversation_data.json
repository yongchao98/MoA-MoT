    "This problem requires applying the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time. This principle connects the lifetime of a quantum state to the inherent uncertainty (or \"width\") of its energy level.\n\n**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n*   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in a system's energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least on the order of the reduced Planck constant (ħ).\n    \n    ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2\n    \n    For a quantum state with a finite lifetime τ, the lifetime can be taken as the uncertainty in time (Δt ≈ τ). Therefore, the minimum uncertainty in its energy, often called the natural linewidth or energy width (Γ), is:\n    \n    ΔE ≈ Γ = ħ / τ\n    \n*   **Constants:**\n    *   Reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   To work in electron volts (eV), we use ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n*   **Calculate Energy Width for Each State:**\n    *   **State 1:** Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s.\n        The energy width is ΔE₁ = ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   **State 2:** Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s.\n        The energy width is ΔE₂ = ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n\n*   **Condition for Resolution:** To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the separation between their central energies (|E₁ - E₂|) must be significantly larger than their energy widths. If the separation is smaller than the widths, their energy distributions will overlap so much that they cannot be told apart. A common criterion is that the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the individual widths.\n    \n    Required Energy Difference > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n    Required Energy Difference > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    Required Energy Difference > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    \n    The state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has a much larger energy width, which is the dominant factor. The required energy separation must be at least on the order of 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   **Evaluate the Options:** We now check which of the given options meets this condition.\n    *   A) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much greater than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV. (10⁻⁴ >> 7.24 x 10⁻⁷). This would be clearly resolved.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is smaller than the required separation.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than the required separation.\n    *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much smaller than the required separation.\n\nOnly option A provides an energy difference large enough to resolve the two broadened energy levels.\n\n**2. Python Code for Verification**\n\n```python\n# Constants\nh_bar_eVs = 6.582e-16  # Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states\ntau1 = 1e-9  # seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8  # seconds\n\n# Calculate the energy width (uncertainty) for each state\ndelta_E1 = h_bar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar_eVs / tau2\n\n# The condition to resolve the two levels is that their energy difference\n# must be larger than their combined widths.\nrequired_separation = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of State 1 (τ=10^-9 s): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of State 2 (τ=10^-8 s): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Minimum energy separation required for resolution (ΔE1 + ΔE2): {required_separation:.3e} eV\")\n\n# Check the given options\noption_A = 1e-4\nprint(f\"\\nIs Option A ({option_A:.1e} eV) > required separation? {option_A > required_separation}\")\n```\n**Execution Output:**\n```\nEnergy width of State 1 (τ=10^-9 s): 6.582e-07 eV\nEnergy width of State 2 (τ=10^-8 s): 6.582e-08 eV\nMinimum energy separation required for resolution (ΔE1 + ΔE2): 7.240e-07 eV\n\nIs Option A (1.0e-04 eV) > required separation? True\n```\n\nThe calculations confirm that an energy difference of at least ~7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV is needed. Option A, 10⁻⁴ eV, is the only value that is sufficiently large.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem is about the energy-time uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics.\n\n**1. Understand the Principle**\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time states:\nΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in the energy of a quantum state.\n*   Δt is the lifetime of the state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nThis principle means that a state with a finite lifetime (Δt = τ) cannot have a perfectly defined energy. Its energy will have an intrinsic \"width\" or uncertainty (ΔE), often called the natural linewidth. We can approximate this width as:\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n**2. Calculate the Energy Width for Each State**\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nNotice that the state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has a larger energy uncertainty.\n\n**3. Determine the Condition for Resolution**\n\nTo \"clearly resolve\" or distinguish between two energy levels, the difference in their energies (|E₁ - E₂|) must be larger than their energy widths. If the energy difference is smaller than the widths, the energy distributions of the two states will overlap significantly, making them indistinguishable.\n\nA common criterion for resolution is that the energy separation must be greater than the sum of the individual energy widths:\n|E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n|E₁ - E₂| > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n|E₁ - E₂| > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nThe required energy separation must be greater than approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**4. Compare with the Given Options**\n\nWe need to find an option that is greater than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much larger than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV. (10⁻⁴ = 1000 x 10⁻⁷)\n*   B) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is much smaller.\n*   C) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller. (10⁻⁸ = 0.1 x 10⁻⁷)\n*   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much smaller.\n\nOnly option A provides an energy difference large enough to clearly resolve the two states.\n\n<<<A>>>"
