    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the correct equation:\n\n1.  **Understand the Governing Principle:** The distribution of atoms among different energy levels in a gas in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) is described by the Boltzmann equation. The equation relates the number of atoms in an excited state to the number of atoms in a lower energy state as a function of temperature.\n\n2.  **Write the Boltzmann Equation:** For two energy levels, a lower level `i` and an upper level `j`, the ratio of their populations (N_j / N_i) is given by:\n    N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n    Where:\n    *   N_j, N_i are the number of atoms in levels j and i.\n    *   g_j, g_i are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   ΔE = E_j - E_i is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Apply the Equation to Both Stars:** We can write the population ratio for the specific iron transition in each star.\n    *   For star_1 with temperature T_1:\n        (N_j / N_i)_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n    *   For star_2 with temperature T_2:\n        (N_j / N_i)_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n    Note that ΔE, g_j, g_i, and k are constants, as we are observing the same atomic transition in both stars.\n\n4.  **Use the Information from the Problem:** The problem states that iron atoms in star_1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star_2. This means the ratio of atoms in the excited state to the lower state is twice as large for star_1 compared to star_2.\n    (N_j / N_i)_1 = 2 * (N_j / N_i)_2\n\n5.  **Substitute and Simplify:** Now, we substitute the Boltzmann equations from step 3 into the relationship from step 4:\n    (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * [(g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]]\n\n    The statistical weight term (g_j / g_i) cancels out from both sides:\n    exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n6.  **Solve for the Relationship between T_1 and T_2:** To isolate the temperatures, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:\n    ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n\n    Using the logarithm properties (ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b) and ln(e^x) = x):\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n    Now, rearrange the terms to solve for ln(2):\n    ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n\n7.  **Factor and Combine Terms:** Factor out the constant term (ΔE / k):\n    (ΔE / k) * [1/T_2 - 1/T_1] = ln(2)\n\n    Combine the fractions inside the brackets:\n    (ΔE / k) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] = ln(2)\n\n8.  **Use the Given Numerical Values:** The problem provides:\n    *   Energy difference, ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J.\n    *   The Boltzmann constant, k, is a fundamental physical constant with a value of approximately k ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K.\n\n    Therefore, the ratio (ΔE / k) is:\n    (ΔE / k) ≈ (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) ≈ 1 K\n\n    Substituting this value back into our equation:\n    1 * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] = ln(2)\n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** The derived equation matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
