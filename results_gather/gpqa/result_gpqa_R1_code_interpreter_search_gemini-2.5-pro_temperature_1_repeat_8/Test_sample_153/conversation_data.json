    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotope of each element.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. This M+ and M+2 pattern is characteristic of a molecule containing a halogen.\n    *   The natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is approximately 75% ³⁵Cl and 25% ³⁷Cl, leading to an M+ to M+2 peak ratio of about 3:1 (or 100:33).\n    *   The natural abundance of bromine isotopes is approximately 50% ⁷⁹Br and 50% ⁸¹Br, leading to an M+ to M+2 peak ratio of about 1:1 (or 100:100).\n*   **Conclusion:** The observed ratio of 100:32 strongly indicates the presence of **one chlorine atom** in the molecule.\n\nLet's check the molecular weight of the proposed options, all of which have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\nMolecular Weight = (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 35) + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol (using the ³⁵Cl isotope). This is consistent with all the options.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, a C=O stretch for a conjugated carboxylic acid falls around 1725-1700 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Conclusion:** The IR spectrum strongly indicates the presence of a **carboxylic acid functional group**. This eliminates option **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde** (which has an aldehyde and a phenol) and **D) Phenyl chloroformate** (which has an acid chloride and no O-H group). We are left with options A and B.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal far downfield (typically >10 ppm) that is a singlet and integrates to one proton is the classic signature of a **carboxylic acid proton**. This further confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n    *   The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   In a para-substituted ring, there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons. The protons adjacent (ortho) to one substituent are equivalent, and the protons adjacent to the other substituent are also equivalent. They split each other into doublets.\n*   **Conclusion:** The ¹H NMR shows a carboxylic acid proton and a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. This structure fits the NMR data perfectly.\n    *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is an ortho-substituted (1,2-disubstituted) benzene ring. This would result in four unique aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern, not two simple doublets.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBy combining all the spectral data:\n*   MS shows a molecular weight of 156 and one chlorine atom.\n*   IR shows a carboxylic acid group.\n*   ¹H NMR shows a carboxylic acid proton and a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\nThe only structure that fits all these criteria is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
