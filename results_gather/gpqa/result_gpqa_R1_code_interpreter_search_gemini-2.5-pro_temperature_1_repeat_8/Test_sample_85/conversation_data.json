    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Products and Reactions\n\n*   **Product:** Both reactions produce a derivative of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring lactone (a delta-lactone) with a chiral center at position C4, which bears an ethyl group.\n    *   Reaction 1 Product: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n    *   Reaction 2 Product: (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Formation of the Lactone:** A delta-lactone is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. The specific hydroxy acid required here is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    *   `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2OH(5) --(H+)--> Lactone + H2O`\n    *   The chiral center in the hydroxy acid is at C3. Upon cyclization, C3 of the acid becomes C4 of the lactone. The stereochemistry at this center is preserved during lactonization.\n\n### 2. Deduce the Structure of the Starting Material\n\n*   The starting material must be a precursor to 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   The reactions involve selective reduction of one of two carbonyl groups. This implies the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid derivative.\n*   The parent acid is 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid): `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`. This molecule has a chiral center at C3.\n*   The options provide the name \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". While the name is somewhat ambiguous, it clearly describes a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid.\n*   The structure of the starting material (A and B) is: `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu`. This molecule has a carboxylic acid group and an isobutyl ester group, separated by a three-carbon chain containing the chiral center.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Reducing Agents\n\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH3 (Borane):** This reagent selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n\n### 4. Analyze Reaction 1: A + LiBH4 → (R)-Lactone\n\n1.  **Reduction Step:** LiBH4 reduces the ester group of starting material A.\n    `HOOC-CH2-CH*(Et)-CH2-COOiBu (A) --LiBH4--> HOOC-CH2-CH*(Et)-CH2-CH2OH (Hydroxy Acid)`\n    The reaction does not affect the chiral center (`*`).\n2.  **Stereochemical Analysis:** We need to compare the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the groups attached to the chiral center before and after the reduction to see if the R/S designation changes.\n    *   **Starting Material (A):** The groups at the chiral center are -H, -Et, `-CH2COOH`, and `-CH2COOiBu`.\n        *   Priorities: P1: `-CH2COOiBu` > P2: `-CH2COOH` > P3: `-CH2CH3`\n    *   **Hydroxy Acid Intermediate:** The groups are -H, -Et, `-CH2COOH`, and `-CH2CH2OH`.\n        *   Priorities: P1: `-CH2COOH` > P2: `-CH2CH2OH` > P3: `-CH2CH3`\n3.  **Configuration Change:**\n    *   The group that was Priority 1 in A (`-CH2COOiBu`) becomes the group with Priority 2 in the hydroxy acid (`-CH2CH2OH`).\n    *   The group that was Priority 2 in A (`-CH2COOH`) becomes the group with Priority 1 in the hydroxy acid.\n    *   This swap in the ranking of the top two priority groups causes an **inversion** of the stereochemical descriptor (R becomes S, and S becomes R).\n4.  **Lactonization Step:** The hydroxy acid cyclizes to the lactone. A comparison of the CIP priorities for the chiral center in the hydroxy acid and the final lactone shows that the priority order is preserved. Therefore, the configuration does not change during this step.\n5.  **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The overall transformation is (S)-A → (R)-Hydroxy Acid → (R)-Lactone. To obtain the observed (R)-lactone, the starting material **A must have the (S) configuration**.\n\n### 5. Analyze Reaction 2: B + BH3 → (S)-Lactone\n\n1.  **Reduction Step:** BH3 reduces the carboxylic acid group of starting material B.\n    `HOOC-CH2-CH*(Et)-CH2-COOiBu (B) --BH3--> HOCH2-CH2-CH*(Et)-CH2-COOiBu (Hydroxy Ester)`\n    The reaction does not affect the chiral center (`*`).\n2.  **Stereochemical Analysis:**\n    *   **Starting Material (B):** Same as A.\n        *   Priorities: P1: `-CH2COOiBu` > P2: `-CH2COOH` > P3: `-CH2CH3`\n    *   **Hydroxy Ester Intermediate:** The groups are -H, -Et, `-CH2CH2OH`, and `-CH2COOiBu`.\n        *   Priorities: P1: `-CH2COOiBu` > P2: `-CH2CH2OH` > P3: `-CH2CH3`\n3.  **Configuration Change:**\n    *   The group that was Priority 1 in B (`-CH2COOiBu`) remains Priority 1 in the hydroxy ester.\n    *   The group that was Priority 2 in B (`-CH2COOH`) is reduced to `-CH2CH2OH`, which becomes Priority 2 in the hydroxy ester.\n    *   The priority ranking of the groups (P1 > P2 > P3) is **preserved**. Therefore, the stereochemical descriptor does **not** change (R remains R, S remains S).\n4.  **Lactonization Step:** The hydroxy ester cyclizes to the lactone, and this step also preserves the stereochemistry.\n5.  **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The overall transformation is (S)-B → (S)-Hydroxy Ester → (S)-Lactone. To obtain the observed (S)-lactone, the starting material **B must have the (S) configuration**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\n*   Starting material A must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Therefore, A and B are the same compound.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
