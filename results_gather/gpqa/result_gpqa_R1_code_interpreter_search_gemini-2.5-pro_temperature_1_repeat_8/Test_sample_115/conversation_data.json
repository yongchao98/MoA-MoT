    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Compound A:**\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H) and a quartet at 1.3 ppm (4H).\n    *   The splitting pattern (triplet and quartet) and the integration ratio (6H:4H, which simplifies to 3H:2H) are characteristic of an ethyl group (-CH₂-CH₃).\n    *   The total number of protons (6H + 4H = 10H) suggests two equivalent ethyl groups.\n    *   A simple alkane with 10 protons has the formula C₄H₁₀. The only symmetrical isomer is n-butane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃).\n    *   In n-butane, the two -CH₃ groups are equivalent and adjacent to a -CH₂ group, so they appear as a triplet. The two -CH₂ groups are equivalent and adjacent to both a -CH₃ (3H) and a -CH₂ (2H), so they should appear as a sextet (n+1 = 5+1 = 6).\n    *   The problem states a \"quartet\" for the 4H signal. This is a slight inaccuracy in the problem description, as it should be a more complex multiplet (sextet). However, given the subsequent reactions, it's highly probable that Compound A is **n-butane**. This is a common simplification in textbook problems.\n\n2.  **Identify Compound B:**\n    *   Compound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination. This is a free-radical halogenation.\n    *   CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃ + Br₂ --(light)--> CH₃-CH(Br)-CH₂-CH₃ (major) + CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂Br (minor).\n    *   Bromination is selective for the most stable radical intermediate. The secondary radical (at C2) is more stable than the primary radical (at C1).\n    *   Therefore, the major product, Compound B, is **2-bromobutane**.\n\n3.  **Identify Compound C:**\n    *   Compound B (2-bromobutane) reacts with alcoholic KOH. This is a dehydrohalogenation (elimination) reaction.\n    *   The base (OH⁻) removes a proton from a carbon adjacent to the one bearing the bromine, and the bromide ion leaves, forming a double bond.\n    *   Elimination can occur in two ways:\n        *   Removing a proton from C1 gives but-1-ene.\n        *   Removing a proton from C3 gives but-2-ene.\n    *   According to Zaitsev's rule, the more substituted (more stable) alkene is the major product. But-2-ene is more substituted than but-1-ene.\n    *   Therefore, Compound C is **but-2-ene** (CH₃-CH=CH-CH₃).\n    *   The problem states that C has two geometrical isomers. But-2-ene exists as **cis-but-2-ene** and **trans-but-2-ene**. This confirms our identification.\n\n4.  **Identify Compound D (Diels-Alder Reaction):**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   **Dienophile:** The *cis-isomer of C*, which is **cis-but-2-ene**.\n    *   **Diene:** (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol.\n    *   The reaction forms a six-membered ring (a cyclohexene derivative). The product is **4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**. This matches the base name in the options.\n\n5.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of Compound D:**\n    *   We must analyze the stereochemical consequences of the Diels-Alder reaction.\n    *   **Rule 1 (from Dienophile):** The stereochemistry of the dienophile is conserved. Since we start with *cis*-but-2-ene, the two methyl groups added to the ring (at positions C5 and C6) must be **cis** to each other in the product.\n    *   **Rule 2 (from Diene):** The stereochemistry of the diene's termini is conserved. An (E,E)-diene gives a product where the terminal substituents (at C1 and C4) are **trans** to each other. So, the -OH group at C1 and the -CH₃ group at C4 should be **trans**.\n\n6.  **Analyze the Options based on Stereochemical Rules:**\n    *   Let's check the options against Rule 1 (C5-Me and C6-Me must be cis).\n        *   We need to determine if the configurations (e.g., 5S, 6R) correspond to a cis or trans relationship. Two cis substituents on adjacent chiral centers will have configurations of either (R,R) or (S,S) relative to each other in this specific ring system, while trans will be (R,S) or (S,R).\n        *   **Option A: (1S,4R,5S,6R)**... The configurations at C5 and C6 are S and R. This corresponds to a **trans** relationship between the two methyl groups. This contradicts Rule 1. Thus, Option A is incorrect.\n        *   **Option D: (1S,4R,5S,6S)**... The configurations at C5 and C6 are S and S. This corresponds to a **cis** relationship between the two methyl groups. This is consistent with Rule 1.\n        *   Options B and C have the wrong substitution pattern (4,6,6-trimethyl) and can be eliminated.\n\n7.  **Final Check and Conclusion:**\n    *   Only Option D is consistent with the stereochemistry of the dienophile (cis-but-2-ene).\n    *   Let's examine the diene stereochemistry in Option D. The configuration is (1S, 4R). This corresponds to a **cis** relationship between the -OH at C1 and the -CH₃ at C4.\n    *   This contradicts Rule 2, which states that an (E,E)-diene should give a **trans** product. This indicates a typo in the problem statement; the diene should likely have been named as an (E,Z)-isomer to yield a cis-1,4 product.\n    *   However, in a multiple-choice context, we must choose the best possible answer. Option A is definitively wrong based on the dienophile's stereochemistry. Options B and C are wrong based on the product's structure. Option D is the only one that correctly represents the stereochemical outcome from the specified *dienophile*. Therefore, it is the intended answer despite the inconsistency in the diene's name.\n\nThe final product is (1S,4R,5S,6S)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol.\n\n<<<D>>>"
