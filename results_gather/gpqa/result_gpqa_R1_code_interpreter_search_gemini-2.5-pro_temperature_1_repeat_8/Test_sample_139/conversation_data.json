    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues about the Substances and Reactions:**\n\n    *   **Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope.** This immediately suggests isotopes like Deuterium (D or ²H), ¹³C, ¹⁵N, etc.\n    *   **Substance B has a melting point very close to 277 K.** 277 Kelvin is 3.85 °C. This is remarkably close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K). This is a very strong indicator that **B is D₂O**.\n    *   **Gas W's molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.** Let's examine candidates. Deuterium gas (D₂) consists of two deuterium atoms. Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly. This reinforces the idea that we are dealing with deuterium chemistry.\n    *   **Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to release gas W (D₂) and form a precipitate G.** If W is D₂, the reaction is producing deuterium gas. To get D₂ gas from a reaction, Substance X (which contains D) likely needs to react with a deuterium source. The most common liquid deuterium source is heavy water, D₂O. So, **liquid Y is D₂O**. The reaction is `X + D₂O → D₂ (gas) + G (precipitate)`. This is characteristic of a metal deuteride reacting with heavy water, analogous to a metal hydride reacting with normal water (`M-H + H₂O → H₂ + M-OH`). The deuterated version would be `M-D + D₂O → D₂ + M-OD`.\n    *   **Precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O).** This means `G → D₂O + other products`. If G is a metal deuteroxide (M-OD or M(OD)ₓ), heating it would cause decomposition. For example, `Ca(OD)₂ → CaO + D₂O`, or `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This process fits the description.\n    *   **X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.** This points towards common laboratory reagents.\n    *   **The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.** A keto acid has the structure R-CO-COOH, containing at least 3 oxygen atoms (one in the keto group C=O, two in the carboxyl group -COOH). For the product to have only 2 oxygen atoms, a reduction must have occurred that removes an oxygen atom or reduces both functional groups. A powerful reducing agent like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) can reduce both a ketone and a carboxylic acid. The reaction would be: `R-CO-COOH + [Reducing Agent] → R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH`. The product, a diol, has exactly two oxygen atoms.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X:**\n\n    *   Based on the clues, X is likely the deuterated analog of a powerful reducing agent. The most fitting candidate is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   Let's verify LiAlD₄ against all clues:\n        *   **Heavy Isotope:** Contains Deuterium (D). **Check.**\n        *   **Analog:** The non-deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), is a very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. **Check.**\n        *   **Reaction with Y (D₂O):** `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD (soluble) + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate) + 4D₂ (gas)`. The reaction is known to be violent. **Check.**\n        *   **Gas W:** The gas produced is D₂, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. **Check.**\n        *   **Precipitate G:** Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, is a gelatinous precipitate, analogous to aluminum hydroxide. **Check.**\n        *   **Heating G:** `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. It releases D₂O (Substance B). **Check.**\n        *   **Melting Point of B:** B is D₂O, which has a melting point of ~277 K. **Check.**\n        *   **Keto Acid Reaction:** As established, LiAlD₄ is powerful enough to reduce a keto acid to a diol, resulting in a product with 2 oxygen atoms. **Check.**\n\n    *   All clues consistently point to **X = LiAlD₄**.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". It also clarifies that if an element appears multiple times, all its masses should be summed.\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n    *   **Elements present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Atomic Numbers:** H (Z=1), Li (Z=3), Al (Z=13).\n    *   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (represented by Deuterium).\n    *   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum.\n    *   We need to calculate the total mass contributed by all the hydrogen (deuterium) atoms and add it to the total mass contributed by all the aluminum atoms. We will use integer atomic mass units (amu) for simplicity, as the options are integers.\n        *   Mass of one Deuterium (D or ²H) atom ≈ 2 amu.\n        *   Mass of one Aluminum (²⁷Al) atom ≈ 27 amu.\n    *   **Total mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 deuterium atoms in LiAlD₄.\n        *   Total Mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 amu = 8 amu.\n    *   **Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is 1 aluminum atom in LiAlD₄.\n        *   Total Mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 amu = 27 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:** Sum of the two totals.\n        *   Cumulative Mass = 8 amu + 27 amu = 35 amu.\n\nTo confirm with more precise numbers:\n```python\n# Mass of Deuterium (²H) is approximately 2.014 amu.\n# Mass of Aluminum (²⁷Al) is approximately 26.982 amu.\n# Substance is LiAlD₄.\n# Lightest element is Hydrogen (as Deuterium), heaviest is Aluminum.\n# Total mass from Deuterium = 4 * 2.014 = 8.056 amu\n# Total mass from Aluminum = 1 * 26.982 = 26.982 amu\n# Sum = 8.056 + 26.982 = 35.038 amu\nprint(35.038)\n```\nThe result, 35.038, is extremely close to 35.\n\nFinal Answer matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify the Substances**\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X contains a heavier isotope.** This is a major hint. I should think about common isotopes used in chemistry, like Deuterium (D, or ²H), ¹³C, ¹⁵N, etc.\n\n    *   **Clue 2: Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W.** This suggests a highly reactive substance, like an alkali metal, a hydride, or a similar compound reacting with a protic substance like water or an alcohol.\n\n    *   **Clue 3: Gas W's molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.** Let's test some simple diatomic gases:\n        *   H₂ (Hydrogen): Each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. The molecule has 2 protons, 0 neutrons. Doesn't match.\n        *   N₂ (Nitrogen): Each ¹⁴N has 7 protons, 7 neutrons. The molecule has 14 protons, 14 neutrons. This is a match.\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium): Each D (²H) has 1 proton, 1 neutron. The molecule has 2 protons, 2 neutrons. This is also a perfect match.\n        *   Given Clue 1 about a \"heavier isotope\" of a constituent element, D₂ is a much more likely candidate for W than N₂. So, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that **W is D₂** and the heavier isotope is Deuterium.\n\n    *   **Clue 4: A precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B.** This tells me about the products. The reaction is `X + Y → D₂ (gas) + G (precipitate)`. Then `G --(heat)--> B`.\n\n    *   **Clue 5: The melting point of B is very close to 277 K.**\n        *   Let's convert Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n        *   I know the melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n        *   What about heavy water (D₂O)? I'll search for its melting point.\n        <search>melting point of heavy water D2O</search>\n        <information>The melting point of heavy water (D2O) is 3.82 °C (38.88 °F; 276.97 K).</information>\n        *   This is an excellent match. 276.97 K is \"very close to 277 K\". So, **B is D₂O**.\n\n    *   **Putting it together so far:**\n        *   If heating G produces D₂O (B), then G must contain both D and O. A metal deuteroxide (M(OD)ₓ) is a likely candidate, as heating a metal hydroxide often yields the metal oxide and water (`M(OH)ₓ → MₐOₑ + H₂O`). The deuterated equivalent would be `M(OD)ₓ → MₐOₑ + D₂O`.\n        *   If X reacts to form D₂ gas and a metal deuteroxide precipitate (G), it is very likely that X is a metal deuteride and it reacts with heavy water (D₂O). The violent reaction would be: `Metal-Deuteride (X) + D₂O (Y) → D₂ (W) + Metal-Deuteroxide (G)`. This confirms my hypothesis that **Y is D₂O**.\n\n    *   **Clue 6: The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.**\n        *   A keto acid has the general formula R-C(=O)-COOH. It has one ketone group and one carboxylic acid group. It contains at least 3 oxygen atoms.\n        *   If the product has only 2 oxygen atoms, X must be a **reducing agent**. A strong reducing agent could reduce both functional groups.\n        *   `R-C(=O)-COOH --[Reduction]--> R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH`\n        *   The product, a diol, has exactly two oxygen atoms. This reaction requires a powerful reducing agent.\n\n    *   **Clue 7: Substance X and its very close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.**\n        *   This points me to common laboratory reagents. A powerful reducing agent used in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its \"very close analog\" containing a heavier isotope would be **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n    *   **Final Verification: Is X = LiAlD₄?**\n        *   **Heavier isotope?** Yes, Deuterium.\n        *   **Analog in organic chemistry?** Yes, LiAlH₄.\n        *   **Reaction with Y (D₂O)?** `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂`. This is a known violent reaction. LiOD is soluble in D₂O, but Al(OD)₃ is an insoluble gelatinous precipitate.\n        *   **Gas W?** D₂, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. Check.\n        *   **Precipitate G?** Al(OD)₃. Check.\n        *   **Heating G releases B?** `2 Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O`. Yes, it releases D₂O (B). Check.\n        *   **Melting point of B?** B is D₂O, melting point ~277 K. Check.\n        *   **Keto acid reaction?** LiAlD₄ is a powerful enough reducing agent to perform the required transformation. Check.\n        *   All clues point conclusively to **X = LiAlD₄**.\n\n2.  **Perform the Calculation**\n\n    *   **The Goal:** Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄). The masses of all atoms of those elements must be summed.\n    *   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Atomic Numbers:** H (Z=1), Li (Z=3), Al (Z=13).\n    *   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (present as D).\n    *   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (Al).\n    *   **Masses (using integer approximations for atomic mass units, as the answers are integers):**\n        *   Mass of one Deuterium (²H) atom ≈ 2 amu.\n        *   Mass of one Aluminum (²⁷Al, the most common isotope) atom ≈ 27 amu.\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is one Al atom. Mass = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n        *   Total mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen/Deuterium): There are four D atoms. Mass = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n        *   Cumulative Mass = (Mass from Al) + (Mass from D) = 27 + 8 = 35 amu.\n\n3.  **Code-assisted verification (optional but helpful for confidence):**\n    I can use a python script to sum the more precise masses to see if the result is close to an integer option.\n\n    ```python\n    # Atomic mass of Deuterium (²H) is ~2.014 amu\n    # Atomic mass of Aluminum (²⁷Al) is ~26.982 amu\n    # Substance is LiAlD₄\n    \n    # Total mass contributed by the 4 atoms of the lightest element (Deuterium)\n    mass_of_deuterium = 4 * 2.014\n    \n    # Total mass contributed by the 1 atom of the heaviest element (Aluminum)\n    mass_of_aluminum = 1 * 26.982\n    \n    # Cumulative mass\n    cumulative_mass = mass_of_deuterium + mass_of_aluminum\n    \n    print(cumulative_mass)\n    ```\n\nThe result of the code will be approximately 35.038, which strongly supports 35 as the correct answer.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Selection**\n\n    The calculated cumulative mass is 35 amu. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B and the Isotope:** The clue states that substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope Deuterium (D or ²H), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is an extremely close match. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**, and the heavy isotope involved is **Deuterium (D)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The gas W is released from a reaction involving deuterium. The clue states its molecule contains an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   A Deuterium atom (D or ²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   A molecule of deuterium gas (D₂) would have 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This perfectly matches the description.\n    *   Therefore, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Reaction and Substances X, Y, and G:**\n    *   Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to release D₂ (gas W) and form a precipitate G. Since deuterium is involved, it is highly probable that liquid Y is heavy water, D₂O.\n    *   The reaction is `X + D₂O → D₂ + G`. This is characteristic of a metal deuteride reacting with heavy water, analogous to a metal hydride reacting with normal water (e.g., `NaH + H₂O → H₂ + NaOH`).\n    *   The precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This suggests G is a metal deuteroxide, as heating a metal hydroxide often yields a metal oxide and water. For example, `Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + D₂O`.\n\n4.  **Use the Organic Chemistry Clues to Identify X:**\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) has at least 3 oxygen atoms. To get a product with only 2 oxygens, a powerful reduction must occur, converting both the ketone and the carboxylic acid to alcohol groups (`R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH`).\n    *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points to a common, powerful reducing agent. The most famous one is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n    *   The deuterated analog of LiAlH₄ is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. This fits all the criteria:\n        *   It contains the heavy isotope Deuterium.\n        *   Its analog, LiAlH₄, is a staple in organic chemistry.\n        *   It is a powerful reducing agent capable of reducing a keto acid to a diol.\n        *   Its reaction with heavy water is violent: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → 4D₂ (W) + LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G)`. Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃) is a precipitate.\n        *   Heating the precipitate G (`Al(OD)₃`) releases D₂O (B).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic mass of the lightest and heaviest elements in substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (present as 4 atoms of Deuterium). The mass of one deuterium atom is approximately 2 amu.\n        *   Total mass from Deuterium = 4 × 2 amu = 8 amu.\n    *   **Heaviest element:** Aluminum (present as 1 atom). The mass of one aluminum atom is approximately 27 amu.\n        *   Total mass from Aluminum = 1 × 27 amu = 27 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative mass** = (Total mass from Al) + (Total mass from D) = 27 + 8 = 35 amu.\n\nThe calculated value is 35.\n\n<<<D>>>"
