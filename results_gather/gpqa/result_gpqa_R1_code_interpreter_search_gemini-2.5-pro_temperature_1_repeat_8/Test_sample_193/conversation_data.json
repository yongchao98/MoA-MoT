    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the partition function Z for a system of three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can take a value of either +1 or -1. The total number of possible configurations (microstates) for this system is 2^3 = 8.\n\nThe energy of the system is given by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J [ S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 ]\n\nThe partition function, Z, is defined as the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), where β = 1/(kT).\nZ = Σ_states e^(-βE_state)\n\nWe need to enumerate all 8 possible microstates, calculate the energy for each, and then sum their respective Boltzmann factors.\n\nLet's list the states by the configuration of spins (S1, S2, S3):\n\n**Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n*   **State 1: (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)**\n    The term S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.\n    The energy is E1 = -J * (3) = -3J.\n    The Boltzmann factor is e^(-β(-3J)) = e^(3Jβ).\n\n*   **State 2: (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)**\n    The term S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.\n    The energy is E2 = -J * (3) = -3J.\n    The Boltzmann factor is e^(-β(-3J)) = e^(3Jβ).\n\nThere are two states with energy E = -3J. Their total contribution to the partition function is 2 * e^(3Jβ).\n\n**Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\nThis case includes states where two spins are +1 and one is -1, or two spins are -1 and one is +1.\n\n*   **Subcase 2a: Two spins are +1, one is -1.**\n    There are three such states: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), and (-1, +1, +1).\n    Let's calculate the energy for one of them, e.g., (+1, +1, -1):\n    S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1.\n    The energy is E = -J * (-1) = J.\n    All three states in this subcase are equivalent by symmetry and have the same energy, E = J.\n    The total contribution from these three states is 3 * e^(-βJ) = 3e^(-Jβ).\n\n*   **Subcase 2b: One spin is +1, two are -1.**\n    There are three such states: (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), and (-1, -1, +1).\n    Let's calculate the energy for one of them, e.g., (+1, -1, -1):\n    S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1.\n    The energy is E = -J * (-1) = J.\n    Similarly, all three states in this subcase have the same energy, E = J.\n    The total contribution from these three states is 3 * e^(-βJ) = 3e^(-Jβ).\n\nIn total, there are 3 + 3 = 6 states with energy E = J. Their total contribution to the partition function is 6 * e^(-Jβ).\n\n**Calculating the Partition Function Z**\n\nNow, we sum the contributions from all 8 states:\nZ = (Contribution from Case 1) + (Contribution from Case 2)\nZ = (2 * e^(3Jβ)) + (6 * e^(-Jβ))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 2e^(2Jβ)+6e^(-2Jβ)\nB) Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ)+6e^(Jβ)\nC) Z= 2 e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ)\nD) Z= 6e^(2Jβ)+2e^(-2Jβ)\n\nThe calculated partition function matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
