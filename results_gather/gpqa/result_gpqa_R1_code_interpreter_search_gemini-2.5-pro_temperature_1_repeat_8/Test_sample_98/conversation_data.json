    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not help distinguish between the choices.\n\n### **2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThis is the key to distinguishing between the isomers. We are given two specific, complex splitting patterns for two different protons in the molecule.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This confirms the molecule is saturated (contains no C=C double bonds), which is true for all four options.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nLet's break down what these splitting patterns mean based on the n+1 rule, where 'n' is the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons:\n*   A **doublet (d)** means the proton is coupled to **1** neighboring proton.\n*   A **triplet (t)** means the proton is coupled to **2** neighboring protons.\n*   A **quartet (q)** means the proton is coupled to **3** neighboring protons.\n\nTherefore:\n*   **dtq:** A single proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: a set of 1 proton, a set of 2 protons, and a set of 3 protons.\n*   **dtt:** A single proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: a set of 1 proton, a set of 2 protons, and another different set of 2 protons.\n\nOur task is to find the molecule that has two different protons matching these descriptions. Let's analyze the structure of each option. The most complex signals will come from the protons on the chiral centers (the `C(H)` groups).\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Candidate Molecule**\n\nFirst, let's correctly identify the structures from the condensed formulas.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH:** 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH:** 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH:** 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH:** 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid\n\nNow, let's analyze the protons on the main chain for each.\n\n---\n\n**A) 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃-CH₂-CH(d)(CH₃)-CH(e)(CH₃)-COOH`\n*   **Proton (d):** Coupled to H(e) (1H, doublet), the -CH₂- group (2H, triplet), and its own methyl group (3H, quartet). This gives a **dtq**. This matches one signal.\n*   **Proton (e):** Coupled to H(d) (1H, doublet) and its own methyl group (3H, quartet). This gives a **dq (doublet of quartets)**.\n*   *Result:* Has a dtq, but not a dtt. **Incorrect.**\n\n---\n\n**B) 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH(d)(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH`\n*   **Proton (d):** Coupled to H(c) (1H, doublet), the -CH₂- group (2H, triplet), and its own methyl group (3H, quartet). This gives a **dtq**. This matches one signal.\n*   **Proton (c):** Coupled to H(d) (1H, doublet), the terminal CH₃ group (3H, quartet), and its own methyl group (3H, quartet). This gives a **dqq (doublet of quartets of quartets)**.\n*   *Result:* Has a dtq, but not a dtt. **Incorrect.**\n\n---\n\n**C) 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃-CH₂-CH(d)(Et)-CH(e)(Et)-COOH`\n*   **Proton (d):** Coupled to H(e) (1H, doublet), the -CH₂- group of the main chain (2H, triplet), and the -CH₂- group of its ethyl side chain (2H, triplet). This gives a **dtt**. This matches one signal.\n*   **Proton (e):** Coupled to H(d) (1H, doublet) and the -CH₂- group of its ethyl side chain (2H, triplet). This gives a **dt (doublet of triplets)**.\n*   *Result:* Has a dtt, but not a dtq. **Incorrect.**\n\n---\n\n**D) 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃-CH(b)(Et)-CH(c)(Et)-CH₂-COOH`\nLet's analyze the two key protons, H(b) and H(c).\n\n*   **Proton H(b) (on C4):**\n    *   Coupled to the terminal **CH₃** group (3 neighbors) -> gives a **quartet (q)**.\n    *   Coupled to proton **H(c)** on C3 (1 neighbor) -> gives a **doublet (d)**.\n    *   Coupled to the **-CH₂-** of its ethyl side chain (2 neighbors) -> gives a **triplet (t)**.\n    *   **Result for H(b):** A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This perfectly matches the first signal.\n\n*   **Proton H(c) (on C3):**\n    *   Coupled to proton **H(b)** on C4 (1 neighbor) -> gives a **doublet (d)**.\n    *   Coupled to the **-CH₂-** group on C2 of the main chain (2 neighbors) -> gives a **triplet (t)**.\n    *   Coupled to the **-CH₂-** of its own ethyl side chain (2 neighbors) -> gives another **triplet (t)**.\n    *   **Result for H(c):** A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This perfectly matches the second signal.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nMolecule D, **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**, is the only compound that contains a proton that would appear as a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) AND a different proton that would appear as a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).\n\n<<<D>>>"
