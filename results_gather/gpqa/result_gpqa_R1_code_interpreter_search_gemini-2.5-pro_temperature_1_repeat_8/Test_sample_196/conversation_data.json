    "*   **Step 1: Elucidate the structure of Compound X from spectroscopic data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectroscopy:**\n        *   The broad absorption from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n        *   The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are indicative of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n        *   Conclusion from IR: Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This very downfield, broad singlet is a classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). This confirms the IR analysis.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The presence of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggests a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is ortho to an electron-withdrawing group (the -COOH group), while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is ortho to an electron-donating group (an alkyl group).\n        *   **Alkyl group analysis (0.9 to 2.9 ppm):**\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a -CH₂-CH₃ group (an ethyl fragment).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a CH-CH₃ group.\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the -CH₂- from the ethyl fragment, which is further coupled to another proton.\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the CH- proton, which is attached to the benzene ring and coupled to multiple adjacent protons.\n        *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** The fragments are -CH₂CH₃ and -CH(CH₃)-. Connecting them gives a sec-butyl group: -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃.\n            *   The proton at 2.9 ppm is the benzylic CH.\n            *   The protons at 1.7 ppm are the CH₂ group.\n            *   The protons at 1.4 ppm are the methyl group attached to the benzylic carbon.\n            *   The protons at 0.9 ppm are the terminal methyl group of the ethyl part.\n        *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. This matches option (D).\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the reaction and the product.**\n\n    *   **Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is treated with red phosphorus and hydriodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reagent Function:** Red P/HI is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). It does not affect the aromatic ring or the alkyl substituent.\n    *   **Transformation:**\n        *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n        *   Reaction: Reduction of the -COOH group.\n        *   -COOH → -CH₃\n        *   The sec-butyl group at position 4 remains unchanged.\n        *   Product: The final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n*   **Step 3: Match the product with the given options.**\n\n    *   The calculated product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n    *   This matches option (B).\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
