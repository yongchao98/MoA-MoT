    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a trans-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n          H       CH2CH2CH3\n           \\     /\n            C = C\n           /     \\\n    CH3CH2CH2   H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process.\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs epoxidation on the alkene. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** This reagent opens the epoxide ring. The acid-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide is an *anti*-addition, where the nucleophile (water) attacks from the side opposite the epoxide C-O bond.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence of epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene (addition of two -OH groups across the double bond, one from the top face and one from the bottom face).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** There is a well-established stereochemical rule for this type of reaction: the *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a *meso* compound.\n    *   *Mnemonic: T-A-M (Trans + Anti -> Meso)*\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The product is meso-octane-4,5-diol. A meso compound is a single, achiral molecule that contains chiral centers but has a plane of symmetry. Let's call this **Product A**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a cis-alkene. It is also an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n    CH3CH2CH2\\     /CH2CH2CH3\n              C = C\n             /     \\\n            H       H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents are the same as in Reaction 1, leading to an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical rule for the *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene is the formation of a *racemic* mixture.\n    *   *Mnemonic: C-A-R (Cis + Anti -> Racemic)*\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The product is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. A racemic mixture contains equal amounts of two enantiomers. Let's call this mixture **Product B**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's examine the relationship between these isomers:\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of (4R,5R)-diol.\n*   The meso-diol is also a **diastereomer** of (4S,5S)-diol.\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers** of each other.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Chromatogram on a Standard (Achiral) HPLC Column**\n\n*   **Principle:** A standard, achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated; they elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Application:**\n    *   The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have different properties. Thus, it will be separated from them.\n    *   The two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, will co-elute as a single peak.\n*   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **two peaks**:\n    *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   Peak 2: The racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n**Step 5: Predict the Chromatogram on a Chiral HPLC Column**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. This chiral environment allows it to interact differently with enantiomers, enabling their separation. It can also separate diastereomers. Therefore, a chiral column can separate all stereoisomers in a mixture.\n*   **Application:** The chiral column will separate the three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture.\n*   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **three peaks**:\n    *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n    (Note: The order of elution depends on the specific column and conditions.)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Standard (achiral) HPLC: **2 peaks**\n*   Chiral HPLC: **3 peaks**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
