    "This question has two parts, one related to thermodynamics and the other to kinetics of oxygen as an oxidizing agent.\n\n**Part 1: Thermodynamics**\n\nThe strength of an oxidizing agent is determined by its standard reduction potential (E°). A higher (more positive) E° value indicates a stronger oxidant. We need to compare the reduction potential of oxygen in acidic and basic solutions.\n\nThe standard half-reaction for the reduction of oxygen in an acidic solution is:\nO₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l)\nThe standard reduction potential for this reaction is E° = +1.23 V.\n\nThe standard half-reaction for the reduction of oxygen in a basic solution is:\nO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq)\nThe standard reduction potential for this reaction is E° = +0.40 V.\n\nComparing the two values, +1.23 V (acidic) > +0.40 V (basic). This means that oxygen is a thermodynamically stronger oxidizing agent in acidic solution than in basic solution. Conversely, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n\nThis eliminates options A and D.\n\n**Part 2: Kinetics**\n\nThe second part of the question addresses how fast oxygen reacts in acidic solutions. The reduction of molecular oxygen (O₂) is a complex process that involves breaking a very strong O=O double bond. This process has a high activation energy, which means the reaction rate is intrinsically slow.\n\nEven though the reduction of oxygen in acidic solution is very thermodynamically favorable (as indicated by the high E° of +1.23 V), it is kinetically very **slower**. This phenomenon is well-known in electrochemistry and is a major reason for the \"overpotential\" observed in fuel cells and other electrochemical processes involving oxygen reduction. The reaction usually requires a catalyst to proceed at a reasonable rate.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination is weaker and slower.\n\n*   Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions (compared to acidic solutions).\n*   Kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions (despite being a strong oxidant thermodynamically).\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
