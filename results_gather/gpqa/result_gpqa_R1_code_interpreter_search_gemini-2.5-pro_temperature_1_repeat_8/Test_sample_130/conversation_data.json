    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **The Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid (HOOC-CH=CH-COOH).\n    *   Dehydration of maleic acid yields maleic anhydride.\n    *   Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinyl protons (-CH=CH-) chemically equivalent. Their chemical shift is typically around 7 ppm, which matches the description.\n    *   Maleic anhydride has two types of carbon atoms: two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O) and two equivalent vinyl carbons (-CH=CH-). This leads to two signals in the ¹³C NMR spectrum. The carbonyl carbons appear around 165 ppm, and the vinyl carbons around 137 ppm. This perfectly matches the provided data.\n    *   Therefore, the anhydride is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **The Diene:** The anhydride reacts with **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a conjugated diene, suitable for a Diels-Alder reaction. Its structure is a five-membered ring with a CH₂ group at position 5, double bonds at C1-C2 and C3-C4, and methyl groups attached to C1, C2, C3, and C4.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   **The Reaction:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n*   **The Products:** This reaction typically produces two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed. In Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is usually the kinetically favored (major) product, while the *exo* product is the thermodynamically favored (minor) product.\n*   **Molecular Formula Check:** The diene (C₉H₁₄) reacts with the anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) to form an adduct with the formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This matches the molecular formula given in the problem.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Structures of the Major and Minor Products**\n\nThe key difference between the *endo* and *exo* products lies in the relative stereochemistry of the fused anhydride ring. We need to determine which protons are close in space in one isomer but far apart in the other.\n\n*   **Standard Convention for Cyclopentadiene Adducts:**\n    *   ***Endo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the one-carbon bridge (the CH₂ group, C7 in bicyclic numbering). This orientation places the anhydride ring \"under\" the C2=C3 double bond of the original diene system. This allows for stabilizing secondary orbital interactions, making it the kinetic product.\n    *   ***Exo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the CH₂ bridge. This is sterically less hindered and thus more thermodynamically stable.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the NOESY NMR Data**\n\n*   **NOESY Principle:** 2D NOESY NMR spectroscopy shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of their bonding connectivity.\n*   **The Differentiating Cross-Peak:** The problem states that a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor product. This means we are looking for a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n*   **Spatial Proximity Analysis:**\n    *   In the ***endo* (major) product**, the anhydride ring is tucked underneath the molecule. This brings the two protons on the anhydride moiety (let's call them H_a) into close proximity with the two methyl groups on the C=C double bond (let's call them Me_vinyl).\n    *   In the ***exo* (minor) product**, the anhydride ring is flipped up. The H_a protons are now far away from the Me_vinyl groups. Instead, they are closer to the CH₂ bridge protons.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The NOESY cross-peak that is unique to the major product must be between the anhydride protons (H_a) and the vinyl methyl protons (Me_vinyl).\n\n**Step 5: Assign NMR Signals and Choose the Correct Option**\n\nNow, we need to assign the expected ¹H NMR signals to these groups and match them to the given options. The product has a high degree of symmetry (a C_s plane).\n\n*   **Anhydride Protons (H_a):** There are two of them. They are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing anhydride group.\n    *   **Integral:** 2H\n    *   **Multiplicity:** Singlet (any long-range coupling is likely unresolved).\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** Typically ~3.5 ppm.\n\n*   **Vinyl Methyl Protons (Me_vinyl):** There are two methyl groups on the double bond. They are equivalent by symmetry.\n    *   **Integral:** 6H (2 x CH₃)\n    *   **Multiplicity:** Singlet.\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** For methyl groups on a double bond, typically ~1.7 ppm.\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak connects these two signals. We are looking for an option that describes a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n*   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - Incorrect integral (1H).\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm - Incorrect integral (1H).\n*   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** - This perfectly matches our prediction for the vinyl methyl protons (6H, ~1.7 ppm) and the anhydride protons (2H, ~3.5 ppm).\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm - This would be an interaction between the two different sets of methyl groups (vinyl and bridgehead). The relative orientation of these groups is the same in both the *endo* and *exo* isomers, so this cross-peak would be present in both spectra, not just the major product's.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak unique to the major product connects the resonances described in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
