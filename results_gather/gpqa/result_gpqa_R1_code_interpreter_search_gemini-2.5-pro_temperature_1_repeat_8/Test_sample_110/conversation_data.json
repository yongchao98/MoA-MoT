    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base that will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate. This enolate will then act as a nucleophile and attack the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate).\n\n2.  **Identify the nucleophile (enolate formation):**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   We need to identify the acidic α-protons (protons on carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group). The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group, so it is a quaternary carbon and has no α-protons.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the base (t-BuOK) can only abstract the proton from C6. This forms a single regioselective enolate with the double bond between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Identify the electrophile:** The electrophile is ethyl acrylate (CH2=CH-COOEt). In a Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated system.\n\n4.  **Determine the product structure:**\n    *   The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The initial starting ketone structure is:\n        *   C1: C=O\n        *   C2: C(Et)(Me)\n        *   C6: CH(Me)\n    *   The resulting product structure has a new substituent, -(CH2CH2COOEt), attached to C6. The final structure is 6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n5.  **Name the product and match with options:** We need to find the correct IUPAC name for the product. The options name the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent on the propanoate chain.\n    *   Let's follow this convention. The parent chain is \"ethyl ... propanoate\". The cyclohexyl ring is a substituent at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   We number the cyclohexyl ring starting from the point of attachment (our original C6). Let's call this C1' of the substituent.\n    *   **Attachment point (C1'):** This carbon was C6 in the ketone. It has a methyl group attached. So, we have a \"1-methyl\" substituent on the ring.\n    *   **Adjacent to attachment point (C2'):** This carbon was C1 in the ketone. It has the carbonyl group. So, we have a \"2-oxo\" group.\n    *   **Carbon C3':** This carbon was C2 in the ketone. It has an ethyl and a methyl group. So, we have a \"3-ethyl\" and a \"3-methyl\" substituent.\n    *   Combining these pieces gives the name for the cyclohexyl substituent: (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   The full name of the product is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This name matches the product A described in options **C** and **D**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is also a Michael addition. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a base that deprotonates the carbon α to the electron-withdrawing nitro group (-NO2). The resulting carbanion (nitronate) is the nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Identify the nucleophile:**\n    *   The starting material is 1-nitropropane (CH3-CH2-CH2-NO2).\n    *   The α-carbon (C1) has two acidic protons. KOH deprotonates this carbon to form the nucleophilic nitronate anion: [CH3-CH2-CH-NO2]⁻.\n\n3.  **Identify the electrophile:** The electrophile is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile, CH3-CH=CH-CN). The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon.\n\n4.  **Determine the product structure:**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon of the nitronate (C1 of the propane chain) attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile (C3 of the butene chain).\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane part and C3 of the butenenitrile part.\n    *   Structure of the new molecule: CH3-CH2-CH(NO2) — CH(CH3)-CH2-CN.\n    *   The intermediate anion formed at the α-position to the nitrile is protonated by water (H2O) to yield the final product.\n\n5.  **Name the product and match with options:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so it defines the end of the parent chain (C1).\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n        **C6**H3-**C5**H2-**C4**H(NO2)-**C3**H(CH3)-**C2**H2-**C1**N\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent alkane is hexane. The full parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Now, we identify and number the substituents:\n        *   A methyl group (-CH3) is on C3.\n        *   A nitro group (-NO2) is on C4.\n    *   The full name of the product is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This name matches the product B described in options **B** and **C**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A** is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.\n*   **Product B** is 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile.\n\nComparing these conclusions with the given options:\n*   A) A = wrong name, B = wrong name\n*   B) A = wrong name, B = correct name\n*   C) A = correct name, B = correct name\n*   D) A = correct name, B = wrong name\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies both products is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
