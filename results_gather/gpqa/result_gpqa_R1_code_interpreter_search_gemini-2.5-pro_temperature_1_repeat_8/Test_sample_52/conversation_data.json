    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Information Provided**\n\n*   **General Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring (a benzene ring, C6H4).\n*   **Functional Group (FTIR):** An ester group (-COO-). This group contains a carbonyl (C=O) bond.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** Two signals. In a di-substituted benzene ring, two signals for the aromatic protons (integrating to 4H in total) strongly suggest a para (1,4) substitution pattern due to symmetry.\n    *   **Vinyl Protons:** Two signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets). This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group, specifically `-CH=CH-CH3`.\n        *   The proton on the first carbon (`-CH=`) is split by the adjacent vinyl proton, giving a doublet.\n        *   The proton on the second carbon (`=CH-CH3`) is split by the first vinyl proton (making it a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (making it a quartet). The combined pattern is a doublet of quartets.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** Two signals. This means there are two chemically distinct methyl groups in the molecule.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (-CH2):** No signals. This is a crucial piece of information, as it rules out many possible structures.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency) tells us the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule. We can calculate the required DBE from the structural features identified:\n*   Benzene ring: 1 ring + 3 double bonds = 4 DBE\n*   Ester group (C=O): 1 double bond = 1 DBE\n*   Vinyl group (C=C): 1 double bond = 1 DBE\n*   **Total Required DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6**\n\nAny valid chemical formula must correspond to a DBE of 6.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the DBE for Each of the Given Options**\n\nThe formula for DBE is: `DBE = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens (oxygens do not affect the calculation).\n\n```python\ndef calculate_dbe(formula):\n    import re\n    parts = re.findall(r'([A-Z][a-z]*)(\\d*)', formula)\n    counts = {element: int(count) if count else 1 for element, count in parts}\n    C = counts.get('C', 0)\n    H = counts.get('H', 0)\n    dbe = C - H / 2 + 1\n    print(f\"Formula: {formula}, DBE = {int(dbe)}\")\n\nformulas = [\"C11H14O2\", \"C12H14O2\", \"C12H12O2\", \"C11H12O2\"]\nfor f in formulas:\n    calculate_dbe(f)\n```\n<execute_ipython>\n```python\ndef calculate_dbe(formula):\n    import re\n    parts = re.findall(r'([A-Z][a-z]*)(\\d*)', formula)\n    counts = {element: int(count) if count else 1 for element, count in parts}\n    C = counts.get('C', 0)\n    H = counts.get('H', 0)\n    dbe = C - H / 2 + 1\n    print(f\"Formula: {formula}, DBE = {int(dbe)}\")\n\nformulas = [\"C11H14O2\", \"C12H14O2\", \"C12H12O2\", \"C11H12O2\"]\nfor f in formulas:\n    calculate_dbe(f)\n```\n</execute_ipython>\n<execution_result>\nFormula: C11H14O2, DBE = 5\nFormula: C12H14O2, DBE = 6\nFormula: C12H12O2, DBE = 7\nFormula: C11H12O2, DBE = 6\n</execution_result>\nFrom the calculation:\n*   A) C11H14O2: DBE = 5 (Incorrect)\n*   B) C12H14O2: DBE = 6 (Possible)\n*   C) C12H12O2: DBE = 7 (Incorrect)\n*   D) C11H12O2: DBE = 6 (Possible)\n\nThis eliminates options A and C. We must now decide between B and D.\n\n**Step 4: Propose Structures and Differentiate Between B and D**\n\nLet's try to build a structure that fits all the spectroscopic data for both possible formulas.\n\n*   **For D) C11H12O2:**\n    Let's assemble the pieces: a para-substituted benzene ring (C6H4), a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3), and an ester group. The ester must account for the second methyl group. The most logical structure is **Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**.\n    *   **Structure:** `CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-COOCH3` (with para substitution)\n    *   **Check against data:**\n        *   **Formula:** C (1+1+1 from propenyl + 6 from ring + 1 from C=O + 1 from OCH3) = C11. H (3+1+1 from propenyl + 4 from ring + 3 from OCH3) = H12. O2. Formula is **C11H12O2**. Correct.\n        *   **Aromatic H:** 2 signals (para). Correct.\n        *   **Vinyl H:** 2 signals (d, dq). Correct.\n        *   **-CH3 groups:** 2 signals (one from propenyl, one from methyl ester). Correct.\n        *   **No -CH2 groups:** The structure contains no -CH2- groups. Correct.\n    *   This structure perfectly matches all the given information.\n\n*   **For B) C12H14O2:**\n    This formula has one additional carbon and two additional hydrogens (a CH2 unit) compared to the structure we just confirmed for C11H12O2. To maintain the core features (para-aromatic, propenyl), the extra CH2 must be incorporated somewhere. A common way to do this is to change the methyl ester to an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Proposed Structure:** **Ethyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**\n    *   **Structure:** `CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-COOCH2CH3`\n    *   **Check against data:**\n        *   **Formula:** This structure has the formula C12H14O2. Correct.\n        *   **No -CH2 groups:** This structure contains a `-CH2-` group in the ethyl ester. This would produce a signal in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n    *   This contradicts the key information that \"There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\". Other possible isomers of C12H14O2 that lack a CH2 group (e.g., by adding more methyls) will fail to match the other specific NMR signal counts (e.g., number of vinyl protons or aromatic protons). Therefore, C12H14O2 cannot be the correct formula.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly the formula C11H12O2 allows for the construction of a molecule (Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate) that is fully consistent with all pieces of the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Based on the analysis, here is the final answer.\n\n**1. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\nFrom the problem description, we can deduce the structural components:\n*   A 6-membered aromatic ring (benzene ring) has a DBE of 4 (1 ring + 3 double bonds).\n*   An ester group (-COO-) contains a C=O double bond, contributing 1 to the DBE.\n*   The presence of two vinyl-H signals indicates a C=C double bond, contributing another 1 to the DBE.\n\nTherefore, the total required Degree of Unsaturation for the molecule is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n\n**2. Check the DBE for Each Option**\n\nThe python script calculated the DBE for each of the given chemical formulas:\n*   C11H14O2: DBE = 5\n*   C12H14O2: DBE = 6\n*   C12H12O2: DBE = 7\n*   C11H12O2: DBE = 6\n\nThis eliminates options A (C11H14O2) and C (C12H12O2) because their DBE values do not match the required DBE of 6. We are left with options B and D.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Data to Differentiate Between B and D**\n\nLet's propose a structure that fits all the NMR data:\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with two signals:** This suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern due to the symmetry, resulting in only two types of aromatic protons.\n*   **Two vinyl-H signals (doublet and doublet of quartets):** This is the classic splitting pattern for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n*   **Two -CH3 signals:** One methyl group is part of the propenyl group. The second methyl group must be part of the ester, indicating a methyl ester (-COOCH3).\n*   **No -CH2 signals:** This is a crucial piece of information.\n\nLet's assemble a structure with these pieces: a propenyl group and a methyl ester group on a benzene ring in the para position. The structure is **methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**.\n\nLet's check the formula for this proposed structure:\n*   Carbons: 3 (from propenyl) + 6 (from ring) + 1 (from C=O) + 1 (from O-CH3) = 11 carbons.\n*   Hydrogens: 3 (from propenyl-CH3) + 1 (from vinyl) + 1 (from vinyl) + 4 (from ring) + 3 (from ester-CH3) = 12 hydrogens.\n*   Oxygens: 2 (from ester).\nThe chemical formula is **C11H12O2**. This structure has no -CH2- groups, which is consistent with the NMR data.\n\nNow, let's consider the other possibility, C12H14O2 (Option B). This formula has one extra carbon and two extra hydrogens (a -CH2- unit) compared to C11H12O2. A plausible structure would be **ethyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**, which has an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3). However, this structure contains a -CH2- group, which would produce a signal in the 1H NMR spectrum. Since the problem explicitly states there are no signals for -CH2- groups, C12H14O2 is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
