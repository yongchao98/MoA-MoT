    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative. The relative positions of the substituents are crucial for determining the synthesis pathway.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Weakly activating, ortho, para-director. It is very bulky, which sterically hinders ortho substitution.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**3. Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards)**\n\n*   **Final Step**: The ethoxy group (-OEt) is typically introduced by a Williamson ether synthesis. This involves reacting a phenoxide with an ethyl halide (like ethyl bromide, EtBr). So, the immediate precursor should be the corresponding phenol: **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. The reaction would be with NaOH (to form the phenoxide) and then EtBr.\n\n*   **Phenol Formation**: A phenol group (-OH) is often introduced by hydrolyzing a diazonium salt (-N2+). This requires an amino group (-NH2) as a precursor. The sequence is diazotization (with NaNO2/HCl) followed by heating in aqueous acid (H3O+, H2O/Heat). So, the precursor to our phenol is **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n*   **Formation of 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**: This is the most challenging step. The molecule has an amino group (-NH2, o,p director), a tert-butyl group (-tBu, o,p director), and a nitro group (-NO2, m-director). The groups are at positions 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n    *   Let's consider nitrating **2-tert-butylaniline**. Normally, the powerful ortho, para-directing -NH2 group would direct the incoming nitro group to the para position (C4) or ortho position (C6). However, under the strongly acidic conditions of nitration (HNO3/H2SO4), the amino group is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+).\n    *   The anilinium ion (-NH3+) is a **meta-director**.\n    *   So, in the nitration of 2-tert-butylanilinium ion, we have a meta-director (-NH3+) at C1 and an ortho, para-director (-tBu) at C2.\n        *   The -NH3+ group directs nitration to positions C3 and C5.\n        *   The -tBu group directs nitration to its ortho (C3) and meta (C5) positions.\n    *   Both groups direct the incoming electrophile to positions 3 and 5. This allows for the formation of **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline**, which is the required intermediate. This is the key to achieving the 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n\n*   **Formation of 2-tert-butylaniline**: This aniline can be formed by the reduction of the corresponding nitro compound, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, using a reducing agent like Fe/HCl.\n\n*   **Formation of 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene (High Yield)**: How do we make this starting material?\n    *   Direct nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives mainly the para isomer (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) because the bulky -tBu group sterically hinders the ortho positions.\n    *   To achieve high-yield ortho-nitration, a **blocking group strategy** is required.\n    1.  Start with **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  Use sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4) to block the sterically accessible para position with a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H). This forms **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    3.  Now, nitrate the ring (HNO3/H2SO4). Both the -tBu (o,p) and -SO3H (m) groups direct the incoming nitro group to the position ortho to the t-butyl group. This gives **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    4.  Remove the sulfonic acid blocking group by heating with dilute acid (e.g., dilute H2SO4). This process is called desulfonation. This yields **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene** in high yield.\n\n*   **Formation of tert-butylbenzene**: This is made by the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene with tert-butyl chloride and a Lewis acid catalyst like AlCl3.\n\n**4. Assembling the Forward Synthesis and Matching with Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct high-yield sequence is:\n\n1.  **Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3** → tert-butylbenzene\n2.  **tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4** → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (Para-blocking)\n3.  **Intermediate + HNO3/H2SO4** → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid (Ortho-nitration)\n4.  **Intermediate + dilute H2SO4** → 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene (Deblocking)\n5.  **Intermediate + Fe/HCl** → 2-tert-butylaniline (Reduction)\n6.  **Intermediate + HNO3/H2SO4** → 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline (Meta-nitration of anilinium)\n7.  **Intermediate + NaNO2/HCl** → Diazonium salt formation\n8.  **Intermediate + H3O+, H2O/Heat** → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol (Hydrolysis of diazonium salt)\n9.  **Intermediate + NaOH/EtBr** → **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene** (Williamson ether synthesis)\n\nNow let's examine the given options. The options seem to have typos and illogical orderings. We must find the option that contains the complete \"shopping list\" of reagents required for this valid synthesis.\n\n*   **Reagents required**: `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`, `SO3/H2SO4`, `HNO3/H2SO4` (used twice), `dilute H2SO4`, `Fe/HCl`, `NaNO2/HCl`, `H3O+, H2O/Heat`, `NaOH/EtBr`.\n\nLet's check the reagent list of each option:\n*   **A) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4**\n    *   This option contains *all* the necessary reagents. Although the sequence as written is incorrect (e.g., it produces the wrong isomer initially and has sulfonation/desulfonation at the end), it is the only option that provides the complete toolkit for the correct synthesis.\n\n*   **B), C), D)**: These options are missing key reagents and/or have chemically impossible steps in their sequences (e.g., diazotizing a molecule with no amine, Friedel-Crafts on a free aniline, nitrating a diazonium salt).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAssuming the question is flawed in its sequential presentation, Option A is the only one that provides all the necessary reagents to perform the correct, high-yield synthesis. The logical deduction points to this being the intended answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
