    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the effect of the charge inside the cavity:**\n    The positive charge `+q` is placed inside a cavity within a spherical conductor. This charge will polarize the conductor, inducing charges on its surfaces.\n    *   **Inner Surface (Cavity Wall):** According to Gauss's Law, if we consider a Gaussian surface entirely within the conducting material that encloses the cavity, the electric field inside the conductor must be zero. For the net electric flux through this surface to be zero, the total charge enclosed must be zero. Since there is a charge `+q` inside the cavity, a total charge of `-q` must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This induced charge `-q` will distribute itself on the inner surface in such a way that it, together with the original charge `+q`, creates zero electric field everywhere outside the cavity, specifically within the conducting material.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The spherical conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` has been drawn to the inner surface from the conductor's free electrons, a net charge of `+q` must be left behind on the conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality. This excess charge `+q` will reside on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n2.  **Apply the principle of Electrostatic Shielding:**\n    A key property of a closed conductor is that it acts as an electrostatic shield. The charges on the outer surface are shielded from the electric fields of the charges inside the cavity. This means the distribution of the charge `+q` on the outer surface is not affected by the position of the charge `+q` inside the cavity, nor by the position or shape of the cavity itself.\n\n3.  **Determine the charge distribution on the outer surface:**\n    The charge `+q` on the outer surface will distribute itself to be in electrostatic equilibrium. Since the outer surface is a sphere and it is isolated (no other external charges are mentioned), the charge `+q` will spread out uniformly over the entire outer surface.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Electric Field outside the conductor:**\n    The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the vector sum of the fields produced by all charges. However, due to the shielding effect, the net electric field produced by the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface is zero everywhere outside the cavity. Therefore, the electric field at point P is solely due to the uniform distribution of charge `+q` on the outer spherical surface.\n\n5.  **Use the Shell Theorem:**\n    The Shell Theorem (a direct result of Gauss's Law) states that the electric field at a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as that of a point charge with the same total charge located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the outer sphere is the center of the conductor, let's call it O.\n    *   The point P is at a distance `L` from the center O.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Applying the formula for the electric field of a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total Charge}}{\\text{(distance)}^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The information about the cavity's radius `r`, its distance `s` from the center, the distance `l` from the cavity's center to P, and the angle `\\theta` are all distractors. They describe the internal configuration, which does not affect the electric field outside the conductor due to electrostatic shielding. The correct expression for the electric field magnitude at point P depends only on the total charge that appears on the outer surface (`+q`) and the distance from the center of the conductor (`L`).\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe derived expression matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
