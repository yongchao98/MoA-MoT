    "The user wants to identify the set of assumptions that define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. The core idea of this approximation is that a nucleon inside a nucleus behaves like a free, unbound nucleon during a very brief interaction. Let's analyze each assumption:\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"**\n    This is the fundamental tenet of the impulse approximation. The incoming probe (e.g., an electron, neutrino) is assumed to interact with just one nucleon at a time. Interactions with the nucleus as a whole or with multi-nucleon systems (like meson-exchange currents) are neglected. This is a necessary condition for treating the target nucleon as an isolated entity during the event. This assumption is correct.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"**\n    This assumption addresses what happens before and after the primary interaction. It means that the incoming probe and the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the ejected nucleon) do not interact with the other nucleons in the nucleus. These are known as initial-state and final-state interactions (FSI). Neglecting FSI is a key part of simplifying the problem to a single, clean interaction with one nucleon, making the nucleus effectively \"transparent\" to the particles involved, except for the one being struck. This assumption is also correct.\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"**\n    This assumption concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself, describing it in terms of the quark model. The impulse approximation, however, is a statement about the nucleon's behavior *within the nuclear environment*, not about the dynamics of its constituent quarks. The impulse approximation can be applied in both non-relativistic and relativistic frameworks, and it does not inherently depend on a non-relativistic description of quarks. Therefore, this assumption is not a defining feature of the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"**\n    This is the \"impulse\" part of the approximation. The interaction is assumed to happen over an extremely short timescale. During this brief \"impulse,\" the nucleon does not have time to interact with its neighboring nucleons or to feel the effects of the nuclear potential that binds it. It essentially behaves as a free particle with a certain momentum for the duration of the interaction. This assumption is correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe impulse approximation is defined by the combination of three core ideas:\n- The interaction targets a single nucleon (Assumption 1).\n- The rest of the nucleus is ignored before and after the collision (Assumption 2).\n- The nucleon is treated as unbound during the brief collision (Assumption 4).\n\nTherefore, the assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
