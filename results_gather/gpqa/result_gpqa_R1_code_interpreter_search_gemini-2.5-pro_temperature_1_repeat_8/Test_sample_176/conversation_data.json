    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, i.e., $L_1 / L_2$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Principle:** The problem states that the stars radiate as black bodies. The luminosity (L) of a spherical black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L = A \\sigma T^4 = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n3.  **Set up the Luminosity Ratio:** Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4}$\n    The constants $4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ cancel out, leaving:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information:**\n    *   **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So, $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, which means $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$.\n    *   **Peak Wavelength:** The problem states that the wavelength at which the stars appear brightest ($\\lambda_{max}$) is the same for both. This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength.\n    *   **Radial Velocities:** Star_1 has a radial velocity $v_1 = 0$ km/s. Star_2 has a radial velocity $v_2 = 700$ km/s.\n\n5.  **Relate Temperature to Peak Wavelength:** Wien's Displacement Law relates the *emitted* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{em}$) of a black body to its temperature (T):\n    $\\lambda_{em} = \\frac{b}{T}$\n    where b is Wien's displacement constant. This means $T = \\frac{b}{\\lambda_{em}}$.\n\n6.  **Account for the Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) is different from the emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{em}$) if the source is moving relative to the observer. This is the Doppler effect. The formula for the relativistic Doppler effect for light is:\n    $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{em} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}$\n    where v is the radial velocity (positive for recession/redshift, negative for approach/blueshift) and c is the speed of light.\n\n7.  **Connect Observed Wavelengths to Temperatures:**\n    *   For Star_1: $v_1 = 0$, so its observed peak wavelength is the same as its emitted peak wavelength: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{em,1}$.\n    *   For Star_2: $v_2 = 700$ km/s. A positive radial velocity conventionally means the object is moving away from the observer (recession), causing a redshift. So, its observed peak wavelength is:\n        $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{em,2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}$\n    *   We are given that $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$. Therefore:\n        $\\lambda_{em,1} = \\lambda_{em,2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}$\n\n8.  **Find the Temperature Ratio:** Now, substitute Wien's Law ($\\lambda_{em} = b/T$) into the equation from the previous step:\n    $\\frac{b}{T_1} = \\frac{b}{T_2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}$\n    Canceling b and rearranging to find the temperature ratio $\\frac{T_1}{T_2}$:\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}$\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}$\n\n9.  **Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:** Substitute the radius ratio and the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}\\right)^4$\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^2$\n\n10. **Perform the Calculation:** Now, I will use a Python script to compute the final value accurately. The extraneous information about mass is not needed for this calculation based on black body radiation principles.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values\nR_ratio = 1.5\nv2 = 700.0  # km/s\nc = 299792.458  # speed of light in km/s\n\n# The luminosity ratio is L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\n# The temperature ratio is T1/T2 = sqrt((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))\n# So, (T1/T2)^4 = ((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))^2\n\n# Calculate beta (v2/c)\nbeta = v2 / c\n\n# Calculate the luminosity ratio\nL_ratio = (R_ratio**2) * ((1 - beta) / (1 + beta))**2\n\nprint(L_ratio)\n```\n2.2290838183917815\n\n11. **Final Conclusion:** The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) ~2.35\n    B) ~2.32\n    C) ~2.25\n    D) ~2.23\n\nThe calculated value of 2.229 is closest to 2.23.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The reasoning for solving this problem involves combining the Stefan-Boltzmann law for black body radiation with the relativistic Doppler effect.\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it's a spherical black body, is given by the formula:\n    $L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio:** We want to find the ratio of the luminosities of Star\\_1 and Star\\_2, which is:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n\n3.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a star's surface temperature (T) to the *emitted* wavelength at which its radiation is most intense ($\\lambda_{em}$):\n    $\\lambda_{em} = \\frac{b}{T}$ or $T = \\frac{b}{\\lambda_{em}}$\n    where b is Wien's constant. From this, we can write the temperature ratio as:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{em,2}}{\\lambda_{em,1}}$\n\n4.  **Relativistic Doppler Effect:** The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{obs}$) are the same for both stars. However, Star\\_2 is moving away from us at a high velocity, so its light is redshifted. The relationship between the observed and emitted wavelength is given by the relativistic Doppler effect formula:\n    $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{em} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}$\n    where v is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light.\n\n5.  **Connecting the Equations:**\n    *   For Star\\_1, the radial velocity $v_1 = 0$, so its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted wavelength: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{em,1}$.\n    *   For Star\\_2, the radial velocity is $v_2 = 700$ km/s. Its observed wavelength is: $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{em,2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}$.\n    *   We are given that $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$. Therefore:\n        $\\lambda_{em,1} = \\lambda_{em,2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}$\n    *   Now we can find the ratio of emitted wavelengths:\n        $\\frac{\\lambda_{em,2}}{\\lambda_{em,1}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}$\n    *   This ratio is equal to the temperature ratio:\n        $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}$\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** We can now substitute the known values and derived ratios into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    *   Radius ratio: $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$\n    *   Luminosity ratio: $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}\\right)^4$\n    *   This simplifies to:\n        $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^2$\n\nUsing the provided code output, which calculates this exact expression:\nThe calculated value for the luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~2.35\nB) ~2.32\nC) ~2.25\nD) ~2.23\n\nThe calculated value of 2.229 is closest to 2.23. The information about the stars' masses is not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
