    "This problem requires a step-by-step calculation of ion concentrations in a buffer solution.\n\n**1. Understand the System**\nThe solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4·2H2O). In water, these salts dissociate completely:\n*   KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4-\n*   Na2HPO4·2H2O → 2Na+ + HPO4^2- + 2H2O\n\nThis creates a buffer solution composed of the weak acid H2PO4- and its conjugate base HPO4^2-. This buffer system is governed by the second dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid (H3PO4).\n\n**2. Calculate Moles and Concentrations**\nFirst, we calculate the number of moles for each component and then their initial concentrations in the 200.00 cm³ (0.200 L) solution.\n\n*   **Moles of KH2PO4 (which provides H2PO4-):**\n    Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 moles\n*   **Concentration of H2PO4-:**\n    [H2PO4-] = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.03674 M\n\n*   **Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O (which provides HPO4^2-):**\n    Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 moles\n*   **Concentration of HPO4^2-:**\n    [HPO4^2-] = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.02809 M\n\n**3. Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H+]**\nThe pH (and thus [H+]) of the buffer is determined by the equilibrium involving the H2PO4-/HPO4^2- pair, which corresponds to Ka2 for phosphoric acid.\n\n*   Equilibrium: H2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-\n*   Ka2 expression: Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [H+]:\n[H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n[H+] = (6.2 x 10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H+] ≈ 8.11 x 10^-8 M\n\n**4. Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion [PO4^3-] Concentration**\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is produced by the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4^2-), which corresponds to Ka3.\n\n*   Equilibrium: HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-\n*   Ka3 expression: Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe rearrange this expression to solve for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO4^3-]:\n[PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8 x 10^-12) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10^-8 M)\n[PO4^3-] ≈ 6.24 x 10^-7 M\n\nThe calculation can be performed efficiently using a script.\n```python\n# Given values\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000  # L\n\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate initial concentrations of the buffer components\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / volume_L\n\nmoles_HPO4_2minus = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] from the Ka2 equilibrium\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nconc_H_plus = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-] from the Ka3 equilibrium\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\nconc_PO4_3minus = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2minus / conc_H_plus)\n\nprint(f\"{conc_PO4_3minus:.2e}\")\n```\n executing code...\n\n> 6.24e-07\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.24 x 10^-7 M.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This is a multi-step problem involving a buffer solution and multiple acid-dissociation equilibria. Here is the step-by-step reasoning to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4³⁻).\n\n**1. Identify the components and their roles:**\n*   The solution contains KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O.\n*   When dissolved in water, these salts dissociate completely:\n    *   KH₂PO₄ → K⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻\n    *   Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O → 2Na⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ + 2H₂O\n*   This creates a buffer system consisting of the weak acid H₂PO₄⁻ (dihydrogen phosphate) and its conjugate base HPO₄²⁻ (hydrogen phosphate).\n\n**2. Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components:**\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of each substance and then divide by the volume of the solution (200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L).\n\n*   **Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄):**\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol\n*   **Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻:**\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = Moles / Volume\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.03674 M\n\n*   **Moles of HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O):**\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol\n*   **Concentration of HPO₄²⁻:**\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = Moles / Volume\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.02809 M\n\n**3. Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] in the buffer:**\nThe pH of the buffer is governed by the second dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid, which involves the H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ pair.\n*   Equilibrium: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n*   The equilibrium constant expression is: Kₐ₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺]:\n*   [H⁺] = Kₐ₂ × ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n*   [H⁺] = (6.2 × 10⁻⁸) × (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n*   [H⁺] ≈ 8.11 × 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**4. Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO₄³⁻] concentration:**\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻). This is the third dissociation step for phosphoric acid.\n*   Equilibrium: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n*   The equilibrium constant expression is: Kₐ₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\nWe rearrange this expression to solve for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO₄³⁻]:\n*   [PO₄³⁻] = Kₐ₃ × ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n*   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 × 10⁻¹²) × (0.02809 M / 8.11 × 10⁻⁸ M)\n*   [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.24 × 10⁻⁷ M\n\nTo ensure precision, we can perform the calculation using a Python script.\n```python\n# Given values\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000  # L\n\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate initial concentrations of the buffer components\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / volume_L\n\nmoles_HPO4_2minus = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] from the Ka2 equilibrium\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nconc_H_plus = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-] from the Ka3 equilibrium\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\nconc_PO4_3minus = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2minus / conc_H_plus)\n\nprint(f\"{conc_PO4_3minus:.2e}\")\n```\nThe calculation confirms that the concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
