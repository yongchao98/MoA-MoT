    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Parent Compound and Principal Functional Group**\nThe molecule is based on a benzene ring. It contains several functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3).\nAccording to IUPAC rules for nomenclature, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority among these. Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is designated as carbon #1.\n\n**Step 2: Place the Substituents Based on Relative Positions**\nLet's map out the positions of all groups on the benzene ring, starting with C1 for the carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Carboxylic acid:** at C1.\n*   **Methoxy group:** \"para to the carboxylic acid\". Para to C1 is C4. So, the methoxy group is at C4.\n*   **Carbaldehyde and Cyano groups:** \"all meta to one another\" (referring to -COOH, -CHO, and -CN). Meta positions relative to C1 are C3 and C5. Thus, the carbaldehyde and cyano groups are at C3 and C5 (in some order).\n*   **Hydroxyl and Dimethylamino groups:** \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid\". Ortho positions relative to C1 are C2 and C6. Thus, the hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups are at C2 and C6 (in some order).\n\nAt this point, the basic structure is:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2/C6: -OH and -N(CH3)2\n*   C3/C5: -CHO and -CN\n*   C4: -OCH3\n\n**Step 3: Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Structure**\nThe final piece of information is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n*   The methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4.\n*   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) is at C2 or C6.\n*   The nitrile (cyano group, -CN) is at C3 or C5.\n\nLet's test the two possible positions for the nitrile group:\n*   **Case 1: Nitrile (-CN) is at C5.** For the methoxy (at C4) and hydroxyl groups to be ortho to it, they must be at positions C4 and C6. We know methoxy is at C4, which is ortho to C5. This means the hydroxyl group must be at C6. This arrangement is consistent with all the given information.\n*   **Case 2: Nitrile (-CN) is at C3.** For the methoxy (at C4) and hydroxyl groups to be ortho to it, they must be at positions C4 and C2. We know methoxy is at C4, which is ortho to C3. This means the hydroxyl group must be at C2. This arrangement is also consistent with all the given information.\n\nIt seems there are two possible structures. However, these two structures are actually the same molecule, just viewed from different perspectives (they are mirror images that can be renumbered to be identical). The IUPAC naming rules will resolve this and lead to a single correct name.\n\nLet's analyze the structure derived from Case 2 (it doesn't matter which case we pick, as they represent the same molecule).\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2: -OH (ortho to -CN at C3)\n*   C3: -CN\n*   C4: -OCH3\n*   C5: -CHO (the other meta group)\n*   C6: -N(CH3)2 (the other ortho group)\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Correct IUPAC Numbering**\nIUPAC rules state that after assigning C1 to the principal functional group, we number the ring to give the lowest possible locants (numbers) to the substituents. In this case, the substituents are at 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, so this rule doesn't help decide the direction of numbering (clockwise vs. counter-clockwise).\n\nThe next rule is to assign the lowest numbers based on the alphabetical order of the substituents.\nLet's list the substituents alphabetically:\n1.  **c**yano (-CN)\n2.  **d**imethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n3.  **f**ormyl (-CHO)\n4.  **h**ydroxy (-OH)\n5.  **m**ethoxy (-OCH3)\n\nWe have two possible numbering schemes for our molecule:\n*   **Numbering A (clockwise):** 2-hydroxy, 3-cyano, 4-methoxy, 5-formyl, 6-dimethylamino.\n*   **Numbering B (counter-clockwise):** 2-dimethylamino, 3-formyl, 4-methoxy, 5-cyano, 6-hydroxy.\n\nWe compare these schemes based on the alphabetical list. The first substituent is \"cyano\".\n*   In Numbering A, \"cyano\" gets the locant **3**.\n*   In Numbering B, \"cyano\" gets the locant **5**.\nSince 3 is lower than 5, we **must** use Numbering A.\n\nSo, the correct locants for the substituents are:\n*   Cyano: 3\n*   Dimethylamino: 6\n*   Formyl: 5\n*   Hydroxy: 2\n*   Methoxy: 4\n\n**Step 5: Assemble the Final IUPAC Name**\nNow, we write the full name by listing the substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by its locant number, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n*   **3-cyano-**\n*   **6-(dimethylamino)-**\n*   **5-formyl-**\n*   **2-hydroxy-**\n*   **4-methoxy**\n*   **benzoic acid**\n\nCombining these gives the final name:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n**Step 6: Compare with the Given Options**\n*   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - Incorrect numbering.\n*   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - Incorrect alphabetical order.\n*   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - **Correct.**\n*   D) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - Incorrect alphabetical order.\n\n<<<C>>>"
