    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Spectral Data**\n\nThe problem provides the following information about the 1H NMR spectrum of a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 isomers:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integral ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integral ratio of 2:1:1.\n\nSince the mixture is 1:1, each compound contributes equally to the total number of protons observed.\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nLet's analyze the structure and symmetry of each of the four possible compounds to predict their individual 1H NMR spectra. All have the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal. Since there are no adjacent protons, this signal will be a **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C4, C5) are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single signal, which will be a **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary for Durene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are not equivalent. H4 is between two methyl groups, while H6 is between a methyl group and another hydrogen's previous position (C6 is between C1-Me and C5-Me). They are meta to each other, so coupling is negligible. They will produce **two separate singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three sets of chemically different methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        3.  The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This results in **three singlets** with an integral ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary for Isodurene:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 alkyl singlets (ratio 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Because of the symmetry (they are magnetically equivalent), they do not split each other. They will produce a **single singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of chemically equivalent methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        This results in **two singlets** with an integral ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary for Prehnitene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (ratio 1:1).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent, producing a **single singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. They will produce a **quartet** (from the 2x -CH2- groups, 4H total) and a **triplet** (from the 2x -CH3 groups, 6H total).\n    *   **Summary for 1,4-diethylbenzene:** 1 aromatic singlet (4H), 1 alkyl quartet (4H), 1 alkyl triplet (6H).\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Options based on the Mixture Spectrum**\n\nNow, let's see which 1:1 mixture of the compounds matches the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** This mixture would have signals that are not all singlets (a quartet and a triplet from 1,4-diethylbenzene). This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene (1 singlet, 2H) + Isodurene (2 singlets, 1H each). This would result in three aromatic signals with a 2:1:1 ratio (unless there's accidental overlap, which is a less likely scenario to assume). This contradicts the \"two signals, 1:1 ratio\" data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Prehnitene (1 singlet, 2H) + Isodurene (2 singlets, 1H each). This would also result in three aromatic signals with a 2:1:1 ratio. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:**\n        *   Durene contributes one 2H singlet.\n        *   Prehnitene contributes one 2H singlet.\n        *   Assuming they have different chemical shifts, this gives **two singlets**. Since the mixture is 1:1, their integrals will be equal (2H from Durene vs. 2H from Prehnitene). This gives a **1:1 ratio**. This **matches** the experimental data.\n    *   **Alkyl Region:**\n        *   Durene contributes one 12H singlet.\n        *   Prehnitene contributes two 6H singlets.\n        *   This gives a total of **three singlets**. The integral ratio is 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also **matches** the experimental data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds whose 1:1 mixture spectrum is consistent with all the provided data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>"
