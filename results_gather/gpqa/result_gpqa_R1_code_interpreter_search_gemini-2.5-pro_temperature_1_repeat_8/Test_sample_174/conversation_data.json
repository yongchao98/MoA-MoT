    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the physical system:** The problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution\" in the shape of a spheroid with its symmetry axis along the z-axis. This system will radiate electromagnetic waves. The question asks for the angular distribution and wavelength dependence of the radiated power in the far-field (radiation zone).\n\n2.  **Identify the radiation mechanism:** An oscillating charge distribution can be analyzed using a multipole expansion of the radiation field. The dominant term in this expansion is typically the lowest-order non-zero multipole moment. The possible multipoles are electric dipole (E1), magnetic dipole (M1), electric quadrupole (E2), and so on.\n\n    *   An **electric dipole** moment `p` arises from a separation of positive and negative charges. If the spheroid oscillates as a whole along the z-axis, or if charges oscillate up and down along the z-axis, it will have a time-varying electric dipole moment `p(t)` along the z-axis. This is the simplest and most common type of oscillation.\n    *   An **electric quadrupole** moment `Q` describes a more complex charge distribution that is not spherically symmetric. A spheroid inherently has a static quadrupole moment. If the spheroid pulsates or deforms symmetrically about its center, its dipole moment would be zero, but its quadrupole moment would oscillate, leading to electric quadrupole radiation.\n\n3.  **Determine the dominant radiation type:** The power radiated by these multipoles depends on the frequency `ω` and the size of the source `d` relative to the wavelength `λ`.\n    *   Electric Dipole Power: `P_E1 ∝ ω⁴ |p|²`\n    *   Electric Quadrupole Power: `P_E2 ∝ ω⁶ |Q|²`\n    The ratio of these powers is approximately `P_E2 / P_E1 ∝ (ωd/c)² = (2πd/λ)²`.\n    In the typical regime where the size of the source is much smaller than the radiated wavelength (`d << λ`), the term `(d/λ)²` is very small. Therefore, electric dipole radiation will be much stronger and will dominate over quadrupole radiation, unless the electric dipole radiation is forbidden by some symmetry.\n\n    Given the general description \"oscillating charge distribution,\" the most natural and dominant mechanism to assume is electric dipole radiation.\n\n4.  **Analyze Electric Dipole Radiation:**\n    *   **Angular Dependence:** For an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) is given by:\n        `dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n        where `θ` is the angle with the z-axis and `C` is a constant that depends on the dipole moment amplitude and frequency.\n\n    *   **Wavelength Dependence:** The constant `C` is proportional to `ω⁴`, where `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation. The relationship between `ω` and wavelength `λ` is `ω = 2πν = 2πc/λ`. Therefore, the power is proportional to `ω⁴`, which means it is proportional to `(1/λ)⁴` or `λ⁻⁴`.\n        So, the functional form `f` has a `λ⁻⁴` dependence.\n\n5.  **Calculate the fraction of maximum power:**\n    *   The radiated power `dP/dΩ` is proportional to `sin²(θ)`.\n    *   The maximum power, `A`, occurs when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (in the equatorial plane). So, `A ∝ 1`.\n    *   We need to find the power radiated at `θ = 30°`. At this angle, the power is proportional to `sin²(30°)`.\n    *   We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    *   Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at `θ = 30°` is:\n        Fraction = `(Power at 30°) / (Maximum Power) = sin²(30°) / sin²(90°) = (1/4) / 1 = 1/4`.\n\n6.  **Combine the results and choose the correct option:**\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is `1/4`.\n    *   A possible form for the wavelength dependence of the function `f` is `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n    Matching these two results with the given options:\n    A) 1/2, λ⁻⁴\n    B) 1/4, λ⁻⁴\n    C) 1/4, λ⁻³\n    D) 3/4, λ⁻⁶\n\n    Option B correctly identifies both the fraction (1/4) and the wavelength dependence (λ⁻⁴).\n\n    *(Self-check: Option D corresponds to electric quadrupole radiation, where `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)cos²(θ)` and `P ∝ ω⁶ ∝ λ⁻⁶`. This would yield a fraction of `sin²(30)cos²(30) / sin²(45)cos²(45) = [(1/4)(3/4)] / [(1/2)(1/2)] = (3/16)/(1/4) = 3/4`. While mathematically consistent for a quadrupole source, the dipole source is the physically dominant and most natural interpretation of the problem statement.)*\n\nFinal Answer is based on the standard model of electric dipole radiation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
