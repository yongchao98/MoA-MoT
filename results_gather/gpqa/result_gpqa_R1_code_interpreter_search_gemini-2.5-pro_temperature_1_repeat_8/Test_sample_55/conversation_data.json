    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Process and Selection Rules**\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay happens via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies there must be an intermediate state.\n\nThe selection rules for an E1 transition are:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer, but for decay (spontaneous emission), $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n**2. Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nLet the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First transition:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$\n    *   Initial state has $l=0$. According to the $\\Delta l=\\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   Initial state has $m=0$. According to the $\\Delta m=0, \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   For a decay, we need $n' < 3$. So, $n'$ can be 1 or 2. However, for $n=1$, only $l=0$ is possible ($|1,1,m'\\rangle$ does not exist). Therefore, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\n    *   So, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n*   **Second transition:** $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Intermediate state has $l'=1$. Final state has $l_f=0$. So $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   Intermediate state has $m'$. Final state has $m_f=0$. So $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. This is allowed if $-m'$ is $0$ or $\\pm 1$, which is true for $m' \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$.\n    *   $n'=2 \\to n_f=1$ is an allowed decay.\n\nSo, the decay must proceed through one of the three states in the $n=2, l=1$ (or 2p) manifold. The three possible routes are:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nAll routes listed in the options are physically possible. We need to determine the probability of the specific route mentioned.\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThe \"probability\" of a specific decay route in a cascade is the product of the branching ratios at each step.\n\n*   **Step 1: Branching Ratio for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$**\n\nThe branching ratio for a transition to a specific final state is the rate of that transition divided by the total decay rate of the initial state. The transition rate is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle final | e\\mathbf{r} | initial \\rangle|^2$.\n\nWe need to compare the transition rates from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\nA key physical principle simplifies this calculation: The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (a 3s state) is spherically symmetric. It has no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the decay process, which is governed by the fundamental laws of electromagnetism, cannot have a preferred outcome regarding the orientation of the final state. This means that the three final states $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle$, which are distinguished only by their magnetic quantum number $m'$ (i.e., their orientation in space), must be populated with equal probability.\n\nSince there are three possible, equiprobable outcomes for the first decay step, the probability (branching ratio) for the atom to decay into any single one of them is $1/3$.\n\nSo,\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n\n*(This can be confirmed with a detailed calculation using the Wigner-Eckart theorem or by explicitly computing the matrix elements, which shows that $|\\langle 2,1,m' | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$ is independent of $m'$.)*\n\n*   **Step 2: Branching Ratio for $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\nOnce the atom is in an intermediate state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$, we need to find its decay channels.\nFrom $|2,1,0\\rangle$, a dipole transition requires $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   If $\\Delta l = -1$, the final state has $l_f=0$. The only possible state with $n_f < 2$ is $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This transition is allowed.\n*   If $\\Delta l = +1$, the final state would have $l_f=2$. This requires $n_f \\ge 3$. Since this is a decay ($n_f < n'$), this channel is not possible.\n\nThus, any state in the 2p manifold ($|2,1,m'\\rangle$) can only decay to the 1s state ($|1,0,0\\rangle$) via an E1 transition. There are no other allowed E1 decay channels. Therefore, the branching ratio for this second step is 1.\n\n*   **Total Probability for the Cascade**\n\nThe total probability for a specific route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\nLet's consider the route in option C: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\nProbability = $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\nProbability = $(1/3) \\times 1 = 1/3$.\n\nThis same probability of $1/3$ applies to the other two possible routes as well.\n\n**4. Compare with Options**\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. (Incorrect probability)\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. (Incorrect probability)\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. (Correct route and probability)\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
