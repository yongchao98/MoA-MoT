    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Potential:**\n    The potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ):\n    V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr^2 + (3/2)kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n\n2.  **Convert to Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    To simplify the problem, we convert the potential into Cartesian coordinates (x, y). The relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\n    *   x = r cos(θ)\n    *   y = r sin(θ)\n    *   r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\n    From these, we can see that the term `r cos(θ)` is simply `x`. Therefore, `r^2 cos^2(θ) = x^2`.\n\n    Now, substitute these into the potential expression:\n    V(x, y) = (1/2)k(x^2 + y^2) + (3/2)k(x^2)\n\n3.  **Simplify the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    Combine the terms with x^2 and y^2:\n    V(x, y) = (1/2)kx^2 + (1/2)ky^2 + (3/2)kx^2\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2)kx^2 + (1/2)ky^2\n    V(x, y) = (4/2)kx^2 + (1/2)ky^2\n    V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + (1/2)ky^2\n\n4.  **Identify the System:**\n    The potential is now in the form V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y), where:\n    *   V_x(x) = 2kx^2\n    *   V_y(y) = (1/2)ky^2\n\n    This shows that the potential is separable in the x and y coordinates. The system is equivalent to two independent one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillators (QHO), one oscillating in the x-direction and the other in the y-direction.\n\n5.  **Determine the Frequencies of the Oscillators:**\n    The potential for a standard 1D QHO is given by V(q) = (1/2)mω^2q^2, where ω is the angular frequency. We can find the frequencies ω_x and ω_y by comparing our potential terms with this standard form.\n\n    *   **For the x-oscillator:**\n        V_x(x) = 2kx^2 = (1/2)mω_x^2x^2\n        This implies: (1/2)mω_x^2 = 2k\n        mω_x^2 = 4k\n        ω_x^2 = 4k/m\n        ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\n    *   **For the y-oscillator:**\n        V_y(y) = (1/2)ky^2 = (1/2)mω_y^2y^2\n        This implies: (1/2)mω_y^2 = (1/2)k\n        mω_y^2 = k\n        ω_y^2 = k/m\n        ω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\n6.  **Find the Energy Spectrum:**\n    The energy eigenvalue for a 1D QHO with quantum number n is E_n = (n + 1/2)ℏω.\n    Since the two oscillators are independent, the total energy E of the 2D system is the sum of the energies of the individual oscillators:\n    E = E_x + E_y\n    E = (n_x + 1/2)ℏω_x + (n_y + 1/2)ℏω_y\n\n    Here, n_x and n_y are the quantum numbers for the x and y oscillators, respectively (n_x, n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n\n    Now, substitute the expressions for ω_x and ω_y we found:\n    E = (n_x + 1/2)ℏ * (2 * sqrt(k/m)) + (n_y + 1/2)ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n7.  **Simplify the Energy Expression:**\n    Factor out the common term ℏ*sqrt(k/m):\n    E = [ (n_x + 1/2) * 2 + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = ( 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ) * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n8.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m).\n    Let's compare this with the given choices:\n    A) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    B) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    C) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    D) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n\n    Our result matches option D perfectly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
