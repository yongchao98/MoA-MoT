    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n1.  **Understanding Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n    The mean free path (λ) represents the average distance a particle travels before it collides with another particle. The general formula for the mean free path is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    Where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"target area\" that a particle presents for a collision. A larger cross-section means a collision is more likely.\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Two Scenarios**\n    In this problem, the environment (pressure, temperature, volume, and thus the number density `n` of gas molecules) is the same for both λ1 and λ2. The only difference is the nature of the colliding particles, which directly affects the collision cross-section (σ).\n\n    *   **Scenario 1: Gas-Gas Collisions (λ1)**\n        *   This describes a gas molecule colliding with another gas molecule.\n        *   The collision is governed by short-range intermolecular forces (like van der Waals forces) and is often modeled as a \"hard-sphere\" collision.\n        *   The collision cross-section, let's call it **σ1**, is related to the physical size (the kinetic diameter) of the gas molecules.\n\n    *   **Scenario 2: Electron-Gas Collisions (λ2)**\n        *   This describes a high-energy electron from the beam colliding with a gas molecule.\n        *   This collision is fundamentally different. The electron is a charged particle, and it interacts with the gas molecule (which consists of a positive nucleus and a cloud of negative electrons) via the long-range electrostatic (Coulomb) force.\n        *   An electron does not need to physically \"hit\" the molecule to be scattered or deflected. It can be influenced by the molecule's electric field from a significant distance.\n        *   This long-range interaction means the effective target area the gas molecule presents to the electron is much larger than its physical size.\n        *   Therefore, the collision cross-section for an electron-gas interaction, let's call it **σ2**, is significantly larger than the kinetic cross-section for a gas-gas interaction (σ1).\n\n3.  **Comparing the Mean Free Paths**\n    *   We have established that the collision cross-section for electron-gas scattering is larger than for gas-gas scattering: **σ2 > σ1**.\n    *   The formula for mean free path is λ = 1 / (n * σ). This shows an inverse relationship between λ and σ.\n    *   Since `n` is constant and σ2 > σ1, it must be true that the corresponding mean free path for the electron (λ2) is smaller than the mean free path for the gas molecule (λ1).\n    *   **λ2 < λ1**\n\n4.  **Conclusion**\n    An electron traveling through the residual gas is far more likely to be scattered by a gas molecule than a gas molecule is to be scattered by another gas molecule. This means the average distance an electron travels between collisions (λ2) will be shorter than the average distance a gas molecule travels between collisions (λ1).\n\n<<<C>>>"
