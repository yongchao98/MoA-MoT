    "This question requires an understanding of the relationship between a planet's mass, composition, and density.\n\n1.  **Analyze the baseline (Option a):**\n    *   An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet is, by definition, a planet with the same density as Earth.\n    *   Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. We'll use this as our reference value.\n    *   Density (a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n2.  **Analyze Option b:**\n    *   This planet has 2 Earth masses, but its density is given as ~5.5 g/cm³, which is essentially the same as Earth's.\n    *   Density (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n3.  **Analyze Option c:**\n    *   This planet has the same composition as Earth (e.g., a mix of rock and iron) but is 5 times more massive.\n    *   For planets with the same composition, a more massive planet experiences stronger self-gravity.\n    *   This stronger gravity compresses the planet's material more tightly, leading to a higher overall density. This phenomenon is known as gravitational compression.\n    *   Therefore, a 5-Earth-mass planet with Earth-like composition will be significantly denser than Earth.\n    *   Density (c) > 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n4.  **Analyze Option d:**\n    *   This planet also has the same composition as Earth but is only half as massive.\n    *   Following the same logic as above, with less mass, there is weaker self-gravity.\n    *   The material will be less compressed compared to Earth.\n    *   Therefore, its density will be lower than Earth's.\n    *   Density (d) < 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n**Comparison:**\n\n*   Density (a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n*   Density (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n*   Density (c) > 5.51 g/cm³\n*   Density (d) < 5.51 g/cm³\n\nComparing these values, the planet in option (c) is the only one with a density clearly greater than Earth's and is therefore the densest among the choices.\n\n<<<A>>>"
