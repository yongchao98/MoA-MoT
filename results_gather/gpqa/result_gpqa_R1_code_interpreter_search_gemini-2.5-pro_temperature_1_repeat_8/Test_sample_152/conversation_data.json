These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the β position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nA) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\nB) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione\nC) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\nD) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each reaction to determine the reactants and products.\n\n### Reaction A:\n**Reactants:** dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate\n**Reagents:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH)\n**Reaction Type:** Michael Addition\n\n1.  **Identify the Nucleophile (Michael Donor):** Sodium ethoxide is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate. The α-hydrogens are acidic because the resulting carbanion (enolate) is stabilized by resonance with both adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   Dimethyl malonate: CH₂(COOCH₃)₂\n    *   Formation of the nucleophile: CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ + NaOEt → Na⁺[⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂] + EtOH\n    *   The nucleophile is the malonate enolate: [CH(COOCH₃)₂]⁻\n\n2.  **Identify the Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon is electrophilic due to conjugation with the carbonyl group.\n    *   Structure: p-Tolyl-CᵝH=CᵃH-COOCH₃\n    *   The β-carbon is the carbon atom bonded to the p-tolyl group.\n\n3.  **The Reaction:** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. This is a conjugate addition (1,4-addition). The double bond shifts, and an enolate intermediate is formed.\n    *   Attack: [⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂] + p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃ → p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - [⁻CH-COOCH₃]\n\n4.  **Workup:** The enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (ethanol) to yield the final neutral product (A).\n    *   Protonation: p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - [⁻CH-COOCH₃] + EtOH → p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃ + EtO⁻\n    *   **Product (A) Structure:** (CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃\n\n5.  **Naming Product (A):** To name this molecule according to IUPAC rules, we identify the longest carbon chain that contains the principal functional groups. The main chain is the three-carbon backbone connecting the ester groups.\n    *   Chain: C(from malonate) - C(β from acrylate) - C(α from acrylate).\n    *   Let's number the chain to give the lowest possible locants for the functional groups. Numbering from the malonate carbon gives the locant set {1,1,3} for the carboxylate groups. Numbering from the other end gives {1,3,3}. The set {1,1,3} is lower.\n    *   Parent name: propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n    *   The p-tolyl group is on carbon 2.\n    *   The esters are all methyl esters.\n    *   **Final Name for A:** trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n\n### Reaction B:\n**Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile\n**Reagents:** Methanol (MeOH), then aqueous acid (H₃O⁺)\n**Reaction Type:** Stork Enamine Synthesis (involving Michael Addition)\n\n1.  **Identify the Nucleophile (Michael Donor):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine of cyclohexanone. Enamines are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (the C2 of the cyclohexene ring), which was the α-carbon of the original ketone.\n    *   The resonance structure shows a negative charge on this carbon: R₂N-C¹=C² ↔ R₂N⁺=C¹-C²⁻.\n\n2.  **Identify the Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CᵝH=CᵃH-CN. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n\n3.  **The Reaction (Michael Addition):** The nucleophilic enamine attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and an iminium ion intermediate.\n    *   The intermediate after addition and protonation of the nitrile-stabilized anion is a substituted iminium salt.\n\n4.  **Workup (Hydrolysis):** The addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group. This regenerates the ketone (cyclohexanone) and protonated piperidine.\n    *   The overall result is the alkylation of cyclohexanone at its α-position.\n    *   The group added is derived from but-2-enenitrile: -CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n    *   **Product (B) Structure:** A cyclohexanone ring with a -CH(CH₃)CH₂CN group at the C2 position.\n\n5.  **Naming Product (B):** The product can be named as a substituted butanenitrile.\n    *   Parent chain: butanenitrile (NC-C1-C2-C3-C4).\n    *   The structure is NC-CH₂-CH(substituent)-CH₃. This is a 3-substituted butanenitrile.\n    *   The substituent on C3 is the 2-oxocyclohexyl group.\n    *   **Final Name for B:** 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n\n### Reaction C:\n**Reactants:** C + but-3-en-2-one\n**Reagents:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) in water (H₂O)\n**Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n**Reaction Type:** Michael Addition (Retrosynthesis)\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Known Reactant:** We are given the product and one reactant (the Michael acceptor) and need to find the other reactant (the Michael donor, C).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. This means a cyclohexane-1,3-dione core is substituted at C2.\n    *   **Substituent:** The \"3-oxobutyl\" group is -CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK). Structure: CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃.\n\n2.  **Retrosynthesis:** A Michael addition forms a bond between the α-carbon of a donor and the β-carbon of an acceptor.\n    *   The 3-oxobutyl group in the product came from MVK. The addition of a nucleophile to the β-carbon (CH₂) of MVK, followed by protonation, gives Nu-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃.\n    *   Comparing this to the product structure, the nucleophile (Nu⁻) must be the enolate of cyclohexane-1,3-dione, formed by deprotonation at C2.\n    *   The base KOH deprotonates the highly acidic C2 position of the dione.\n    *   Therefore, the starting material C must be the molecule that forms this enolate.\n    *   **Reactant C:** cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
