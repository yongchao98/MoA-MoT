    "This problem involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction proceeding through a benzyne intermediate. Let's break down the reaction step-by-step.\n\n**1. Reactants and Conditions:**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, D) at position C2. The other ortho position to the bromine, C6, has a regular hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base (the active species is the amide anion, :NH2-), and liquid ammonia serves as the solvent.\n\n**2. Mechanism: Elimination-Addition**\n\nThe reaction proceeds in two main stages:\n*   **Stage 1: Elimination to form benzyne intermediates.**\n    *   The strong base, :NH2-, abstracts an acidic proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (the bromine atom).\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions: C2 (with a deuterium, D) and C6 (with a hydrogen, H).\n    *   This leads to two competing elimination pathways:\n\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1 to form a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n        *   Due to the **kinetic isotope effect**, breaking a C-H bond is significantly faster than breaking an equivalent C-D bond. Therefore, this is the **major** pathway.\n\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1 to form a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n        *   This is the **minor** pathway due to the slower rate of C-D bond cleavage.\n\n*   **Stage 2: Addition of the nucleophile to the benzyne intermediates.**\n    *   The nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (:NH2-), attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3).\n\n    *   **Addition to Intermediate from Pathway A (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n        *   The intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium at C2.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group adds to C1. A negative charge develops on C6, which is then protonated by NH3. The final product has the -NH2 group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH2 group adds to C6. A negative charge develops on C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH2 group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   So, the major pathway produces two different deuterated anilines.\n\n    *   **Addition to Intermediate from Pathway B (Benzyne):**\n        *   The intermediate is standard benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C2 and no deuterium.\n        *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The -NH2 group adds to either C1 or C2. The adjacent carbon becomes negatively charged and is protonated by NH3. In both cases, the final product is **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n        *   So, the minor pathway produces one non-deuterated product.\n\n**3. Summary of Possible Products:**\nCombining the outcomes from both possible pathways, we get three distinct organic products:\n1.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nSince the question asks for the total number of *possible* organic products, we must consider the products from both the major and minor pathways. Therefore, there are 3 possible products.\n\n<<<B>>>"
