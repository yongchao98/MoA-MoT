    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning and calculations to solve the problem.\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Dilution of Acetic Acid:**\n    *   First, we need to calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it's been diluted with water.\n    *   Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH):\n        *   Volume = 20.00 cm³ = 0.0200 L\n        *   Concentration = 0.05 M\n        *   Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.0200 L = 0.001 mol.\n    *   The total volume after adding 20.00 cm³ of water is:\n        *   Total Volume = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L.\n    *   The new concentration of the diluted acetic acid is:\n        *   New Concentration = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M.\n\n2.  **Titration Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between acetic acid (a weak acid) and sodium hydroxide (a strong base) is:\n        *   CH₃COOH (aq) + NaOH (aq) → CH₃COONa (aq) + H₂O (l)\n\n3.  **pH at 25% Titration:**\n    *   \"25% titration\" means that 25% of the initial acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH.\n    *   This point is in the buffer region of the titration curve, where the solution contains both the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻).\n    *   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH:\n        *   pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n        *   Where [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) and [HA] is the concentration of the acid (acetic acid).\n    *   First, calculate the pKa:\n        *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n        *   pKa = -log₁₀(Ka) = -log₁₀(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the acid is converted to its conjugate base, and 75% remains as the acid.\n    *   The ratio [A⁻]/[HA] is therefore 25/75 or 1/3.\n    *   Now, plug the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n        *   pH = pKa + log(1/3)\n        *   pH = 4.73 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.255\n\n4.  **pH at the Equivalence Point:**\n    *   At the equivalence point, all the initial acetic acid (0.001 mol) has been completely neutralized by the NaOH to form its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa).\n    *   The solution now contains 0.001 mol of CH₃COO⁻.\n    *   We need to find the total volume of the solution at this point. First, let's find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH required to reach the equivalence point (V_eq):\n        *   Moles of Acid = Moles of Base\n        *   0.001 mol = (0.1 mol/L) × V_eq\n        *   V_eq = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    *   Total volume at equivalence point = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH added\n        *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n    *   Now, calculate the concentration of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) at the equivalence point:\n        *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M.\n    *   The acetate ion is a weak base and will hydrolyze water, producing OH⁻ ions:\n        *   CH₃COO⁻ (aq) + H₂O (l) ⇌ CH₃COOH (aq) + OH⁻ (aq)\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate. We can find it using the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C) and the Ka of acetic acid:\n        *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   Now, we set up an ICE table to find the [OH⁻] at equilibrium:\n|             | CH₃COO⁻ | CH₃COOH | OH⁻   |\n|-------------|---------|----------|-------|\n| Initial (I) | 0.02 M  | 0        | 0     |\n| Change (C)  | -x      | +x       | +x    |\n| Equil. (E)  | 0.02-x  | x        | x     |\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x).\n    *   Since Kb is very small, we can assume x is negligible compared to 0.02, so (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    *   Kb ≈ x² / 0.02\n    *   x² = Kb × 0.02 = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n    *   Calculate pOH:\n        *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48.\n    *   Finally, calculate pH:\n        *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52.\n\nTo confirm the calculations with precision, we can use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\ninitial_moles_acid = 0.001\nconcentration_acetate_at_eq = 0.02 # Calculated as 0.001 moles / 0.050 L\n\n# --- Part 1: pH at 25% titration ---\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n# At 25% titration, the ratio of [A-]/[HA] is 0.25 / (1 - 0.25) = 1/3\npH_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- Part 2: pH at equivalence point ---\n# Calculate Kb for the conjugate base (acetate)\nKb = Kw / Ka\n# Calculate the hydroxide ion concentration [OH-] from the hydrolysis of acetate\n# Kb = [OH-]^2 / [Acetate]  =>  [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [Acetate])\nOH_concentration = math.sqrt(Kb * concentration_acetate_at_eq)\n# Calculate pOH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(OH_concentration)\n# Calculate pH from pOH\npH_eq = 14.00 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\n>pH at 25% titration: 4.26\n>pH at equivalence point: 8.52\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n*   The pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The initial reasoning and the executed Python code both lead to the same result.\n\n1.  **pH at 25% Titration:**\n    *   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used: `pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])`.\n    *   pKa = -log(1.85x10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73.\n    *   At 25% titration, the ratio of conjugate base [A⁻] to acid [HA] is 25/75, or 1/3.\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.26.\n    *   The code output confirms: `pH at 25% titration: 4.26`.\n\n2.  **pH at the Equivalence Point:**\n    *   At this point, all the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M in a total volume of 50.00 cm³.\n    *   The acetate hydrolyzes water, producing OH⁻. We need to calculate the pOH first using the Kb of acetate.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = 1.0x10⁻¹⁴ / 1.85x10⁻⁵ ≈ 5.41x10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   [OH⁻] = sqrt(Kb * [CH₃COO⁻]) = sqrt(5.41x10⁻¹⁰ * 0.02) ≈ 3.29x10⁻⁶ M.\n    *   pOH = -log(3.29x10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.\n    *   The code output confirms: `pH at equivalence point: 8.52`.\n\nThe calculated values are pH = 4.26 at 25% titration and pH = 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
