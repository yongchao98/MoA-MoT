    "This is a problem of special relativity, specifically concerning time dilation.\n\nHere is the reasoning process:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference:**\n    *   The \"Galaxy frame\" (let's call it S) is one inertial frame of reference.\n    *   The \"ejecta frame\" (let's call it S') is another inertial frame of reference, moving relative to S.\n\n2.  **Identify the given quantities:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time interval measured in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame S') is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is the **proper time**, as it is measured by a clock at rest in its own reference frame.\n    *   The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n\n4.  **Formulate the plan:**\n    *   The distance `d` traveled in the Galaxy frame is given by the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the time `Δt` measured in the stationary frame (S) is different from the proper time `Δt₀` measured in the moving frame (S'). The relationship is given by the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`.\n    *   The term `γ` is the Lorentz factor, calculated as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   Therefore, the full formula for the distance is `d = v * γ * Δt₀ = v * Δt₀ / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n5.  **Execute the calculation:**\n    *   First, calculate the ratio `β = v/c`:\n        `β = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Next, calculate `β²`:\n        `β² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n    *   Now, calculate the term inside the square root:\n        `1 - β² = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96`\n    *   Calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n    *   Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame, `Δt`:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n    *   Finally, calculate the distance `d` in the Galaxy frame:\n        `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n        `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\nTo get the final numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # km/s\ndt0 = 50  # s\nc = 300000  # km/s\n\n# Calculate beta (v/c)\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame (dt)\ndt = gamma * dt0\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy frame\ndistance = v * dt\n\nprint(f\"{distance=:.0f} km\")\n```\n>>>\ndistance=3061862 km\n>>>\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:** We have two inertial frames of reference:\n    *   **S (Galaxy Frame):** This is considered the stationary frame.\n    *   **S' (Ejecta Frame):** This is the moving frame, traveling at a high velocity relative to S.\n\n2.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time interval measured in the moving frame (S'), `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is the **proper time** because it's measured by a clock at rest within its own reference frame (the ejecta).\n    *   The speed of light, `c`, is approximately `300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the stationary Galaxy frame (S).\n\n4.  **Apply the Principles of Special Relativity:**\n    *   The distance `d` in the Galaxy frame is calculated as `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy frame.\n    *   Due to **time dilation**, an observer in the stationary frame (S) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) for events occurring in the moving frame (S') than the observer in S' measures (`Δt₀`).\n    *   The relationship is given by the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n        where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor is defined as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n    *   First, calculate the ratio `β = v/c`:\n        `β = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Next, calculate `β²`:\n        `β² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n    *   Now, substitute this into the Lorentz factor formula:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Dilated Time (Δt):**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Distance (d) in the Galaxy Frame:**\n    *   Substitute the expression for `Δt` into the distance formula:\n        `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n    *   Combine the terms:\n        `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    *   Now, we calculate the numerical value:\n        `sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`\n        `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n8.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.\n    *   Looking at the options:\n        A) 2,940,000 km\n        B) 3,000,000 km (This would be the answer if relativistic effects were ignored)\n        C) 2,880,000 km\n        D) 3,060,000 km\n    *   The calculated value is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
