    "To determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to identify which ones are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This is typically due to the presence of one or more chiral centers and the absence of any internal planes of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is CH₃CH₂C(CH₃)=CHCl.\n    *   This is an alkene. The atoms involved in the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. The entire molecule is planar.\n    *   Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself).\n    *   Therefore, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name itself provides the absolute configuration of two stereocenters, (3aR, 7aS), and the geometry of a double bond, (E).\n    *   The designation of specific R/S configurations indicates that this is a single, specific stereoisomer.\n    *   Complex bridged molecules like this are generally chiral unless they possess a high degree of symmetry.\n    *   Since a single enantiomer (or diastereomer) is specified by the name, it must be a chiral compound. Chiral compounds are **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   The molecule is symmetrical, as the two ends (COOH) and the substituents on the chiral carbons (H, CH₃) are the same.\n    *   When a molecule has two chiral centers and symmetrical ends, the (R,S) configuration results in a meso compound.\n    *   A meso compound has a plane of symmetry (when viewed in an eclipsed conformation like a Fischer projection) or a center of inversion (in a staggered conformation). Due to this internal symmetry, it is achiral despite having chiral centers.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the previous compound.\n    *   The configuration is (2R, 3R). Its mirror image would be (2S, 3S).\n    *   This molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is not superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   Therefore, it is a chiral molecule and is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond (between C3 and C4) and a hydroxyl group at C1.\n    *   Carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) -CH=CH-CH₂- (path C2-C3-C4), and 4) -CH₂-CH₂-CH= (path C6-C5-C4). The two pathways around the ring from C1 are different. Thus, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The name specifies the (R) enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This represents the isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis).\n    *   Let's consider the chair conformation. All three -OH groups can be axial, or they can all be equatorial. In either case, the molecule has a C₃ axis of rotation (a 120° rotation around an axis through the center of the ring restores the molecule).\n    *   However, the molecule does not have any plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Molecules that possess a rotational axis (Cn) but lack a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i) are chiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is (CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-[cyclopentyl ring].\n    *   We need to check for any elements of chirality. There are no chiral centers in this molecule. The carbon in the -CH(CH₃)₂ group is attached to two identical methyl groups. All carbons in the cyclopentyl ring are -CH₂- groups.\n    *   The molecule can adopt a conformation that has a plane of symmetry. This plane would contain the C=O group and the adjacent CH₂ and C atoms, bisecting the two methyl groups and the cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   Since a conformation with a plane of symmetry is readily accessible, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary**:\n*   Optically Inactive: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.\n*   Optically Active: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol.\n\nThere are 4 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<A>>>"
