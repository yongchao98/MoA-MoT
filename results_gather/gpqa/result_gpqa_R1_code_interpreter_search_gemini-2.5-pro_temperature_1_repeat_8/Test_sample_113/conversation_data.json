    "*   **Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n    *   This reaction is a **cyanohydrin formation**. It involves the nucleophilic addition of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN to the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n    *   **Step 1:** The cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This breaks the C=O pi bond and forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n    *   **Step 2:** The negatively charged oxygen atom of the alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final stable hydroxyl group (-OH) of the cyanohydrin product.\n    *   Reagent **A** must be a source of protons (H⁺). An acidic workup, represented by **H₃O⁺**, provides the necessary protons to complete the reaction. NaHSO₃ forms bisulfite addition products and is not used for cyanohydrin synthesis.\n    *   Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n    *   This reaction is the **hydrolysis of a nitrile** group (-C≡N) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The reactant is an α-hydroxy nitrile (a cyanohydrin), and the product is an α-hydroxy carboxylic acid.\n    *   The hydrolysis of nitriles requires either strong acidic or strong basic conditions, typically with heating. The presence of H₂O in the reaction scheme indicates that it is a hydrolysis reaction.\n    *   Reagent **B** acts as the catalyst for this hydrolysis.\n    *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** A strong acid, such as **HCl** or H₂SO₄, protonates the nitrile nitrogen, making the carbon more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water. The reaction proceeds through an amide intermediate, which is then further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** A strong base (e.g., NaOH) can also be used, which would first produce a carboxylate salt. An acid workup would then be needed to get the final carboxylic acid.\n    *   Comparing the options for B, **HCl** is a strong acid and a standard reagent for efficiently catalyzing the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid and is generally not effective enough for this transformation.\n    *   Therefore, **B = HCl**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   For the first reaction, A = H₃O⁺.\n    *   For the second reaction, B = HCl.\n    *   This combination matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
