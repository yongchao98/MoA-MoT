    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**1. Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ range is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extensive hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers causes this significant broadening.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Combined with the broad O-H peak, it strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is unsaturated (i.e., it contains an alkene).\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. The presence of these peaks confirms the existence of an alkene group, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n**Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The compound contains a C=C double bond.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very diagnostic fragment. We can calculate the mass of the carboxyl group [COOH]⁺:\n    *   Mass = (1 × atomic mass of C) + (2 × atomic mass of O) + (1 × atomic mass of H)\n    *   Mass = (1 × 12) + (2 × 16) + (1 × 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45\n*   This m/z = 45 fragment is a classic result of alpha-cleavage or McLafferty rearrangement in carboxylic acids, providing strong evidence for the -COOH group.\n\n**Conclusion from Mass Spec:** The compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n**4. Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   From all three techniques, we have concluded that the unknown is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n*   A carboxylic acid must contain two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options B (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O), which only have one oxygen.\n*   We are left with **C6H10O2** and **C6H12O2**. To distinguish between them, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU). The DoU tells us the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n*   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)` (for a formula containing only C, H, and O).\n*   From our spectral analysis, we know the molecule must contain:\n    *   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   One C=C double bond (from the alkene) = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the correct formula must have a total DoU of **2**.\n\n*   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n    *   **A) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This molecule is saturated (apart from the C=O in the acid group). It does not have the C=C bond required by the FTIR and NMR data.\n    *   **C) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU matches our requirement for one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** The chemical formula C6H10O2 is the only one that perfectly matches all the spectroscopic evidence.\n\n<<<C>>>"
