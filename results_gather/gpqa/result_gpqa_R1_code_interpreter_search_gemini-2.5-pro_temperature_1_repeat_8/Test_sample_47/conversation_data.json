    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\n*   **Reaction:** This is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine to place a bromine atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon). Since cyclohexanone is symmetric, both α-positions are equivalent.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n    \n     \n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n*   **Reactant:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone, an α-halo ketone with an available proton on the other α-carbon (C6).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydroxide (a strong base) and heat.\n*   **Reaction:** These conditions are classic for the **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n    1.  The hydroxide ion (⁻OH) abstracts an acidic α-proton from C6, forming an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 attack on the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon of the strained bicyclic intermediate.\n    4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, and the three-membered ring opens. The C1-C6 bond breaks, leading to a ring contraction from a six-membered ring to a five-membered ring. This forms a cyclopentane ring with a carboxylate group.\n    5.  Acidic workup (implied in this type of problem) protonates the carboxylate to give a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    \n    *(Note: An alternative reaction is E2 elimination to form cyclohex-2-en-1-one. However, the Favorskii rearrangement is a very common reaction for this substrate under these conditions, and the subsequent reaction steps make much more sense if the Favorskii product is formed.)*\n    \n     \n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) replaces the -OH group of the carboxylic acid with a -Cl atom. Pyridine is a weak base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n    \n     \n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H)**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a selective reduction. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky, mild reducing agent. It is specifically known for reducing acid chlorides to aldehydes without continuing the reduction to the primary alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n    \n     \n\n**Analysis of Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. We can do this by analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring is attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry (Cₛ symmetry). This plane passes through the aldehyde group (H-C=O), the C1 carbon and its attached hydrogen, and it bisects the C3-C4 bond of the ring.\n*   **Counting Distinct Hydrogens:**\n    1.  **The aldehyde proton (H-C=O):** This hydrogen is unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 type)\n    2.  **The proton on C1:** This hydrogen is also unique, attached to the carbon that links the ring and the aldehyde group. It also lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 type)\n    3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 are not equivalent to each other; they are diastereotopic because of the substituent on C1. The same is true for the two protons on C5. The 'upper' proton on C2 is equivalent to the 'upper' proton on C5, and the 'lower' proton on C2 is equivalent to the 'lower' proton on C5. This gives two distinct sets of protons for these four positions. (2 types)\n    4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes C3 and C4 equivalent. The two protons on C3 are diastereotopic, as are the two on C4. This gives another two distinct sets of protons for these four positions. (2 types)\n\n*   **Total Count:**\n    *   Type 1: Aldehyde H (1H)\n    *   Type 2: C1 H (1H)\n    *   Type 3: One set of C2/C5 protons (2H)\n    *   Type 4: The other set of C2/C5 protons (2H)\n    *   Type 5: One set of C3/C4 protons (2H)\n    *   Type 6: The other set of C3/C4 protons (2H)\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
