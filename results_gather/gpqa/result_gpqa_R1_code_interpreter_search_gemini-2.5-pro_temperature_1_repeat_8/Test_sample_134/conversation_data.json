    "The interaction Lagrangian is given by:\n$\\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\lambda_f \\bar{\\psi}_f (y) (\\upsilon + X(y)) \\psi_f(y)$\n\nThis Lagrangian describes the interaction between a bosonic field $X$ and a fermion field $\\psi_f$. The term relevant for the decay of the boson $X$ is the interaction term:\n$\\mathcal{L}_{Xf\\bar{f}} = -\\lambda_f X(y) \\bar{\\psi}_f(y) \\psi_f(y)$\n\nThis term corresponds to a vertex where the boson $X$ couples to a fermion-antifermion pair ($f\\bar{f}$). This means that the boson $X$ can decay into a fermion and its corresponding antifermion, a process denoted as $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$.\n\nFor a decay to be kinematically allowed, the mass of the initial decaying particle must be greater than or equal to the sum of the masses of the decay products. In this case, for the decay $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$, the condition is:\n$m_X \\ge m_f + m_{\\bar{f}}$\n\nSince a fermion and its antifermion have the same mass ($m_f = m_{\\bar{f}}$), the condition simplifies to:\n$m_X \\ge 2m_f$\n\nWe are given the mass of the boson $X$:\n$m_X = 6$ GeV\n\nTherefore, a decay into a specific fermion-antifermion pair $f\\bar{f}$ is kinematically allowed if the mass of the fermion $f$ satisfies:\n$2m_f \\le 6 \\text{ GeV}$\n$m_f \\le 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nNow, we need to check this condition for all fundamental fermions (quarks and leptons) of the Standard Model.\n\n**Leptons:**\n*   Electron ($e$): $m_e \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.000511 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.000511 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$ is allowed.\n*   Muon ($\\mu$): $m_\\mu \\approx 105.7 \\text{ MeV} = 0.1057 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.1057 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ is allowed.\n*   Tau ($\\tau$): $m_\\tau \\approx 1.777 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $1.777 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ is allowed.\n\n**Quarks:**\n*   Up quark ($u$): $m_u \\approx 2.2 \\text{ MeV} = 0.0022 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.0022 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}$ is allowed.\n*   Down quark ($d$): $m_d \\approx 4.7 \\text{ MeV} = 0.0047 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.0047 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow d\\bar{d}$ is allowed.\n*   Strange quark ($s$): $m_s \\approx 95 \\text{ MeV} = 0.095 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.095 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow s\\bar{s}$ is allowed.\n*   Charm quark ($c$): $m_c \\approx 1.27 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $1.27 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$ is allowed.\n*   Bottom quark ($b$): $m_b \\approx 4.18 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $4.18 > 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ is **not** allowed.\n*   Top quark ($t$): $m_t \\approx 173 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $173 > 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow t\\bar{t}$ is **not** allowed.\n\nSummarizing the allowed decays:\n*   $X \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$\n*   $X \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$\n*   $X \\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$\n*   $X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}$\n*   $X \\rightarrow d\\bar{d}$\n*   $X \\rightarrow s\\bar{s}$\n*   $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$\n\nNow we compare this list with the given options:\nA) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Incorrect, includes $b\\bar{b}$)\nB) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Correct, includes all allowed decays)\nC) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},t\\bar{t},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Incorrect, includes $t\\bar{t}$)\nD) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Incorrect, includes $b\\bar{b}$ and is missing $\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ and $c\\bar{c}$)\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
