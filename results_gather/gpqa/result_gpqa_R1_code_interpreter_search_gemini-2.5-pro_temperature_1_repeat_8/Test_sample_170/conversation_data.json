    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction and Substituent Effects**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination). Substituents on the benzene ring determine the regioselectivity, i.e., where the incoming electrophile (Br+) will attack.\n*   **Activating groups** donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive. They are typically **ortho, para-directors**.\n*   **Deactivating groups** withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive. They are typically **meta-directors**.\n*   **Halogens** are an exception: they are deactivating but are **ortho, para-directors**.\n\nThe yield of the para-isomer will be very low for meta-directors and significantly higher for ortho, para-directors.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\n\nLet's classify each substituent and its directing effect:\n\n*   **1) -CH3 (in Toluene):** Activating, *ortho, para-director*.\n*   **2) -COOC2H5 (in Ethyl benzoate):** Deactivating, *meta-director*.\n*   **3) -Cl (in Chlorobenzene):** Deactivating, *ortho, para-director*.\n*   **4) -NO2 (in Nitrobenzene):** Strongly deactivating, *meta-director*.\n*   **5) -C2H5 (in Ethylbenzene):** Activating, *ortho, para-director*.\n*   **6) -COOH (in Benzoic acid):** Deactivating, *meta-director*.\n\nThis means the substances can be split into two groups:\n*   **Low para-yield group (meta-directors):** 4 (-NO2), 6 (-COOH), 2 (-COOC2H5)\n*   **High para-yield group (ortho, para-directors):** 1 (-CH3), 5 (-C2H5), 3 (-Cl)\n\nThe final order will have all the meta-directors first, followed by the ortho, para-directors.\n\n**3. Order the Meta-Directors (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the para-isomer is a minor byproduct. The amount of this byproduct is inversely related to the strength of the deactivating group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n(Nitro is the strongest, followed by carboxylic acid, and then the ester, which is slightly less deactivating than the acid).\n\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be lowest for the strongest deactivator and highest (among this group) for the weakest deactivator.\nOrder of increasing para-yield: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**4. Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The distribution between ortho and para products depends on a balance of electronic and steric factors.\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** A bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer. The order of steric bulk for the groups is: -Cl < -CH3 < -C2H5. Based on sterics alone, the para yield should increase in this order.\n*   **Electronic Effects & Experimental Data:**\n    *   **Toluene (1, -CH3):** Bromination gives about 67% para-isomer.\n    *   **Chlorobenzene (3, -Cl):** Bromination gives about 87% para-isomer. Despite being smaller than a methyl group, the strong inductive effect of chlorine deactivates the ortho positions more strongly than the para position, leading to very high para selectivity.\n    *   **Ethylbenzene (5, -C2H5):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance will favor para-substitution over ortho-substitution more than in toluene. Therefore, the para-yield for ethylbenzene must be greater than that of toluene (i.e., > 67%). It is reasonable to assume it doesn't exceed the very high para-selectivity of chlorobenzene.\n\nCombining these points, the order of increasing para-yield is:\nToluene (1) (~67%) < Ethylbenzene (5) (>67%) < Chlorobenzene (3) (~87%)\nOrder of increasing para-yield: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**5. Combine the Orders**\n\nNow, we combine the two ordered groups:\n*   Meta-directors: 4 < 6 < 2\n*   Ortho, para-directors: 1 < 5 < 3\n\nThe complete sequence, in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer, is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
