    "*   **Analyze the Question:** The core of the question is about \"regularization at high energies.\" This is a procedure used in physics to handle mathematical infinities that arise in calculations, particularly when dealing with interactions at very short distances or, equivalently, very high energies. These are often called \"ultraviolet (UV) divergences.\" We need to identify which of the listed theories is free from these types of divergences and therefore doesn't need regularization.\n\n*   **Examine the Options:**\n\n    *   **A) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** This is the quantum field theory (QFT) that describes the strong force. Like other QFTs, when calculating interactions (for example, through Feynman diagrams with loops), integrals often diverge at high energies. QCD is a renormalizable theory, which means that these infinities can be systematically removed through the process of regularization and renormalization. Therefore, QCD *does* require regularization.\n\n    *   **B) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory, governed by Maxwell's equations, describes electric and magnetic fields. While it's a classical theory, it runs into its own infinity problem if you consider point-like charged particles. The self-energy of a point charge (the energy of its own electric field) is infinite. To get a finite answer, one must introduce a cutoff, such as assuming the particle has a small but non-zero radius. This is a form of regularization. So, Classical Electrodynamics *does* encounter infinities that require a form of regularization.\n\n    *   **D) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the QFT of electromagnetism. It was the first successful QFT and the model for others like QCD. It famously suffers from UV divergences in loop calculations (e.g., in calculating the electron's self-energy or its interaction with photons). These infinities are handled by regularization and renormalization. Therefore, QED *does* require regularization.\n\n    *   **C) Superstring Theory:** This is a theoretical framework that attempts to unify all fundamental forces, including gravity. One of its primary motivations and most celebrated features is that it is believed to be free of ultraviolet (high-energy) divergences. Instead of point-like particles, the fundamental entities are one-dimensional \"strings.\" The interactions between strings are \"smeared out\" over a small region, which smooths out the short-distance behavior that leads to infinities in QFT. As a result, calculations of scattering amplitudes in superstring theory are expected to be finite without the need for regularization.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** QCD, QED, and even Classical Electrodynamics all encounter infinities at high energies/short distances that must be dealt with by some form of regularization. Superstring Theory is specifically formulated in a way that is believed to avoid these infinities altogether.\n\n<<<C>>>"
