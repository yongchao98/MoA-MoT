    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Fundamental Assumption:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This implies that the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ`, is constant throughout space.\n\n2.  **Number of Stars in a Volume:** The number of stars `N` in any given volume `V` is simply the density multiplied by the volume: `N = ρ * V`.\n\n3.  **Consider a Shell of Stars:** We are interested in the number of stars at a certain distance. Let's consider a thin spherical shell of stars at a distance `d` from the observer, with a small thickness `dd`. The volume of this thin shell `dV` can be approximated by the surface area of the sphere (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`).\n    `dV = 4πd² dd`\n\n4.  **Number of Stars in the Shell:** The number of stars `dN` in this thin shell is the density `ρ` times the volume of the shell `dV`.\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * (4πd² dd)`\n\n5.  **Introduce Parallax (plx):** Parallax is defined as the inverse of the distance to the star. For simplicity (using units of parsecs for distance and arcseconds for parallax), the relationship is:\n    `d = 1/plx`\n\n6.  **Relate Differentials `dd` and `d(plx)`:** We need to find how a small change in distance `dd` relates to a small change in parallax `d(plx)`. We can find this by differentiating the parallax equation with respect to `plx`:\n    `d(d)/d(plx) = d(1/plx)/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    This gives us the relationship: `dd = - (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n    Since we are counting stars, `dN` must be a positive number. A positive interval `d(plx)` corresponds to a negative interval `dd` (as distance decreases when parallax increases). We are interested in the number of stars within a parallax range, so we consider the magnitude of the change:\n    `|dd| = (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n\n7.  **Substitute `d` and `dd` into the `dN` equation:** Now we substitute the expressions for `d` and `|dd|` in terms of `plx` into our equation for the number of stars in the shell (`dN = 4πρd² |dd|`).\n    *   Replace `d` with `1/plx`.\n    *   Replace `|dd|` with `(1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n\n    `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n\n8.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\n9.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Range of Parallax:** The question asks for how the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`, changes with `plx`. We can find this by dividing both sides of our equation by `d(plx)`.\n    `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n10. **Determine the Proportionality:** Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we can see the relationship:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
