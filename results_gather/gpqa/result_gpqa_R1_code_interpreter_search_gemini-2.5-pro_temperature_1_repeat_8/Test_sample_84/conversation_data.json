    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2, which can be written as T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet orbiting a star is given by:\n    T_eq = T_eff_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    where:\n    *   T_eff_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n    *   A is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n    *   R_star is the radius of the star.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to compute the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 = T_eff_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))\n    T_eq2 = T_eff_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))\n\n    The problem states that the star's properties (T_eff_star, R_star) are the same for both planets. It also explicitly states that both planets have the same albedo (A_1 = A_2). Therefore, these terms will cancel out in the ratio:\n\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_eff_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))] / [T_eff_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (R_star / (2 * a_1)) * ( (2 * a_2) / R_star) )\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\n    This simplifies the problem to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n4.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Observational Data:** The problem provides data from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the Doppler shift (Δλ) caused by each planet. The maximum Doppler shift is related to the star's maximum radial velocity (K), also known as the RV semi-amplitude.\n\n    The relationship between the star's RV semi-amplitude (K) and the planet's properties for a circular orbit is:\n    K = (M_p / M_star) * v_p * sin(i)\n    where M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, v_p is the planet's orbital velocity, and `i` is the orbital inclination. Since the planets were detected by the transit method, it is safe to assume their orbits are close to edge-on, so sin(i) ≈ 1.\n\n    The planet's orbital velocity (v_p) for a circular orbit is given by:\n    v_p = sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\n    Substituting v_p into the equation for K:\n    K = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\n5.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We can rearrange the formula to solve for `a`:\n    K^2 = M_p^2 * (G / (M_star * a))\n    a = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a_2 / a_1):**\n    a_2 / a_1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K_2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K_1^2)]\n    The terms G and M_star cancel out.\n    a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_2^2) * (K_1^2 / M_p1^2)\n    a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2\n\n7.  **Relate RV Semi-Amplitude (K) to Doppler Shift (Δλ):** The Doppler shift formula relates wavelength shift to velocity:\n    Δλ / λ_0 = v_r / c\n    The maximum shift (Δλ) corresponds to the maximum velocity (K):\n    K = c * Δλ / λ_0\n    The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is therefore equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n    K_1 / K_2 = (c * Δλ_1 / λ_0) / (c * Δλ_2 / λ_0) = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2\n\n8.  **Combine the Ratios:** Substitute the Doppler shift ratio back into the equation for a_2 / a_1:\n    a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2\n\n9.  **Final Calculation:** Now substitute this expression for a_2 / a_1 back into our simplified temperature ratio formula:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1) = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2 )\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)\n\n    Now, we plug in the given values:\n    *   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n    *   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n    *   Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n    *   Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n10. **Compute the final numerical value.**\n```python\n# Given values\nMp1_Me = 7  # Mass of Planet 1 in Earth masses\nMp2_Me = 5  # Mass of Planet 2 in Earth masses\ndelta_lambda1 = 0.03  # Doppler shift for Planet 1 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda2 = 0.04  # Doppler shift for Planet 2 in Angstroms\n\n# Mass ratio (Mp2 / Mp1)\nmass_ratio = Mp2_Me / Mp1_Me\n\n# Doppler shift ratio (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\nlambda_ratio = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 is given by\n# (Mp2 / Mp1) * (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\nT_eq_ratio = mass_ratio * lambda_ratio\n\nprint(f\"{T_eq_ratio:.4f}\")\n```\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.5357. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.30\nB) ~ 1.05\nC) ~ 0.53\nD) ~ 0.98\n\nThe result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2), we can follow these steps:\n\n**1. The Formula for Equilibrium Temperature**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_star` is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n*   `A` is the planet's Bond albedo.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n**2. Forming the Ratio**\n\nWe want to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2:\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both and will cancel out. It is also given that both planets have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂), so the `(1 - A)^(1/4)` term also cancels out.\n\nThis simplifies the ratio to:\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt( (R_star / (2 * a₁)) * ((2 * a₂) / R_star) )\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n\nSo, to find the temperature ratio, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n**3. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data**\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude (K) induced on a star by an orbiting planet in a circular orbit is given by:\nK = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nWhere:\n*   `M_p` is the mass of the planet.\n*   `M_star` is the mass of the star.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis.\n(We assume an edge-on orbit, sin(i) ≈ 1, which is a reasonable assumption for planets detected via the transit method).\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\nK² = (M_p² / M_star²) * (G * M_star / a)\nK² = (G * M_p²) / (M_star * a)\na = (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = [(G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K₂²)] / [(G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K₁²)]\nThe terms G and M_star cancel out, leaving:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p1²) = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n**4. Relating RV Semi-Amplitude (K) to Doppler Shift (Δλ)**\n\nThe Doppler shift formula relates the change in wavelength (Δλ) to the radial velocity (v_r):\nΔλ / λ₀ = v_r / c\nThe maximum Doppler shift corresponds to the RV semi-amplitude K:\nK = c * (Δλ_max / λ₀)\n\nThe ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is therefore:\nK₁ / K₂ = [c * (Δλ₁ / λ₀)] / [c * (Δλ₂ / λ₀)] = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\n\nSubstitute the expression for K₁/K₂ back into the equation for a₂/a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²\n\nNow, substitute this into our simplified temperature ratio equation:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁) = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)² )\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\nFinally, plug in the given values:\n*   Mass of Planet 1 (M_p1) = 7 Earth masses\n*   Mass of Planet 2 (M_p2) = 5 Earth masses\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 1 (Δλ₁) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 2 (Δλ₂) = 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>"
