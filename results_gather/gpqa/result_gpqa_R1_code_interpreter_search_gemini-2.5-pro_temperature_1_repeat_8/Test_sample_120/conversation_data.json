    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the given reaction.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Starting Material\nThe starting material is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n\n*   **Core Structure**: `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide ring. The epoxide oxygen (atom 7) bridges carbons C1 and C6. This is essentially a substituted cyclohexene oxide.\n*   **Substituents**: There are methyl groups (`-CH3`) at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: The absolute configurations are given as `1R`, `3R`, `4R`, and `6S`. This defines the 3D arrangement of the atoms. We can deduce the relative positions of the groups from these configurations. For instance, for the epoxide to be formed, the bonds to the oxygen must be on the same face of the C1-C6 bond of the original cyclohexene ring (a syn-epoxidation). Let's assume the epoxide ring is on the 'top' (beta, β) face of the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   To satisfy **1R**, the methyl group at C1 must be on the 'bottom' (alpha, α) face.\n    *   To satisfy **6S**, the hydrogen atom at C6 must also be on the 'bottom' (alpha, α) face.\n    *   To satisfy **3R** and **4R**, the methyl groups at C3 and C4 must have specific orientations, which we can track throughout the reaction. For now, what is crucial is that they are stereocenters whose configuration will be preserved.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Reagent and Reaction\n*   **Reagent**: `Me2CuLi` is lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (`Me⁻`).\n*   **Reaction Type**: This is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The problem statement provides the key regiochemical and stereochemical rules for this reaction:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity**: The nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity**: The attack occurs via an **Sₙ2 mechanism**, which means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the C-O bond (anti-attack) and causes an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.\n\n### 3. Identify the Site of Attack\nThe epoxide ring consists of carbons C1 and C6, and the oxygen atom.\n*   **C1** is a tertiary carbon: it is bonded to C2, C6, a methyl group, and the epoxide oxygen.\n*   **C6** is a secondary carbon: it is bonded to C5, C1, a hydrogen atom, and the epoxide oxygen.\n\nComparing the two, C6 is less sterically hindered than C1. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group from `Me2CuLi` will attack **C6**.\n\n### 4. Determine the Product Structure and Stereochemistry\n1.  **Attack and Bond Breaking**: The `Me⁻` nucleophile attacks C6 from the side opposite to the C6-O bond. Since the epoxide oxygen is on the top (β) face, the methyl group attacks from the bottom (α) face. This is an anti-attack.\n2.  **Inversion**: The attack causes an inversion of configuration at C6. The original configuration of C6 was **S**. After the reaction, it will be **R**.\n3.  **Ring Opening**: The C6-O bond breaks, and the electron pair moves to the oxygen atom. This forms an alkoxide intermediate with the negative charge on the oxygen attached to C1.\n4.  **Protonation**: A subsequent aqueous workup (which is implied in such reactions) protonates the alkoxide (`O⁻`) to form a hydroxyl group (`-OH`) at C1.\n5.  **Fate of Stereocenters**:\n    *   **C1**: The configuration at C1 is not inverted because no bonds to the chiral center are broken. It was `R` and remains `R`. The oxygen of the original epoxide becomes the oxygen of the new hydroxyl group.\n    *   **C6**: The configuration inverts from `S` to `R`.\n    *   **C3 & C4**: These stereocenters are far from the reaction site and are unaffected. Their configurations remain `3R` and `4R`.\n\n### 5. Name the Product\nThe product is a substituted cyclohexanol. We need to number the ring according to IUPAC rules.\n*   The principal functional group is the hydroxyl group (`-OH`), so the carbon it's attached to (the original C1) is designated as **C1** in the product's name.\n*   We number the ring to give the substituents (the methyl groups) the lowest possible set of locants.\n*   The methyl groups are located at:\n    *   The new C1 (from the original C1).\n    *   The new C2 (which was the original C6, where the new methyl group was added).\n    *   The new C4 (which was the original C4).\n    *   The new C5 (which was the original C3).\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise from the new C1 gives the locant set {1, 2, 4, 5} for the methyl groups. Numbering clockwise would give {1, 3, 4, 6}. The set {1, 2, 4, 5} is preferred as it is lower at the first point of difference (2 vs 3).\n*   Thus, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and C.\n\n### 6. Determine the Final Stereochemistry\nWe now map the stereochemical descriptors to the new numbering:\n*   **New C1** (from old C1): Configuration is retained -> **1R**.\n*   **New C2** (from old C6): Configuration is inverted (S → R) -> **2R**.\n*   **New C4** (from old C4): Configuration is retained -> **4R**.\n*   **New C5** (from old C3): Configuration is retained -> **5R**.\n\nThe full IUPAC name of the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
