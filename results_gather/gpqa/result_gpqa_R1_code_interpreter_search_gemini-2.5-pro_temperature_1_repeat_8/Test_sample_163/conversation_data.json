    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem and Identify Key Information**\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the total mass of binary star system_1 to that of system_2 (M1/M2). We are given the following observational data for each system:\n*   **System 1:**\n    *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n    *   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K1a, K1b) = 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n*   **System 2:**\n    *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n    *   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K2a, K2b) = 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n\nA crucial piece of information is that both systems are \"eclipsing.\"\n\n**2. Select the Appropriate Physical Formula**\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system (where we can measure the radial velocities of both stars), the total mass of the system (M = m1 + m2) can be derived from Kepler's Third Law. The formula is:\n\nM = (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))\n\nWhere:\n*   M is the total mass of the system.\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   K1 and K2 are the amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n*   'i' is the inclination of the orbital plane to our line of sight.\n\n**3. Use the \"Eclipsing\" Information**\n\nThe fact that the systems exhibit eclipses tells us that we are viewing them nearly edge-on. This means the inclination angle 'i' is very close to 90°. For i = 90°, sin(i) = 1, and therefore sin³(i) = 1. This significantly simplifies the mass equation:\n\nM ≈ (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2 * π * G)\n\nThis shows that the total mass is directly proportional to the period and the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes (M ∝ P * (K_total)³).\n\n**4. Set Up the Ratio Calculation**\n\nWe need to find the ratio M1 / M2. We can set up the ratio of the masses for the two systems:\n\nM1 / M2 = [ (P1 * (K1_total)³) / (2 * π * G) ] / [ (P2 * (K2_total)³) / (2 * π * G) ]\n\nThe constant term (2 * π * G) cancels out, leaving a simpler expression:\n\nM1 / M2 = (P1 / P2) * (K1_total / K2_total)³\n\n**5. Substitute the Values and Calculate**\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total velocity amplitudes for each system:\n*   **K1_total** = K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n*   **K2_total** = K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, substitute all the known values into the ratio formula:\n*   P1 / P2 = 2 years / 1 year = 2\n*   K1_total / K2_total = 15 km/s / 25 km/s = 3/5 = 0.6\n\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (0.6)³\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (0.6 * 0.6 * 0.6)\nM1 / M2 = 2 * 0.216\nM1 / M2 = 0.432\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated ratio of the mass of system_1 to system_2 is approximately 0.432. This value is closest to the given option B.\n\nTo confirm the calculation:\n```python\n# System 1 data\nP1 = 2  # years\nK1_total = 10 + 5  # km/s\n\n# System 2 data\nP2 = 1  # year\nK2_total = 15 + 10  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the velocity terms cubed\nvelocity_ratio_cubed = (K1_total / K2_total)**3\n\n# Calculate the final mass ratio\nmass_ratio = (P1 / P2) * velocity_ratio_cubed\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.432\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation confirms that the factor is 0.432.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The mass of a binary system can be determined from Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period (P), the sum of the semi-major axes of the orbits of the two stars (a = a1 + a2), and the total mass of the system (M = m1 + m2). For spectroscopic binaries, we can relate the semi-major axes to the observed radial velocity amplitudes (K1, K2).\n\nThe key relationship for the total mass (M) of a double-lined spectroscopic binary is:\n\nM = (P / (2 * π * G)) * ((K1 + K2)³ / sin³(i))\n\nWhere:\n*   M is the total mass of the system (m1 + m2).\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n*   K1 and K2 are the amplitudes of the radial velocities for star 1 and star 2.\n*   'i' is the inclination of the orbital plane with respect to the line of sight.\n\nA critical piece of information given is that both systems are **eclipsing**. This means that the orbital plane is viewed nearly edge-on, so the inclination angle 'i' is very close to 90 degrees. For i = 90°, sin(i) = 1, and therefore sin³(i) = 1. This simplifies the mass equation considerably, as we can assume sin³(i) ≈ 1 for both systems.\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the mass of system_1 (M1) to the mass of system_2 (M2). We can set up this ratio:\n\nM1 / M2 = [ (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i₁)) ] / [ (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i₂)) ]\n\nSince both are eclipsing, sin³(i₁) ≈ 1 and sin³(i₂) ≈ 1. The term (2 * π * G) is a constant and cancels out. The equation simplifies to:\n\nM1 / M2 = (P1 / P2) * ( (K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b) )³\n\nNow, let's plug in the given values:\n\n**For system_1:**\n*   P1 = 2 years\n*   K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**For system_2:**\n*   P2 = 1 year\n*   K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, calculate the ratio:\n\nM1 / M2 = (2 years / 1 year) * ( (15 km/s) / (25 km/s) )³\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (15 / 25)³\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (0.6)³\nM1 / M2 = 2 * 0.216\nM1 / M2 = 0.432\n\nThe result 0.432 is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
