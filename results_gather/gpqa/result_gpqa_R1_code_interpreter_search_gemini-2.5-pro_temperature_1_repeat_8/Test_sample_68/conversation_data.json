    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays of the $X^0$ particle. In the context of particle physics experiments, \"observing a decay\" means that the parent particle must travel a distinguishable distance before it decays. If it decays instantaneously at its creation point, we only see the daughter particles, and we cannot confirm that the parent particle ever existed as a separate entity with a measurable track.\n\nTherefore, the \"minimum resolution\" corresponds to a minimum track length, let's call it `d`. We need to find the value of `d` such that at least 30% of the $X^0$ particles travel a distance *greater than or equal to* `d` before they decay.\n\n**2. Key Physics Principles**\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The probability that a particle has not decayed after a time `t` in its own rest frame is given by $P(t) = e^{-t/\\tau_0}$, where $\\tau_0$ is the proper lifetime.\n*   **Time Dilation:** For a particle moving at a relativistic speed, its lifetime appears longer to an observer in the lab frame. The lab-frame lifetime, $\\tau$, is given by $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** This factor relates the particle's total energy (E) and its rest mass ($m_0$) through the equation $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$. It is also related to the particle's velocity `v` by $\\gamma = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}$.\n*   **Decay Length:** The distance a particle travels in a given time `t` is `d = v * t`. The average distance a particle travels before decaying in the lab frame is the mean decay length, $L = v \\tau$.\n\n**3. Mathematical Formulation**\nLet's formalize the condition from Step 1. The probability that a particle survives for a time `t` (in the lab frame) is given by $P(t) = e^{-t/\\tau}$. This is also the probability that it travels a distance `d = v * t` or more before decaying. We want this probability to be at least 30% (or 0.30).\n\nSo, the condition is:\n$P(\\text{distance} \\ge d) \\ge 0.30$\n\nThis is equivalent to:\n$e^{-t/\\tau} \\ge 0.30$\nwhere `t` is the time it takes to travel the resolution distance `d`, i.e., $t = d/v$.\n$e^{-d/(v\\tau)} \\ge 0.30$\n\nTo find the minimum resolution `d`, we solve for the equality:\n$e^{-d/(v\\tau)} = 0.30$\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-d/(v\\tau) = \\ln(0.30)$\n$d = -v \\tau \\ln(0.30)$\n\n**4. Calculation Steps**\nWe can calculate the required values in sequence.\n\n*   **Step a: Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$)**\n    Given: $E = 27$ GeV, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27}{3.41}$\n\n*   **Step b: Calculate the term `v * τ`**\n    The term $v\\tau$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame. We can express it in terms of $\\gamma$ to avoid calculating `v` separately.\n    $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n    $v = c \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$\n    $v\\tau = (c \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}) \\times (\\gamma \\tau_0) = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 (1 - 1/\\gamma^2)} = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n\n*   **Step c: Calculate the resolution `d`**\n    Substitute the expression for `vτ` back into our equation for `d`:\n    $d = -(c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}) \\ln(0.30)$\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n*   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   $c = 299792458$ m/s (speed of light)\n*   $\\gamma = 27 / 3.41$\n*   $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.20397$\n\nA Python script is ideal for performing this calculation accurately.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the constants from the problem statement\nproper_lifetime_tau0 = 8e-16  # s\nenergy_E = 27.0  # GeV\nmass_m0 = 3.41   # GeV\nc = 299792458  # m/s\nfraction_to_observe = 0.30\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = energy_E / mass_m0\n\n# Step 2: Formulate the equation for the minimum resolution 'd'.\n# The probability of a particle surviving to travel a distance 'd' is P(d) = exp(-d / L),\n# where L is the mean decay length in the lab frame (L = v*tau).\n# We want this probability to be 0.30.\n# exp(-d / L) = 0.30\n# d = -L * ln(0.30)\n# The mean decay length L can be expressed as L = c * tau0 * sqrt(gamma^2 - 1).\n# So, d = - (c * tau0 * sqrt(gamma^2 - 1)) * ln(0.30)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the numerical value for 'd'\ngamma_squared = gamma**2\nln_fraction = np.log(fraction_to_observe)\nd = -c * proper_lifetime_tau0 * np.sqrt(gamma_squared - 1) * ln_fraction\n\nprint(f\"{d:.2e}\")\n```\n>2.27e-06\n\nThe calculation yields $d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.

The small discrepancy (around 9%) might arise from slightly different values for constants used in the problem's source or a minor variation in the problem's interpretation or wording. However, given the options, D is the only one in the correct order of magnitude and reasonably close to the calculated value.\n\n<<<D>>>",

We can rearrange this to find the time `t` it takes to travel the distance `d`: $t = d/v$.\n\nSubstituting this into the probability equation, we want the probability of traveling a distance `d` to be 0.30:\n$e^{-(d/v)/\\tau} = 0.30$\n$e^{-d/(v\\tau)} = 0.30$\n\nThe term $v\\tau$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame, which we can call `L`.

The small difference between the calculated value and the option is likely due to slightly different constants or rounding used in the problem's source material.\n\n<<<D>>>"
