This is the starting point for all correct solutions.\n*   In the standard computational basis, we have $|0\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $|1\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n*   The outer products are $|0\\rangle\\langle0| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $|1\\rangle\\langle1| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n*   The expression $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|$ is the sum of projectors onto a complete orthonormal basis, which is equal to the identity matrix $I$.\n*   Therefore, the density matrix simplifies to $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** All provided solutions correctly identify this density matrix as representing the **maximally mixed state**. This state has an equal 50% probability of being measured as state $|0\\rangle$ or $|1\\rangle$, and geometrically it lies at the very center of the Bloch sphere.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Bloch Vector**\n\nAny single-qubit density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$ and the Pauli matrices $\\vec{\\sigma}$ using the formula $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$. There are two common and equivalent ways to find $\\vec{r}$.\n\n*   **Method A: Direct Comparison:**\n    We set our simplified matrix equal to the general form:\n    $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n    This immediately simplifies to $\\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = 0$. Since the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, the only solution is for all coefficients to be zero: $r_x = 0, r_y = 0, r_z = 0$.\n\n*   **Method B: Using the Trace Formula:**\n    The components of the Bloch vector are given by $r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_k)$.\n    *   $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_x) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = 0$\n    *   $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_y) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = 0$\n    *   $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_z) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = 0$\n    (This works because all Pauli matrices are traceless).\n\n**Careful Point 2:** Both methods robustly show that the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$. The unanimity of the candidate answers on this point confirms the correctness of the calculation.\n\n**Step 3: Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe calculated geometrical position is the vector $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$, which corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere. Now, we must map this result to the specific options provided in the question.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** The candidate answers provided have different final letter choices (A, B, C, D). This is because the multiple-choice options were presented to them in different orders. However, the calculated vector `(0, 0, 0)` is consistently the same. We must ignore their final letter choices and use the universally correct mathematical result to answer the question as presented.\n\nThe options are:\nA) r=(0,0,1)\nB) r=(0,0,0)\nC) r=(1,1,0)\nD) r=(1,1,1)\n\nOur calculated result, `r=(0,0,0)`, matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe problem is to determine the geometrical position, which is the Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$, for the density matrix $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$. An analysis of the provided candidate answers reveals a unanimous consensus on the calculation, despite differing final letter choices due to shuffled options.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the Density Matrix**\n\nFirst, the density matrix given in Dirac notation needs to be expressed in matrix form.\n*   The computational basis states are $|0\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $|1\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n*   The outer products $|i\\rangle\\langle i|$ are projection operators. For the computational basis, we have:\n    $|0\\rangle\\langle0| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $|1\\rangle\\langle1| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n*   The sum of these projectors is $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = I$.\n*   Substituting this into the expression for $\\rho$, we get: $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$.\n    This is the density matrix for the **maximally mixed state**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Bloch Vector**\n\nThe Bloch vector $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$ represents the geometrical position of a qubit state. It relates to the density matrix via the equation $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$, where $\\vec{\\sigma}$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n\nWe can solve for $\\vec{r}$ by substituting our result from Step 1:\n$\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 and subtracting $I$ gives:\n$0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$\n\nSince the Pauli matrices ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$) are linearly independent, the only way for their linear combination to be the zero matrix is if all the coefficients are zero.\nTherefore, $r_x = 0$, $r_y = 0$, and $r_z = 0$.\n\nThe resulting Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$. This vector corresponds to the origin (the center) of the Bloch sphere.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Recognizing the Identity Operator:** The most crucial first step is to correctly identify that the sum of projectors onto a complete orthonormal basis, $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|$, is the identity operator $I$. This immediately simplifies the problem.\n2.  **Correct Formula Application:** One must use the correct relationship between the density matrix and the Bloch vector, either by direct comparison with $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$ or by using the trace formulas $r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_k)$. Both methods yield the same result.\n3.  **Physical Interpretation:** The vector $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$ represents the center of the Bloch sphere. This is the geometrical location for the maximally mixed state, which has a purity of $\\text{Tr}(\\rho^2)=1/2$, the minimum possible for a qubit. States on the surface of the sphere are pure states with $|\\vec{r}|=1$.\n4.  **Option Matching:** All candidate answers correctly derive the vector $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$. The disagreement in their final letter choice is due to the multiple-choice options being listed in a different order for each instance. It is critical to match the unanimously derived mathematical result to the options provided in the original question.\n\nBased on the provided options in the question, the vector $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$ matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on the provided candidate answers and a thorough analysis of the question, here is a step-by-step reasoning and final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal**: The question asks for the \"geometrical position\" of the density matrix $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$ in the qubit space. This position is described by the Bloch vector $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Density Matrix**:\n    *   The first step is to express the density matrix in its 2x2 matrix form. The computational basis states are $|0\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $|1\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   The sum of the projectors for a complete orthonormal basis is the identity operator: $|0\\rangle\\langle0| + |1\\rangle\\langle1| = I$.\n    *   Let's verify this explicitly:\n        $|0\\rangle\\langle0| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        $|1\\rangle\\langle1| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        So, $|0\\rangle\\langle0| + |1\\rangle\\langle1| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = I$.\n    *   Substituting this result into the original expression for $\\rho$:\n        $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   This is the density matrix for the **maximally mixed state**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Bloch Vector**:\n    *   Any single-qubit density matrix can be written in terms of the identity matrix and the Pauli matrices ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$) using its Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$:\n        $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n    *   We can find the components of $\\vec{r}$ by setting our calculated $\\rho$ equal to the general form:\n        $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n    *   Multiplying both sides by 2 and subtracting $I$ yields:\n        $0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z$\n    *   Because the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, the only way for this equation to hold true is if the scalar coefficients are all zero. Therefore, $r_x = 0$, $r_y = 0$, and $r_z = 0$.\n    *   The Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Unanimous Calculation**: All 15 candidate answers correctly derive the density matrix as $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$ and correctly calculate the Bloch vector as $\\vec{r} = (0,0,0)$. The underlying physics and mathematics are universally agreed upon.\n2.  **Inconsistent Options**: The final letter choices (A, B, C, D) vary across the candidate answers. This is not due to calculation errors but rather to the fact that the multiple-choice options were presented in a different order to each agent. The correct procedure is to rely on the robustly calculated vector `(0,0,0)` and match it to the options provided in *this* specific problem.\n3.  **Physical Interpretation**: The result $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$ corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere. This is the correct location for the maximally mixed state, which represents a state of complete ignorance or equal probability of being found in any state. Pure states lie on the surface of the sphere (radius 1), while the maximally mixed state lies at the origin (radius 0).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation consistently shows that the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0,0,0)$. We match this result to the given options:\nA) r=(1,1,0)\nB) r=(1,1,1)\nC) r=(0,0,1)\nD) r=(0,0,0)\n\nThe correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nBased on an analysis of the provided answers and a step-by-step resolution of the problem, here is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Simplify the Density Matrix:** The question provides the density matrix $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$. The term inside the parentheses, $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|$, represents the sum of projection operators onto a complete orthonormal basis for a single qubit. This sum is equal to the identity operator, $I$. Therefore, the density matrix simplifies to $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$. This is the representation of the **maximally mixed state**.\n\n2.  **Relate the Density Matrix to the Bloch Vector:** Any single-qubit density matrix can be represented in the Bloch sphere using the formula:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$, where $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$ is the Bloch vector and $\\vec{\\sigma}$ is the vector of Pauli matrices. The geometrical position in qubit space is this Bloch vector, $\\vec{r}$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Bloch Vector:** We can find the components of the Bloch vector either by direct comparison or by using the trace formula.\n    *   **Method 1 (Comparison):**\n        We equate the two expressions for $\\rho$:\n        $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n        Multiplying by 2 and subtracting $I$ from both sides gives:\n        $0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z$\n        Since the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, this equation can only be true if all the coefficients are zero. Thus, $r_x=0$, $r_y=0$, and $r_z=0$.\n\n    *   **Method 2 (Trace Formula):**\n        The components are given by $r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_k)$.\n        $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = 0$\n        $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = 0$\n        $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = 0$\n        (This works because all Pauli matrices are traceless).\n\n    Both methods yield the same result: the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$. This vector corresponds to the origin (the center) of the Bloch sphere.\n\n### Careful Points:\n\n*   **Understanding the Input:** The expression $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|$ is the identity operator, a key simplification. Mistaking it for something else would lead to an incorrect matrix for $\\rho$.\n*   **Conceptual Check:** The state is a 50/50 mixture of $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$, representing complete uncertainty. Intuitively, a state of complete uncertainty should have no preferred direction, so it should be at the center of the Bloch sphere, i.e., at $(0,0,0)$. This confirms the calculation.\n*   **Analyzing the Candidate Answers:** The candidate answers unanimously agree on the mathematical result that $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$. The discrepancy in their final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) is due to the multiple-choice options being shuffled in their respective problem prompts. The correct procedure is to trust the unanimous mathematical reasoning and map it to the options provided here.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe calculated Bloch vector is $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$. Matching this to the given options:\nA) r=(0,0,1)\nB) r=(1,1,0)\nC) r=(0,0,0)\nD) r=(1,1,1)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating the reasoning from the candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The task is to find the \"geometrical position\" for the density matrix $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$. In the context of a single qubit, this means finding the corresponding Bloch vector $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Density Matrix:**\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Recognizing the Identity Operator.** The term $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|$ is the sum of projectors onto a complete orthonormal basis $\\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle\\}$.

This state corresponds to a 50% chance of being in state $|0\\rangle$ and a 50% chance of being in state $|1\\rangle$, with no coherence. Geometrically, it represents a point of complete indifference, which provides a strong intuition that it should be at the center of the Bloch sphere.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Bloch Vector ($\\vec{r}$):**\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Using the Bloch Vector Formula.** Any single-qubit density matrix can be expressed as $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$, where $\\vec{\\sigma}$ is the vector of Pauli matrices. We can solve for $\\vec{r}$ from this relation.\n    *   **Method A: Direct Comparison.**\n        We equate our simplified density matrix with the general form:\n        $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n        Multiplying by 2 and subtracting $I$ from both sides gives:\n        $0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z$\n        Since the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, this equation only holds if the coefficients $r_x, r_y, r_z$ are all zero.\n    *   **Method B: Trace Formula.**\n        The components of the Bloch vector can be found using the formula $r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_k)$.\n        $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$\n        $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$\n        $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}(1-1) = 0$\n    *   Both robust methods yield the same unambiguous result: $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n4.  **Conclusion and Matching the Answer:**\n    *   The calculation consistently shows that the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$.

Since the Pauli matrices ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$) are linearly independent, the only solution is for their coefficients to be zero. Thus, $r_x=0$, $r_y=0$, and $r_z=0$.\n    *   **Method 2 (Trace Formula):** The components can also be calculated using $r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_k)$:\n        *   $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$\n        *   $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$\n        *   $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** Both standard methods confirm that the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$.

This is standard terminology for the **Bloch vector**, denoted as $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$, which provides coordinates for the quantum state within the Bloch sphere.\n\n2.  **Express the Density Matrix in Matrix Form:** The first step, correctly performed by all candidate answers, is to convert the density matrix from Dirac notation to a standard 2x2 matrix.\n    *   In the standard computational basis, the basis vectors are $|0\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $|1\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   The term $|0\\rangle \\langle 0|+|1\\rangle \\langle 1|$ represents the sum of projectors onto a complete basis. This is a fundamental property of quantum mechanics known as the completeness relation, and it always equals the identity matrix, $I$.\n    *   Therefore, the expression simplifies directly:\n        $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** Recognizing this simplification is the fastest way to start the problem. The state $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$ is known as the **maximally mixed state**, representing complete uncertainty about the qubit's orientation.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Bloch Vector from the Density Matrix:** The relationship between a density matrix and its Bloch vector is given by the general formula:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$, where $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n\n    As shown consistently across the candidate answers, there are two excellent ways to solve for $\\vec{r}$:\n\n    *   **Method A (Direct Comparison):**\n        We equate our specific density matrix with the general formula:\n        $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n        Multiplying by 2 and subtracting $I$ from both sides leaves:\n        $0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$\n        Since the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, the only way their weighted sum can equal the zero matrix is if all the coefficients (the components of $\\vec{r}$) are zero.

This is a superficial error that stems from being presented with differently ordered lists of options. The critical observation is that the *mathematical result* of $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$ is consistent across all of them, confirming the correctness of the physical reasoning. By focusing on the correct calculation and mapping it to the specific options given in this problem, we can resolve the ambiguity.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n### Analysis of the Problem and Solutions\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating the common reasoning found in the candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points.\n\n**Step 1: Express the density matrix in its matrix form.**\n\nThe question provides the density matrix in Dirac notation: $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Understand the term $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|$.** This is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics. For any complete orthonormal basis $\\{|i\\rangle\\}$, the sum of the outer products $\\sum_i |i\\rangle\\langle i|$ is equal to the identity operator, $I$. Since $\\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle\\}$ is the standard complete orthonormal basis for a single qubit, we have:\n    $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right| = I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n*   Substituting this back into the expression for $\\rho$:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    This is the density matrix for the **maximally mixed state**. All candidate answers correctly identify this.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Bloch vector from the density matrix.**\n\nThe geometrical position in the qubit space is given by the Bloch vector $\\vec{r}=(r_x, r_y, r_z)$. The relationship between a density matrix and its Bloch vector is given by the formula:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\nwhere $\\vec{\\sigma}$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n\nThere are two common and equivalent ways to find $\\vec{r}$.\n\n*   **Method A: Direct Comparison**\n    We equate the matrix we found in Step 1 with the general form:\n    $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n    This simplifies to $I = I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$, which in turn gives:\n    $0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z$\n\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Linear Independence of Pauli Matrices.** The Pauli matrices are linearly independent. This means the only way a weighted sum of them can equal the zero matrix is if all the weights (the coefficients $r_x, r_y, r_z$) are zero. Therefore, $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n*   **Method B: Using the Trace Formula**\n    The components of the Bloch vector can be calculated directly using the formula $r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_k)$.\n    $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_x) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x)$\n    $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y)$\n    $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z)$\n\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Tracelessness of Pauli Matrices.** All Pauli matrices are \"traceless,\" meaning their trace (the sum of their diagonal elements) is zero. So, $\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = \\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = \\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = 0$.\n    *   This directly leads to $r_x=0$, $r_y=0$, and $r_z=0$. The resulting vector is again $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n**Step 3: Final Conclusion.**\n\nBoth methods unambiguously show that the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$. This vector represents the origin, or the center, of the Bloch sphere. We now match this result to the given options:\n\nA) r=(0,0,1)\nB) r=(0,0,0)\nC) r=(1,1,0)\nD) r=(1,1,1)\n\nThe calculated vector matches option B.

Simplify the Density Matrix:** The first and most critical step is to convert the density matrix from Dirac notation into its 2x2 matrix representation.\n*   In the standard computational basis, the outer products $|0\\rangle\\langle0|$ and $|1\\rangle\\langle1|$ are projectors. The sum of the projectors over a complete orthonormal basis, such as $\\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle\\}$, yields the identity matrix, $I$.\n*   Therefore: $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = I$.\n*   Substituting this into the expression for $\\rho$ gives: $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$. This state is known as the **maximally mixed state**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Bloch Vector:** Any single-qubit density matrix can be expressed in terms of the identity matrix $I$ and the Pauli matrices $\\vec{\\sigma}=(\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ via the Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n\nThere are two common ways to solve for $\\vec{r}$:\n*   **Method A: Direct Comparison.** We equate the two expressions for $\\rho$:\n    $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n    $I = I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$\n    $0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$\n    Since the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, the only solution to this equation is $r_x=r_y=r_z=0$.\n\n*   **Method B: Using the Trace Formula.** The components of the Bloch vector can be found using the formula $r_i = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_i)$.\n    $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = 0$\n    $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = 0$\n    $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = 0$\n    (This works because all Pauli matrices are traceless).\n\nBoth methods consistently yield the result $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n**4.

(Here, 0 is the 2x2 zero matrix).\n    *   The Pauli matrices $\\sigma_x$, $\\sigma_y$, and $\\sigma_z$ are linearly independent. This means that for a weighted sum of them to equal zero, all the scalar coefficients must be zero.\n    *   Therefore, $r_x = 0$, $r_y = 0$, and $r_z = 0$.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The calculated Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.

The term inside the parentheses, $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|$, represents the sum of projection operators onto a complete orthonormal basis for a single qubit. This sum is equal to the identity operator, $I$. Therefore, the density matrix simplifies to $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$. This is the representation of the **maximally mixed state**.\n\n2.  **Relate the Density Matrix to the Bloch Vector:** Any single-qubit density matrix can be represented in the Bloch sphere using the formula:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$, where $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$ is the Bloch vector and $\\vec{\\sigma}$ is the vector of Pauli matrices. The geometrical position in qubit space is this Bloch vector, $\\vec{r}$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Bloch Vector:** We can find the components of the Bloch vector either by direct comparison or by using the trace formula.\n    *   **Method 1 (Comparison):**\n        We equate the two expressions for $\\rho$:\n        $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n        Multiplying by 2 and subtracting $I$ from both sides gives:\n        $0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z$\n        Since the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, this equation can only be true if all the coefficients are zero. Thus, $r_x=0$, $r_y=0$, and $r_z=0$.\n\n    *   **Method 2 (Trace Formula):**\n        The components are given by $r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_k)$.\n        $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = 0$\n        $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = 0$\n        $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = 0$\n        (This works because all Pauli matrices are traceless).\n\n    Both methods yield the same result: the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$. This vector corresponds to the origin (the center) of the Bloch sphere.\n\n### Careful Points:\n\n*   **Understanding the Input:** The expression $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|$ is the identity operator, a key simplification. Mistaking it for something else would lead to an incorrect matrix for $\\rho$.\n*   **Conceptual Check:** The state is a 50/50 mixture of $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$, representing complete uncertainty. Intuitively, a state of complete uncertainty should have no preferred direction, so it should be at the center of the Bloch sphere, i.e., at $(0,0,0)$. This confirms the calculation.\n*   **Analyzing the Candidate Answers:** The candidate answers unanimously agree on the mathematical result that $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$. The discrepancy in their final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) is due to the multiple-choice options being shuffled in their respective problem prompts.

This is a superficial error that stems from being presented with differently ordered lists of options. The critical observation is that the *mathematical result* of $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$ is consistent across all of them, confirming the correctness of the physical reasoning. By focusing on the correct calculation and mapping it to the specific options given in this problem, we can resolve the ambiguity.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n### Analysis of the Problem and Solutions\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating the common reasoning found in the candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points.\n\n**Step 1: Express the density matrix in its matrix form.**\n\nThe question provides the density matrix in Dirac notation: $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Understand the term $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|$.** This is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics. For any complete orthonormal basis $\\{|i\\rangle\\}$, the sum of the outer products $\\sum_i |i\\rangle\\langle i|$ is equal to the identity operator, $I$. Since $\\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle\\}$ is the standard complete orthonormal basis for a single qubit, we have:\n    $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right| = I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n*   Substituting this back into the expression for $\\rho$:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    This is the density matrix for the **maximally mixed state**. All candidate answers correctly identify this.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Bloch vector from the density matrix.**\n\nThe geometrical position in the qubit space is given by the Bloch vector $\\vec{r}=(r_x, r_y, r_z)$. The relationship between a density matrix and its Bloch vector is given by the formula:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\nwhere $\\vec{\\sigma}$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n\nThere are two common and equivalent ways to find $\\vec{r}$.\n\n*   **Method A: Direct Comparison**\n    We equate the matrix we found in Step 1 with the general form:\n    $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n    This simplifies to $I = I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$, which in turn gives:\n    $0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z$\n\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Linear Independence of Pauli Matrices.** The Pauli matrices are linearly independent. This means the only way a weighted sum of them can equal the zero matrix is if all the weights (the coefficients $r_x, r_y, r_z$) are zero. Therefore, $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n*   **Method B: Using the Trace Formula**\n    The components of the Bloch vector can be calculated directly using the formula $r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_k)$.\n    $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_x) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x)$\n    $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y)$\n    $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z)$\n\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Tracelessness of Pauli Matrices.** All Pauli matrices are \"traceless,\" meaning their trace (the sum of their diagonal elements) is zero. So, $\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = \\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = \\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = 0$.\n    *   This directly leads to $r_x=0$, $r_y=0$, and $r_z=0$. The resulting vector is again $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n**Step 3: Final Conclusion.**\n\nBoth methods unambiguously show that the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$. This vector represents the origin, or the center, of the Bloch sphere. We now match this result to the given options:\n\nA) r=(0,0,1)\nB) r=(0,0,0)\nC) r=(1,1,0)\nD) r=(1,1,1)\n\nThe calculated vector matches option B. The discrepancies in the final letter chosen by the various agents are due to different orderings of the multiple-choice options they were presented with, but their mathematical reasoning is consistent and correct.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution and the careful points to consider.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the \"geometrical position in the qubits space\" for the density matrix $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$. This position is represented by the Bloch vector $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$.\n\n**2. Simplify the Density Matrix:** The first and most critical step is to convert the density matrix from Dirac notation into its 2x2 matrix representation.\n*   In the standard computational basis, the outer products $|0\\rangle\\langle0|$ and $|1\\rangle\\langle1|$ are projectors. The sum of the projectors over a complete orthonormal basis, such as $\\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle\\}$, yields the identity matrix, $I$.\n*   Therefore: $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = I$.\n*   Substituting this into the expression for $\\rho$ gives: $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$. This state is known as the **maximally mixed state**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Bloch Vector:** Any single-qubit density matrix can be expressed in terms of the identity matrix $I$ and the Pauli matrices $\\vec{\\sigma}=(\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ via the Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n\nThere are two common ways to solve for $\\vec{r}$:\n*   **Method A: Direct Comparison.** We equate the two expressions for $\\rho$:\n    $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n    $I = I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$\n    $0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$\n    Since the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, the only solution to this equation is $r_x=r_y=r_z=0$.\n\n*   **Method B: Using the Trace Formula.** The components of the Bloch vector can be found using the formula $r_i = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_i)$.\n    $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = 0$\n    $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = 0$\n    $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = 0$\n    (This works because all Pauli matrices are traceless).\n\nBoth methods consistently yield the result $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n**4. Conclusion:** The geometrical position of the given density matrix in the Bloch sphere is the vector $(0, 0, 0)$. This point is the origin or center of the sphere. Matching this result with the provided options:\nA) r=(0,0,1)\nB) r=(1,1,1)\nC) r=(0,0,0)\nD) r=(1,1,0)\n\nThe calculated vector matches option C.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Understanding the Notation:** It is crucial to recognize that $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|$ is the identity operator, $I$. This greatly simplifies the initial expression.\n*   **Bloch Sphere Representation:** Knowing the general formula $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$ is fundamental to connect the density matrix formalism with the geometrical picture of the Bloch sphere.\n*   **Mathematical Consistency:** The reasoning in all candidate answers is remarkably consistent. They all correctly derive that the density matrix is $\\frac{1}{2}I$ and that the corresponding Bloch vector is $(0, 0, 0)$.\n*   **Option Matching:** The only source of discrepancy among the candidate answers is the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D). This is an artifact of those agents being presented with the options in a different order. The correct procedure is to perform the calculation independently and then map the correct mathematical result to the list of options provided in the specific question prompt, as done above.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThe question asks for the geometrical position, represented by the Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$, of the density matrix $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$.\n\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a unanimous consensus on the calculation, despite differing final letter choices due to inconsistent option ordering. Here is a consolidated, step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Simplify the Density Matrix:** The first step is to express the density matrix in its 2x2 matrix form.\n    *   In the standard computational basis, the outer products $|0\\rangle\\langle0|$ and $|1\\rangle\\langle1|$ are projectors onto the basis states.\n    *   The term $|0\\rangle\\langle0| + |1\\rangle\\langle1|$ is a sum over a complete orthonormal basis, which forms the identity operator, $I$.\n    *   Thus, the density matrix simplifies to $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   **Careful Point 1**: Recognizing that the state is the **maximally mixed state** ($\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$) is the key insight.\n\n2.  **Relate Density Matrix to Bloch Vector:** Any single-qubit density matrix can be written in terms of the identity matrix $I$ and the Pauli matrices $\\vec{\\sigma}=(\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ using the Bloch vector $\\vec{r}=(r_x, r_y, r_z)$.\n    *   The general formula is: $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$.\n    *   **Careful Point 2**: This formula provides the fundamental connection between the algebraic representation ($\\rho$) and the geometric representation ($\\vec{r}$).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Bloch Vector:** We can now solve for $\\vec{r}$ by equating the specific form of our density matrix with the general formula.\n    *   $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n    *   Multiplying both sides by 2 and then subtracting $I$ gives: $0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$.\n    *   **Careful Point 3**: Since the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, the only way for their weighted sum to be the zero matrix is if all the coefficients ($r_x, r_y, r_z$) are themselves zero.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Both methods used by the candidate answers (direct comparison and the trace formula $r_i = \\text{Tr}(\\rho\\sigma_i)$) correctly and unanimously conclude that the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r}=(0, 0, 0)$.

The disagreements in the candidate answers' final letter choice stem from variations in how the options were listed for them, not from any error in their calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the careful points identified from the candidate answers.\n\n### **Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The question asks for the \"geometrical position in the qubits space\" for the density matrix $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$. This is a standard way of asking for the Bloch vector $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$ associated with the state $\\rho$.\n\n2.  **Express the Density Matrix in Matrix Form:**\n    *   The first step is to represent the components in the standard computational basis, where $|0\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $|1\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   The term $|0\\rangle\\langle0| + |1\\rangle\\langle1|$ is the sum of the projectors onto the basis states.\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** One must correctly recognize that for a complete orthonormal basis $\\{|i\\rangle\\}$, the sum of the projectors $\\sum_i |i\\rangle\\langle i|$ is equal to the identity operator $I$.\n    *   Therefore, $|0\\rangle\\langle0| + |1\\rangle\\langle1| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = I$.\n    *   Substituting this result into the original expression for $\\rho$, we get:\n        $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   This state is known as the **maximally mixed state**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Bloch Vector:**\n    *   Any single-qubit density matrix can be written as $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$, where $\\vec{\\sigma}$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.

The Bloch vector provides coordinates for a qubit's state within a 3D space known as the Bloch sphere.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n1.  **Simplify the Density Matrix:** The first step is to simplify the expression for the density matrix $\\rho$.\n    *   The term $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|$ is a sum of projection operators onto the complete orthonormal basis $\\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle\\}$. For any complete orthonormal basis, this sum is equal to the identity operator, $I$.\n    *   In matrix form, $|0\\rangle\\langle0| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $|1\\rangle\\langle1| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Their sum is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = I$.\n    *   Therefore, the density matrix simplifies to $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$. This is the representation of the **maximally mixed state**.\n\n2.  **Relate Density Matrix to Bloch Vector:** Any single-qubit density matrix can be uniquely expressed in terms of the identity matrix $I$, the Pauli matrices $\\vec{\\sigma}=(\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$, and the Bloch vector $\\vec{r}=(r_x, r_y, r_z)$ using the formula:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Bloch Vector:** We can now find $\\vec{r}$ by equating the two expressions we have for $\\rho$.\n    *   From Step 1: $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$\n    *   From Step 2: $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n    *   Setting them equal: $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n    *   Multiplying both sides by 2 and subtracting $I$ gives: $0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$. (Here, 0 is the 2x2 zero matrix).\n    *   The Pauli matrices $\\sigma_x$, $\\sigma_y$, and $\\sigma_z$ are linearly independent. This means that for a weighted sum of them to equal zero, all the scalar coefficients must be zero.\n    *   Therefore, $r_x = 0$, $r_y = 0$, and $r_z = 0$.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The calculated Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.

This state is known as the **maximally mixed state**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Bloch Vector from the Density Matrix:**\n    The relationship between a single-qubit density matrix $\\rho$ and its Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$ is given by the formula:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$, where $\\vec{\\sigma}$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n\n    Two common methods can be used to find $\\vec{r}$:\n\n    *   **Method 1: Direct Comparison.** We set our calculated density matrix equal to the general form:\n        $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n        Multiplying both sides by 2 and subtracting $I$ yields:\n        $0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$ (where 0 is the zero matrix).\n        Since the Pauli matrices ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$) are linearly independent, the only way for their linear combination to be zero is if all scalar coefficients are zero. Thus, $r_x=0$, $r_y=0$, and $r_z=0$.\n\n    *   **Method 2: Using the Trace Formula.** The components of the Bloch vector can be found using the formula $r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_k)$.\n        $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_x) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$.\n        $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_y) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$.\n        $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_z) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$.\n\n    Both methods lead to the same result: $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n4.  **Match with Options:**\n    The calculated Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$. We compare this with the provided options:\n    A) r=(1,1,0)\n    B) r=(0,0,1)\n    C) r=(1,1,1)\n    D) r=(0,0,0)\n    The result matches option D.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Recognizing the Maximally Mixed State:** The density matrix $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$ is the maximally mixed state. By definition, this state represents complete uncertainty and has no preferred direction. Geometrically, it lies at the very center (the origin) of the Bloch sphere, which immediately implies its Bloch vector is $(0, 0, 0)$. Recognizing this provides a direct path to the answer.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Linear Independence of Pauli Matrices:** The conclusion that $\\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = 0$ implies $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$ relies on the fact that the Pauli matrices are linearly independent and form a basis (along with the identity matrix) for the space of 2x2 Hermitian matrices. This is a fundamental concept in quantum computing.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Tracelessness of Pauli Matrices:** The trace formula method is efficient because all Pauli matrices are traceless (their trace is 0). This property simplifies the calculation significantly.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Analyzing Candidate Answer Inconsistencies:** All provided candidate answers correctly calculate the Bloch vector to be $(0, 0, 0)$. The discrepancies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, D) are a result of them being presented with differently ordered multiple-choice options. The core mathematical conclusion is unanimous, confirming the result is robust. The final answer must be based on the options provided in the prompt, not the letter choices from the candidates.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
