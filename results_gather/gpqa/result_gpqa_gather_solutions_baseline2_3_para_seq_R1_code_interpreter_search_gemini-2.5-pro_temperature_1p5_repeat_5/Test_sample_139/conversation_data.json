Deconstruct the Chemical Clues**\n\n*   **Substance B and the Heavier Isotope:** The primary clue is the melting point of substance B, which is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   **Conversion:** 277 K is equivalent to 3.85 °C (277 - 273.15).\n    *   **Identification:** This value is almost identical to the known melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). Normal water (H₂O) melts at 0 °C. This makes it almost certain that **Substance B is D₂O**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The \"heavier isotope\" central to the problem is Deuterium (D or ²H), an isotope of hydrogen.\n\n*   **Gas W:** The molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   **Analysis:** In the context of a reaction involving deuterium, the most plausible gas is deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   A single deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   A D₂ molecule, therefore, has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This perfectly matches the clue.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n*   **Substance X and the Overall Reaction:** We must now identify substance X using its chemical reactivity.\n    *   **Reactants and Products:** X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate (G). G releases D₂O (B) when heated. This chain implies the entire system is deuterated. Therefore, the liquid **Y must be D₂O**.\n    *   **Organic Chemistry Clue:** X reacts with a keto acid (containing at least 3 oxygen atoms) to produce a compound with only 2 oxygen atoms. This means the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in the keto acid was reduced to an alcohol group (-CH₂OH), a reaction that requires a very powerful reducing agent.\n    *   **Identifying the Analog:** Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) is a famous, powerful reducing agent capable of this transformation, whereas milder agents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) are not. The clue states X's \"very close analog is used as a reagent\", pointing to LiAlH₄.\n    *   **Identifying X:** Since X contains the heavier isotope deuterium, **Substance X must be Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**2. Verify the Complete Picture**\nThe full reaction is `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑`.\n*   This reaction is known to be violent.\n*   It produces D₂ gas (W).\n*   It forms a gelatinous precipitate, Aluminium deuteroxide (G), since Al(OH)₃ is insoluble.\n*   Heating G (`2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`) correctly releases D₂O (B).\n*   The identification of X as LiAlD₄ is consistent with all the facts provided.\n\n**3. Perform the Final Calculation**\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements Present:** Hydrogen (H, Z=1), Lithium (Li, Z=3), and Aluminium (Al, Z=13).\n*   **Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** Based on atomic number, the lightest element is Hydrogen and the heaviest element is Aluminium.\n*   **Sum the Masses:** We must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using their specific isotopic mass numbers (which are integers).\n    *   The isotope of Hydrogen is Deuterium (D, or ²H), which has a mass number of **2**. There are **four** D atoms in the formula.\n    *   The stable isotope of Aluminium is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of **27**. There is **one** Al atom.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Total mass from Aluminium = 1 × 27 = 27\n    *   Total mass from Hydrogen (as Deuterium) = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Cumulative Sum = 27 + 8 = 35**\n\n**4. Final Answer Selection**\nThe calculated value is 35. This value matches one of the options.\n\nA) 25\nB) 31\nC) 35\nD) 29\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the final answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance B and the Heavy Isotope**\nThe first key clue is that substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   To analyze this, we convert the temperature from Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier isotope of hydrogen called deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C.\n*   The value of 3.85 °C is an almost perfect match for heavy water. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**, and the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is **Deuterium (D or ²H)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Gas W**\nThe gas W released during the reaction has molecules containing an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n*   Given that the reaction involves deuterium, the most plausible candidate is deuterium gas, D₂.\n*   A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n*   Therefore, a molecule of D₂ gas has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, which perfectly fits the description. Thus, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Substance X using all clues**\n*   **Clue from organic chemistry:** Substance X (or its \"very close analog\") is a common organic reagent that can reduce a keto acid to a product with 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid (e.g., containing R-C(=O)-COOH) has at least 3 oxygen atoms. Reducing both the ketone and the carboxylic acid to alcohol groups results in a diol (with 2 oxygen atoms). This reduction requires a very powerful agent. Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) is the canonical reagent for this transformation; milder agents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) cannot reduce the carboxylic acid. Therefore, the analog is LiAlH₄.\n*   Since Substance X contains the heavy isotope deuterium, we can deduce that **Substance X is Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n*   **Verification with reaction clues:** Let's test the reaction of LiAlD₄ with liquid Y. For the products to be fully deuterated (D₂ gas and a precipitate G that yields D₂O), the liquid Y must be heavy water (D₂O).\n    *   The reaction is: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G) + LiOD + 4 D₂ (W)`\n    *   This reaction is famously violent.\n    *   It produces D₂ gas (W).\n    *   It produces a gelatinous precipitate, Aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), which matches the description of G.\n    *   When heated, Al(OD)₃ decomposes to Al₂O₃ and D₂O (Substance B).\n    *   All clues are consistent with this identification.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Final Calculation**\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic mass of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n*   **Identify Elements:** The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, Atomic Number Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n*   **Identify Lightest and Heaviest:** The lightest element by atomic number is Hydrogen. The heaviest element is Aluminium.\n*   **Sum Masses:** We need to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using the mass numbers for their specific isotopes.\n    *   The isotope of hydrogen is Deuterium (²H), which has a mass number of **2**. The formula has **four** deuterium atoms.\n    *   The stable isotope of aluminium is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of **27**. The formula has **one** aluminium atom.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Total mass from Aluminium = 1 × 27 = 27\n    *   Total mass from Hydrogen (as Deuterium) = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   Cumulative Sum = 27 + 8 = **35**.\n\n**Step 5: Select the Final Answer**\nThe calculated value is 35. We compare this to the options provided:\nA) 25\nB) 29\nC) 35\nD) 31\n\nThe calculated value of 35 matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identification of the Chemical Substances**\n\n*   **Substance B and the \"Heavier Isotope\"**: The first key clue is that substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Converting this to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 K = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C.\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D or ²H), is 3.82 °C.\n    *   The given value is an almost exact match for heavy water. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**, and the heavier isotope involved is **Deuterium (D)**.\n\n*   **Gas W**: The gas W, produced in the reaction, has molecules with an equal number of protons and neutrons.\n    *   Given the presence of deuterium, we consider deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   A D₂ molecule therefore has a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This perfectly fits the description. Thus, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n*   **Substance X and the Organic Chemistry Reaction**:\n    *   We are told X (or its \"very close analog\") is a common organic reagent. The reaction of X with a keto acid results in a product with only 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   A keto acid has both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), meaning it has at least 3 oxygen atoms. To reduce the oxygen count to 2, the carboxylic acid group must be reduced to a primary alcohol group (-COOH → -CH₂OH).\n    *   This specific reduction requires a very powerful reducing agent. A common reagent capable of this is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Milder reagents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) cannot perform this transformation.\n    *   Therefore, the \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄. Since Substance X contains the deuterium isotope, **Substance X must be Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n*   **Verification of the Reaction Sequence**:\n    *   The overall reaction would be between X (LiAlD₄) and a deuterated liquid Y, which must be D₂O to produce the observed products.\n    *   **Reaction**: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑`\n    *   This reaction is famously violent, releases D₂ gas (W), and produces a precipitate, Aluminum Deuteroxide (G).\n    *   When the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) is heated, it decomposes to release B (D₂O): `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`.\n    *   All clues align perfectly with this identification.\n\n**2. Performing the Final Calculation**\n\n*   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   The elements present, ordered by atomic number, are Hydrogen (Z=1), Lithium (Z=3), and Aluminium (Z=13).\n*   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Heaviest element:** Aluminium (Al).\n*   We must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecule, using their integer mass numbers (as implied by the integer answer choices).\n    *   The isotope of Hydrogen is Deuterium (²H), which has a mass number of **2**. There are four D atoms.\n    *   The stable isotope of Aluminium is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of **27**. There is one Al atom.\n*   **Calculation**:\n    *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium) = 1 × 27 = 27\n    *   Total mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium) = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Cumulative Sum = 27 + 8 = 35**\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe logical reasoning overwhelmingly supports a calculated value of 35. Matching this value against the provided options:\nA) 25\nB) 31\nC) 35\nD) 29\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct reasoning from the provided candidate answers to determine the final, correct choice.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues and Identify the Key Substances\n\n1.  **Substance B and the \"Heavier Isotope\"**: The primary clue is the melting point of substance B, which is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 K = 3.85 °C.\n    *   This temperature is nearly identical to the melting point of heavy water (**D₂O**), which is 3.82 °C. It is distinctly different from normal water (H₂O), which melts at 0 °C.\n    *   This allows us to confidently identify **Substance B as D₂O**. This also establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is **Deuterium (D)**, an isotope of hydrogen. This reasoning was a unanimous consensus across all candidate answers.\n\n2.  **Gas W**: The gas W is described as having molecules with an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   Given the established presence of Deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron), the gas **D₂** is the most logical candidate. A D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the description. This was also a unanimous finding.\n\n3.  **Substance X and Its Analog**: Several clues point to the identity of X:\n    *   **Organic Chemistry Use**: X or its analog is a common organic reagent. It can reduce a \"keto acid\" to a product containing only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (one in the ketone >C=O, and two in the carboxylic acid -COOH). For the product to have only 2 oxygens, the carboxylic acid group must be reduced to a primary alcohol group (-COOH → -CH₂OH).\n    *   **Reagent Identity**: This specific reduction requires a powerful reducing agent. Lithium Aluminium Hydride (**LiAlH₄**) is famous for this capability, whereas a milder agent like sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is not strong enough. This strongly suggests the analog is LiAlH₄.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Since Substance X contains Deuterium, it must be the deuterated version of LiAlH₄, which is **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n4.  **Verifying the Entire Reaction Sequence**: Let's confirm LiAlD₄ fits all remaining clues.\n    *   `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G) + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)`\n    *   This reaction is known to be violent.\n    *   The liquid reactant, Y, would be heavy water (D₂O).\n    *   The gas product, W, is D₂.\n    *   A precipitate, G, is formed. Aluminium deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, is insoluble and would precipitate.\n    *   When the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) is heated, it decomposes to Al₂O₃ and D₂O (Substance B).\n    *   All clues are consistent and point to **X = LiAlD₄**.\n\n### Step 2: Perform the Required Calculation\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n\n*   **Substance X**: LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements Present**: Lithium (Li, Atomic Number 3), Aluminium (Al, Atomic Number 13), and Hydrogen (H, Atomic Number 1).\n*   **Lightest Element**: Hydrogen (present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Heaviest Element**: Aluminium (Al).\n*   **Mass Summation**: The question requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements, using their integer isotopic mass numbers.\n    *   Mass of the four atoms of the lightest element (Deuterium, ²H): 4 × 2 = **8**\n    *   Mass of the one atom of the heaviest element (Aluminium, ²⁷Al): 1 × 27 = **27**\n*   **Cumulative Mass**: 8 + 27 = **35**\n\n### Step 3: Final Answer Selection\n\nThe universally agreed-upon calculation yields a result of **35**. The candidate answers showed discrepancies in their final letter choice due to different option mappings in their individual contexts. However, the reasoning is unanimously sound.\n\nMatching our result of 35 with the options provided in the main question:\nA) 35\nB) 31\nC) 25\nD) 29\n\nThe calculated value of 35 corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the candidate responses.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct and Analyze the Chemical Clues**\nThe first step is to systematically identify the unknown substances (X, Y, W, G, B) using the provided clues. This process was followed correctly by all the successful agents.\n\n*   **Clue about Substance B:** The melting point of B is \"very close to 277 K\". Converting to Celsius (277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C), this value is a nearly perfect match for the melting point of **heavy water (D₂O)**, which is 3.82 °C. This is a very strong initial clue. It establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is **Deuterium (D)**.\n*   **Clue about Gas W:** The molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Given the context of Deuterium, the most logical candidate is **di-deuterium gas (D₂)**. A Deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so the D₂ molecule has a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fulfilling the condition.\n*   **Clue about the Reaction and Precipitate G:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G. Since the products are deuterated, the reacting liquid **Y must also be D₂O**. The precipitate G releases B (D₂O) upon heating, which is characteristic of a metal deuteroxide (M(OD)n) decomposing into a metal oxide and D₂O.\n*   **Organic Chemistry Clues to Identify X:**\n    1.  The analog of X is a common organic reagent. This points towards a known reducing agent.\n    2.  X reduces a \"certain keto acid\" to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (one in the ketone >C=O group, two in the carboxylic acid -COOH group). For the product to have only 2 oxygen atoms, the carboxylic acid group must be reduced to an alcohol group (-COOH → -CH₂OH).\n    3.  This specific reduction requires a powerful reducing agent. **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)** is a classic example of a reagent that can perform this transformation, while weaker reagents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) cannot.\n    4.  Therefore, the \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄, and Substance X, which contains deuterium, must be **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**Step 2: Verify the Complete Reaction Chemistry**\nLet's confirm that X = LiAlD₄ fits all the clues:\n*   The reaction `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD(aq) + 4D₂(g) (W)↑` is known to be violent.\n*   It correctly produces D₂ gas (W) and an insoluble precipitate, Aluminium deuteroxide, G.\n*   When heated, G (Al(OD)₃) decomposes to produce D₂O (B).\n*   The identification of X as LiAlD₄ is consistent with all pieces of information provided.\n\n**Step 3: Perform the Final Calculation**\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n*   The constituent elements are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n*   The **lightest element** (by atomic number) is Hydrogen.\n*   The **heaviest element** (by atomic number) is Aluminium.\n*   We must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved (as implied by the integer answer choices).\n    *   The isotope of hydrogen present is Deuterium (D or ²H), which has a mass number of **2**. There are **four** Deuterium atoms.\n    *   The stable isotope of aluminium is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of **27**. There is **one** Aluminium atom.\n*   Calculation:\n    *   Total mass from Aluminium = 1 × 27 = 27\n    *   Total mass from Hydrogen (as Deuterium) = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Cumulative Sum = 27 + 8 = 35**\n\n**Step 4: Final Decision**\nThe step-by-step chemical reasoning, consistently followed by the candidate answers, leads to a definitive calculated value of 35. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) 35\nB) 29\nC) 25\nD) 31\n\nThe calculated value of 35 matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided candidate answers, a clear and consistent logical path emerges. The core of the problem involves two main stages: identifying the unknown chemical substances and then performing the specified calculation.\n\n### Analysis of the Reasoning\n\n**1. Identification of Substances**\n\n*   **Consensus on Substance B and the Isotope:** There is a unanimous agreement among all candidate answers. The melting point of Substance B being \"very close to 277 K\" (which is 3.85 °C) is correctly identified as a near-perfect match for the melting point of **D₂O (heavy water)**, which is 3.82 °C. This key insight establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is **Deuterium (D, or ²H)**.\n*   **Consensus on Gas W:** All candidate answers correctly deduce that Gas W, with molecules having an equal number of protons and neutrons, must be **D₂ gas**. A Deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so the D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description perfectly within the established chemical context.\n*   **Consensus on Substance X:** The identification of Substance X is more complex but is also reached unanimously through logical deduction across all candidates.\n    *   **The Keto Acid Clue:** The reduction of a keto acid (with ≥3 oxygen atoms) to a product with 2 oxygen atoms requires a very powerful reducing agent, as it involves the reduction of a carboxylic acid group. This points to the \"analog\" being **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)**, a well-known strong reducing agent, and rules out milder ones like NaBH₄.\n    *   **The Precipitation Clue:** Since Substance X contains deuterium, it must be the deuterated version of the analog, which is **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. The violent reaction with liquid Y (identified as D₂O) produces a precipitate G: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑`. The formation of the Aluminium deuteroxide precipitate (G) is consistent with the clues.\n    *   All chemical properties described in the problem point conclusively to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n**2. The Calculation**\n\n*   **The Task:** The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n*   **Identifying the Elements:** The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (H, present as its isotope Deuterium, D). By atomic number, Hydrogen is the lightest, and Aluminium is the heaviest.\n*   **Consensus on Calculation:** All candidate answers correctly perform the same calculation, using the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved (²H for Deuterium and ²⁷Al for Aluminium), as is standard for such problems with integer answer choices.\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium): 1 atom × 27 amu/atom = **27**\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen, as Deuterium): 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = **8**\n    *   Cumulative Sum: 27 + 8 = **35**\n\n**3. Conclusion and Final Answer**\n\nThe reasoning and the final numerical result are exceptionally consistent across all provided answers. Every logical step points to the identities X = LiAlD₄ and a calculated mass sum of 35. The only variation among the candidate answers is the final letter choice, which is due to the options being presented in a different order to each agent.\n\nBased on the definitive calculation of 35, and comparing this to the options provided in the question:\nA) 31\nB) 29\nC) 25\nD) 35\n\nThe correct answer is 35, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the consensus logic from the provided candidate answers.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**\nThe first critical clue is that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   Convert Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n*   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium, is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n*   The given value is an almost perfect match for heavy water. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**. This also establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is **Deuterium (D)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Gas W**\nThe gas W, released in the reaction, has molecules with \"the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n*   Given that the reaction involves deuterium, the most plausible candidate is deuterium gas (D₂).\n*   A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n*   Therefore, a molecule of D₂ gas has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the clue. Thus, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Substance X**\nA combination of chemical and organic chemistry clues points to the identity of X.\n*   **The Reaction:** Substance X reacts violently with a liquid Y to produce D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate (G). Since the products are deuterated, the liquid Y must also be a source of deuterium, making **Y = D₂O**.\n*   **Organic Chemistry Clues:**\n    1.  X's \"very close analog\" is a common organic reagent. This suggests reagents like LiAlH₄ or NaBH₄, meaning X could be LiAlD₄ or NaBD₄.\n    2.  X reduces a \"keto acid\" to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (one in the ketone >C=O group, two in the carboxylic acid -COOH group). To get to a 2-oxygen product, the carboxylic acid group must be reduced to an alcohol (-CH₂OH), a reaction that requires a powerful reducing agent.\n    3.  Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) is a famous powerful reducing agent capable of this; Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) is not.\n*   **Conclusion:** The analog is LiAlH₄, so substance X must be its deuterated version, **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. This is confirmed by its reaction with D₂O (`LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → Al(OD)₃↓ + LiOD + 4D₂↑`), which produces a precipitate (G = Al(OD)₃) and D₂ gas (W), as described.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Final Calculation**\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n*   The elements present, ordered by atomic number, are Hydrogen (Z=1), Lithium (Z=3), and Aluminium (Z=13).\n*   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n*   The **heaviest element** is Aluminium.\n*   The question requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using the mass numbers for the specific isotopes present.\n    *   The isotope of Hydrogen is Deuterium (D or ²H), which has a mass number of **2**.\n    *   The stable isotope of Aluminium is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of **27**.\n*   The calculation is:\n    *   Mass from lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium): 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = 8\n    *   Mass from heaviest element (Aluminium): 1 atom × 27 amu/atom = 27\n    *   **Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35**\n\n**Step 5: Match the Result to the Options**\nThe calculated value is 35.

Identification of Key Substances from Physical and Chemical Clues**\n\n*   **Substance B and the Heavier Isotope:** The primary clue is the melting point of substance B, which is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   **Conversion:** 277 Kelvin = 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   **Comparison:** This value is significantly different from the melting point of normal water (H₂O) at 0 °C but is an excellent match for the melting point of **heavy water (D₂O)**, which is 3.82 °C.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This identifies substance B as D₂O and reveals that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is **Deuterium (D, or ²H)**.\n\n*   **Gas W:** The molecule of gas W is described as having \"the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** Given the confirmed presence of Deuterium (which has 1 proton and 1 neutron), the most logical candidate for gas W is **D₂ gas**.

A keto acid contains at least 3 oxygen atoms (one in a ketone group >C=O and two in a carboxylic acid group -COOH). To reduce the oxygen count to 2, the carboxylic acid must be reduced to an alcohol (-COOH → -CH₂OH). This powerful reduction is characteristic of a strong reducing agent like **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)**. Milder agents like sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) cannot perform this specific reduction.\n    *   **Conclusion on X:** The \"close analog\" is LiAlH₄. Since substance X contains Deuterium, it must be **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**2. Verification of the Proposed Reaction Scheme**\n\n*   With the identities established (X = LiAlD₄, Y = D₂O, W = D₂, G = a precipitate, B = D₂O), the reaction can be written:\n    `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD (soluble) + 4 D₂ (W)↑`\n*   This reaction aligns with all the clues:\n    1.  It is known to be violent.\n    2.  It produces D₂ gas (W).\n    3.  It forms a precipitate (G), Aluminium deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃.\n    4.  Heating the precipitate (`2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`) would release heavy water (B), which has a melting point near 277 K.\n\n**3.

Identification of Key Substances from Chemical Clues**\n\n*   **Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**: The primary clue is the melting point of substance B, \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 K = 3.85 °C.\n    *   This temperature is an excellent match for the melting point of **heavy water (D₂O)**, which is 3.82 °C. It is significantly different from the melting point of normal water (H₂O) at 0 °C.\n    *   This establishes that **Substance B is D₂O**, and the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is **Deuterium (D or ²H)**.\n\n*   **Gas W**: Gas W is a product of the reaction, and its molecules contain \"the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n    *   Given that the system contains Deuterium, the most plausible candidate is **Deuterium gas (D₂)**.\n    *   A single Deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule therefore has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the description.\n\n*   **Substance X and Associated Reaction**:\n    *   The \"close analog\" of X is a common organic chemistry reagent, and X itself is potent enough to reduce a \"certain keto acid\" to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid contains a minimum of 3 oxygen atoms (one in a ketone group, >C=O, and two in a carboxylic acid group, -COOH). Reducing this to a product with 2 oxygen atoms requires the reduction of the carboxylic acid group (-COOH → -CH₂OH), a reaction that only very strong reducing agents can accomplish.\n    *   This points to the analog being **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)**, not the weaker Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄).\n    *   Since X contains the isotope Deuterium, **Substance X must be Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   This identification is confirmed by the other clues:\n        *   The reaction `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑` is famously violent.\n        *   It produces D₂ gas (W).\n        *   It forms a precipitate, **Aluminium deuteroxide (G)**.\n        *   Heating G (`Al(OD)₃`) would cause it to decompose, releasing D₂O (B).

The consensus on the core reasoning is remarkably strong and accurate across all candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B and the Isotope:** The initial clue states that Substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   277 Kelvin converts to 3.85 °C (by subtracting 273.15).\n    *   This is almost identical to the known melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C, and significantly different from that of normal water (H₂O), which is 0 °C.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Substance B is D₂O. This establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is Deuterium (D or ²H).\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The clue for gas W is that its molecule contains \"the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n    *   Given the established context of Deuterium, the most logical candidate is Deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   A single Deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   Therefore, a D₂ molecule has a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the description.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Gas W is D₂.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X:** Several powerful clues point to the identity of Substance X.\n    *   **Organic Chemistry Context:** X's \"very close analog\" is a common organic reagent, and X can reduce a \"certain keto acid\" to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid contains at least 3 oxygen atoms (in the ketone and carboxylic acid groups). Reducing the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH) removes one oxygen atom. This powerful reduction requires a strong agent like Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄), as milder agents (like NaBH₄) are insufficient.\n    *   **Conclusion about X:** The analog is LiAlH₄. Therefore, Substance X, its deuterated counterpart, must be **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n4.  **Verify the Entire Reaction:** The reaction scheme is `X + Y → W + G`.\n    *   With X = LiAlD₄ and W = D₂, the liquid reactant Y must also be a source of deuterium, confirming **Y = D₂O**.\n    *   The reaction is `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑`.\n    *   This reaction is famously violent. It produces a precipitate (G), Aluminium deuteroxide, which when heated (`2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`) correctly releases Substance B (D₂O). All conditions are satisfied.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   **Elements present:** Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n*   **Lightest element (by atomic number):** Hydrogen.\n*   **Heaviest element (by atomic number):** Aluminium.\n*   **Calculation:** We sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved (²H and ²⁷Al), as implied by the integer answer choices.\n    *   Mass from lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium): 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = 8 amu.\n    *   Mass from heaviest element (Aluminium): 1 atom × 27 amu/atom = 27 amu.\n*   **Cumulative Sum:** 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35.

Deconstruct the Clues to Identify the Substances**\n\n*   **Clue 1: Substance B's Melting Point**\n    The problem states that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\". Converting this to Celsius gives 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. This temperature is significantly different from the melting point of normal water (H₂O) at 0 °C, but it is an almost perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (**D₂O**), which is 3.82 °C. This is the crucial starting point, correctly identified by all candidate answers. This also establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is Deuterium (D or ²H).\n\n*   **Clue 2: Gas W's Composition**\n    Gas W is described as having molecules with an equal number of protons and neutrons. Given that the system contains Deuterium, the most logical candidate is di-deuterium gas, **D₂**. Each Deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so the D₂ molecule has a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the clue.\n\n*   **Clue 3: The Organic Chemistry Reaction**\n    Substance X or its \"very close analog\" is a common organic reagent. It can react with a keto acid (which contains at least 3 oxygen atoms) to produce a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. This means the reagent must be powerful enough to reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), which removes one oxygen atom. Among common laboratory reagents, Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) is famous for this capability, whereas milder reagents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) are not. Therefore, the \"analog\" is LiAlH₄. Since Substance X contains the heavy isotope Deuterium, **Substance X must be Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n*   **Clue 4: Verifying the Full Reaction**\n    Let's check if X = LiAlD₄ fits the remaining clues. It reacts violently with a liquid Y to form gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G, which upon heating yields B (D₂O).\n    The reaction is: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD (soluble) + 4D₂ (W)↑`.\n    *   The liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O).\n    *   The reaction is known to be violent.\n    *   Gas W (D₂) is produced.\n    *   A precipitate G, Aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), is formed.\n    *   Heating the precipitate G (`2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`) correctly releases B (D₂O).\n    All clues are perfectly consistent with X being LiAlD₄.\n\n**2. Perform the Final Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements:** Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n*   **Lightest element (by atomic number):** Hydrogen.\n*   **Heaviest element (by atomic number):** Aluminium.\n*   **The calculation**: Sum the mass numbers of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the formula.\n    *   Mass from Hydrogen: The isotope is Deuterium (D or ²H), which has a mass number of 2. There are four D atoms in the formula.\n        Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   Mass from Aluminium: The stable isotope is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27. There is one Al atom in the formula.\n        Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27\n*   **Cumulative Mass:** 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n**3.

The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier isotope of hydrogen (Deuterium, D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is an almost perfect match. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**, and the \"heavier isotope\" is **Deuterium (D or ²H)**.\n\n*   **Gas W:** The molecule of gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons.\n    *   Given that the system contains Deuterium, the most logical candidate for the gas is di-deuterium gas, **D₂**.\n    *   Each Deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Thus, a D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, which perfectly matches the clue.\n\n*   **Substance X and the Organic Reaction:**\n    1.  Substance X's \"very close analog\" is a common organic chemistry reagent.\n    2.  The product of its reaction with a \"keto acid\" has 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid possesses both a ketone group (R-CO-R') and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), meaning it starts with at least 3 oxygen atoms. For the product to have only 2 oxygen atoms, the carboxylic acid group must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-COOH → -CH₂OH).\n    3.  This reduction requires a powerful reagent. A common and powerful reducing agent is **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)**. Milder agents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) cannot perform this reduction.\n    4.  Therefore, the analog is LiAlH₄, and since substance X contains deuterium, **X must be Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**2. Verify the Complete Reaction Chemistry**\n\n*   With X identified as LiAlD₄ and the system being deuterated, the violent reaction is with liquid Y, which must be D₂O.\n*   The reaction is: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑`.\n*   This reaction is indeed violent.\n*   It correctly produces D₂ gas (W).\n*   It forms a precipitate, G, which is Aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), as aluminium hydroxide is insoluble.\n*   Heating the precipitate G (`2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`) would release B (D₂O).\n*   All the provided clues are consistent with this set of identifications.\n\n**3. Perform the Final Calculation**\n\n*   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n*   The elements present are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n*   The **lightest element** (by atomic number) is Hydrogen, which is present as the isotope Deuterium (D).\n*   The **heaviest element** (by atomic number) is Aluminium (Al).\n*   The problem instructs us to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using the mass numbers of their specific isotopes.\n    *   There is **one atom** of the heaviest element, Aluminium (²⁷Al). Its mass number is **27**.\n    *   There are **four atoms** of the lightest element, Hydrogen, present as Deuterium (²H). Its mass number is **2**.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Total mass from Aluminium = 1 × 27 = 27\n    *   Total mass from Hydrogen (Deuterium) = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 27 + 8 = **35**.\n\n**4.

Identification of Key Substances from Chemical Clues**\n\n*   **Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**: The problem states that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\". Converting this to Celsius gives `277 K - 273.15 K = 3.85 °C`. This value is extremely close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C, and significantly different from that of normal water (H₂O), which is 0 °C. This allows us to confidently identify **Substance B as D₂O**. This identification also reveals that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the reaction is Deuterium (D, or ²H).\n\n*   **Gas W**: The gas W is described as having molecules where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Given that the system contains Deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron), the most logical candidate is Deuterium gas (D₂). A D₂ molecule contains two Deuterium atoms, for a total of **2 protons and 2 neutrons**, perfectly matching the clue. Therefore, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n*   **Substance X and its Reaction**: Substance X is the core unknown. We know the following:\n    1.  It contains Deuterium.\n    2.  Its \"very close analog\" is a common organic chemistry reagent.\n    3.  It reacts with a keto acid to produce a compound with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid has at least 3 oxygens (from a ketone group `>C=O` and a carboxylic acid group `-COOH`). Reducing the final oxygen count to 2 requires the reduction of the carboxylic acid to an alcohol (`-COOH → -CH₂OH`). This specific reduction requires a very powerful agent. The common reagent Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) is known for this, while milder reagents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) are not.\n    4.  This points to the analog being LiAlH₄. Therefore, Substance X, its deuterated version, must be **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**2. Verification of the Proposed Reaction Scheme**\n\nWith the identities established (X=LiAlD₄, W=D₂, B=D₂O), we can verify the entire reaction. For the reaction to produce only deuterated products, the liquid Y must also be a deuterium source, making it D₂O.\n\n*   **Reaction**: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4 D₂ (W)↑`\n*   **Violent Reaction**: The reaction of LiAlH₄ (and LiAlD₄) with water is famously violent, matching the description.\n*   **Precipitate G**: The reaction produces Aluminium Deuteroxide, `Al(OD)₃`, which, like Aluminium Hydroxide, is an insoluble precipitate.\n*   **Release of B**: When heated, G (Al(OD)₃) decomposes: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B)`. This correctly releases substance B (D₂O).\n\nAll clues are internally consistent with the identification of Substance X as LiAlD₄.\n\n**3. Final Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n\n*   **Substance X**: LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements Present**: Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n*   **Lightest Element**: Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Heaviest Element**: Aluminium (Al).\n*   **Mass Summation**: The problem requires summing the masses of *all atoms* of these two elements, using their specific isotopic mass numbers (which are integers, as implied by the answer choices).\n    *   The isotope of Hydrogen is Deuterium (²H), with a mass number of **2**. There are **four** Deuterium atoms in the formula.\n    *   The stable isotope of Aluminium is ²⁷Al, with a mass number of **27**. There is **one** Aluminium atom in the formula.\n*   **Calculation**:\n    (Mass of all lightest element atoms) + (Mass of all heaviest element atoms)\n    = (4 × Mass of D) + (1 × Mass of Al)\n    = (4 × 2) + (1 × 27)\n    = 8 + 27\n    = **35**\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35. Comparing this to the provided options:\n\nA) 29\nB) 35\nC) 25\nD) 31\n\nThe calculated value of 35 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nAn analysis of the problem and the provided candidate answers reveals a strong consensus in the core reasoning, despite minor discrepancies in the final letter choices due to differing option lists. The correct solution is derived as follows:\n\n**1. Identification of Key Substances:**\n\n*   **Substance B and the Heavier Isotope:** The melting point of B is stated as \"very close to 277 K,\" which is approximately 3.85 °C. This is a very precise match for the melting point of heavy water, **D₂O** (3.82 °C), and definitively rules out normal water (0 °C). This is the cornerstone of the solution, identifying the heavier isotope as **Deuterium (D or ²H)**. All candidate answers correctly made this deduction.\n\n*   **Gas W:** Gas W has molecules with an equal number of protons and neutrons. Given that the system involves deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron per atom), the most logical candidate is **D₂ gas**. A D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the description. This conclusion was also unanimously reached.\n\n*   **Substance X:** The identity of substance X is determined by several strong clues:\n    *   **Organic Chemistry Reagent:** Its \"very close analog\" is a common reagent, and it performs a specific, powerful reduction.\n    *   **Reduction Reaction:** It reduces a keto acid (which has ≥ 3 oxygen atoms) to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. This means a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) was reduced to an alcohol group (-CH₂OH). This reaction requires a very strong reducing agent.\n    *   **Identifying the Analog:** Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) is a famous, powerful reducing agent capable of this transformation, while other common reagents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) are not. Therefore, the analog is LiAlH₄.\n    *   **Conclusion on X:** Since substance X contains Deuterium, it must be the deuterated version of the analog: **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   **Verification:** The reaction `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G, precipitate) + LiOD + 4D₂ (W, gas)` is consistent with all remaining clues (violent reaction, precipitate formation, gas release, and the subsequent heating of G to produce B).\n\n**2.

Deconstruct the Clues to Identify the Substances**\n\n*   **Substance B and the \"Heavier Isotope\"**: The problem states that substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\". Converting this to Celsius gives 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. This value is a near-perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. This strongly suggests that substance **B is D₂O**, and the \"heavier isotope\" central to the problem is Deuterium (D, or ²H), an isotope of Hydrogen.\n\n*   **Gas W**: The gas W, produced in the reaction, has molecules with \"the same number of neutrons and protons.\" Given that the system contains deuterium, we can test deuterium gas, D₂. A single deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, which fits the description perfectly. Thus, **W is D₂ gas**.\n\n*   **Substance X and the Organic Chemistry Reaction**:\n    *   A \"very close analog\" of X is a common reagent in organic chemistry.\n    *   X reacts with a keto acid to produce a compound with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid contains a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), meaning it has at least 3 oxygen atoms. To reduce the oxygen count to 2, the carboxylic acid must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-COOH → -CH₂OH), which removes one oxygen atom.\n    *   This reaction requires a powerful reducing agent. Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) is the classic reagent strong enough to reduce both ketones and carboxylic acids, while milder agents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) cannot.\n    *   Therefore, the analog is LiAlH₄. Since substance X contains the heavy isotope Deuterium, **Substance X must be Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**2. Verify the Complete Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   With X identified as LiAlD₄, and knowing the products are deuterated, the liquid Y must also be a source of deuterium, making **Y = D₂O**.\n*   The full reaction is: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G) + LiOD + 4 D₂ (W)`.\n*   This reaction is famously violent. It correctly produces D₂ gas (W).\n*   It forms Aluminium Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is a gelatinous precipitate, so **G = Al(OD)₃**.\n*   Heating the precipitate G (`2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`) correctly releases substance B (D₂O).\n*   All clues are consistent with the identification of X as LiAlD₄.\n\n**3. Perform the Final Calculation**\n\n*   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n*   The elements are Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminium (Al, atomic number 13), and Hydrogen (H, atomic number 1).\n*   The **lightest element** (by atomic number) is Hydrogen.\n*   The **heaviest element** (by atomic number) is Aluminium.\n*   The question requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements, using the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved, as implied by the integer answer choices.\n    *   The isotope of Hydrogen present is Deuterium (D or ²H), which has a mass number of **2**. There are **four** Deuterium atoms.\n    *   The stable isotope of Aluminium is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of **27**. There is **one** Aluminium atom.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Total mass from Aluminium: 1 × 27 = 27\n    *   Total mass from Hydrogen (as Deuterium): 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Cumulative Mass = 27 + 8 = 35**\n\n**4.

This process was followed correctly by all the successful agents.\n\n*   **Clue about Substance B:** The melting point of B is \"very close to 277 K\". Converting to Celsius (277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C), this value is a nearly perfect match for the melting point of **heavy water (D₂O)**, which is 3.82 °C. This is a very strong initial clue. It establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is **Deuterium (D)**.\n*   **Clue about Gas W:** The molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Given the context of Deuterium, the most logical candidate is **di-deuterium gas (D₂)**. A Deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so the D₂ molecule has a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fulfilling the condition.\n*   **Clue about the Reaction and Precipitate G:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G. Since the products are deuterated, the reacting liquid **Y must also be D₂O**. The precipitate G releases B (D₂O) upon heating, which is characteristic of a metal deuteroxide (M(OD)n) decomposing into a metal oxide and D₂O.\n*   **Organic Chemistry Clues to Identify X:**\n    1.  The analog of X is a common organic reagent. This points towards a known reducing agent.\n    2.  X reduces a \"certain keto acid\" to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (one in the ketone >C=O group, two in the carboxylic acid -COOH group). For the product to have only 2 oxygen atoms, the carboxylic acid group must be reduced to an alcohol group (-COOH → -CH₂OH).\n    3.  This specific reduction requires a powerful reducing agent. **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)** is a classic example of a reagent that can perform this transformation, while weaker reagents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) cannot.\n    4.  Therefore, the \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄, and Substance X, which contains deuterium, must be **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**Step 2: Verify the Complete Reaction Chemistry**\nLet's confirm that X = LiAlD₄ fits all the clues:\n*   The reaction `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD(aq) + 4D₂(g) (W)↑` is known to be violent.\n*   It correctly produces D₂ gas (W) and an insoluble precipitate, Aluminium deuteroxide, G.\n*   When heated, G (Al(OD)₃) decomposes to produce D₂O (B).\n*   The identification of X as LiAlD₄ is consistent with all pieces of information provided.\n\n**Step 3: Perform the Final Calculation**\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n*   The constituent elements are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n*   The **lightest element** (by atomic number) is Hydrogen.\n*   The **heaviest element** (by atomic number) is Aluminium.\n*   We must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved (as implied by the integer answer choices).\n    *   The isotope of hydrogen present is Deuterium (D or ²H), which has a mass number of **2**. There are **four** Deuterium atoms.\n    *   The stable isotope of aluminium is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of **27**. There is **one** Aluminium atom.\n*   Calculation:\n    *   Total mass from Aluminium = 1 × 27 = 27\n    *   Total mass from Hydrogen (as Deuterium) = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Cumulative Sum = 27 + 8 = 35**\n\n**Step 4: Final Decision**\nThe step-by-step chemical reasoning, consistently followed by the candidate answers, leads to a definitive calculated value of 35. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) 35\nB) 29\nC) 25\nD) 31\n\nThe calculated value of 35 matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided candidate answers, a clear and consistent logical path emerges. The core of the problem involves two main stages: identifying the unknown chemical substances and then performing the specified calculation.\n\n### Analysis of the Reasoning\n\n**1. Identification of Substances**\n\n*   **Consensus on Substance B and the Isotope:** There is a unanimous agreement among all candidate answers. The melting point of Substance B being \"very close to 277 K\" (which is 3.85 °C) is correctly identified as a near-perfect match for the melting point of **D₂O (heavy water)**, which is 3.82 °C. This key insight establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is **Deuterium (D, or ²H)**.\n*   **Consensus on Gas W:** All candidate answers correctly deduce that Gas W, with molecules having an equal number of protons and neutrons, must be **D₂ gas**. A Deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so the D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description perfectly within the established chemical context.\n*   **Consensus on Substance X:** The identification of Substance X is more complex but is also reached unanimously through logical deduction across all candidates.\n    *   **The Keto Acid Clue:** The reduction of a keto acid (with ≥3 oxygen atoms) to a product with 2 oxygen atoms requires a very powerful reducing agent, as it involves the reduction of a carboxylic acid group. This points to the \"analog\" being **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)**, a well-known strong reducing agent, and rules out milder ones like NaBH₄.\n    *   **The Precipitation Clue:** Since Substance X contains deuterium, it must be the deuterated version of the analog, which is **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. The violent reaction with liquid Y (identified as D₂O) produces a precipitate G: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑`. The formation of the Aluminium deuteroxide precipitate (G) is consistent with the clues.\n    *   All chemical properties described in the problem point conclusively to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n**2. The Calculation**\n\n*   **The Task:** The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n*   **Identifying the Elements:** The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (H, present as its isotope Deuterium, D). By atomic number, Hydrogen is the lightest, and Aluminium is the heaviest.\n*   **Consensus on Calculation:** All candidate answers correctly perform the same calculation, using the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved (²H for Deuterium and ²⁷Al for Aluminium), as is standard for such problems with integer answer choices.\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium): 1 atom × 27 amu/atom = **27**\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen, as Deuterium): 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = **8**\n    *   Cumulative Sum: 27 + 8 = **35**\n\n**3. Conclusion and Final Answer**\n\nThe reasoning and the final numerical result are exceptionally consistent across all provided answers. Every logical step points to the identities X = LiAlD₄ and a calculated mass sum of 35. The only variation among the candidate answers is the final letter choice, which is due to the options being presented in a different order to each agent.\n\nBased on the definitive calculation of 35, and comparing this to the options provided in the question:\nA) 31\nB) 29\nC) 25\nD) 35\n\nThe correct answer is 35, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the consensus logic from the provided candidate answers.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**\nThe first critical clue is that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   Convert Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n*   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium, is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n*   The given value is an almost perfect match for heavy water. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**. This also establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is **Deuterium (D)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Gas W**\nThe gas W, released in the reaction, has molecules with \"the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n*   Given that the reaction involves deuterium, the most plausible candidate is deuterium gas (D₂).\n*   A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n*   Therefore, a molecule of D₂ gas has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the clue. Thus, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Substance X**\nA combination of chemical and organic chemistry clues points to the identity of X.\n*   **The Reaction:** Substance X reacts violently with a liquid Y to produce D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate (G). Since the products are deuterated, the liquid Y must also be a source of deuterium, making **Y = D₂O**.\n*   **Organic Chemistry Clues:**\n    1.  X's \"very close analog\" is a common organic reagent. This suggests reagents like LiAlH₄ or NaBH₄, meaning X could be LiAlD₄ or NaBD₄.\n    2.  X reduces a \"keto acid\" to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (one in the ketone >C=O group, two in the carboxylic acid -COOH group). To get to a 2-oxygen product, the carboxylic acid group must be reduced to an alcohol (-CH₂OH), a reaction that requires a powerful reducing agent.\n    3.  Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) is a famous powerful reducing agent capable of this; Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) is not.\n*   **Conclusion:** The analog is LiAlH₄, so substance X must be its deuterated version, **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. This is confirmed by its reaction with D₂O (`LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → Al(OD)₃↓ + LiOD + 4D₂↑`), which produces a precipitate (G = Al(OD)₃) and D₂ gas (W), as described.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Final Calculation**\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n*   The elements present, ordered by atomic number, are Hydrogen (Z=1), Lithium (Z=3), and Aluminium (Z=13).\n*   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n*   The **heaviest element** is Aluminium.\n*   The question requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using the mass numbers for the specific isotopes present.\n    *   The isotope of Hydrogen is Deuterium (D or ²H), which has a mass number of **2**.\n    *   The stable isotope of Aluminium is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of **27**.\n*   The calculation is:\n    *   Mass from lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium): 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = 8\n    *   Mass from heaviest element (Aluminium): 1 atom × 27 amu/atom = 27\n    *   **Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35**\n\n**Step 5: Match the Result to the Options**\nThe calculated value is 35. Comparing this to the provided options:\nA) 25\nB) 29\nC) 35\nD) 31\n\nThe calculated value of 35 corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, leading to the final answer.\n\n**1. Identification of Key Substances from Physical and Chemical Clues**\n\n*   **Substance B and the Heavier Isotope:** The primary clue is the melting point of substance B, which is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   **Conversion:** 277 Kelvin = 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   **Comparison:** This value is significantly different from the melting point of normal water (H₂O) at 0 °C but is an excellent match for the melting point of **heavy water (D₂O)**, which is 3.82 °C.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This identifies substance B as D₂O and reveals that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is **Deuterium (D, or ²H)**.\n\n*   **Gas W:** The molecule of gas W is described as having \"the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** Given the confirmed presence of Deuterium (which has 1 proton and 1 neutron), the most logical candidate for gas W is **D₂ gas**. A D₂ molecule contains two deuterium atoms, for a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the description.\n\n*   **Substance X:** Several clues converge to identify substance X.\n    *   **Organic Chemistry Reagent:** The statement that \"its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" points towards a common compound.\n    *   **Reducing Power:** The reaction of X with a \"keto acid\" yields a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid contains at least 3 oxygen atoms (one in a ketone group >C=O and two in a carboxylic acid group -COOH). To reduce the oxygen count to 2, the carboxylic acid must be reduced to an alcohol (-COOH → -CH₂OH). This powerful reduction is characteristic of a strong reducing agent like **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)**. Milder agents like sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) cannot perform this specific reduction.\n    *   **Conclusion on X:** The \"close analog\" is LiAlH₄. Since substance X contains Deuterium, it must be **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**2. Verification of the Proposed Reaction Scheme**\n\n*   With the identities established (X = LiAlD₄, Y = D₂O, W = D₂, G = a precipitate, B = D₂O), the reaction can be written:\n    `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD (soluble) + 4 D₂ (W)↑`\n*   This reaction aligns with all the clues:\n    1.  It is known to be violent.\n    2.  It produces D₂ gas (W).\n    3.  It forms a precipitate (G), Aluminium deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃.\n    4.  Heating the precipitate (`2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`) would release heavy water (B), which has a melting point near 277 K.\n\n**3. Final Calculation**\n\n*   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄.\n*   **Elements Present:** Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n*   **Lightest Element (by atomic number):** Hydrogen. In the molecule, it is present as its isotope Deuterium (D).\n*   **Heaviest Element (by atomic number):** Aluminium (Al).\n*   The instruction is to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   The mass number of Deuterium (D, or ²H) is **2**.\n    *   The mass number of Aluminium's stable isotope (²⁷Al) is **27**.\n*   **Summation:**\n    *   Mass from Aluminium = 1 atom × 27 = 27\n    *   Mass from Hydrogen (Deuterium) = 4 atoms × 2 = 8\n    *   **Cumulative Mass = 27 + 8 = 35**\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35. Matching this with the provided options:\nA) 25\nB) 31\nC) 35\nD) 29\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the logic from the candidate answers to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n**1. Identification of Key Substances from Chemical Clues**\n\n*   **Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**: The primary clue is the melting point of substance B, \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 K = 3.85 °C.\n    *   This temperature is an excellent match for the melting point of **heavy water (D₂O)**, which is 3.82 °C. It is significantly different from the melting point of normal water (H₂O) at 0 °C.\n    *   This establishes that **Substance B is D₂O**, and the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is **Deuterium (D or ²H)**.\n\n*   **Gas W**: Gas W is a product of the reaction, and its molecules contain \"the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n    *   Given that the system contains Deuterium, the most plausible candidate is **Deuterium gas (D₂)**.\n    *   A single Deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule therefore has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the description.\n\n*   **Substance X and Associated Reaction**:\n    *   The \"close analog\" of X is a common organic chemistry reagent, and X itself is potent enough to reduce a \"certain keto acid\" to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid contains a minimum of 3 oxygen atoms (one in a ketone group, >C=O, and two in a carboxylic acid group, -COOH). Reducing this to a product with 2 oxygen atoms requires the reduction of the carboxylic acid group (-COOH → -CH₂OH), a reaction that only very strong reducing agents can accomplish.\n    *   This points to the analog being **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)**, not the weaker Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄).\n    *   Since X contains the isotope Deuterium, **Substance X must be Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   This identification is confirmed by the other clues:\n        *   The reaction `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑` is famously violent.\n        *   It produces D₂ gas (W).\n        *   It forms a precipitate, **Aluminium deuteroxide (G)**.\n        *   Heating G (`Al(OD)₃`) would cause it to decompose, releasing D₂O (B). All clues are consistent.\n\n**2. Final Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n\n*   **Substance X**: LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements**: The molecule contains Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n*   **Lightest and Heaviest Elements**: Based on atomic number (Z), the lightest element is Hydrogen and the heaviest element is Aluminium.\n*   **Summation of Masses**: The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved (as implied by the integer options).\n    *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminium)**: There is one atom of Aluminium (Al).

The consensus on the core reasoning is remarkably strong and accurate across all candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B and the Isotope:** The initial clue states that Substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   277 Kelvin converts to 3.85 °C (by subtracting 273.15).\n    *   This is almost identical to the known melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C, and significantly different from that of normal water (H₂O), which is 0 °C.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Substance B is D₂O. This establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is Deuterium (D or ²H).\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The clue for gas W is that its molecule contains \"the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n    *   Given the established context of Deuterium, the most logical candidate is Deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   A single Deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   Therefore, a D₂ molecule has a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the description.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Gas W is D₂.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X:** Several powerful clues point to the identity of Substance X.\n    *   **Organic Chemistry Context:** X's \"very close analog\" is a common organic reagent, and X can reduce a \"certain keto acid\" to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid contains at least 3 oxygen atoms (in the ketone and carboxylic acid groups). Reducing the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH) removes one oxygen atom. This powerful reduction requires a strong agent like Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄), as milder agents (like NaBH₄) are insufficient.\n    *   **Conclusion about X:** The analog is LiAlH₄. Therefore, Substance X, its deuterated counterpart, must be **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n4.  **Verify the Entire Reaction:** The reaction scheme is `X + Y → W + G`.\n    *   With X = LiAlD₄ and W = D₂, the liquid reactant Y must also be a source of deuterium, confirming **Y = D₂O**.\n    *   The reaction is `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑`.\n    *   This reaction is famously violent. It produces a precipitate (G), Aluminium deuteroxide, which when heated (`2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`) correctly releases Substance B (D₂O).

Deconstruct the Clues to Identify the Substances**\n\n*   **Clue 1: Substance B's Melting Point**\n    The problem states that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\". Converting this to Celsius gives 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. This temperature is significantly different from the melting point of normal water (H₂O) at 0 °C, but it is an almost perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (**D₂O**), which is 3.82 °C. This is the crucial starting point, correctly identified by all candidate answers. This also establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is Deuterium (D or ²H).\n\n*   **Clue 2: Gas W's Composition**\n    Gas W is described as having molecules with an equal number of protons and neutrons. Given that the system contains Deuterium, the most logical candidate is di-deuterium gas, **D₂**. Each Deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so the D₂ molecule has a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the clue.\n\n*   **Clue 3: The Organic Chemistry Reaction**\n    Substance X or its \"very close analog\" is a common organic reagent. It can react with a keto acid (which contains at least 3 oxygen atoms) to produce a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. This means the reagent must be powerful enough to reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), which removes one oxygen atom. Among common laboratory reagents, Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) is famous for this capability, whereas milder reagents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) are not. Therefore, the \"analog\" is LiAlH₄. Since Substance X contains the heavy isotope Deuterium, **Substance X must be Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n*   **Clue 4: Verifying the Full Reaction**\n    Let's check if X = LiAlD₄ fits the remaining clues. It reacts violently with a liquid Y to form gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G, which upon heating yields B (D₂O).\n    The reaction is: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD (soluble) + 4D₂ (W)↑`.\n    *   The liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O).\n    *   The reaction is known to be violent.\n    *   Gas W (D₂) is produced.\n    *   A precipitate G, Aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), is formed.\n    *   Heating the precipitate G (`2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`) correctly releases B (D₂O).\n    All clues are perfectly consistent with X being LiAlD₄.\n\n**2.

There are four D atoms in the formula.\n        Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   Mass from Aluminium: The stable isotope is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27. There is one Al atom in the formula.\n        Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27\n*   **Cumulative Mass:** 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n**3.

The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier isotope of hydrogen (Deuterium, D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is an almost perfect match. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**, and the \"heavier isotope\" is **Deuterium (D or ²H)**.\n\n*   **Gas W:** The molecule of gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons.\n    *   Given that the system contains Deuterium, the most logical candidate for the gas is di-deuterium gas, **D₂**.\n    *   Each Deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron.

Substance X's \"very close analog\" is a common organic chemistry reagent.\n    2.  The product of its reaction with a \"keto acid\" has 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid possesses both a ketone group (R-CO-R') and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), meaning it starts with at least 3 oxygen atoms. For the product to have only 2 oxygen atoms, the carboxylic acid group must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-COOH → -CH₂OH).\n    3.  This reduction requires a powerful reagent. A common and powerful reducing agent is **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)**. Milder agents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) cannot perform this reduction.\n    4.  Therefore, the analog is LiAlH₄, and since substance X contains deuterium, **X must be Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**2. Verify the Complete Reaction Chemistry**\n\n*   With X identified as LiAlD₄ and the system being deuterated, the violent reaction is with liquid Y, which must be D₂O.\n*   The reaction is: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑`.\n*   This reaction is indeed violent.\n*   It correctly produces D₂ gas (W).\n*   It forms a precipitate, G, which is Aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), as aluminium hydroxide is insoluble.\n*   Heating the precipitate G (`2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`) would release B (D₂O).\n*   All the provided clues are consistent with this set of identifications.\n\n**3. Perform the Final Calculation**\n\n*   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n*   The elements present are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n*   The **lightest element** (by atomic number) is Hydrogen, which is present as the isotope Deuterium (D).\n*   The **heaviest element** (by atomic number) is Aluminium (Al).\n*   The problem instructs us to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using the mass numbers of their specific isotopes.\n    *   There is **one atom** of the heaviest element, Aluminium (²⁷Al). Its mass number is **27**.\n    *   There are **four atoms** of the lightest element, Hydrogen, present as Deuterium (²H). Its mass number is **2**.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Total mass from Aluminium = 1 × 27 = 27\n    *   Total mass from Hydrogen (Deuterium) = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 27 + 8 = **35**.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35. This corresponds to option B.\n\nA) 31\nB) 35\nC) 25\nD) 29\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers to arrive at a definitive solution.\n\n**1. Identification of Key Substances from Chemical Clues**\n\n*   **Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**: The problem states that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\". Converting this to Celsius gives `277 K - 273.15 K = 3.85 °C`. This value is extremely close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C, and significantly different from that of normal water (H₂O), which is 0 °C. This allows us to confidently identify **Substance B as D₂O**. This identification also reveals that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the reaction is Deuterium (D, or ²H).\n\n*   **Gas W**: The gas W is described as having molecules where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Given that the system contains Deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron), the most logical candidate is Deuterium gas (D₂). A D₂ molecule contains two Deuterium atoms, for a total of **2 protons and 2 neutrons**, perfectly matching the clue. Therefore, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n*   **Substance X and its Reaction**: Substance X is the core unknown. We know the following:\n    1.  It contains Deuterium.\n    2.  Its \"very close analog\" is a common organic chemistry reagent.\n    3.  It reacts with a keto acid to produce a compound with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid has at least 3 oxygens (from a ketone group `>C=O` and a carboxylic acid group `-COOH`). Reducing the final oxygen count to 2 requires the reduction of the carboxylic acid to an alcohol (`-COOH → -CH₂OH`). This specific reduction requires a very powerful agent. The common reagent Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) is known for this, while milder reagents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) are not.\n    4.  This points to the analog being LiAlH₄. Therefore, Substance X, its deuterated version, must be **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**2. Verification of the Proposed Reaction Scheme**\n\nWith the identities established (X=LiAlD₄, W=D₂, B=D₂O), we can verify the entire reaction. For the reaction to produce only deuterated products, the liquid Y must also be a deuterium source, making it D₂O.\n\n*   **Reaction**: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4 D₂ (W)↑`\n*   **Violent Reaction**: The reaction of LiAlH₄ (and LiAlD₄) with water is famously violent, matching the description.\n*   **Precipitate G**: The reaction produces Aluminium Deuteroxide, `Al(OD)₃`, which, like Aluminium Hydroxide, is an insoluble precipitate.\n*   **Release of B**: When heated, G (Al(OD)₃) decomposes: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B)`. This correctly releases substance B (D₂O).\n\nAll clues are internally consistent with the identification of Substance X as LiAlD₄.\n\n**3. Final Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n\n*   **Substance X**: LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements Present**: Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n*   **Lightest Element**: Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Heaviest Element**: Aluminium (Al).\n*   **Mass Summation**: The problem requires summing the masses of *all atoms* of these two elements, using their specific isotopic mass numbers (which are integers, as implied by the answer choices).\n    *   The isotope of Hydrogen is Deuterium (²H), with a mass number of **2**. There are **four** Deuterium atoms in the formula.\n    *   The stable isotope of Aluminium is ²⁷Al, with a mass number of **27**. There is **one** Aluminium atom in the formula.\n*   **Calculation**:\n    (Mass of all lightest element atoms) + (Mass of all heaviest element atoms)\n    = (4 × Mass of D) + (1 × Mass of Al)\n    = (4 × 2) + (1 × 27)\n    = 8 + 27\n    = **35**\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35. Comparing this to the provided options:\n\nA) 29\nB) 35\nC) 25\nD) 31\n\nThe calculated value of 35 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nAn analysis of the problem and the provided candidate answers reveals a strong consensus in the core reasoning, despite minor discrepancies in the final letter choices due to differing option lists. The correct solution is derived as follows:\n\n**1. Identification of Key Substances:**\n\n*   **Substance B and the Heavier Isotope:** The melting point of B is stated as \"very close to 277 K,\" which is approximately 3.85 °C. This is a very precise match for the melting point of heavy water, **D₂O** (3.82 °C), and definitively rules out normal water (0 °C). This is the cornerstone of the solution, identifying the heavier isotope as **Deuterium (D or ²H)**. All candidate answers correctly made this deduction.\n\n*   **Gas W:** Gas W has molecules with an equal number of protons and neutrons. Given that the system involves deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron per atom), the most logical candidate is **D₂ gas**. A D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the description. This conclusion was also unanimously reached.\n\n*   **Substance X:** The identity of substance X is determined by several strong clues:\n    *   **Organic Chemistry Reagent:** Its \"very close analog\" is a common reagent, and it performs a specific, powerful reduction.\n    *   **Reduction Reaction:** It reduces a keto acid (which has ≥ 3 oxygen atoms) to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. This means a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) was reduced to an alcohol group (-CH₂OH). This reaction requires a very strong reducing agent.\n    *   **Identifying the Analog:** Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) is a famous, powerful reducing agent capable of this transformation, while other common reagents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) are not. Therefore, the analog is LiAlH₄.\n    *   **Conclusion on X:** Since substance X contains Deuterium, it must be the deuterated version of the analog: **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   **Verification:** The reaction `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G, precipitate) + LiOD + 4D₂ (W, gas)` is consistent with all remaining clues (violent reaction, precipitate formation, gas release, and the subsequent heating of G to produce B).\n\n**2. Final Calculation:**\n\nThe task is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in Substance X (LiAlD₄), using the specific isotopic masses.\n\n*   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (present as Deuterium, D).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminium (Al).\n*   **Mass Calculation:**\n    *   The mass from the **heaviest** element (Aluminium): There is one atom of Aluminium. Its stable isotope is ²⁷Al, so its mass is 27.\n    *   The mass from the **lightest** element (Hydrogen): There are four atoms, all of which are the isotope Deuterium (²H), with a mass number of 2. Their total mass is 4 × 2 = 8.\n*   **Cumulative Mass:** 27 + 8 = **35**.\n\n**3. Final Answer Selection:**\n\nThe reasoning across all candidate answers robustly and consistently leads to the calculated value of 35. Comparing this result with the provided options:\n\nA) 25\nB) 35\nC) 29\nD) 31\n\nThe calculated value of 35 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Clues to Identify the Substances**\n\n*   **Substance B and the \"Heavier Isotope\"**: The problem states that substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\". Converting this to Celsius gives 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. This value is a near-perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. This strongly suggests that substance **B is D₂O**, and the \"heavier isotope\" central to the problem is Deuterium (D, or ²H), an isotope of Hydrogen.\n\n*   **Gas W**: The gas W, produced in the reaction, has molecules with \"the same number of neutrons and protons.\" Given that the system contains deuterium, we can test deuterium gas, D₂. A single deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, which fits the description perfectly. Thus, **W is D₂ gas**.\n\n*   **Substance X and the Organic Chemistry Reaction**:\n    *   A \"very close analog\" of X is a common reagent in organic chemistry.\n    *   X reacts with a keto acid to produce a compound with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid contains a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), meaning it has at least 3 oxygen atoms. To reduce the oxygen count to 2, the carboxylic acid must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-COOH → -CH₂OH), which removes one oxygen atom.\n    *   This reaction requires a powerful reducing agent. Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) is the classic reagent strong enough to reduce both ketones and carboxylic acids, while milder agents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) cannot.\n    *   Therefore, the analog is LiAlH₄. Since substance X contains the heavy isotope Deuterium, **Substance X must be Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**2. Verify the Complete Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   With X identified as LiAlD₄, and knowing the products are deuterated, the liquid Y must also be a source of deuterium, making **Y = D₂O**.\n*   The full reaction is: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G) + LiOD + 4 D₂ (W)`.\n*   This reaction is famously violent. It correctly produces D₂ gas (W).\n*   It forms Aluminium Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is a gelatinous precipitate, so **G = Al(OD)₃**.\n*   Heating the precipitate G (`2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`) correctly releases substance B (D₂O).\n*   All clues are consistent with the identification of X as LiAlD₄.\n\n**3. Perform the Final Calculation**\n\n*   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n*   The elements are Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminium (Al, atomic number 13), and Hydrogen (H, atomic number 1).\n*   The **lightest element** (by atomic number) is Hydrogen.\n*   The **heaviest element** (by atomic number) is Aluminium.\n*   The question requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements, using the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved, as implied by the integer answer choices.\n    *   The isotope of Hydrogen present is Deuterium (D or ²H), which has a mass number of **2**. There are **four** Deuterium atoms.\n    *   The stable isotope of Aluminium is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of **27**. There is **one** Aluminium atom.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Total mass from Aluminium: 1 × 27 = 27\n    *   Total mass from Hydrogen (as Deuterium): 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Cumulative Mass = 27 + 8 = 35**\n\n**4. Select the Final Answer**\n\n*   The calculated value is 35.\n*   Looking at the options provided in the prompt:\n    A) 29\n    B) 25\n    C) 31\n    D) 35\n*   The calculated value of 35 matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
