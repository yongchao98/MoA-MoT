This value is numerically equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (since 1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n*   **Determine the General Formula:** For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `y / (12x + y)`, using integer atomic masses for simplicity (C=12, H=1). Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`. Solving this leads to `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   **Identify the Class of Hydrocarbon:** The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. A hydrocarbon with this formula can be either an alkene (containing a double bond) or a cycloalkane (a ring structure).\n*   **Use Saturation Information:** The problem states that Z is a product of hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This means Z is a saturated compound, which rules out the possibility of it being an alkene. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Identify the Specific Compound:** All compounds in the problem hydrogenate to *only* Z, implying they all share a common carbon skeleton. Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The most common and simple cycloalkane fitting these criteria, and which allows for the subsequent reaction steps (involving an aromatic ring), is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This choice fits the formula CₙH₂ₙ for n=6 and all other properties.\n\n**Step 2: Identification of the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   **Analyze the Properties of Mixture Y:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. It \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   **Identify the Known Component:** We have already established that substance Z, **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**, is one of the components of mixture Y.\n*   **Identify the Unknown Component:** Let's call the second component Y₂. We know two key things about it:\n    1.  Hydrogenation of Y₂ must produce only cyclohexane (since the whole mixture hydrogenates to Z). This means Y₂ must also have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n    2.  Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water. This rules out cycloalkenes.\n    The only compound with a six-carbon ring skeleton that can be hydrogenated but does not react with bromine water is an aromatic compound. Therefore, Y₂ must be **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   **Conclusion for Mixture Y:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Total Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**\n\n*   **Understand the Reaction:** Mixture X is converted to Mixture Y through a \"disproportionation\" reaction when heated with a platinum catalyst. In this chemical context, disproportionation means a hydrogen transfer reaction where one molecule is reduced (gains hydrogen) and another is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n*   **Apply the Law of Conservation of Mass:** Since both mixtures are equimolar, the overall reaction stoichiometry can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `Liquid X₁ + Liquid X₂ → Liquid Y₁ + Liquid Y₂`\n    Substituting the known components of Y:\n    `Liquid X₁ + Liquid X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Calculate the Total Hydrogen Atoms:** The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. According to the law of conservation of atoms, this total must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in Cyclohexane) + (H atoms in Benzene)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n**Step 4: Verification and Careful Check of Constraints**\n\n*   This step is crucial to ensure our solution is fully consistent with all parts of the problem statement. We must verify that a plausible Mixture X exists.\n*   The components of X must be:\n    1.  Two different liquids with C₆ ring skeletons.\n    2.  They must decolorize bromine water (be unsaturated).\n    3.  They must *not* have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    4.  The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each must be 18.\n*   Let's consider possible unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds: Cyclohexene is C₆H₁₀. Cyclohexadienes are C₆H₈.\n*   The sum 10 + 8 = 18, so a mixture of **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and a **cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** is a perfect candidate.\n*   The specific cyclohexadiene must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**, because its double bonds are isolated and therefore not conjugated. The alternative, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, has conjugated double bonds and is explicitly ruled out by the problem statement.\n*   This plausible composition for Mixture X ({cyclohexene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene}) perfectly fits all conditions, verifying that our calculation of 18 hydrogen atoms is correct.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, highlighting the key points necessary to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning and Careful Points\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z.**\n    *   **Chemical Formula:** The first clue is that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the relationship `y = 2x`. Thus, Z has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n    *   **Saturation:** The problem states Z \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ that is saturated cannot be an alkene and must therefore be a **cycloalkane**.\n    *   **Common Skeleton:** A critical point is that hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* substance Z. This implies that all components in both mixtures share the same carbon skeleton as Z. The reaction type (disproportionation to an aromatic compound) strongly suggests this skeleton is a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Conclusion for Z:** The most common six-carbon cycloalkane that is a widely used solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **. This identification is consistent with all the facts.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y.**\n    *   **Properties:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components must be either saturated (like Z) or aromatic.\n    *   **Known Component:** We are told Z is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one liquid is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **.\n    *   **Identifying the Second Component:** The other liquid must also hydrogenate to give only cyclohexane (due to the common skeleton rule). Since it does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only remaining possibility for a C₆ compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane but is unreactive with bromine water is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n    *   **Conclusion for Y:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Total Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X.**\n    *   **The Reaction:** The core of the problem lies in the reaction `Mixture X → Mixture Y`, which is a **disproportionation** reaction on a platinum catalyst. In this context, it is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one component is reduced and another is oxidized.\n    *   **Stoichiometry and Conservation of Mass:** Since both X and Y are equimolar mixtures, the reaction stoichiometry is 1:1. Let the components of X be X₁ and X₂.\n        `X₁ + X₂ → cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + benzene (C₆H₆)`\n    *   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms on the reactant side must equal the total on the product side. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is simply the sum of the hydrogens in one molecule of X₁ and one molecule of X₂.\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        Total H atoms in X = Total H atoms in Y\n        Total H atoms in X = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆)\n        Total H atoms in X = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n4.  **Verification and Final Check (A crucial \"careful point\").**\n    *   To ensure the entire scenario is chemically plausible, we must check if a mixture X exists that fits all the remaining criteria: its two components decolorize bromine water (are unsaturated) and have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   The sum of hydrogen atoms in the two components (both C₆ compounds) must be 18. Plausible candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and a cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n        *   Total hydrogens: 10 + 8 = 18. This works.\n        *   The diene must be non-conjugated. **1,4-cyclohexadiene** has isolated double bonds, while 1,3-cyclohexadiene is conjugated. Therefore, the diene must be 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n    *   Thus, a valid Mixture X is {cyclohexene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene}. All conditions of the problem are met, confirming that the calculation based on conservation of mass is correct.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on a careful analysis of the problem and the provided candidate answers, here is a consolidated, step-by-step reasoning to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Detailed Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the identity of hydrocarbon Z.**\n\n*   **Analyze the chemical formula from the mass fraction:** The problem states Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This value is very close to the fraction 1/7 (since 1/7 ≈ 0.142857).\n*   For a hydrocarbon with the general formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen (using approximate atomic masses C=12, H=1) is `y / (12x + y)`.\n*   Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`.\n*   Solving this equation: `7y = 12x + y` -> `6y = 12x` -> `y = 2x`.\n*   This shows that the general formula for Z is **CₙH₂ₙ**. This formula corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n*   **Analyze the chemical properties:** The problem states that Z is a product of hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This indicates that Z is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   **Identify the specific compound:** All the compounds in the problem hydrogenate to form *only* Z, implying they all share the same carbon skeleton. Z is also a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The chemical reactions described (disproportionation involving an aromatic compound) strongly suggest a six-membered ring structure. The most common six-carbon cycloalkane used as a solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits the CₙH₂ₙ formula and all the given conditions.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the composition of mixture Y.**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. It \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is Z, which we have identified as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   Hydrogenation of the entire mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means the other component of Y must also have a six-carbon skeleton and must form cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   Since this other component does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a simple alkene. The only logical identity is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, does not react with bromine water under these conditions, but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the reaction from X to Y and calculate the final answer.**\n\n*   The problem states that an equimolar mixture X is treated with a platinum catalyst upon heating to form the equimolar mixture Y. This transformation is described as a **disproportionation**, which in this context means a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X is oxidized (loses H₂) and the other is reduced (gains H₂).\n*   The overall reaction can be written as:\n    `Liquid from X₁ + Liquid from X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   The key principle to solve the problem is the **Law of Conservation of Mass**. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on the reactant side and the product side.\n*   The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\". This is simply the sum of hydrogen atoms on the product side of the balanced equation.\n*   Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n*   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n**Careful Points & Verification:**\n\n*   **Consistency:** The logical flow is highly consistent. Identifying Z first is crucial. Using Z to identify the components of Y is the next step. Finally, applying the law of conservation of mass to the reaction that produces Y provides the answer directly, without needing to identify the exact components of X.\n*   **Plausibility Check:** We can verify that a valid mixture X exists. Its components must be unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water), have non-conjugated bonds, have a C₆ ring skeleton, and their total hydrogen count must be 18. The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** perfectly fits all criteria. (10 H + 8 H = 18 H; both are unsaturated; 1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated).\n\nThe calculation robustly shows the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) 12\nB) 22\nC) 16\nD) 18\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer. The key is to logically deduce the identities of the compounds involved.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance Z**\n\n*   **Analyze the chemical formula:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (since 1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). Let the formula for Z be CₓHᵧ. Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), we can set up the equation for the mass fraction of hydrogen:\n    `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n    Solving for the ratio of y to x:\n    `7y = 12x + y`\n    `6y = 12x`\n    `y = 2x`\n    This means the general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. This formula can represent either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n\n*   **Analyze the chemical properties:** The problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which indicates that it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane, not an alkene.\n\n*   **Identify the specific compound:** We are told that Z is a \"widely used as a solvent\" and is the sole product when all other mixtures are hydrogenated. This implies all components share a common carbon skeleton. Given the reaction context (disproportionation often involving aromatic systems), a six-membered ring is the most logical skeleton. A six-carbon cycloalkane (n=6) is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**, which is a common solvent and perfectly fits the CₙH₂ₙ formula.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   **Analyze the properties of Mixture Y:** It is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic. One component is Z (cyclohexane).\n*   **Identify the second component:** Let the other liquid be Y₂. Since hydrogenation of the entire mixture Y gives only cyclohexane, the hydrogenation of Y₂ must also produce cyclohexane. This means Y₂ has a six-carbon ring skeleton. As Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be an alkene. The only remaining possibility is an aromatic compound, specifically **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive towards bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n*   **Analyze the transformation:** An equimolar mixture X (of liquids X₁ and X₂) is converted to the equimolar mixture Y through a disproportionation reaction on a heated platinum catalyst. In this organic chemistry context, disproportionation means a hydrogen transfer reaction where one molecule is reduced (gains H) and another is oxidized (loses H).\n*   **Apply the Law of Conservation of Mass:** The overall reaction can be written as:\n    `X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the equation. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X₁ and one molecule of X₂.\n*   This sum must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products:\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This is directly derivable from the conservation of atoms in the chemical reaction, and it is consistent with plausible identities for the components of mixture X (cyclohexene, C₆H₁₀, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene, C₆H₈), which sum to 18 hydrogen atoms and meet all other conditions of the problem.\n\nComparing the result (18) to the given options:\nA) 16\nB) 18\nC) 12\nD) 22\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the logic from the candidate answers to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n**1. Identification of Substance Z**\n\n*   **Clue:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   **Analysis:** The mass percentage 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` and solving gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Clue:** Z \"does not react further with hydrogen.\"\n*   **Analysis:** This indicates that Z is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Clue:** Hydrogenation of all other substances in the problem yields only Z. This implies that all key compounds share the same carbon skeleton. The later steps involving disproportionation to an aromatic compound strongly suggest this is a six-membered ring.\n*   **Conclusion:** The substance Z is a six-carbon cycloalkane, which is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This compound is also a widely used solvent, fitting all clues.\n\n**2. Identification of Mixture Y**\n\n*   **Clue:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" and one component is Z (cyclohexane).\n*   **Analysis:** Since mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, its components must be either saturated or aromatic. We know one component is saturated (cyclohexane).\n*   **Clue:** Hydrogenation of mixture Y yields only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   **Analysis:** The second component of Y, let's call it Y₂, must also be a C₆-ring compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. For it to not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a simple alkene. The only substance fitting these criteria is **benzene (C₆H₆)**, which is aromatic and hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Reaction and Calculation**\n\n*   **Clue:** An equimolar mixture X is converted into an equimolar mixture Y via disproportionation on a heated platinum catalyst.\n*   **Analysis:** This describes a hydrogen transfer reaction. Since the starting and ending mixtures are both equimolar, the reaction stoichiometry for the components is 1:1. We can write the overall transformation as:\n    `Liquid X₁ + Liquid X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Principle of Conservation of Mass:** The total number of atoms of each element must be conserved. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This sum must be equal to the sum of the hydrogen atoms in the products.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18\n\n**4. Final Verification**\n\n*   To ensure our logic is sound, we can identify plausible components for mixture X. They must be C₆ cyclic compounds, must be unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water), must not have conjugated double bonds, and their total hydrogen count must be 18.\n*   The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** perfectly fits these conditions:\n    *   Hydrogen sum: 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds.\n*   This confirms that a mixture fitting the description exists and that our calculation is correct.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.

The logic is synthesized from the common, correct reasoning found across the candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   **Clue:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   **Analysis:** A hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (since 1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `y = 2x`. Thus, the general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   **Clue:** Z is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"). A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ that is saturated must be a **cycloalkane**.\n    *   **Clue:** All reactions lead to Z, and Z is a \"widely used as a solvent\". This strongly implies a common and stable six-carbon ring structure.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The most logical identity for Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **. It fits the formula (n=6), is a cycloalkane, and is a common solvent. Its H mass fraction is 12 / (6*12 + 12) = 12/84 = 1/7.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n    *   **Clue:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One component is Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   **Clue:** Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z.\n    *   **Analysis:** Let the components of Y be cyclohexane and another substance, Y₂. The hydrogenation of Y₂ must also produce cyclohexane, meaning Y₂ has a six-carbon skeleton. Since Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be an alkene. The only substance fitting these criteria is **benzene (C₆H₆)**, which is aromatic and unreactive with bromine water but hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Find the Total Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**\n    *   **Clue:** An equimolar mixture X is converted into an equimolar mixture Y via disproportionation on a heated platinum catalyst.\n    *   **Analysis:** A disproportionation in this context involves hydrogen transfer. Since the mixtures are equimolar, the stoichiometry is 1:1. The reaction is:\n        `(Liquid A from X) + (Liquid B from X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n    *   According to the **law of conservation of atoms**, the total number of atoms on the reactant side must equal the total number of atoms on the product side. We can sum the hydrogen atoms on the product side to find the total in the reactants.\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n        Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\", which must be equal to the total in the products. Therefore, the answer is 18.\n\n### Final Verification and Answer Selection\n\nThe logic consistently and robustly leads to the number 18. We can check for a plausible mixture X: the components must be C₆ cyclic unsaturated molecules with no conjugated bonds, and their hydrogen atoms must sum to 18. **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fit all criteria (10 + 8 = 18; both unsaturated; no conjugated bonds). This confirms the result.\n\nThe calculated answer is 18.

This value is equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (since 1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n2.  **Determine Empirical Formula:** Let the formula be CₓHᵧ. Using the atomic masses of Carbon (≈12) and Hydrogen (≈1), the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. This means the general formula for Z is **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n3.  **Determine Compound Type:** A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be either an alkene (with a double bond) or a cycloalkane. The problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which means it is a saturated compound. Therefore, **Z must be a cycloalkane**.\n4.  **Identify Specific Compound:** All compounds in the reaction scheme hydrogenate to form only Z, implying they all share a common carbon skeleton. The overall reaction involves disproportionation to form an aromatic compound (as we'll see in the next step), which strongly suggests a six-membered ring skeleton. The most common C₆ cycloalkane that is a \"widely used as a solvent\" is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This identity fits all the given criteria perfectly.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n1.  **Analyze Properties of Y:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of the liquids is Z (cyclohexane). The mixture \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" which means its components must be saturated (like an alkane/cycloalkane) or aromatic.\n2.  **Identify the Second Component:** Let the second component be Y₂. Since the hydrogenation of the entire mixture Y gives only cyclohexane, the hydrogenation of Y₂ must also produce cyclohexane. Therefore, Y₂ must have a C₆ ring skeleton. Since Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water but can be hydrogenated, it cannot be a cyclohexene. The only logical choice is an aromatic compound, specifically **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water but is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n3.  **Conclusion for Y:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Use Conservation of Mass to Find the Answer\nThe core of the problem can be solved by applying the Law of Conservation of Mass to the reaction that converts mixture X into mixture Y.\n1.  **Define the Reaction:** The reaction is a disproportionation (in this context, an intermolecular hydrogen transfer) where an equimolar mixture X (of liquids X₁ and X₂) is converted to an equimolar mixture Y.\n    `X₁ + X₂ → Y₁ + Y₂`\n2.  **Substitute Known Products:** We identified Y₁ and Y₂ as cyclohexane and benzene.\n    `X₁ + X₂ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Hydrogen Atoms:** The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of a chemical equation. The question asks for \"the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\", which is the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of X₁ and one molecule of X₂. This sum must equal the total number of hydrogens in the products.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This result is independent of the exact structures of the liquids in mixture X, relying only on the identities of the products and the law of conservation of mass. It can be further verified that a plausible mixture X (cyclohexene, C₆H₁₀, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene, C₆H₈) fits all criteria and has a total of 10 + 8 = 18 hydrogen atoms.\n\nComparing the numerical result with the given options:\nA) 22\nB) 16\nC) 18\nD) 12\n\nThe calculated answer of 18 corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the final answer, carefully synthesizing the correct logic from the provided candidate solutions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z.**\n    *   **Information given:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. It is the final product of hydrogenation, meaning it is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"). It is also a widely used solvent.\n    *   **Analysis:** The mass fraction 14.28% is numerically equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 and solving for the ratio of y to x gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   Since Z is a saturated hydrocarbon, it must be a cycloalkane (an alkene would be unsaturated).\n    *   Given that all compounds in the reaction scheme hydrogenate to Z, they must share a common carbon skeleton. The involvement of disproportionation leading to a very stable compound often points towards a six-membered ring system. The most common six-carbon cycloalkane used as a solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits the formula CₙH₂ₙ for n=6 and satisfies all conditions.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y.**\n    *   **Information given:** Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. Z (cyclohexane) is a component of Y. Hydrogenation of Y yields only Z.\n    *   **Analysis:** Let the two components of Y be Y₁ and Y₂. We know Y₁ is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Since hydrogenation of the entire mixture Y gives only cyclohexane, the hydrogenation of Y₂ must also produce cyclohexane. This means Y₂ has a six-carbon skeleton.\n    *   Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water. This rules out common alkenes. The only compound with a six-carbon skeleton that does not decolorize bromine water but can be hydrogenated (under severe conditions) to cyclohexane is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n    *   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction from X to Y and Calculate the Final Answer.**\n    *   **Information given:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to an equimolar mixture Y via disproportionation. This reaction is a hydrogen transfer.\n    *   **Analysis:** The reaction stoichiometry is 1:1 between the components. Let the two liquids in mixture X be X₁ and X₂.\n        Reaction: `X₁ + X₂ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. According to the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n        Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is **18**.\n\n4.  **Consistency Check.**\n    *   To ensure the solution is sound, we must check if a plausible Mixture X exists that fits the description: two liquids, decolorizes bromine water (unsaturated), no conjugated multiple bonds, and a total hydrogen count of 18 for two molecules.\n    *   The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits perfectly.\n        *   Their hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18.\n        *   Both are unsaturated and have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n        *   Cyclohexene has one double bond (not conjugated). 1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated double bonds (the conjugated isomer is 1,3-cyclohexadiene, which is ruled out).\n    *   The existence of this valid pair confirms our result based on conservation of mass.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids that constitute mixture X is 18.

For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is therefore **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Information:** Z is a product of hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\"\n*   **Analysis:** This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   **Information:** Hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y gives *only* Z, and Z is a \"widely used as a solvent.\"\n*   **Analysis:** The fact that all precursors form Z implies a common carbon skeleton. The chemical reaction described (disproportionation involving unsaturated compounds) strongly suggests a six-membered ring system, which allows for the formation of a stable aromatic ring. The most common six-carbon cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits the formula, the properties, and the reaction context perfectly.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the components of mixture Y.**\n*   **Information:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. Z (cyclohexane) is one component.\n*   **Analysis:** Not decolorizing bromine water means the components are saturated or aromatic. Let the second component be Y₂.\n*   **Information:** Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   **Analysis:** Since one component is already cyclohexane, the hydrogenation of the other component, Y₂, must also yield cyclohexane. This means Y₂ has a C₆ ring skeleton. For Y₂ to be hydrogenated but not react with bromine water, it must be aromatic. The only such C₆ compound is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the reaction and solve the problem.**\n*   **Information:** An equimolar mixture X is heated with platinum to form an equimolar mixture Y via disproportionation.\n*   **Analysis:** Disproportionation, in this organic chemistry context, refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction where some molecules are reduced (gain hydrogen) and others are oxidized (lose hydrogen). Since the mixtures are equimolar, the overall reaction stoichiometry between the components is 1:1.\n    *   Let the two liquids in mixture X be X₁ and X₂.\n    *   The reaction is: **X₁ + X₂ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆**\n*   **Core Principle (Law of Conservation of Mass):** The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the chemical equation.\n*   **Calculation:** The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (i.e., in one molecule of X₁ plus one molecule of X₂). This total must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n**Step 4: Final verification (optional but helpful).**\n*   We can confirm that a valid Mixture X exists. The components must be C₆ unsaturated rings without conjugated bonds, and their total hydrogen count must be 18.\n*   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fit all criteria:\n    *   **Hydrogen sum:** 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   **Unsaturation:** Both have double bonds and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   **Non-conjugated:** 1,4-cyclohexadiene's double bonds are isolated, satisfying the condition.\n*   This confirms our calculation based on conservation of mass is correct.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 12\nB) 16\nC) 22\nD) 18\n\nThe correct answer is 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nBased on the analysis of the provided solutions and the problem statement, here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to reach the final answer.\n\n**1. Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   **Key Information:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. It is a saturated compound (product of hydrogenation that doesn't react further with hydrogen) and a widely used solvent.\n*   **Reasoning:**\n    *   The hydrogen mass percentage of 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` gives the relationship `y = 2x`. Therefore, Z has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   Since Z is saturated, it must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Considering it's a common solvent and the parent compound for the other C6-ring molecules in the reaction, Z is confidently identified as **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. All candidate answers correctly deduce this.\n\n**2. Identification of the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   **Key Information:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One component is Z (cyclohexane), and hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n*   **Reasoning:**\n    *   Let the components of Y be Y₁ and Y₂. We know Y₁ is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n    *   Since hydrogenation of the entire mixture Y gives only cyclohexane, the hydrogenation of Y₂ must also produce cyclohexane. This means Y₂ has a six-carbon skeleton.\n    *   Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water, ruling out alkenes. An aromatic compound fits this description.\n    *   The only compound that has a C₆ skeleton, can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane, and does not decolorize bromine water is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n    *   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**. This is another point of universal agreement among the candidate solutions.\n\n**3. The Core Calculation: Finding the H-atom count of Mixture X**\n\n*   **Key Information:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to an equimolar mixture Y via disproportionation on a heated platinum catalyst.\n*   **Reasoning:**\n    *   A disproportionation reaction in this context is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X is oxidized (loses H atoms), and the other is reduced (gains H atoms).\n    *   The overall reaction can be written as:\n        `(Liquid 1 of X) + (Liquid 2 of X) → (Liquid 1 of Y) + (Liquid 2 of Y)`\n        `X₁ + X₂ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`\n    *   The most direct way to solve the problem is by applying the Law of Conservation of Atoms. The total number of atoms of each element must be identical on both sides of the equation.\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is simply the sum of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids that make up mixture X must be 18. This reasoning is consistent and correct across all provided solutions. The only variation among the candidates is the final letter choice, which is due to receiving differently ordered options. For the options provided in this prompt:\n\nA) 22\nB) 16\nC) 18\nD) 12\n\nThe calculated answer of 18 corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem to determine the final answer. The logical flow is consistent across the most accurate candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Percentage:** The hydrocarbon Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is numerically equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (since 1/7 ≈ 0.142857).\n2.  **Determine the General Formula:** For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen (using approximate atomic masses C=12, H=1) is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting this equal to 1/7 gives: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n    *   This simplifies to `7y = 12x + y`, then `6y = 12x`, which results in `y = 2x`.\n    *   Therefore, Z has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n3.  **Determine the Compound Type:** A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be an alkene or a cycloalkane. The problem states Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which means it is a saturated compound. This rules out an alkene, so Z must be a cycloalkane.\n4.  **Identify the Specific Compound:** All compounds in the reaction scheme hydrogenate to form only Z, implying they all share the same carbon skeleton. Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The chemical context, involving a disproportionation that produces an aromatic molecule (see Step 2), strongly suggests a six-membered ring is the common skeleton. The six-carbon cycloalkane is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **. This fits the formula CₙH₂ₙ (for n=6), the description as a common solvent, and all other problem conditions.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n\n1.  **Analyze the Properties of Mixture Y:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One liquid is Z (cyclohexane). The mixture \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components must be saturated or aromatic.\n2.  **Identify the Second Component:** Let the second component of Y be Y₂. We know:\n    *   Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y₂ yields only Z (cyclohexane). This means Y₂ must also have a six-carbon skeleton.\n    *   A six-carbon compound that can be hydrogenated but does not react with bromine water must be aromatic. The only such compound is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene requires severe conditions for hydrogenation, which is consistent with the problem statement.\n3.  **Conclusion for Mixture Y:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Use Conservation of Mass to Find the Answer\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction:** An equimolar mixture X is converted into an equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction on a heated platinum catalyst. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. The stoichiometry is:\n    `(Liquid 1 of X) + (Liquid 2 of X) → (cyclohexane) + (benzene)`\n2.  **Apply Conservation of Atoms:** The law of conservation of mass states that the total number of atoms for each element must be the same on both sides of a chemical reaction. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n3.  **Calculate the Total Hydrogen Atoms:**\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18\n\n### Careful Points & Verification\n\n*   **Conservation of Mass:** The most crucial point is that the total number of atoms is conserved. This allows us to find the total hydrogen content of the reactants (mixture X) by simply summing the hydrogen content of the known products (mixture Y), bypassing the need to definitively identify the exact components of X first.\n*   **Consistency Check:** The result can be verified by finding a plausible mixture X. The components of X must be unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water), have no conjugated bonds, and have a C₆ ring skeleton. A mixture of **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits all criteria perfectly. Their hydrogen atoms sum to 10 + 8 = 18, confirming the result. 1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated, as required.\n\nThe final answer is the total number of hydrogen atoms, which is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis is a complex stoichiometry and organic chemistry problem. Let's break it down step-by-step, verifying each piece of information.\n\n### Careful Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance Z**\n\n*   **Clue 1: Hydrocarbon with 14.28% H by mass.**\n    The mass percentage of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is almost exactly 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. This means the substance has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Clue 2: Saturated.**\n    A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be either an alkene (with one double bond) or a cycloalkane. Since Z is the final product of hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen\", it must be a saturated molecule. Therefore, Z is a **cycloalkane**.\n*   **Clue 3: Single product and widely used solvent.**\n    The fact that hydrogenation of *both* mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* Z implies that all precursor compounds share the same carbon skeleton. The context of the reaction (disproportionation leading to an aromatic product, as we will see) strongly suggests a six-membered ring. The most common six-carbon cycloalkane that is widely used as a solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits the CₙH₂ₙ formula (n=6) and all the clues perfectly.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   **Clue 1: Equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water.**\n    This means the components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   **Clue 2: Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is a constituent.**\n    So, Y₁ is cyclohexane. Let's call the second liquid Y₂.\n*   **Clue 3: Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.**\n    Since Y₁ is already cyclohexane, this means the hydrogenation of Y₂ must also yield cyclohexane. Therefore, Y₂ must have a six-carbon skeleton.\n*   **Conclusion:** We need a C₆-skeleton liquid (Y₂) that does not decolorize bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. The only logical candidate is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, making it unreactive to bromine water under normal conditions, but it can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions (high pressure/temperature with a catalyst).\n*   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Solve the Question**\n\n*   **Clue: An equimolar mixture X is treated with platinum when heated to form an equimolar mixture Y via disproportionation.**\n    A disproportionation reaction, in this organic chemistry context, is a type of redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. Here, it is a hydrogen transfer: one molecule is reduced (gains hydrogen) and another is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n*   **Reaction Stoichiometry:** Since the starting and ending mixtures are equimolar, the reaction can be written with a 1:1 stoichiometry for the components. Let the two liquids in mixture X be X₁ and X₂.\n    `X₁ + X₂ → Y₁ + Y₂`\n*   **Applying the Law of Conservation of Mass:** Substituting the known identities of Y₁ and Y₂, we get:\n    `X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n    The total number of atoms of each element must be conserved. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18\n    Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is **18**.\n\n**Step 4: Final Verification (Consistency Check)**\n\n*   Does a valid Mixture X exist? Its components (X₁ and X₂) must:\n    1.  Be liquids with a C₆ skeleton.\n    2.  Decolorize bromine water (be unsaturated).\n    3.  Have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    4.  Have a total of 18 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Let's test the pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    1.  C₆ skeleton: Yes.\n    2.  Unsaturated: Yes, both have double bonds and decolorize Br₂ water.\n    3.  Non-conjugated: Yes. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated double bonds, unlike its conjugated isomer 1,3-cyclohexadiene. Cyclohexene has only one double bond. This condition is met.\n    4.  Total H atoms: 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our calculation perfectly.\n*   The existence of this plausible pair confirms the result obtained from the law of conservation of mass.\n\nThe final answer is the total number of hydrogen atoms, which is 18. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem, drawing upon the logical consensus from the candidate answers.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   **Information:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. It is the final product of hydrogenation, meaning it is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"). It is also a common solvent.\n    *   **Calculation:** The hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n        *   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n        *   Solving for the ratio gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   **Deduction:** The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. Since Z is a saturated hydrocarbon, it must be a cycloalkane (an alkene would be unsaturated). Given that Z is a common solvent and is the ultimate product of all reactions in the scheme, the most logical candidate is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits the CₙH₂ₙ formula, is a widely used solvent, and its C₆ skeleton is consistent with the subsequent reaction analysis.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n    *   **Information:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One component is Z (cyclohexane). It does not decolorize bromine water, and its complete hydrogenation yields only Z.\n    *   **Deduction:** Let the components of Y be Y₁ and Y₂. We know Y₁ is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Since hydrogenation of the entire mixture gives only cyclohexane, the hydrogenation of Y₂ must also produce cyclohexane. This means Y₂ has a six-carbon ring skeleton. The fact that Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water but can be hydrogenated points to it being an aromatic compound, not an alkene.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The only compound fitting these criteria is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Find the Total Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**\n    *   **Information:** An equimolar mixture X is converted into an equimolar mixture Y via disproportionation on a heated platinum catalyst.\n    *   **Reaction:** Let the two components of mixture X be X₁ and X₂. The reaction can be written with 1:1 stoichiometry:\n        `X₁ + X₂ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`\n    *   **Conservation of Atoms:** The fundamental principle of conservation of atoms states that the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of a chemical reaction. The question asks for \"the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X\", which is the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of X₁ and one molecule of X₂. This sum must be equal to the total number of hydrogens in the products.\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene)\n        Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   **Result:** Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is **18**.\n\n4.  **Final Verification (Optional)**\n    *   We can confirm this result by identifying plausible molecules for mixture X. They must be unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water), have C₆ skeletons, have no conjugated bonds, and their total hydrogen count must be 18.

This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer. The logic synthesizes the correct reasoning paths identified in the candidate answers.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   **Clue:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   **Analysis:** The value 14.28% is the decimal representation of the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `(y × 1.008) / (x × 12.011 + y × 1.008)`. Using simplified integer masses (H=1, C=12), the fraction is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n    *   This gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   **Conclusion:** The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. This corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n*   **Clue:** Z is a final hydrogenation product and \"does not react further with hydrogen\".\n*   **Analysis:** This indicates that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂n must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   **Clue:** Z is a widely used solvent, and all reactants share its carbon skeleton. The context of the disproportionation reaction (see next step) strongly suggests a six-membered ring.\n*   **Final Identification:** The only C₆ cycloalkane is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **, which is a very common solvent and fits all conditions perfectly.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   **Clue:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water.\" Z (cyclohexane) is one component.\n*   **Analysis:** Not decolorizing bromine water means the components are either saturated (like cyclohexane) or aromatic.\n*   **Clue:** Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives *only* cyclohexane.\n*   **Analysis:** The second component of Y must also have a C₆ carbon skeleton and hydrogenate to give cyclohexane. Since this second component doesn't react with bromine water, it cannot be a simple alkene. The only compound fitting these criteria is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, so it is unreactive with bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Final Answer**\n\n*   **Clue:** An equimolar mixture X undergoes disproportionation upon heating with platinum to form the equimolar mixture Y.\n*   **Analysis:** Disproportionation, in this chemical context, is a hydrogen transfer reaction. Because both mixtures are equimolar, the reaction stoichiometry for the components is 1:1. The overall transformation is:\n    `(Liquid 1 of X) + (Liquid 2 of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Application of Law of Conservation of Mass:** The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18\n\n**Careful Points & Verification:**\n*   The problem states that mixture X decolorizes bromine water (it is unsaturated) and has no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   We can check if such a mixture X can exist. A plausible composition for X would be **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   **Hydrogen sum:** 10 + 8 = 18. (Matches our calculation)\n    *   **Unsaturation:** Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   **No Conjugation:** Cyclohexene has one double bond. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds. The conjugated isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, is excluded by the problem statement.\n*   The existence of this valid pair confirms that our calculation based on conservation of mass is correct and consistent with all the chemical details provided.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) 22\nB) 18\nC) 16\nD) 12\n\nThe calculated answer, 18, corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to arrive at the correct answer. The process synthesizes the core logic present in the successful candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z\n\nThe first crucial step is to determine the identity of substance Z. We are given several key pieces of information:\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%.\n*   Z is the final product of hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a fully saturated compound.\n*   Hydrogenation of all compounds in the reaction scheme leads to Z, implying they all share a common carbon skeleton.\n*   Z is a widely used solvent.\n\nTo determine the formula, we use the mass fraction of hydrogen. A hydrogen percentage of 14.28% is numerically equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `Mass_H / (Mass_C + Mass_H)`. Using approximate integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1), this becomes:\n`y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\nSolving for the relationship between x and y:\n`7y = 12x + y`\n`6y = 12x`\n`y = 2x`\n\nThis gives Z a general formula of CₙH₂ₙ. A hydrocarbon with this formula that is also saturated must be a **cycloalkane**. Given the context of the problem (involving disproportionation which often occurs in ring systems) and its use as a common solvent, the most probable identity for Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This choice fits all the given criteria perfectly.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n\nNext, we identify the two liquids in the equimolar mixture Y:\n*   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components must be saturated or aromatic.\n*   Substance Z (cyclohexane) is a component of mixture Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of the entire mixture Y under severe conditions yields only Z (cyclohexane).\n\nSince one component is cyclohexane (Y₁ = C₆H₁₂), the other component (Y₂) must also hydrogenate to produce cyclohexane. This means Y₂ must also possess a six-carbon ring skeleton. For Y₂ to not decolorize bromine water but still be reducible to cyclohexane, it cannot be a simple alkene. The only logical choice is an aromatic compound, specifically **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water but hydrogenates to cyclohexane under the described severe conditions.\nTherefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Answer\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the transformation of mixture X into mixture Y.\n*   An equimolar mixture X of two liquids (let's call them X₁ and X₂) is converted into the equimolar mixture Y upon heating with a platinum catalyst.\n*   The reaction is described as a disproportionation, which in this context is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one species is hydrogenated (reduced) and another is dehydrogenated (oxidized).\n*   The overall stoichiometry of the reaction is:\n    `X₁ + X₂ → Y₁ + Y₂`\n*   Substituting the identified components of Y, we get:\n    `X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n\nTo find the total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X, we apply the **Law of Conservation of Atoms**. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both the reactant and product sides of the equation. Since the carbon skeleton is C₆ for all species, the carbons are balanced. We can now balance the hydrogen atoms:\n*   Total H atoms in reactants (X₁ + X₂) = Total H atoms in products (C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆)\n*   Total H atoms = 12 + 6\n*   Total H atoms = 18\n\nThe question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\", which is precisely this sum.\n\n### Step 4: Consistency Check (Verification)\n\nWe can check if a plausible Mixture X exists that fits all the conditions: its two components must decolorize bromine water (be unsaturated), have no conjugated double bonds, possess a C₆ skeleton, and have a total of 18 hydrogen atoms.\nA plausible pair is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   **Total Hydrogen Atoms**: 10 + 8 = 18. (Correct)\n*   **Unsaturation**: Both have double bonds and will decolorize bromine water. (Correct)\n*   **No Conjugation**: Cyclohexene has one double bond. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has two isolated double bonds, which are not conjugated (unlike the 1,3-isomer). (Correct)\n*   **Hydrogenation**: Both will hydrogenate to form cyclohexane. (Correct)\nThe existence of this plausible mixture confirms that our answer of 18 is correct and the problem is chemically sound.\n\nBased on the calculation, the total number of hydrogen atoms is 18. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, with careful attention paid to each condition provided in the question.\n\n### **Reasoning and Analysis**\n\n**1. Identification of Substance Z**\n\nThe first and most critical step is to identify the hydrocarbon Z, which serves as the anchor for the entire problem.\n\n*   **Analyze the Chemical Formula from Mass Fraction:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This value is the decimal equivalent of the fraction 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n    *   For a hydrocarbon with the general formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen can be expressed as `y / (12x + y)`, using simplified integer atomic masses.\n    *   Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`.\n    *   Solving for the relationship between x and y: `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   This establishes the general formula of Z as **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Analyze the Chemical Properties:**\n    *   A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which means it is a **saturated** compound. This rules out the possibility of it being an alkene. Therefore, Z must be a **cycloalkane**.\n    *   The fact that hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y gives *only* Z implies that all precursor compounds share the same carbon skeleton.\n*   **Identify the Specific Compound:** Given the reaction involves disproportionation (often involving the formation of a stable aromatic ring) and Z is a \"widely used as a solvent\", the most logical carbon skeleton is a six-membered ring. The C₆ cycloalkane is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**, a very common solvent, which perfectly fits the CₙH₂ₙ formula and all other conditions.\n\n**2. Identification of the Components of Mixture Y**\n\nWith Z identified as cyclohexane, we can determine the composition of mixture Y.\n\n*   **Analyze the Properties of Mixture Y:** It is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic. We know one component is Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂).\n*   **Identify the Second Component:** Let the other component be Y₂.\n    *   Hydrogenation of the entire mixture Y yields only cyclohexane. Therefore, the hydrogenation of Y₂ must also produce cyclohexane, meaning Y₂ has a C₆ ring skeleton.\n    *   Since Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a cyclohexene. The only C₆ ring compound that can be hydrogenated but is unreactive towards bromine water is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Answer**\n\nThe final step connects mixture X to mixture Y.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** An equimolar mixture X is converted into an equimolar mixture Y via **disproportionation** when heated with platinum. In this context, this is a hydrogen transfer reaction. The stoichiometry is 1:1.\n    *   Let the two liquids in mixture X be X₁ and X₂.\n    *   The reaction is: `X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Apply the Law of Conservation of Atoms:** The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the chemical equation. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This sum must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n### **Careful Points & Final Verification**\n\n*   **The Power of Conservation Laws:** The solution relies fundamentally on the law of conservation of atoms. This is a very robust method that allows us to determine the total hydrogen content of the reactants (mixture X) without needing to know their exact identities first.\n*   **Plausibility Check:** We can verify that a chemically plausible mixture X exists. Its components must be C₆ unsaturated ring compounds, must have no conjugated double bonds, and their combined hydrogen atoms must sum to 18. The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** perfectly fits all criteria.\n    *   Total H atoms: 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds, satisfying the constraint.\n    *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` represents a valid hydrogen transfer (disproportionation). This confirms our result is chemically sound.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>"

This value is numerically equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (since 1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n*   **Determine the General Formula:** For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `y / (12x + y)`, using integer atomic masses for simplicity (C=12, H=1). Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`. Solving this leads to `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   **Identify the Class of Hydrocarbon:** The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. A hydrocarbon with this formula can be either an alkene (containing a double bond) or a cycloalkane (a ring structure).\n*   **Use Saturation Information:** The problem states that Z is a product of hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This means Z is a saturated compound, which rules out the possibility of it being an alkene. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Identify the Specific Compound:** All compounds in the problem hydrogenate to *only* Z, implying they all share a common carbon skeleton. Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The most common and simple cycloalkane fitting these criteria, and which allows for the subsequent reaction steps (involving an aromatic ring), is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This choice fits the formula CₙH₂ₙ for n=6 and all other properties.\n\n**Step 2: Identification of the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   **Analyze the Properties of Mixture Y:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. It \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   **Identify the Known Component:** We have already established that substance Z, **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**, is one of the components of mixture Y.\n*   **Identify the Unknown Component:** Let's call the second component Y₂. We know two key things about it:\n    1.  Hydrogenation of Y₂ must produce only cyclohexane (since the whole mixture hydrogenates to Z). This means Y₂ must also have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n    2.  Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water. This rules out cycloalkenes.\n    The only compound with a six-carbon ring skeleton that can be hydrogenated but does not react with bromine water is an aromatic compound. Therefore, Y₂ must be **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   **Conclusion for Mixture Y:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Total Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**\n\n*   **Understand the Reaction:** Mixture X is converted to Mixture Y through a \"disproportionation\" reaction when heated with a platinum catalyst. In this chemical context, disproportionation means a hydrogen transfer reaction where one molecule is reduced (gains hydrogen) and another is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n*   **Apply the Law of Conservation of Mass:** Since both mixtures are equimolar, the overall reaction stoichiometry can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `Liquid X₁ + Liquid X₂ → Liquid Y₁ + Liquid Y₂`\n    Substituting the known components of Y:\n    `Liquid X₁ + Liquid X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Calculate the Total Hydrogen Atoms:** The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. According to the law of conservation of atoms, this total must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in Cyclohexane) + (H atoms in Benzene)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n**Step 4: Verification and Careful Check of Constraints**\n\n*   This step is crucial to ensure our solution is fully consistent with all parts of the problem statement. We must verify that a plausible Mixture X exists.\n*   The components of X must be:\n    1.  Two different liquids with C₆ ring skeletons.\n    2.  They must decolorize bromine water (be unsaturated).\n    3.  They must *not* have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    4.  The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each must be 18.\n*   Let's consider possible unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds: Cyclohexene is C₆H₁₀. Cyclohexadienes are C₆H₈.\n*   The sum 10 + 8 = 18, so a mixture of **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and a **cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** is a perfect candidate.\n*   The specific cyclohexadiene must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**, because its double bonds are isolated and therefore not conjugated. The alternative, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, has conjugated double bonds and is explicitly ruled out by the problem statement.\n*   This plausible composition for Mixture X ({cyclohexene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene}) perfectly fits all conditions, verifying that our calculation of 18 hydrogen atoms is correct.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, highlighting the key points necessary to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning and Careful Points\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z.**\n    *   **Chemical Formula:** The first clue is that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the relationship `y = 2x`. Thus, Z has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n    *   **Saturation:** The problem states Z \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ that is saturated cannot be an alkene and must therefore be a **cycloalkane**.\n    *   **Common Skeleton:** A critical point is that hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* substance Z. This implies that all components in both mixtures share the same carbon skeleton as Z. The reaction type (disproportionation to an aromatic compound) strongly suggests this skeleton is a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Conclusion for Z:** The most common six-carbon cycloalkane that is a widely used solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **. This identification is consistent with all the facts.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y.**\n    *   **Properties:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components must be either saturated (like Z) or aromatic.\n    *   **Known Component:** We are told Z is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one liquid is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **.\n    *   **Identifying the Second Component:** The other liquid must also hydrogenate to give only cyclohexane (due to the common skeleton rule). Since it does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only remaining possibility for a C₆ compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane but is unreactive with bromine water is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n    *   **Conclusion for Y:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Total Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X.**\n    *   **The Reaction:** The core of the problem lies in the reaction `Mixture X → Mixture Y`, which is a **disproportionation** reaction on a platinum catalyst. In this context, it is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one component is reduced and another is oxidized.\n    *   **Stoichiometry and Conservation of Mass:** Since both X and Y are equimolar mixtures, the reaction stoichiometry is 1:1. Let the components of X be X₁ and X₂.\n        `X₁ + X₂ → cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + benzene (C₆H₆)`\n    *   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms on the reactant side must equal the total on the product side. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is simply the sum of the hydrogens in one molecule of X₁ and one molecule of X₂.\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        Total H atoms in X = Total H atoms in Y\n        Total H atoms in X = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆)\n        Total H atoms in X = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n4.  **Verification and Final Check (A crucial \"careful point\").**\n    *   To ensure the entire scenario is chemically plausible, we must check if a mixture X exists that fits all the remaining criteria: its two components decolorize bromine water (are unsaturated) and have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   The sum of hydrogen atoms in the two components (both C₆ compounds) must be 18. Plausible candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and a cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n        *   Total hydrogens: 10 + 8 = 18. This works.\n        *   The diene must be non-conjugated. **1,4-cyclohexadiene** has isolated double bonds, while 1,3-cyclohexadiene is conjugated. Therefore, the diene must be 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n    *   Thus, a valid Mixture X is {cyclohexene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene}. All conditions of the problem are met, confirming that the calculation based on conservation of mass is correct.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on a careful analysis of the problem and the provided candidate answers, here is a consolidated, step-by-step reasoning to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Detailed Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the identity of hydrocarbon Z.**\n\n*   **Analyze the chemical formula from the mass fraction:** The problem states Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This value is very close to the fraction 1/7 (since 1/7 ≈ 0.142857).\n*   For a hydrocarbon with the general formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen (using approximate atomic masses C=12, H=1) is `y / (12x + y)`.\n*   Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`.\n*   Solving this equation: `7y = 12x + y` -> `6y = 12x` -> `y = 2x`.\n*   This shows that the general formula for Z is **CₙH₂ₙ**. This formula corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n*   **Analyze the chemical properties:** The problem states that Z is a product of hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This indicates that Z is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   **Identify the specific compound:** All the compounds in the problem hydrogenate to form *only* Z, implying they all share the same carbon skeleton. Z is also a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The chemical reactions described (disproportionation involving an aromatic compound) strongly suggest a six-membered ring structure. The most common six-carbon cycloalkane used as a solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits the CₙH₂ₙ formula and all the given conditions.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the composition of mixture Y.**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. It \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is Z, which we have identified as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   Hydrogenation of the entire mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means the other component of Y must also have a six-carbon skeleton and must form cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   Since this other component does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a simple alkene. The only logical identity is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, does not react with bromine water under these conditions, but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the reaction from X to Y and calculate the final answer.**\n\n*   The problem states that an equimolar mixture X is treated with a platinum catalyst upon heating to form the equimolar mixture Y. This transformation is described as a **disproportionation**, which in this context means a hydrogen transfer reaction.

The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on the reactant side and the product side.\n*   The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\". This is simply the sum of hydrogen atoms on the product side of the balanced equation.\n*   Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n*   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n**Careful Points & Verification:**\n\n*   **Consistency:** The logical flow is highly consistent. Identifying Z first is crucial. Using Z to identify the components of Y is the next step. Finally, applying the law of conservation of mass to the reaction that produces Y provides the answer directly, without needing to identify the exact components of X.\n*   **Plausibility Check:** We can verify that a valid mixture X exists. Its components must be unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water), have non-conjugated bonds, have a C₆ ring skeleton, and their total hydrogen count must be 18. The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** perfectly fits all criteria. (10 H + 8 H = 18 H; both are unsaturated; 1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated).\n\nThe calculation robustly shows the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) 12\nB) 22\nC) 16\nD) 18\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer. The key is to logically deduce the identities of the compounds involved.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance Z**\n\n*   **Analyze the chemical formula:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (since 1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). Let the formula for Z be CₓHᵧ. Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), we can set up the equation for the mass fraction of hydrogen:\n    `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n    Solving for the ratio of y to x:\n    `7y = 12x + y`\n    `6y = 12x`\n    `y = 2x`\n    This means the general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. This formula can represent either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n\n*   **Analyze the chemical properties:** The problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which indicates that it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane, not an alkene.\n\n*   **Identify the specific compound:** We are told that Z is a \"widely used as a solvent\" and is the sole product when all other mixtures are hydrogenated. This implies all components share a common carbon skeleton. Given the reaction context (disproportionation often involving aromatic systems), a six-membered ring is the most logical skeleton. A six-carbon cycloalkane (n=6) is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**, which is a common solvent and perfectly fits the CₙH₂ₙ formula.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   **Analyze the properties of Mixture Y:** It is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic. One component is Z (cyclohexane).\n*   **Identify the second component:** Let the other liquid be Y₂. Since hydrogenation of the entire mixture Y gives only cyclohexane, the hydrogenation of Y₂ must also produce cyclohexane. This means Y₂ has a six-carbon ring skeleton. As Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be an alkene. The only remaining possibility is an aromatic compound, specifically **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive towards bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n*   **Analyze the transformation:** An equimolar mixture X (of liquids X₁ and X₂) is converted to the equimolar mixture Y through a disproportionation reaction on a heated platinum catalyst. In this organic chemistry context, disproportionation means a hydrogen transfer reaction where one molecule is reduced (gains H) and another is oxidized (loses H).\n*   **Apply the Law of Conservation of Mass:** The overall reaction can be written as:\n    `X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the equation. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X₁ and one molecule of X₂.\n*   This sum must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products:\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This is directly derivable from the conservation of atoms in the chemical reaction, and it is consistent with plausible identities for the components of mixture X (cyclohexene, C₆H₁₀, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene, C₆H₈), which sum to 18 hydrogen atoms and meet all other conditions of the problem.\n\nComparing the result (18) to the given options:\nA) 16\nB) 18\nC) 12\nD) 22\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the logic from the candidate answers to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n**1. Identification of Substance Z**\n\n*   **Clue:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   **Analysis:** The mass percentage 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` and solving gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Clue:** Z \"does not react further with hydrogen.\"\n*   **Analysis:** This indicates that Z is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Clue:** Hydrogenation of all other substances in the problem yields only Z. This implies that all key compounds share the same carbon skeleton. The later steps involving disproportionation to an aromatic compound strongly suggest this is a six-membered ring.\n*   **Conclusion:** The substance Z is a six-carbon cycloalkane, which is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This compound is also a widely used solvent, fitting all clues.\n\n**2. Identification of Mixture Y**\n\n*   **Clue:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" and one component is Z (cyclohexane).\n*   **Analysis:** Since mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, its components must be either saturated or aromatic. We know one component is saturated (cyclohexane).\n*   **Clue:** Hydrogenation of mixture Y yields only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   **Analysis:** The second component of Y, let's call it Y₂, must also be a C₆-ring compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. For it to not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a simple alkene. The only substance fitting these criteria is **benzene (C₆H₆)**, which is aromatic and hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Reaction and Calculation**\n\n*   **Clue:** An equimolar mixture X is converted into an equimolar mixture Y via disproportionation on a heated platinum catalyst.\n*   **Analysis:** This describes a hydrogen transfer reaction. Since the starting and ending mixtures are both equimolar, the reaction stoichiometry for the components is 1:1. We can write the overall transformation as:\n    `Liquid X₁ + Liquid X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Principle of Conservation of Mass:** The total number of atoms of each element must be conserved. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This sum must be equal to the sum of the hydrogen atoms in the products.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18\n\n**4. Final Verification**\n\n*   To ensure our logic is sound, we can identify plausible components for mixture X. They must be C₆ cyclic compounds, must be unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water), must not have conjugated double bonds, and their total hydrogen count must be 18.\n*   The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** perfectly fits these conditions:\n    *   Hydrogen sum: 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds.\n*   This confirms that a mixture fitting the description exists and that our calculation is correct.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.

For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `y = 2x`. Thus, the general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   **Clue:** Z is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"). A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ that is saturated must be a **cycloalkane**.\n    *   **Clue:** All reactions lead to Z, and Z is a \"widely used as a solvent\". This strongly implies a common and stable six-carbon ring structure.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The most logical identity for Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **. It fits the formula (n=6), is a cycloalkane, and is a common solvent. Its H mass fraction is 12 / (6*12 + 12) = 12/84 = 1/7.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n    *   **Clue:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One component is Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   **Clue:** Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z.\n    *   **Analysis:** Let the components of Y be cyclohexane and another substance, Y₂. The hydrogenation of Y₂ must also produce cyclohexane, meaning Y₂ has a six-carbon skeleton. Since Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be an alkene. The only substance fitting these criteria is **benzene (C₆H₆)**, which is aromatic and unreactive with bromine water but hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Find the Total Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**\n    *   **Clue:** An equimolar mixture X is converted into an equimolar mixture Y via disproportionation on a heated platinum catalyst.\n    *   **Analysis:** A disproportionation in this context involves hydrogen transfer. Since the mixtures are equimolar, the stoichiometry is 1:1. The reaction is:\n        `(Liquid A from X) + (Liquid B from X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n    *   According to the **law of conservation of atoms**, the total number of atoms on the reactant side must equal the total number of atoms on the product side. We can sum the hydrogen atoms on the product side to find the total in the reactants.\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n        Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\", which must be equal to the total in the products. Therefore, the answer is 18.\n\n### Final Verification and Answer Selection\n\nThe logic consistently and robustly leads to the number 18. We can check for a plausible mixture X: the components must be C₆ cyclic unsaturated molecules with no conjugated bonds, and their hydrogen atoms must sum to 18. **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fit all criteria (10 + 8 = 18; both unsaturated; no conjugated bonds). This confirms the result.\n\nThe calculated answer is 18. Comparing this to the provided options:\nA) 22\nB) 12\nC) 16\nD) 18\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the most logical and consistent points from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\nThe first crucial step is to determine the chemical formula and identity of substance Z.\n1.  **Analyze Mass Percentage:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This value is equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (since 1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n2.  **Determine Empirical Formula:** Let the formula be CₓHᵧ. Using the atomic masses of Carbon (≈12) and Hydrogen (≈1), the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. This means the general formula for Z is **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n3.  **Determine Compound Type:** A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be either an alkene (with a double bond) or a cycloalkane. The problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which means it is a saturated compound. Therefore, **Z must be a cycloalkane**.\n4.  **Identify Specific Compound:** All compounds in the reaction scheme hydrogenate to form only Z, implying they all share a common carbon skeleton. The overall reaction involves disproportionation to form an aromatic compound (as we'll see in the next step), which strongly suggests a six-membered ring skeleton. The most common C₆ cycloalkane that is a \"widely used as a solvent\" is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This identity fits all the given criteria perfectly.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n1.  **Analyze Properties of Y:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of the liquids is Z (cyclohexane). The mixture \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" which means its components must be saturated (like an alkane/cycloalkane) or aromatic.\n2.  **Identify the Second Component:** Let the second component be Y₂. Since the hydrogenation of the entire mixture Y gives only cyclohexane, the hydrogenation of Y₂ must also produce cyclohexane. Therefore, Y₂ must have a C₆ ring skeleton. Since Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water but can be hydrogenated, it cannot be a cyclohexene. The only logical choice is an aromatic compound, specifically **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water but is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n3.  **Conclusion for Y:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Use Conservation of Mass to Find the Answer\nThe core of the problem can be solved by applying the Law of Conservation of Mass to the reaction that converts mixture X into mixture Y.\n1.  **Define the Reaction:** The reaction is a disproportionation (in this context, an intermolecular hydrogen transfer) where an equimolar mixture X (of liquids X₁ and X₂) is converted to an equimolar mixture Y.\n    `X₁ + X₂ → Y₁ + Y₂`\n2.  **Substitute Known Products:** We identified Y₁ and Y₂ as cyclohexane and benzene.\n    `X₁ + X₂ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Hydrogen Atoms:** The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of a chemical equation. The question asks for \"the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\", which is the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of X₁ and one molecule of X₂. This sum must equal the total number of hydrogens in the products.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This result is independent of the exact structures of the liquids in mixture X, relying only on the identities of the products and the law of conservation of mass. It can be further verified that a plausible mixture X (cyclohexene, C₆H₁₀, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene, C₆H₈) fits all criteria and has a total of 10 + 8 = 18 hydrogen atoms.\n\nComparing the numerical result with the given options:\nA) 22\nB) 16\nC) 18\nD) 12\n\nThe calculated answer of 18 corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the final answer, carefully synthesizing the correct logic from the provided candidate solutions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z.**\n    *   **Information given:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. It is the final product of hydrogenation, meaning it is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"). It is also a widely used solvent.\n    *   **Analysis:** The mass fraction 14.28% is numerically equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 and solving for the ratio of y to x gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   Since Z is a saturated hydrocarbon, it must be a cycloalkane (an alkene would be unsaturated).\n    *   Given that all compounds in the reaction scheme hydrogenate to Z, they must share a common carbon skeleton. The involvement of disproportionation leading to a very stable compound often points towards a six-membered ring system. The most common six-carbon cycloalkane used as a solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits the formula CₙH₂ₙ for n=6 and satisfies all conditions.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y.**\n    *   **Information given:** Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. Z (cyclohexane) is a component of Y. Hydrogenation of Y yields only Z.\n    *   **Analysis:** Let the two components of Y be Y₁ and Y₂. We know Y₁ is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Since hydrogenation of the entire mixture Y gives only cyclohexane, the hydrogenation of Y₂ must also produce cyclohexane. This means Y₂ has a six-carbon skeleton.\n    *   Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water. This rules out common alkenes. The only compound with a six-carbon skeleton that does not decolorize bromine water but can be hydrogenated (under severe conditions) to cyclohexane is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n    *   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction from X to Y and Calculate the Final Answer.**\n    *   **Information given:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to an equimolar mixture Y via disproportionation. This reaction is a hydrogen transfer.\n    *   **Analysis:** The reaction stoichiometry is 1:1 between the components. Let the two liquids in mixture X be X₁ and X₂.\n        Reaction: `X₁ + X₂ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. According to the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n        Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is **18**.\n\n4.  **Consistency Check.**\n    *   To ensure the solution is sound, we must check if a plausible Mixture X exists that fits the description: two liquids, decolorizes bromine water (unsaturated), no conjugated multiple bonds, and a total hydrogen count of 18 for two molecules.\n    *   The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits perfectly.\n        *   Their hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18.\n        *   Both are unsaturated and have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n        *   Cyclohexene has one double bond (not conjugated). 1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated double bonds (the conjugated isomer is 1,3-cyclohexadiene, which is ruled out).\n    *   The existence of this valid pair confirms our result based on conservation of mass.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids that constitute mixture X is 18.

For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is therefore **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Information:** Z is a product of hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\"\n*   **Analysis:** This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   **Information:** Hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y gives *only* Z, and Z is a \"widely used as a solvent.\"\n*   **Analysis:** The fact that all precursors form Z implies a common carbon skeleton. The chemical reaction described (disproportionation involving unsaturated compounds) strongly suggests a six-membered ring system, which allows for the formation of a stable aromatic ring. The most common six-carbon cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits the formula, the properties, and the reaction context perfectly.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the components of mixture Y.**\n*   **Information:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. Z (cyclohexane) is one component.\n*   **Analysis:** Not decolorizing bromine water means the components are saturated or aromatic. Let the second component be Y₂.\n*   **Information:** Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   **Analysis:** Since one component is already cyclohexane, the hydrogenation of the other component, Y₂, must also yield cyclohexane.

Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   **Key Information:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. It is a saturated compound (product of hydrogenation that doesn't react further with hydrogen) and a widely used solvent.\n*   **Reasoning:**\n    *   The hydrogen mass percentage of 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` gives the relationship `y = 2x`. Therefore, Z has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   Since Z is saturated, it must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Considering it's a common solvent and the parent compound for the other C6-ring molecules in the reaction, Z is confidently identified as **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. All candidate answers correctly deduce this.\n\n**2. Identification of the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   **Key Information:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One component is Z (cyclohexane), and hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n*   **Reasoning:**\n    *   Let the components of Y be Y₁ and Y₂. We know Y₁ is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n    *   Since hydrogenation of the entire mixture Y gives only cyclohexane, the hydrogenation of Y₂ must also produce cyclohexane. This means Y₂ has a six-carbon skeleton.\n    *   Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water, ruling out alkenes. An aromatic compound fits this description.\n    *   The only compound that has a C₆ skeleton, can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane, and does not decolorize bromine water is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n    *   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**. This is another point of universal agreement among the candidate solutions.\n\n**3. The Core Calculation: Finding the H-atom count of Mixture X**\n\n*   **Key Information:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to an equimolar mixture Y via disproportionation on a heated platinum catalyst.\n*   **Reasoning:**\n    *   A disproportionation reaction in this context is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X is oxidized (loses H atoms), and the other is reduced (gains H atoms).\n    *   The overall reaction can be written as:\n        `(Liquid 1 of X) + (Liquid 2 of X) → (Liquid 1 of Y) + (Liquid 2 of Y)`\n        `X₁ + X₂ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`\n    *   The most direct way to solve the problem is by applying the Law of Conservation of Atoms. The total number of atoms of each element must be identical on both sides of the equation.\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is simply the sum of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids that make up mixture X must be 18. This reasoning is consistent and correct across all provided solutions. The only variation among the candidates is the final letter choice, which is due to receiving differently ordered options. For the options provided in this prompt:\n\nA) 22\nB) 16\nC) 18\nD) 12\n\nThe calculated answer of 18 corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem to determine the final answer. The logical flow is consistent across the most accurate candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Percentage:** The hydrocarbon Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is numerically equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (since 1/7 ≈ 0.142857).\n2.  **Determine the General Formula:** For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen (using approximate atomic masses C=12, H=1) is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting this equal to 1/7 gives: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n    *   This simplifies to `7y = 12x + y`, then `6y = 12x`, which results in `y = 2x`.\n    *   Therefore, Z has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n3.  **Determine the Compound Type:** A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be an alkene or a cycloalkane. The problem states Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which means it is a saturated compound. This rules out an alkene, so Z must be a cycloalkane.\n4.  **Identify the Specific Compound:** All compounds in the reaction scheme hydrogenate to form only Z, implying they all share the same carbon skeleton. Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The chemical context, involving a disproportionation that produces an aromatic molecule (see Step 2), strongly suggests a six-membered ring is the common skeleton. The six-carbon cycloalkane is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **. This fits the formula CₙH₂ₙ (for n=6), the description as a common solvent, and all other problem conditions.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n\n1.  **Analyze the Properties of Mixture Y:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One liquid is Z (cyclohexane). The mixture \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components must be saturated or aromatic.\n2.  **Identify the Second Component:** Let the second component of Y be Y₂. We know:\n    *   Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y₂ yields only Z (cyclohexane). This means Y₂ must also have a six-carbon skeleton.\n    *   A six-carbon compound that can be hydrogenated but does not react with bromine water must be aromatic. The only such compound is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene requires severe conditions for hydrogenation, which is consistent with the problem statement.\n3.  **Conclusion for Mixture Y:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Use Conservation of Mass to Find the Answer\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction:** An equimolar mixture X is converted into an equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction on a heated platinum catalyst. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. The stoichiometry is:\n    `(Liquid 1 of X) + (Liquid 2 of X) → (cyclohexane) + (benzene)`\n2.  **Apply Conservation of Atoms:** The law of conservation of mass states that the total number of atoms for each element must be the same on both sides of a chemical reaction. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n3.  **Calculate the Total Hydrogen Atoms:**\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18\n\n### Careful Points & Verification\n\n*   **Conservation of Mass:** The most crucial point is that the total number of atoms is conserved. This allows us to find the total hydrogen content of the reactants (mixture X) by simply summing the hydrogen content of the known products (mixture Y), bypassing the need to definitively identify the exact components of X first.\n*   **Consistency Check:** The result can be verified by finding a plausible mixture X. The components of X must be unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water), have no conjugated bonds, and have a C₆ ring skeleton. A mixture of **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits all criteria perfectly. Their hydrogen atoms sum to 10 + 8 = 18, confirming the result. 1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated, as required.\n\nThe final answer is the total number of hydrogen atoms, which is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis is a complex stoichiometry and organic chemistry problem. Let's break it down step-by-step, verifying each piece of information.\n\n### Careful Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance Z**\n\n*   **Clue 1: Hydrocarbon with 14.28% H by mass.**\n    The mass percentage of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is almost exactly 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. This means the substance has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Clue 2: Saturated.**\n    A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be either an alkene (with one double bond) or a cycloalkane. Since Z is the final product of hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen\", it must be a saturated molecule. Therefore, Z is a **cycloalkane**.\n*   **Clue 3: Single product and widely used solvent.**\n    The fact that hydrogenation of *both* mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* Z implies that all precursor compounds share the same carbon skeleton. The context of the reaction (disproportionation leading to an aromatic product, as we will see) strongly suggests a six-membered ring. The most common six-carbon cycloalkane that is widely used as a solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits the CₙH₂ₙ formula (n=6) and all the clues perfectly.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   **Clue 1: Equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water.**\n    This means the components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   **Clue 2: Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is a constituent.**\n    So, Y₁ is cyclohexane. Let's call the second liquid Y₂.\n*   **Clue 3: Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.**\n    Since Y₁ is already cyclohexane, this means the hydrogenation of Y₂ must also yield cyclohexane. Therefore, Y₂ must have a six-carbon skeleton.\n*   **Conclusion:** We need a C₆-skeleton liquid (Y₂) that does not decolorize bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. The only logical candidate is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, making it unreactive to bromine water under normal conditions, but it can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions (high pressure/temperature with a catalyst).\n*   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Solve the Question**\n\n*   **Clue: An equimolar mixture X is treated with platinum when heated to form an equimolar mixture Y via disproportionation.**\n    A disproportionation reaction, in this organic chemistry context, is a type of redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. Here, it is a hydrogen transfer: one molecule is reduced (gains hydrogen) and another is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n*   **Reaction Stoichiometry:** Since the starting and ending mixtures are equimolar, the reaction can be written with a 1:1 stoichiometry for the components. Let the two liquids in mixture X be X₁ and X₂.\n    `X₁ + X₂ → Y₁ + Y₂`\n*   **Applying the Law of Conservation of Mass:** Substituting the known identities of Y₁ and Y₂, we get:\n    `X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n    The total number of atoms of each element must be conserved. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18\n    Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is **18**.\n\n**Step 4: Final Verification (Consistency Check)**\n\n*   Does a valid Mixture X exist? Its components (X₁ and X₂) must:\n    1.  Be liquids with a C₆ skeleton.\n    2.  Decolorize bromine water (be unsaturated).\n    3.  Have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    4.  Have a total of 18 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Let's test the pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    1.  C₆ skeleton: Yes.\n    2.  Unsaturated: Yes, both have double bonds and decolorize Br₂ water.\n    3.  Non-conjugated: Yes. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated double bonds, unlike its conjugated isomer 1,3-cyclohexadiene. Cyclohexene has only one double bond. This condition is met.\n    4.  Total H atoms: 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our calculation perfectly.\n*   The existence of this plausible pair confirms the result obtained from the law of conservation of mass.\n\nThe final answer is the total number of hydrogen atoms, which is 18. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem, drawing upon the logical consensus from the candidate answers.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   **Information:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. It is the final product of hydrogenation, meaning it is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"). It is also a common solvent.\n    *   **Calculation:** The hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n        *   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n        *   Solving for the ratio gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   **Deduction:** The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. Since Z is a saturated hydrocarbon, it must be a cycloalkane (an alkene would be unsaturated). Given that Z is a common solvent and is the ultimate product of all reactions in the scheme, the most logical candidate is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits the CₙH₂ₙ formula, is a widely used solvent, and its C₆ skeleton is consistent with the subsequent reaction analysis.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n    *   **Information:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One component is Z (cyclohexane). It does not decolorize bromine water, and its complete hydrogenation yields only Z.\n    *   **Deduction:** Let the components of Y be Y₁ and Y₂. We know Y₁ is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Since hydrogenation of the entire mixture gives only cyclohexane, the hydrogenation of Y₂ must also produce cyclohexane. This means Y₂ has a six-carbon ring skeleton. The fact that Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water but can be hydrogenated points to it being an aromatic compound, not an alkene.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The only compound fitting these criteria is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Find the Total Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**\n    *   **Information:** An equimolar mixture X is converted into an equimolar mixture Y via disproportionation on a heated platinum catalyst.\n    *   **Reaction:** Let the two components of mixture X be X₁ and X₂. The reaction can be written with 1:1 stoichiometry:\n        `X₁ + X₂ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`\n    *   **Conservation of Atoms:** The fundamental principle of conservation of atoms states that the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of a chemical reaction. The question asks for \"the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X\", which is the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of X₁ and one molecule of X₂. This sum must be equal to the total number of hydrogens in the products.\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene)\n        Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   **Result:** Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is **18**.\n\n4.  **Final Verification (Optional)**\n    *   We can confirm this result by identifying plausible molecules for mixture X. They must be unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water), have C₆ skeletons, have no conjugated bonds, and their total hydrogen count must be 18. The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits all criteria:\n        *   H atom sum: 10 + 8 = 18.\n        *   They are unsaturated C₆-ring liquids.\n        *   The double bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene are not conjugated.\n        *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a chemically valid disproportionation.\n\nThe final calculated answer is 18. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer. The logic synthesizes the correct reasoning paths identified in the candidate answers.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   **Clue:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   **Analysis:** The value 14.28% is the decimal representation of the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `(y × 1.008) / (x × 12.011 + y × 1.008)`. Using simplified integer masses (H=1, C=12), the fraction is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n    *   This gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   **Conclusion:** The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. This corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n*   **Clue:** Z is a final hydrogenation product and \"does not react further with hydrogen\".\n*   **Analysis:** This indicates that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂n must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   **Clue:** Z is a widely used solvent, and all reactants share its carbon skeleton. The context of the disproportionation reaction (see next step) strongly suggests a six-membered ring.\n*   **Final Identification:** The only C₆ cycloalkane is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **, which is a very common solvent and fits all conditions perfectly.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   **Clue:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water.\" Z (cyclohexane) is one component.\n*   **Analysis:** Not decolorizing bromine water means the components are either saturated (like cyclohexane) or aromatic.\n*   **Clue:** Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives *only* cyclohexane.\n*   **Analysis:** The second component of Y must also have a C₆ carbon skeleton and hydrogenate to give cyclohexane. Since this second component doesn't react with bromine water, it cannot be a simple alkene. The only compound fitting these criteria is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, so it is unreactive with bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Final Answer**\n\n*   **Clue:** An equimolar mixture X undergoes disproportionation upon heating with platinum to form the equimolar mixture Y.\n*   **Analysis:** Disproportionation, in this chemical context, is a hydrogen transfer reaction. Because both mixtures are equimolar, the reaction stoichiometry for the components is 1:1. The overall transformation is:\n    `(Liquid 1 of X) + (Liquid 2 of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Application of Law of Conservation of Mass:** The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18\n\n**Careful Points & Verification:**\n*   The problem states that mixture X decolorizes bromine water (it is unsaturated) and has no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   We can check if such a mixture X can exist. A plausible composition for X would be **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   **Hydrogen sum:** 10 + 8 = 18. (Matches our calculation)\n    *   **Unsaturation:** Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   **No Conjugation:** Cyclohexene has one double bond. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds. The conjugated isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, is excluded by the problem statement.\n*   The existence of this valid pair confirms that our calculation based on conservation of mass is correct and consistent with all the chemical details provided.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) 22\nB) 18\nC) 16\nD) 12\n\nThe calculated answer, 18, corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to arrive at the correct answer. The process synthesizes the core logic present in the successful candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z\n\nThe first crucial step is to determine the identity of substance Z. We are given several key pieces of information:\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%.\n*   Z is the final product of hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a fully saturated compound.\n*   Hydrogenation of all compounds in the reaction scheme leads to Z, implying they all share a common carbon skeleton.\n*   Z is a widely used solvent.\n\nTo determine the formula, we use the mass fraction of hydrogen. A hydrogen percentage of 14.28% is numerically equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `Mass_H / (Mass_C + Mass_H)`. Using approximate integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1), this becomes:\n`y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\nSolving for the relationship between x and y:\n`7y = 12x + y`\n`6y = 12x`\n`y = 2x`\n\nThis gives Z a general formula of CₙH₂ₙ. A hydrocarbon with this formula that is also saturated must be a **cycloalkane**. Given the context of the problem (involving disproportionation which often occurs in ring systems) and its use as a common solvent, the most probable identity for Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This choice fits all the given criteria perfectly.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n\nNext, we identify the two liquids in the equimolar mixture Y:\n*   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components must be saturated or aromatic.\n*   Substance Z (cyclohexane) is a component of mixture Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of the entire mixture Y under severe conditions yields only Z (cyclohexane).\n\nSince one component is cyclohexane (Y₁ = C₆H₁₂), the other component (Y₂) must also hydrogenate to produce cyclohexane. This means Y₂ must also possess a six-carbon ring skeleton. For Y₂ to not decolorize bromine water but still be reducible to cyclohexane, it cannot be a simple alkene. The only logical choice is an aromatic compound, specifically **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water but hydrogenates to cyclohexane under the described severe conditions.\nTherefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Answer\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the transformation of mixture X into mixture Y.\n*   An equimolar mixture X of two liquids (let's call them X₁ and X₂) is converted into the equimolar mixture Y upon heating with a platinum catalyst.\n*   The reaction is described as a disproportionation, which in this context is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one species is hydrogenated (reduced) and another is dehydrogenated (oxidized).\n*   The overall stoichiometry of the reaction is:\n    `X₁ + X₂ → Y₁ + Y₂`\n*   Substituting the identified components of Y, we get:\n    `X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n\nTo find the total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X, we apply the **Law of Conservation of Atoms**. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both the reactant and product sides of the equation. Since the carbon skeleton is C₆ for all species, the carbons are balanced. We can now balance the hydrogen atoms:\n*   Total H atoms in reactants (X₁ + X₂) = Total H atoms in products (C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆)\n*   Total H atoms = 12 + 6\n*   Total H atoms = 18\n\nThe question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\", which is precisely this sum.\n\n### Step 4: Consistency Check (Verification)\n\nWe can check if a plausible Mixture X exists that fits all the conditions: its two components must decolorize bromine water (be unsaturated), have no conjugated double bonds, possess a C₆ skeleton, and have a total of 18 hydrogen atoms.\nA plausible pair is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   **Total Hydrogen Atoms**: 10 + 8 = 18. (Correct)\n*   **Unsaturation**: Both have double bonds and will decolorize bromine water. (Correct)\n*   **No Conjugation**: Cyclohexene has one double bond. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has two isolated double bonds, which are not conjugated (unlike the 1,3-isomer). (Correct)\n*   **Hydrogenation**: Both will hydrogenate to form cyclohexane. (Correct)\nThe existence of this plausible mixture confirms that our answer of 18 is correct and the problem is chemically sound.\n\nBased on the calculation, the total number of hydrogen atoms is 18. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
