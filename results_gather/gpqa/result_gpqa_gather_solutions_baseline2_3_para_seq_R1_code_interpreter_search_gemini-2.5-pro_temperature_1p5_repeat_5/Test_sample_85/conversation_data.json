Core Principles of the Problem**\n\nTo solve this question, we must understand two key principles of organic chemistry:\n*   **Chemoselectivity:** Different reagents react preferentially with specific functional groups. Here, we must know the different selectivities of Lithium borohydride (`LiBH₄`) and Borane (`BH₃`) towards esters and carboxylic acids.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We need to determine how each reaction affects the R/S designation of the chiral center. This requires a Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority analysis, as the designation can change even if no bonds to the chiral center are broken.\n\n### **2. Analysis of the Reactions**\n\n#### **Step 2.1: Starting Material and Product**\n*   **Starting Material**: `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid` (`HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`). It has a chiral center at C3 with two main branches attached: an \"acid arm\" (`-CH₂COOH`) and an \"ester arm\" (`-CH₂COOiBu`).\n*   **Product**: `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a delta-lactone.\n\n#### **Step 2.2: Reagent Selectivity**\n*   **Reaction A (`LiBH₄`):** This reagent selectively reduces the **ester** to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid intact. The resulting 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid then cyclizes.\n*   **Reaction B (`BH₃`):** This reagent selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid** to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester intact. The resulting 5-hydroxyester then cyclizes.\n\n### **3. The Crucial Step: Stereochemical Analysis via CIP Priorities**\n\nThe absolute 3D arrangement of groups around the chiral center is preserved. However, the R/S label can change if the priority ranking of the groups is altered. A careful analysis of the candidate answers reveals this is the deciding factor.\n\n**A. CIP Priorities in the Starting Material**\nThe four groups attached to the chiral center C3 are ranked as follows:\n1.  **-CH₂COOiBu** (ester arm) - *Highest priority*\n2.  **-CH₂COOH** (acid arm)\n3.  **-CH₂CH₃** (ethyl group)\n4.  **-H** (hydrogen) - *Lowest priority*\n\nThe ester arm (P1) outranks the acid arm (P2) because the ester's oxygen is bonded to a carbon, while the acid's hydroxyl oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen.\n\n**B. Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction A (`LiBH₄`)**\n1.  **Transformation:** The ester arm (P1) is reduced to an alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid arm (P2) remains unchanged.\n2.  **New Priorities:** In the resulting hydroxy-acid, the acid arm (`-CH₂COOH`) now has higher priority than the new alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n3.  **Conclusion:** The group that was originally P1 becomes lower priority than the group that was originally P2. The priority ranking of the two main arms is swapped. This results in an **INVERSION** of the stereochemical designation (an S starting material becomes an R product).\n4.  **Application:** To obtain the **(R)**-product, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n**C. Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction B (`BH₃`)**\n1.  **Transformation:** The acid arm (P2) is reduced to an alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester arm (P1) remains unchanged.\n2.  **New Priorities:** In the resulting hydroxy-ester, the ester arm (`-CH₂COOiBu`) still has higher priority than the new alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n3.  **Conclusion:** The original P1 group remains P1. The relative priority ranking of the two main arms is preserved. This results in a **RETENTION** of the stereochemical designation (an S starting material remains an S product).\n4.  **Application:** To obtain the **(S)**-product, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **4. Final Determination**\n\nBased on the rigorous stereochemical analysis, which is correctly identified by the majority of the candidate answers (even if some selected the wrong final option letter):\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option C from the question.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer. The solution hinges on two key chemical principles: the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents and the effect of the chemical transformations on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) stereochemical designations.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Structure and Functional Groups\n\n*   **Starting Material**: `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Its structure is `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`.\n*   It has two functional groups that can be reduced: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COO-iBu`).\n*   It has one chiral center at the C3 carbon, where the ethyl group is attached.\n\n*   **Product**: `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone). The chiral center from the start (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4).\n\n### Step 2: Determine Reagent Selectivity\n\nThe two reactions use different reducing agents with opposite selectivity:\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**: This reagent selectively reduces **esters** to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane)**: This reagent selectively reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Stereochemistry (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Priorities)\n\nThis is the most critical part of the problem. While no bonds at the chiral center itself are broken (meaning the 3D arrangement of atoms is unchanged), the R/S designation can change if the CIP priority order of the attached groups is altered by the reactions.\n\n*   **Priorities in the Starting Material (at C3):**\n    The four groups attached to the chiral center are:\n    1.  `-H`\n    2.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n    3.  `-CH₂COOH` (The \"acid arm\")\n    4.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (The \"ester arm\")\n\n    To determine the priority between the acid and ester arms, we compare them atom by atom. The ester arm has higher priority because its oxygen is attached to a carbon (of the isobutyl group), while the acid's hydroxyl oxygen is attached to a hydrogen. Carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen.\n    *   **Priority Order:** **-CH₂COOiBu (P1) > -CH₂COOH (P2)** > -CH₂CH₃ (P3) > -H (P4)\n\n### Step 4: Trace Reaction A\n\n*   **Reaction**: `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone`\n*   **Mechanism**: `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester arm (P1)** to a primary alcohol. The acid arm (P2) is unchanged.\n*   **New Priorities in the Intermediate**: The arms are now `-CH₂COOH` and `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The acid arm has higher priority than the alcohol arm.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**:\n    *   The group that was originally Priority 1 (ester arm) becomes the new Priority 2 (alcohol arm).\n    *   The group that was originally Priority 2 (acid arm) becomes the new Priority 1.\n    *   Since the ranks of the top two groups are swapped, the R/S designation is **INVERTED**.\n*   **Conclusion for A**: To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product via an inversion pathway, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n### Step 5: Trace Reaction B\n\n*   **Reaction**: `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone`\n*   **Mechanism**: `BH₃` reduces the **acid arm (P2)** to a primary alcohol. The ester arm (P1) is unchanged.\n*   **New Priorities in the Intermediate**: The arms are now `-CH₂COOiBu` and `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The ester arm still has higher priority than the new alcohol arm.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**:\n    *   The group that was originally Priority 1 (ester arm) remains Priority 1.\n    *   The group that was originally Priority 2 (acid arm) is converted to a new group that is still lower in priority than the ester arm.\n    *   The relative priority order of the main arms is maintained. The R/S designation is **RETAINED**.\n*   **Conclusion for B**: To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product via a retention pathway, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### Step 6: Final Conclusion\n\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem requires a multi-step analysis involving reagent selectivity and a careful examination of stereochemical consequences based on Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem and Analyze Reagent Selectivity\n\n*   **Starting Material**: The options provide enantiomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule contains both a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`). The chiral center is the carbon at position 3, bonded to an ethyl group.\n*   **Product**: `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, which is a six-membered lactone (cyclic ester). Reaction A produces the (R) enantiomer, and Reaction B produces the (S) enantiomer.\n*   **Reaction A Reagent**: `LiBH₄` (Lithium borohydride) is a chemoselective reducing agent that reduces **esters** to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids intact.\n*   **Reaction B Reagent**: `BH₃` (Borane) has the opposite selectivity; it reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols while leaving esters intact.\n\n### Step 2: Stereochemical Analysis Using CIP Priority Rules\n\nThis is the most critical step. Although the bonds at the chiral center itself are not broken, the R/S designation can change if the chemical transformations alter the priority ranking of the groups attached to the chiral center's chain.\n\n**A. Assigning Initial Priorities (Starting Material)**\n\nThe four groups attached to the chiral center (C3) are -H, -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl), `-CH₂COOH` (the \"acid arm\"), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (the \"ester arm\").\n1.  To compare the acid arm and ester arm, we look down the chain. At the final oxygen, the acid's oxygen is bonded to H, while the ester's oxygen is bonded to a Carbon (of the isobutyl group).\n2.  Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester arm has higher priority.\n3.  **The CIP priority order for the starting material is**:\n    *   Priority 1 (P1): `-CH₂COOiBu`\n    *   Priority 2 (P2): `-CH₂COOH`\n    *   Priority 3 (P3): `-CH₂CH₃`\n    *   Priority 4 (P4): `-H`\n\n**B. Analyzing Reaction A: `A + LiBH₄ → (R)-Lactone`**\n\n1.  **Chemical Change**: `LiBH₄` reduces the ester group (P1) to a primary alcohol. The acid group (P2) is unchanged.\n2.  **Lactone Formation**: The resulting hydroxy-acid cyclizes. The new carbonyl (`C=O`) of the lactone comes from the original acid group (P2), and the new ether oxygen (`-O-`) of the lactone ring comes from the reduced ester group (P1).\n3.  **Priority Change**: The arm derived from the original P2 is now `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` and has the higher priority. The arm derived from the original P1 is now `-CH₂-CH₂O-` and has the lower priority.\n4.  **Stereochemical Consequence**: The group that was P1 in the starting material becomes the new P'2, and the group that was P2 becomes the new P'1. The priorities of the top two groups **swap**. This leads to an **INVERSION** of the stereochemical designation (an S starting material gives an R product).\n5.  **Conclusion for A**: To obtain the **(R)**-lactone via inversion, starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n**C. Analyzing Reaction B: `B + BH₃ → (S)-Lactone`**\n\n1.  **Chemical Change**: `BH₃` reduces the acid group (P2) to a primary alcohol. The ester group (P1) is unchanged.\n2.  **Lactone Formation**: The resulting hydroxy-ester cyclizes. The new carbonyl (`C=O`) of the lactone comes from the original ester group (P1), and the new ether oxygen (`-O-`) comes from the reduced acid group (P2).\n3.  **Priority Change**: The arm derived from the original P1 is `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` and remains the higher priority group. The arm derived from the original P2 is now `-CH₂-CH₂O-` and becomes the lower priority group.\n4.  **Stereochemical Consequence**: The group that was P1 remains the highest priority group, and the group derived from P2 remains the second-highest. The priority ranking is **maintained**. This leads to a **RETENTION** of the stereochemical designation (an S starting material gives an S product).\n5.  **Conclusion for B**: To obtain the **(S)**-lactone via retention, starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n### Step 3: Final Determination\n\n*   From the analysis of Reaction A, starting material A must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   From the analysis of Reaction B, starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nTherefore, both reactions start with the same (S)-enantiomer. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis problem requires a careful, step-by-step analysis of two different chemical reactions, focusing on both the selectivity of the reducing agents and the resulting stereochemistry. The key to solving this is understanding how the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules apply before and after the chemical transformations.\n\n### **1. Structure and Functional Group Analysis**\n\n*   **Starting Material**: `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Its structure is `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`. It contains a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`), an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`), and a single chiral center at the C3 carbon where the ethyl group is attached.\n*   **Product**: `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, which is a six-membered lactone (a cyclic ester).\n\n### **2. Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThe two reducing agents have opposite preferences for which functional group they reduce:\n*   `LiBH₄` **(Lithium borohydride)**: Selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   `BH₃` **(Borane)**: Selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n### **3. Stereochemical Analysis (The Crucial Step)**\n\nThe absolute 3D arrangement of the groups at the chiral center does not change, as no bonds at this center are broken. However, the R/S *designation* can change if the chemical modification alters the CIP priority ranking of the groups.\n\n**Step 3.1: CIP Priorities in the Starting Material**\n\nAt the chiral center (C3), we rank the four attached groups:\n1.  `-H` (Hydrogen)\n2.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n3.  `-CH₂COOH` (The \"acid arm\")\n4.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (The \"ester arm\")\n\nTo prioritize between the acid and ester arms, we compare them atom by atom. The ester arm (`-O-C` from the isobutyl group) has higher priority than the acid arm (`-O-H` from the hydroxyl group) because Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen.\n\nTherefore, the priority order is:\n*   **Priority 1**: `-CH₂COOiBu`\n*   **Priority 2**: `-CH₂COOH`\n*   **Priority 3**: `-CH₂CH₃`\n*   **Priority 4**: `-H`\n\n**Step 3.2: Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction**: `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-Lactone`\n*   **Mechanism**: `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester group (Priority 1)** to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The carboxylic acid group **(Priority 2)** is unchanged.\n*   **Change in Priorities**: In the resulting `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` intermediate, the acid group now has a higher priority than the newly formed alcohol group.\n*   **Outcome**: The group that was originally Priority 1 has become lower priority than the group that was originally Priority 2. This **swapping of priorities results in an INVERSION of the R/S designation**.\n*   **Conclusion for A**: To obtain the **(R)**-product via an inversion pathway, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n**Step 3.3: Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction**: `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-Lactone`\n*   **Mechanism**: `BH₃` reduces the **carboxylic acid group (Priority 2)** to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group **(Priority 1)** is unchanged.\n*   **Change in Priorities**: In the resulting `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate` intermediate, the ester group is still higher priority than the newly formed alcohol group.\n*   **Outcome**: The priority ranking of the main groups is preserved. The group that was Priority 1 is still higher priority than the group that was derived from Priority 2. This **preservation of priorities results in a RETENTION of the R/S designation**.\n*   **Conclusion for B**: To obtain the **(S)**-product via a retention pathway, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Final Determination**\n\n*   Starting Material **A** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting Material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth reactions must start with the same (S)-enantiomer. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires a detailed analysis of two separate chemical reactions, focusing on reagent selectivity and the stereochemical consequences. Let's break down the logic step by step.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Starting Material and Product Structures**\n\n*   **Starting Material**: `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Its structure is `HOOC–CH₂–CH(Et)–CH₂–COO-iBu`. This molecule has two important features:\n    1.  Two different functional groups that can be reduced: a carboxylic acid (`–COOH`) and an ester (`–COO-iBu`).\n    2.  A single chiral center at the C3 position, which is attached to an ethyl group (`–Et`).\n*   **Product**: `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone). It is formed when a precursor molecule (a 5-hydroxy acid) cyclizes. The chiral C3 in the starting material becomes the chiral C4 in the product.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Selectivity of the Reducing Agents**\n\nThe choice of reducing agent determines which functional group is transformed, leading to different pathways.\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**: This reagent selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols. It is much less reactive towards carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane)**: This reagent has the opposite selectivity; it selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols and is less reactive towards esters.\n\n### **3. Perform the Stereochemical Analysis (The Decisive Step)**\n\nThe absolute 3D arrangement of the atoms at the chiral center does not change in these reactions. However, the *R/S* designation is determined by the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules. If the chemical transformations change the priorities of the groups attached to the chiral center's chain, the *R/S* label can be inverted even if the 3D structure is retained.\n\n**CIP Priorities in the Starting Material (at C3):**\nThe four groups attached to the chiral center are -H, `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl), `-CH₂COOH` (acid side), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side).\n*   To rank the acid and ester sides, we look at the first point of difference. In the ester (`-COOiBu`), the oxygen is bonded to a carbon atom of the isobutyl group. In the acid (`-COOH`), the hydroxyl oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen atom. Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester side has higher priority.\n*   **Priority Order:** `(-CH₂COOiBu)` > `(-CH₂COOH)` > `(-CH₂CH₃)` > `(-H)`.\n\n#### **Pathway A: `A + LiBH₄ → (R)-lactone`**\n\n1.  **Chemical Transformation**: LiBH₄ reduces the **ester** group (`-CH₂COOiBu`, the higher priority group) to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group (`-CH₂COOH`, the lower priority group) remains.\n2.  **New Priorities**: We now compare the resulting arms: `-CH₂COOH` and `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The acid group now has a higher priority than the newly formed alcohol group.\n3.  **Stereochemical Consequence**: The group that was originally Priority 1 (ester side) has become a lower priority group (alcohol side), while the group that was originally Priority 2 (acid side) is now the highest priority group. The priorities of the two main arms have swapped. This results in an **INVERSION** of the stereochemical designation (an (S) starting material becomes an (R) product, and vice-versa).\n4.  **Conclusion for A**: To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product via this inversion pathway, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n#### **Pathway B: `B + BH₃ → (S)-lactone`**\n\n1.  **Chemical Transformation**: BH₃ reduces the **acid** group (`-CH₂COOH`, the lower priority group) to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`, the higher priority group) remains.\n2.  **New Priorities**: We now compare the resulting arms: `-CH₂COOiBu` and `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The ester group still has higher priority than the newly formed alcohol group.\n3.  **Stereochemical Consequence**: The group that was originally Priority 1 (ester side) remains the highest priority group. The group that was originally Priority 2 was changed, but the overall priority ranking between the two main arms is maintained (`ester > alcohol` is the same as `ester > acid`). This results in a **RETENTION** of the stereochemical designation (an (S) starting material becomes an (S) product).\n4.  **Conclusion for B**: To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product via this retention pathway, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of both reaction pathways:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBoth reactions start with the same (S) enantiomer. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials, A and B. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the selectivity of the reducing agents and correctly analyzing the stereochemical outcome by applying the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n### **1. Core Principles**\n\n*   **Structure of Starting Material:** `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, with a chiral center at carbon-3. Its structure is `HOOC-CH₂(C2)-CH(Et)(C3)-CH₂(C4)-C(=O)O-iBu(C5)`.\n*   **Structure of Product:** `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a delta-lactone. The chiral center C3 from the start becomes C4 in the product.\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:**\n    *   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** Selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols.\n    *   **BH₃ (Borane):** Selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The R/S designation of the chiral center is determined by the priority of the attached groups. While the reaction doesn't break bonds at the chiral center, it modifies the attached groups, which can change their priority and thus invert the R/S label.\n\n### **2. Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priority Analysis**\n\nThis is the most critical step for a rigorous solution.\n\n*   **Groups at Chiral Center (C3) of Starting Material:**\n    1.  `G1 = -CH₂COOiBu` (ester side)\n    2.  `G2 = -CH₂COOH` (acid side)\n    3.  `G3 = -CH₂CH₃` (ethyl)\n    4.  `G4 = -H` (hydrogen)\n*   **Priority Ranking:** To compare G1 and G2, we look at the point of first difference. In the alkoxy group `-O-iBu` of the ester, the oxygen is attached to a carbon. In the hydroxyl group `-O-H` of the acid, the oxygen is attached to a hydrogen. Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester side has higher priority.\n    *   **Priority Order:** `G1 (-CH₂COOiBu)` > `G2 (-CH₂COOH)` > `G3 (-Et)` > `G4 (-H)`\n\n### **3. Analyzing Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-Lactone`\n*   **Pathway:** LiBH₄ reduces the **ester** group (G1) to a primary alcohol. The resulting hydroxy-acid cyclizes.\n*   **Transformation of Groups:**\n    *   G1 (`-CH₂COOiBu`) becomes `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n    *   G2 (`-CH₂COOH`) remains `-CH₂COOH`.\n*   **New Priorities in Intermediate:** Comparing the new groups, the acid (`-CH₂COOH`) has higher priority than the alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n*   **Stereochemical Result:** The group that was originally Priority #1 has become a lower priority group, and the group that was Priority #2 is now the new Priority #1. The ranks of the top two groups have **swapped**. A swap in priority **inverts** the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To get an **(R)** product from an **inversion** pathway, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n### **4. Analyzing Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-Lactone`\n*   **Pathway:** BH₃ reduces the **carboxylic acid** group (G2) to a primary alcohol. The resulting hydroxy-ester cyclizes.\n*   **Transformation of Groups:**\n    *   G1 (`-CH₂COOiBu`) remains `-CH₂COOiBu`.\n    *   G2 (`-CH₂COOH`) becomes `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n*   **New Priorities in Intermediate:** Comparing the new groups, the ester (`-CH₂COOiBu`) still has higher priority than the alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n*   **Stereochemical Result:** The group that was originally Priority #1 remains Priority #1. The group that was Priority #2 was modified into a new group that is still of lower priority than the first. The priority order of the main groups has been **preserved**. This results in **retention** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** To get an **(S)** product from a **retention** pathway, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reaction pathways:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option D, where both A and B are the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem requires a detailed analysis of the chemoselectivity of two different reducing agents and a rigorous examination of the stereochemical consequences of the reactions. The key to solving this problem lies in determining how the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents on the chiral center change as a result of the chemical transformations.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Structure and Functional Group Identification**\n    *   **Starting Material:** `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n        *   Its structure is `HOOC-CH₂(a)-CH(Et)-CH₂(b)-COOiBu`.\n        *   It contains a carboxylic acid functional group (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester functional group (`-COOiBu`).\n        *   There is a single chiral center at the C3 position, the carbon bearing the ethyl group.\n    *   **Product:** `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n        *   This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone).\n        *   The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4).\n\n2.  **Reagent Selectivity**\n    *   **LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride):** This is a selective reducing agent that reduces **esters** to primary alcohols much faster than it reduces carboxylic acids.\n    *   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent shows the opposite selectivity. It reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols much faster than it reduces esters.\n\n3.  **Stereochemical Analysis (The Decisive Step)**\n    The core of the problem is determining if the R/S designation is retained or inverted. While no bonds are broken at the chiral center itself, the R/S *label* can change if the CIP priorities of the attached groups are altered by the reactions.\n\n    *   **CIP Priorities in the Starting Material (at C3):**\n        The four groups attached to the chiral center are: -H, -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), `-CH₂COOH` (the acid arm), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (the ester arm).\n        To determine the priority between the acid and ester arms, we compare them atom-by-atom from the chiral center. In the ester arm, the oxygen of the alkoxy group (`-O-iBu`) is attached to a carbon atom. In the acid arm, the oxygen of the hydroxyl group (`-OH`) is attached to a hydrogen atom. Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester arm has a higher priority.\n        *   **Priority 1 (P1):** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n        *   **Priority 2 (P2):** `-CH₂COOH`\n        *   **Priority 3 (P3):** `-CH₂CH₃`\n        *   **Priority 4 (P4):** `-H`\n\n4.  **Tracing Reaction A: A + LiBH₄ → (R)-Lactone**\n    *   **Reaction Pathway:** `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester group (P1)** to a primary alcohol. The **acid group (P2)** is untouched and later forms the carbonyl of the lactone.\n    *   **Mapping to Product:** The original **P1** (`-CH₂COOiBu`) becomes the `-CH₂CH₂OH` group, which forms the ether part of the lactone. The original **P2** (`-CH₂COOH`) forms the carbonyl part of the lactone (`-CH₂C(=O)O-`).\n    *   **Priority Change:** In the final product, the carbonyl part has a higher priority than the ether part. Therefore, the group that was originally **P2** is now the higher priority group, and the group that was originally **P1** is now the lower priority group. The priority ranks of the top two groups are swapped.\n    *   **Stereochemical Result:** A swap in the priorities of two groups on a chiral center results in an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-lactone via a reaction pathway that causes inversion, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n5.  **Tracing Reaction B: B + BH₃ → (S)-Lactone**\n    *   **Reaction Pathway:** `BH₃` reduces the **acid group (P2)** to a primary alcohol. The **ester group (P1)** is untouched and later forms the carbonyl of the lactone.\n    *   **Mapping to Product:** The original **P1** (`-CH₂COOiBu`) forms the carbonyl part of the lactone (`-CH₂C(=O)O-`). The original **P2** (`-CH₂COOH`) is reduced and forms the ether part of the lactone (`-CH₂CH₂O-`).\n    *   **Priority Change:** In the final product, the carbonyl part has a higher priority than the ether part. Therefore, the group that was originally **P1** is still the highest priority group, and the group that was originally **P2** has been transformed into a new group that is still of lower priority. The priority order of the top two groups is maintained.\n    *   **Stereochemical Result:** Since the priority order is maintained, the R/S designation is **retained**.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-lactone via a reaction pathway that causes retention, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same (S)-enantiomer. This matches the description in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem requires a careful, step-by-step analysis of two distinct chemical reactions, focusing on both the selectivity of the reagents and the stereochemical consequences of the transformations.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Structures**\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is a stereoisomer of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`\n    *   This molecule contains two functional groups that can be reduced: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COO-iBu`).\n    *   It has one chiral center at Carbon-3, which is bonded to an ethyl group.\n*   **Product:** The product of both reactions is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone).\n    *   The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Selectivity of the Reducing Agents**\nThis is the key to understanding which part of the starting molecule is modified in each reaction.\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride):** Selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols. It is not effective at reducing carboxylic acids under these conditions.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** Selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. It is much less reactive towards esters.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemical Consequences using CIP Rules**\nThis is the most critical and subtle part of the problem. While no bonds at the chiral center itself are broken (preserving the 3D arrangement), the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) R/S designation can change if the priorities of the attached chemical groups are altered by the reaction.\n\n**3.1. Priorities in the Starting Material**\nThe four groups attached to the chiral center C3 are:\n1.  `-H` (Hydrogen)\n2.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n3.  The arm with the carboxylic acid: `-CH₂COOH`\n4.  The arm with the ester: `-CH₂COOiBu`\n\nTo compare the acid arm and the ester arm, we follow the CIP rules. The ester arm (`-CH₂-C(=O)O-C₄H₉`) has higher priority than the acid arm (`-CH₂-C(=O)O-H`) because the oxygen is attached to a carbon in the former and a hydrogen in the latter. Carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen.\n*   **Priority Order (Start):** `-CH₂COOiBu` (P1) > `-CH₂COOH` (P2) > `-CH₂CH₃` (P3) > `-H` (P4).\n\n**3.2. Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction A**\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-Lactone`\n*   **Transformation:** `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester group** (original P1) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The carboxylic acid group (original P2) is untouched. The resulting hydroxy-acid then cyclizes.\n*   **Change in Priorities:** The groups attached to the chiral center in the hydroxy-acid intermediate are `-CH₂COOH` and `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The carboxylic acid group now has a higher priority than the new alcohol group.\n*   **Result:** The original highest priority group (P1, ester) has become a lower priority group. The original second priority group (P2, acid) is now the highest priority group. Since the ranks of the top two groups have been swapped, the R/S designation is **INVERTED**.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-lactone via a reaction pathway that causes inversion, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n**3.3. Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction B**\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-Lactone`\n*   **Transformation:** `BH₃` reduces the **carboxylic acid group** (original P2) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group (original P1) is untouched. The resulting hydroxy-ester then cyclizes.\n*   **Change in Priorities:** The groups attached to the chiral center in the hydroxy-ester intermediate are `-CH₂COOiBu` and `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The ester group still has a higher priority than the new alcohol group.\n*   **Result:** The original highest priority group (P1, ester) remains the highest priority group. The original second priority group (P2, acid) has become a group that is still lower in priority than P1. The relative priority order is maintained. This results in **RETENTION** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-lactone via a reaction pathway that causes retention, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n*   For reaction A, starting material A is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   For reaction B, starting material B is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBoth A and B are the same starting material, the (S)-enantiomer. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis is an organic chemistry problem that requires a deep understanding of reaction mechanisms, reagent selectivity, and stereochemistry, specifically the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structures:**\n    *   **Starting Material**: `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This is a dicarboxylic acid derivative with a chiral center at C3. Its structure can be represented as `HOOC–CH₂–CH(Et)–CH₂–COOiBu`. It has two functional groups susceptible to reduction: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOiBu`).\n    *   **Product**: `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, known as a delta-lactone. Its chiral center is at C4, which corresponds to the C3 of the starting material.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reagent Selectivity:**\n    The two reactions use different reducing agents with opposing selectivity, which is the key to this problem.\n    *   **Reaction A (`LiBH₄`):** Lithium borohydride is a selective reducing agent that reduces **esters** to alcohols but does not react with carboxylic acids under these conditions.\n    *   **Reaction B (`BH₃`):** Borane is a selective reducing agent that reduces **carboxylic acids** to alcohols but reacts much more slowly with esters.\n\n3.  **Perform Stereochemical Analysis (The Decisive Step):**\n    The R/S designation of the product depends not just on the 3D arrangement of atoms at the chiral center (which remains unchanged) but on the **priority** of the attached groups, as defined by CIP rules. If the reaction changes the chemical nature of the groups, their priorities can change, potentially \"inverting\" the R/S label.\n\n    *   **CIP Priorities in the Starting Material (at C3):**\n        The four groups on the chiral center are -H, -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl), `-CH₂COOH` (acid arm), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester arm).\n        To assign priority, we compare the acid and ester arms. The ester arm (`-O-C(isobutyl)`) outranks the acid arm (`-O-H`) because Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen.\n        *   **Priority 1 (P1): `-CH₂COOiBu`**\n        *   **Priority 2 (P2): `-CH₂COOH`**\n        *   Priority 3 (P3): `-CH₂CH₃`\n        *   Priority 4 (P4): `-H`\n\n    *   **Tracing Reaction A (`A + LiBH₄ → (R)-Lactone`):**\n        1.  The `LiBH₄` reduces the ester group (**P1**) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n        2.  The acid group (**P2**) remains unchanged.\n        3.  The resulting intermediate is a hydroxy-acid. When it cyclizes, the unchanged acid group (P2) forms the high-priority carbonyl side of the lactone. The reduced ester group (P1) forms the lower-priority ether side of the lactone.\n        4.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The group that was P1 becomes a lower-priority group in the product, and the group that was P2 becomes the highest-priority group. Since the ranks of the top two groups swap, the stereochemical designation is **INVERTED** (an S starting material gives an R product).\n        5.  **Conclusion for A**: To obtain the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n    *   **Tracing Reaction B (`B + BH₃ → (S)-Lactone`):**\n        1.  The `BH₃` reduces the carboxylic acid group (**P2**) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n        2.  The ester group (**P1**) remains unchanged.\n        3.  The resulting intermediate is a hydroxy-ester. When it cyclizes, the unchanged ester group (P1) forms the high-priority carbonyl side of the lactone. The reduced acid group (P2) forms the lower-priority ether side of the lactone.\n        4.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The group that was P1 remains the highest priority, and the group that was P2 is modified but remains a lower-priority group. The relative priority order is maintained. Therefore, the stereochemical designation is **RETAINED** (an S starting material gives an S product).\n        5.  **Conclusion for B**: To obtain the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting Material A = **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting Material B = **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis means both starting materials are the same (S)-enantiomer. Matching this with the provided options:\nA) A = (S)-acid, B = (R)-acid\nB) A = (R)-acid, B = (R)-acid\nC) A = (R)-acid, B = (S)-acid\nD) A = (S)-acid, B = (S)-acid\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n**1. Deconstruction of the Problem**\n*   **Goal**: Determine the absolute stereochemistry (R/S) for the starting materials A and B.\n*   **Starting Material**: Stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`), an ester (`-COOiBu`), and a single chiral center at C3 with an ethyl group.\n*   **Product**: Stereoisomers of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, which is a δ-lactone (six-membered cyclic ester).\n*   **Reaction A**: `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-product`\n*   **Reaction B**: `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-product`\n\n**2. Reagent Selectivity**\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**: This reagent selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane)**: This reagent has the opposite selectivity, reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n**3. Stereochemical Analysis (The Deciding Factor)**\nThe key to this problem is not just the reagent selectivity but how the resulting chemical change affects the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center. While no bonds at the chiral center itself are broken (preserving the 3D arrangement), the R/S *label* can change if the group priorities are altered.\n\n**Step 3.1: CIP Priorities in the Starting Material**\nThe chiral center (C3) is attached to four groups:\n1.  -H\n2.  -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl)\n3.  `-CH₂COOH` (The \"acid arm\")\n4.  `-CH₂C(=O)O-iBu` (The \"ester arm\")\n\nTo determine the priority between the acid and ester arms, we look at the first point of difference. The oxygen in the acid's hydroxyl group is attached to H. The oxygen in the ester's alkoxy group is attached to C (from the isobutyl group). Since C has a higher atomic number than H, the ester arm has a higher priority.\n*   **Priority Order (Starting Material):** **(P1)** `-CH₂COOiBu` > **(P2)** `-CH₂COOH` > **(P3)** `-CH₂CH₃` > **(P4)** `-H`.\n\n**Step 3.2: Analyzing Reaction A (using LiBH₄)**\n1.  **Transformation**: LiBH₄ reduces the ester (the P1 group) to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid (the P2 group) remains unchanged and will form the carbonyl of the final lactone.\n2.  **Priority Change**: In the resulting 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid intermediate, we now compare the `-CH₂COOH` group (from original P2) with the new `-CH₂CH₂OH` group (from original P1). The acid group has a higher priority than the alcohol group.\n3.  **Conclusion**: The group that was originally P1 has become a new group with a lower priority than the group that was originally P2. The priority order of the top two groups has been swapped. A swap in priorities leads to an **INVERSION** of the stereochemical designation.\n4.  **Determination of A**: The reaction is `A → (R)-product` with inversion. Therefore, starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n**Step 3.3: Analyzing Reaction B (using BH₃)**\n1.  **Transformation**: BH₃ reduces the acid (the P2 group) to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester (the P1 group) remains unchanged and will form the carbonyl of the final lactone.\n2.  **Priority Change**: In the resulting 5-hydroxyester intermediate, we compare the `-CH₂COOiBu` group (original P1) with the new `-CH₂CH₂OH` group (from original P2). The ester group still has a higher priority than the new alcohol group.\n3.  **Conclusion**: The group that was originally P1 is still P1'. The group that was originally P2 has been converted to a new group that is still of lower priority. The relative priority order is maintained. This leads to **RETENTION** of the stereochemical designation.\n4.  **Determination of B**: The reaction is `B → (S)-product` with retention. Therefore, starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n**4. Final Answer Synthesis**\n*   Starting material A must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material B must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBoth reactions start with the same (S)-enantiomer. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Identify the Key Chemical Question\nThe problem asks for the stereochemistry of two starting materials, A and B, which are enantiomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This requires analyzing two different reactions and their stereochemical outcomes. The core of the problem involves:\n1.  **Chemoselectivity**: Which functional group (ester or carboxylic acid) is reduced by each reagent?\n2.  **Stereochemistry**: Does the reaction cause the R/S designation of the chiral center to be retained or inverted?\n\n### 2. Analyze Reagent Selectivity\n*   **Reaction A uses LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**: This reagent is known to selectively reduce esters (`-COOR`) to primary alcohols (`-CH₂OH`) while leaving carboxylic acids (`-COOH`) unaffected.\n*   **Reaction B uses BH₃ (Borane)**: This reagent has the opposite selectivity, reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols while leaving esters largely unaffected under the same conditions.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Stereochemical Outcome\nThis is the most crucial part of the analysis. The R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center. A chemical reaction can change a functional group, altering its priority, which can flip the R/S label even if the 3D structure is preserved.\n\n**Step 3a: Assign CIP Priorities in the Starting Material**\n*   The chiral center is C3. The four groups attached are H, ethyl (`-CH₂CH₃`), the acid-side chain (`-CH₂COOH`), and the ester-side chain (`-CH₂COOiBu`).\n*   To compare the acid and ester chains, we look at the first point of difference. The ester's alkoxy oxygen is attached to a carbon (from the isobutyl group), whereas the acid's hydroxyl oxygen is attached to a hydrogen. Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester-side chain has higher priority.\n*   **Priority Order (Start):**\n    1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (**P1**)\n    2.  `-CH₂COOH` (**P2**)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (**P3**)\n    4.  `-H` (**P4**)\n\n**Step 3b: Analyze Pathway A (LiBH₄)**\n1.  **Transformation**: The ester group (**P1**) is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group (**P2**) remains unchanged.\n2.  **New Priorities**: We now compare the unchanged acid group (`-CH₂COOH`) with the new alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group has higher priority.\n3.  **Result**: The group that was originally **P1** is now lower priority than the group that was originally **P2**. The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. This results in an **INVERSION** of the stereochemical designation (an S starting material gives an R product).\n4.  **Conclusion for A**: The reaction `A → (R)-product` proceeds with inversion. Therefore, starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n**Step 3c: Analyze Pathway B (BH₃)**\n1.  **Transformation**: The acid group (**P2**) is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group (**P1**) remains unchanged.\n2.  **New Priorities**: We now compare the unchanged ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) with the new alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group still has higher priority.\n3.  **Result**: The group that was originally **P1** remains the highest priority group. The group that was **P2** is transformed into a group that is still of lower priority than P1. The priority order of the top two groups is maintained. This results in **RETENTION** of the stereochemical designation (an S starting material gives an S product).\n4.  **Conclusion for B**: The reaction `B → (S)-product` proceeds with retention. Therefore, starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same enantiomer. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Identify the Core Task**\n\nThe goal is to determine the absolute stereochemistry (R or S) of two starting materials, A and B, based on the stereochemistry of the products formed after two different reduction reactions. This requires understanding:\n*   The structure of the molecules involved.\n*   The specific reactivity (chemoselectivity) of each reducing agent.\n*   The rules for assigning stereochemical configurations (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog or CIP rules) and how the configuration can be affected by the reactions.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Structures**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting compound is `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`\n    *   It contains a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COO-iBu`).\n    *   It has one chiral center at Carbon-3, which is bonded to an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`), a hydrogen atom, and two different carbon chains.\n\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered lactone (cyclic ester).\n    *   The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4). The 3D arrangement of the groups at this center is not changed, but the R/S label might change.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Chemoselectivity of the Reagents**\n\nThis is the first critical step that determines the reaction pathway.\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride):** Selectively reduces **esters** to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids untouched.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** Selectively reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols while leaving esters untouched.\n\n### **4. Analyze the Stereochemical Outcome (The Decisive Step)**\n\nThe R/S designation depends on the CIP priority of the groups attached to the chiral center. We must check if the chemical modifications alter these priorities.\n\n**Step 4.1: Assign Priorities in the Starting Material**\nThe four groups on the chiral center C3 are:\n1.  `-H`\n2.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n3.  `-CH₂COOH` (The \"acid arm\")\n4.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (The \"ester arm\")\n\nTo compare the acid and ester arms, we follow the chain atom-by-atom. In the ester's alkoxy group (`-O-iBu`), the oxygen is bonded to a carbon. In the acid's hydroxyl group (`-OH`), the oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen. Since carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen, the ester arm has higher priority.\n*   **Priority Order (Starting Material):**\n    *   **Priority 1:** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n    *   **Priority 2:** `-CH₂COOH`\n    *   **Priority 3:** `-CH₂CH₃`\n    *   **Priority 4:** `-H`\n\n**Step 4.2: Analyze Reaction A (LiBH₄ reduction)**\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-Lactone`\n*   **Transformation:** The **ester** group (original Priority 1) is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group (original Priority 2) is unchanged.\n*   **Priority Change:** In the resulting intermediate, we compare the new arms: `-CH₂COOH` vs. `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The acid group now has a higher priority than the alcohol group.\n*   **Stereochemical Consequence:** The group that was Priority 1 is now lower priority than the group that was Priority 2. The priority ranks of the top two groups have **swapped**. A swap of priorities at a chiral center **inverts** its stereochemical designation (an S starting material becomes an R product, and vice versa).\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Since the reaction pathway `A → (R)-Lactone` proceeds with inversion, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n**Step 4.3: Analyze Reaction B (BH₃ reduction)**\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-Lactone`\n*   **Transformation:** The **acid** group (original Priority 2) is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group (original Priority 1) is unchanged.\n*   **Priority Change:** In the resulting intermediate, we compare the new arms: `-CH₂COOiBu` vs. `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The ester group is still higher priority than the new alcohol group.\n*   **Stereochemical Consequence:** The group that was Priority 1 remains Priority 1. The relative priority order of the groups on the chiral center is **maintained**. This results in a **retention** of the stereochemical designation (an S starting material becomes an S product).\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Since the reaction pathway `B → (S)-Lactone` proceeds with retention, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material A must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material B must also be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis problem requires a multi-step analysis involving both chemoselectivity of reducing agents and the stereochemical consequences determined by Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Reaction Pathways and Reagent Selectivity**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The common starting material is `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, which contains both a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) and an ester group (`-COO-iBu`). The chiral center is at C3.\n*   **Product:** The common product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered lactone.\n*   **Reaction A:** The reagent is `LiBH₄` (Lithium borohydride). It is known to selectively reduce **esters** to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids largely unaffected.\n    *   **Pathway:** Ester is reduced -> creates a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid -> cyclizes to lactone.\n*   **Reaction B:** The reagent is `BH₃` (Borane). It selectively reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols while leaving esters largely unaffected.\n    *   **Pathway:** Carboxylic acid is reduced -> creates a 5-hydroxy ester -> cyclizes to lactone.\n\n### **Step 2: Perform Stereochemical Analysis using CIP Priorities**\n\nThis is the most critical step. The R/S designation depends on the priority of the groups attached to the chiral center. If these priorities change due to the chemical transformation, the R/S label can change even if the 3D structure is preserved.\n\n1.  **Priorities in the Starting Material (at Chiral Center C3):**\n    *   The four groups attached are -H, -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl), `-CH₂COOH` (Acid arm), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (Ester arm).\n    *   The ester arm (`-CH₂COOiBu`) has a higher priority than the acid arm (`-CH₂COOH`) because the oxygen in the ester is attached to a carbon (`-O-C...`), while the oxygen in the acid is attached to a hydrogen (`-O-H`).\n    *   Therefore, the initial priority order is:\n        *   **P1**: `-CH₂COOiBu`\n        *   **P2**: `-CH₂COOH`\n        *   **P3**: `-CH₂CH₃`\n        *   **P4**: `-H`\n\n2.  **Analysis of Reaction A (LiBH₄): `A → (R)-Lactone`**\n    *   The ester group (P1) is reduced to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group (P2) is unchanged.\n    *   In the resulting intermediate, we now compare the priorities of `-CH₂COOH` and `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The acid group now has the higher priority.\n    *   **Stereochemical Result:** The original P1 group has become the new P2 group, and the original P2 group has become the new P1 group. Since the ranks of the top two priority groups have been swapped, the R/S designation is **INVERTED**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** To get the **(R)** product via an inversion pathway, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Reaction B (BH₃): `B → (S)-Lactone`**\n    *   The acid group (P2) is reduced to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group (P1) is unchanged.\n    *   In the resulting intermediate, we compare the priorities of `-CH₂COOiBu` and `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The ester group still has the higher priority.\n    *   **Stereochemical Result:** The original P1 group remains the highest priority group. The priority order of the groups is unchanged. Therefore, the R/S designation is **RETAINED**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** To get the **(S)** product via a retention pathway, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis:\n*   Starting Material **A** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting Material **B** is also **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis means both starting materials are the same enantiomer. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nB) A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nC) A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid , B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nD) A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid , B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis is a problem involving the chemoselectivity of reducing agents and stereochemistry, which requires a careful analysis of how Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities change during a reaction.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material and Product Structures**\n    *   **Starting Material**: `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Its structure is `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`. It contains a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`), an ester (`-COOiBu`), and a single chiral center at the C3 carbon, which is bonded to the ethyl group (`Et`).\n    *   **Product**: `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone). The chiral center from the starting material becomes the chiral center in the product.\n\n2.  **Determine Reagent Selectivity**\n    This is the first key step to determine which part of the molecule is reduced in each reaction.\n    *   **Reaction A uses `LiBH₄`**: Lithium borohydride is a mild reducing agent that selectively reduces **esters** to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Reaction B uses `BH₃`**: Borane is a reducing agent that selectively reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n3.  **Perform Stereochemical Analysis (CIP Priorities)**\n    This is the most critical step. The R/S designation of the chiral center depends on the priority ranking of the four attached groups. Even if no bonds at the chiral center are broken, the designation can change if the chemical modification alters the priority ranking.\n\n    *   **Priorities in the Starting Material (at C3):**\n        The four groups are: `-H`, `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl), `-CH₂COOH` (the \"acid arm\"), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (the \"ester arm\").\n        To compare the acid and ester arms, we look for the first point of difference. In the ester arm, the oxygen of the alkoxy group is attached to a carbon (`-O-C`), while in the acid arm, the hydroxyl oxygen is attached to a hydrogen (`-O-H`). Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester arm has higher priority.\n        *   **Priority 1 (P1):** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n        *   **Priority 2 (P2):** `-CH₂COOH`\n        *   **Priority 3 (P3):** `-CH₂CH₃`\n        *   **Priority 4 (P4):** `-H`\n\n4.  **Trace Reaction A (`A + LiBH₄`)**\n    *   **Reaction Pathway**: `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester group** (P1) to a primary alcohol. The acid group (P2) is left unchanged. The resulting 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid cyclizes to form the lactone.\n    *   **Change in Priorities**: In the intermediate, the original P1 group has become `-CH₂CH₂OH`, while the original P2 group is still `-CH₂COOH`. The acid group now has a higher priority than the alcohol group.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome**: The original P1 group has become the new lower-priority group (P'2), and the original P2 group has become the new higher-priority group (P'1). Since the priority ranking of the top two groups is swapped, the R/S designation is **INVERTED**.\n    *   **Conclusion for A**: To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product from a reaction pathway that causes inversion, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n5.  **Trace Reaction B (`B + BH₃`)**\n    *   **Reaction Pathway**: `BH₃` reduces the **carboxylic acid group** (P2) to a primary alcohol. The ester group (P1) is left unchanged. The resulting 5-hydroxy ester cyclizes to form the lactone.\n    *   **Change in Priorities**: In the intermediate, the original P1 group is still `-CH₂COOiBu`, while the original P2 group has become `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The ester group still has a higher priority than the new alcohol group.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome**: The original P1 group remains the highest priority group. The priority order between the main arms is preserved. Therefore, the R/S designation is **RETAINED**.\n    *   **Conclusion for B**: To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product from a reaction pathway that causes retention, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n*   Starting Material A must be: **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting Material B must also be: **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option **C**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires a careful, step-by-step analysis of two different chemical reactions. The key to solving it is to correctly determine both the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents and the resulting stereochemical outcome for each pathway.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Molecules and Reagents\n\n*   **Starting Material**: `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Its structure is `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`. It contains a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`). It has a single chiral center at the C3 carbon.\n*   **Product**: `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone) formed by cyclization.\n*   **Reagents**:\n    *   **Reaction A**: `LiBH₄` (Lithium borohydride) selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Reaction B**: `BH₃` (Borane) selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n\n### Step 2: Assign Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priorities\n\nThis step is crucial for determining the stereochemical outcome (retention or inversion of the R/S label).\n\n*   **At the Chiral Center (C3) of the Starting Material:** The four attached groups are:\n    1.  `-H` (Hydrogen)\n    2.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n    3.  `-CH₂COOH` (The \"acid arm\")\n    4.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (The \"ester arm\")\n\n    To determine the priority between the acid and ester arms, we follow the chain. The first carbon in each arm (`-CH₂-`) is identical. The second carbon in each arm is a carbonyl carbon. The point of difference is what the carbonyl's oxygen is attached to. In the acid arm, it's `-OH`. In the ester arm, it's `-O-C₄H₉` (isobutyl). Since Carbon (C) has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen (H), the ester arm has higher priority.\n\n    *   **Priority Order (Starting Material):**\n        *   **P1**: `-CH₂COOiBu`\n        *   **P2**: `-CH₂COOH`\n        *   **P3**: `-CH₂CH₃`\n        *   **P4**: `-H`\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Reaction A\n\n*   **Reaction**: `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-Lactone`\n*   **Mechanism**: `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester group (P1)** to a primary alcohol. The acid group (P2) is unaffected and becomes the carbonyl group of the final lactone.\n*   **Stereochemical Analysis**:\n    *   The group that was **P1** (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is reduced and becomes the `-CH₂CH₂O-` part of the lactone ring.\n    *   The group that was **P2** (`-CH₂COOH`) becomes the `-CH₂C(=O)O-` part of the ring.\n    *   In the final lactone, the carbonyl part (`-CH₂C(=O)O-`) has a higher priority than the ether part (`-CH₂CH₂O-`).\n    *   Therefore, the starting P1 becomes the new lower priority group, and the starting P2 becomes the new higher priority group. The priorities of the top two groups are **swapped**. A swap of priorities at a chiral center results in an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for A**: Since the reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration, to obtain the **(R)**-product, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Reaction B\n\n*   **Reaction**: `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-Lactone`\n*   **Mechanism**: `BH₃` reduces the **acid group (P2)** to a primary alcohol. The ester group (P1) is unaffected and becomes the carbonyl group of the final lactone.\n*   **Stereochemical Analysis**:\n    *   The group that was **P1** (`-CH₂COOiBu`) becomes the `-CH₂C(=O)O-` part of the ring.\n    *   The group that was **P2** (`-CH₂COOH`) is reduced and becomes the `-CH₂CH₂O-` part of the ring.\n    *   The carbonyl part retains its higher priority over the ether part.\n    *   Therefore, the starting P1 becomes the new higher priority group, and the starting P2 becomes the new lower priority group. The priority order is **preserved**. This results in **retention** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for B**: Since the reaction proceeds with retention of configuration, to obtain the **(S)**-product, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### Step 5: Final Determination\n\n*   Starting Material A must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting Material B must also be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same (S)-enantiomer.

    "This problem requires a detailed analysis of two different reactions, focusing on both the selectivity of the reducing agents and the resulting stereochemistry. A careful step-by-step approach is necessary.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThe starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, has two functional groups that can be reduced: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOiBu`). The two reagents used have opposite selectivities:\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride)**: This reagent is known to selectively reduce **esters** to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids largely unaffected.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane)**: This reagent has the opposite selectivity, preferentially reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols, while being much less reactive towards esters.\n\n### **Step 2: Assign Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priorities**\n\nThis is the most critical step, as it determines how the reaction affects the R/S stereochemical designation.

According to CIP rules, we look at the first point of difference. In the ester's alkoxy group (`-O-iBu`), the oxygen is bonded to a carbon. In the acid's hydroxyl group (`-O-H`), the oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen. Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester arm has a higher priority.\n    *   **Priority 1 (P1):** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n    *   **Priority 2 (P2):** `-CH₂COOH`\n    *   **Priority 3 (P3):** `-CH₂CH₃`\n    *   **Priority 4 (P4):** `-H`\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-Lactone`\n*   **Pathway:** LiBH₄ reduces the **ester group (P1)** to a primary alcohol.

Core Principles of the Problem**\n\nTo solve this question, we must understand two key principles of organic chemistry:\n*   **Chemoselectivity:** Different reagents react preferentially with specific functional groups. Here, we must know the different selectivities of Lithium borohydride (`LiBH₄`) and Borane (`BH₃`) towards esters and carboxylic acids.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We need to determine how each reaction affects the R/S designation of the chiral center. This requires a Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority analysis, as the designation can change even if no bonds to the chiral center are broken.\n\n### **2. Analysis of the Reactions**\n\n#### **Step 2.1: Starting Material and Product**\n*   **Starting Material**: `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid` (`HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`). It has a chiral center at C3 with two main branches attached: an \"acid arm\" (`-CH₂COOH`) and an \"ester arm\" (`-CH₂COOiBu`).\n*   **Product**: `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a delta-lactone.\n\n#### **Step 2.2: Reagent Selectivity**\n*   **Reaction A (`LiBH₄`):** This reagent selectively reduces the **ester** to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid intact. The resulting 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid then cyclizes.\n*   **Reaction B (`BH₃`):** This reagent selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid** to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester intact. The resulting 5-hydroxyester then cyclizes.\n\n### **3. The Crucial Step: Stereochemical Analysis via CIP Priorities**\n\nThe absolute 3D arrangement of groups around the chiral center is preserved. However, the R/S label can change if the priority ranking of the groups is altered. A careful analysis of the candidate answers reveals this is the deciding factor.\n\n**A. CIP Priorities in the Starting Material**\nThe four groups attached to the chiral center C3 are ranked as follows:\n1.  **-CH₂COOiBu** (ester arm) - *Highest priority*\n2.  **-CH₂COOH** (acid arm)\n3.  **-CH₂CH₃** (ethyl group)\n4.  **-H** (hydrogen) - *Lowest priority*\n\nThe ester arm (P1) outranks the acid arm (P2) because the ester's oxygen is bonded to a carbon, while the acid's hydroxyl oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen.\n\n**B. Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction A (`LiBH₄`)**\n1.  **Transformation:** The ester arm (P1) is reduced to an alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid arm (P2) remains unchanged.\n2.  **New Priorities:** In the resulting hydroxy-acid, the acid arm (`-CH₂COOH`) now has higher priority than the new alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n3.  **Conclusion:** The group that was originally P1 becomes lower priority than the group that was originally P2. The priority ranking of the two main arms is swapped. This results in an **INVERSION** of the stereochemical designation (an S starting material becomes an R product).\n4.  **Application:** To obtain the **(R)**-product, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n**C. Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction B (`BH₃`)**\n1.  **Transformation:** The acid arm (P2) is reduced to an alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester arm (P1) remains unchanged.\n2.  **New Priorities:** In the resulting hydroxy-ester, the ester arm (`-CH₂COOiBu`) still has higher priority than the new alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n3.  **Conclusion:** The original P1 group remains P1. The relative priority ranking of the two main arms is preserved. This results in a **RETENTION** of the stereochemical designation (an S starting material remains an S product).\n4.  **Application:** To obtain the **(S)**-product, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **4. Final Determination**\n\nBased on the rigorous stereochemical analysis, which is correctly identified by the majority of the candidate answers (even if some selected the wrong final option letter):\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option C from the question.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer. The solution hinges on two key chemical principles: the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents and the effect of the chemical transformations on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) stereochemical designations.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Structure and Functional Groups\n\n*   **Starting Material**: `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Its structure is `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`.\n*   It has two functional groups that can be reduced: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COO-iBu`).\n*   It has one chiral center at the C3 carbon, where the ethyl group is attached.\n\n*   **Product**: `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone). The chiral center from the start (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4).\n\n### Step 2: Determine Reagent Selectivity\n\nThe two reactions use different reducing agents with opposite selectivity:\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**: This reagent selectively reduces **esters** to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane)**: This reagent selectively reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Stereochemistry (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Priorities)\n\nThis is the most critical part of the problem. While no bonds at the chiral center itself are broken (meaning the 3D arrangement of atoms is unchanged), the R/S designation can change if the CIP priority order of the attached groups is altered by the reactions.\n\n*   **Priorities in the Starting Material (at C3):**\n    The four groups attached to the chiral center are:\n    1.  `-H`\n    2.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n    3.  `-CH₂COOH` (The \"acid arm\")\n    4.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (The \"ester arm\")\n\n    To determine the priority between the acid and ester arms, we compare them atom by atom. The ester arm has higher priority because its oxygen is attached to a carbon (of the isobutyl group), while the acid's hydroxyl oxygen is attached to a hydrogen. Carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen.\n    *   **Priority Order:** **-CH₂COOiBu (P1) > -CH₂COOH (P2)** > -CH₂CH₃ (P3) > -H (P4)\n\n### Step 4: Trace Reaction A\n\n*   **Reaction**: `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone`\n*   **Mechanism**: `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester arm (P1)** to a primary alcohol. The acid arm (P2) is unchanged.\n*   **New Priorities in the Intermediate**: The arms are now `-CH₂COOH` and `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The acid arm has higher priority than the alcohol arm.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**:\n    *   The group that was originally Priority 1 (ester arm) becomes the new Priority 2 (alcohol arm).\n    *   The group that was originally Priority 2 (acid arm) becomes the new Priority 1.\n    *   Since the ranks of the top two groups are swapped, the R/S designation is **INVERTED**.\n*   **Conclusion for A**: To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product via an inversion pathway, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n### Step 5: Trace Reaction B\n\n*   **Reaction**: `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone`\n*   **Mechanism**: `BH₃` reduces the **acid arm (P2)** to a primary alcohol. The ester arm (P1) is unchanged.\n*   **New Priorities in the Intermediate**: The arms are now `-CH₂COOiBu` and `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The ester arm still has higher priority than the new alcohol arm.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**:\n    *   The group that was originally Priority 1 (ester arm) remains Priority 1.\n    *   The group that was originally Priority 2 (acid arm) is converted to a new group that is still lower in priority than the ester arm.\n    *   The relative priority order of the main arms is maintained. The R/S designation is **RETAINED**.\n*   **Conclusion for B**: To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product via a retention pathway, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### Step 6: Final Conclusion\n\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem requires a multi-step analysis involving reagent selectivity and a careful examination of stereochemical consequences based on Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem and Analyze Reagent Selectivity\n\n*   **Starting Material**: The options provide enantiomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule contains both a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`). The chiral center is the carbon at position 3, bonded to an ethyl group.\n*   **Product**: `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, which is a six-membered lactone (cyclic ester). Reaction A produces the (R) enantiomer, and Reaction B produces the (S) enantiomer.\n*   **Reaction A Reagent**: `LiBH₄` (Lithium borohydride) is a chemoselective reducing agent that reduces **esters** to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids intact.\n*   **Reaction B Reagent**: `BH₃` (Borane) has the opposite selectivity; it reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols while leaving esters intact.\n\n### Step 2: Stereochemical Analysis Using CIP Priority Rules\n\nThis is the most critical step. Although the bonds at the chiral center itself are not broken, the R/S designation can change if the chemical transformations alter the priority ranking of the groups attached to the chiral center's chain.\n\n**A. Assigning Initial Priorities (Starting Material)**\n\nThe four groups attached to the chiral center (C3) are -H, -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl), `-CH₂COOH` (the \"acid arm\"), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (the \"ester arm\").\n1.  To compare the acid arm and ester arm, we look down the chain. At the final oxygen, the acid's oxygen is bonded to H, while the ester's oxygen is bonded to a Carbon (of the isobutyl group).\n2.  Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester arm has higher priority.\n3.  **The CIP priority order for the starting material is**:\n    *   Priority 1 (P1): `-CH₂COOiBu`\n    *   Priority 2 (P2): `-CH₂COOH`\n    *   Priority 3 (P3): `-CH₂CH₃`\n    *   Priority 4 (P4): `-H`\n\n**B. Analyzing Reaction A: `A + LiBH₄ → (R)-Lactone`**\n\n1.  **Chemical Change**: `LiBH₄` reduces the ester group (P1) to a primary alcohol. The acid group (P2) is unchanged.\n2.  **Lactone Formation**: The resulting hydroxy-acid cyclizes. The new carbonyl (`C=O`) of the lactone comes from the original acid group (P2), and the new ether oxygen (`-O-`) of the lactone ring comes from the reduced ester group (P1).\n3.  **Priority Change**: The arm derived from the original P2 is now `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` and has the higher priority. The arm derived from the original P1 is now `-CH₂-CH₂O-` and has the lower priority.\n4.  **Stereochemical Consequence**: The group that was P1 in the starting material becomes the new P'2, and the group that was P2 becomes the new P'1. The priorities of the top two groups **swap**. This leads to an **INVERSION** of the stereochemical designation (an S starting material gives an R product).\n5.  **Conclusion for A**: To obtain the **(R)**-lactone via inversion, starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n**C. Analyzing Reaction B: `B + BH₃ → (S)-Lactone`**\n\n1.  **Chemical Change**: `BH₃` reduces the acid group (P2) to a primary alcohol. The ester group (P1) is unchanged.\n2.  **Lactone Formation**: The resulting hydroxy-ester cyclizes. The new carbonyl (`C=O`) of the lactone comes from the original ester group (P1), and the new ether oxygen (`-O-`) comes from the reduced acid group (P2).\n3.  **Priority Change**: The arm derived from the original P1 is `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` and remains the higher priority group. The arm derived from the original P2 is now `-CH₂-CH₂O-` and becomes the lower priority group.\n4.  **Stereochemical Consequence**: The group that was P1 remains the highest priority group, and the group derived from P2 remains the second-highest. The priority ranking is **maintained**. This leads to a **RETENTION** of the stereochemical designation (an S starting material gives an S product).\n5.  **Conclusion for B**: To obtain the **(S)**-lactone via retention, starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n### Step 3: Final Determination\n\n*   From the analysis of Reaction A, starting material A must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   From the analysis of Reaction B, starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nTherefore, both reactions start with the same (S)-enantiomer. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis problem requires a careful, step-by-step analysis of two different chemical reactions, focusing on both the selectivity of the reducing agents and the resulting stereochemistry. The key to solving this is understanding how the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules apply before and after the chemical transformations.\n\n### **1. Structure and Functional Group Analysis**\n\n*   **Starting Material**: `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Its structure is `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`. It contains a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`), an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`), and a single chiral center at the C3 carbon where the ethyl group is attached.\n*   **Product**: `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, which is a six-membered lactone (a cyclic ester).\n\n### **2. Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThe two reducing agents have opposite preferences for which functional group they reduce:\n*   `LiBH₄` **(Lithium borohydride)**: Selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   `BH₃` **(Borane)**: Selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n### **3. Stereochemical Analysis (The Crucial Step)**\n\nThe absolute 3D arrangement of the groups at the chiral center does not change, as no bonds at this center are broken. However, the R/S *designation* can change if the chemical modification alters the CIP priority ranking of the groups.\n\n**Step 3.1: CIP Priorities in the Starting Material**\n\nAt the chiral center (C3), we rank the four attached groups:\n1.  `-H` (Hydrogen)\n2.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n3.  `-CH₂COOH` (The \"acid arm\")\n4.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (The \"ester arm\")\n\nTo prioritize between the acid and ester arms, we compare them atom by atom. The ester arm (`-O-C` from the isobutyl group) has higher priority than the acid arm (`-O-H` from the hydroxyl group) because Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen.\n\nTherefore, the priority order is:\n*   **Priority 1**: `-CH₂COOiBu`\n*   **Priority 2**: `-CH₂COOH`\n*   **Priority 3**: `-CH₂CH₃`\n*   **Priority 4**: `-H`\n\n**Step 3.2: Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction**: `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-Lactone`\n*   **Mechanism**: `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester group (Priority 1)** to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The carboxylic acid group **(Priority 2)** is unchanged.\n*   **Change in Priorities**: In the resulting `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` intermediate, the acid group now has a higher priority than the newly formed alcohol group.\n*   **Outcome**: The group that was originally Priority 1 has become lower priority than the group that was originally Priority 2. This **swapping of priorities results in an INVERSION of the R/S designation**.\n*   **Conclusion for A**: To obtain the **(R)**-product via an inversion pathway, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n**Step 3.3: Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction**: `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-Lactone`\n*   **Mechanism**: `BH₃` reduces the **carboxylic acid group (Priority 2)** to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group **(Priority 1)** is unchanged.\n*   **Change in Priorities**: In the resulting `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate` intermediate, the ester group is still higher priority than the newly formed alcohol group.\n*   **Outcome**: The priority ranking of the main groups is preserved. The group that was Priority 1 is still higher priority than the group that was derived from Priority 2. This **preservation of priorities results in a RETENTION of the R/S designation**.\n*   **Conclusion for B**: To obtain the **(S)**-product via a retention pathway, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Final Determination**\n\n*   Starting Material **A** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting Material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth reactions must start with the same (S)-enantiomer. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires a detailed analysis of two separate chemical reactions, focusing on reagent selectivity and the stereochemical consequences. Let's break down the logic step by step.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Starting Material and Product Structures**\n\n*   **Starting Material**: `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Its structure is `HOOC–CH₂–CH(Et)–CH₂–COO-iBu`. This molecule has two important features:\n    1.  Two different functional groups that can be reduced: a carboxylic acid (`–COOH`) and an ester (`–COO-iBu`).\n    2.  A single chiral center at the C3 position, which is attached to an ethyl group (`–Et`).\n*   **Product**: `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone). It is formed when a precursor molecule (a 5-hydroxy acid) cyclizes. The chiral C3 in the starting material becomes the chiral C4 in the product.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Selectivity of the Reducing Agents**\n\nThe choice of reducing agent determines which functional group is transformed, leading to different pathways.\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**: This reagent selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols. It is much less reactive towards carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane)**: This reagent has the opposite selectivity; it selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols and is less reactive towards esters.\n\n### **3. Perform the Stereochemical Analysis (The Decisive Step)**\n\nThe absolute 3D arrangement of the atoms at the chiral center does not change in these reactions. However, the *R/S* designation is determined by the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules. If the chemical transformations change the priorities of the groups attached to the chiral center's chain, the *R/S* label can be inverted even if the 3D structure is retained.\n\n**CIP Priorities in the Starting Material (at C3):**\nThe four groups attached to the chiral center are -H, `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl), `-CH₂COOH` (acid side), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side).\n*   To rank the acid and ester sides, we look at the first point of difference. In the ester (`-COOiBu`), the oxygen is bonded to a carbon atom of the isobutyl group. In the acid (`-COOH`), the hydroxyl oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen atom. Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester side has higher priority.\n*   **Priority Order:** `(-CH₂COOiBu)` > `(-CH₂COOH)` > `(-CH₂CH₃)` > `(-H)`.\n\n#### **Pathway A: `A + LiBH₄ → (R)-lactone`**\n\n1.  **Chemical Transformation**: LiBH₄ reduces the **ester** group (`-CH₂COOiBu`, the higher priority group) to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group (`-CH₂COOH`, the lower priority group) remains.\n2.  **New Priorities**: We now compare the resulting arms: `-CH₂COOH` and `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The acid group now has a higher priority than the newly formed alcohol group.\n3.  **Stereochemical Consequence**: The group that was originally Priority 1 (ester side) has become a lower priority group (alcohol side), while the group that was originally Priority 2 (acid side) is now the highest priority group. The priorities of the two main arms have swapped. This results in an **INVERSION** of the stereochemical designation (an (S) starting material becomes an (R) product, and vice-versa).\n4.  **Conclusion for A**: To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product via this inversion pathway, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n#### **Pathway B: `B + BH₃ → (S)-lactone`**\n\n1.  **Chemical Transformation**: BH₃ reduces the **acid** group (`-CH₂COOH`, the lower priority group) to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`, the higher priority group) remains.\n2.  **New Priorities**: We now compare the resulting arms: `-CH₂COOiBu` and `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The ester group still has higher priority than the newly formed alcohol group.\n3.  **Stereochemical Consequence**: The group that was originally Priority 1 (ester side) remains the highest priority group. The group that was originally Priority 2 was changed, but the overall priority ranking between the two main arms is maintained (`ester > alcohol` is the same as `ester > acid`). This results in a **RETENTION** of the stereochemical designation (an (S) starting material becomes an (S) product).\n4.  **Conclusion for B**: To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product via this retention pathway, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of both reaction pathways:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBoth reactions start with the same (S) enantiomer. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials, A and B. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the selectivity of the reducing agents and correctly analyzing the stereochemical outcome by applying the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n### **1. Core Principles**\n\n*   **Structure of Starting Material:** `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, with a chiral center at carbon-3. Its structure is `HOOC-CH₂(C2)-CH(Et)(C3)-CH₂(C4)-C(=O)O-iBu(C5)`.\n*   **Structure of Product:** `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a delta-lactone. The chiral center C3 from the start becomes C4 in the product.\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:**\n    *   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** Selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols.\n    *   **BH₃ (Borane):** Selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The R/S designation of the chiral center is determined by the priority of the attached groups. While the reaction doesn't break bonds at the chiral center, it modifies the attached groups, which can change their priority and thus invert the R/S label.\n\n### **2. Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priority Analysis**\n\nThis is the most critical step for a rigorous solution.\n\n*   **Groups at Chiral Center (C3) of Starting Material:**\n    1.  `G1 = -CH₂COOiBu` (ester side)\n    2.  `G2 = -CH₂COOH` (acid side)\n    3.  `G3 = -CH₂CH₃` (ethyl)\n    4.  `G4 = -H` (hydrogen)\n*   **Priority Ranking:** To compare G1 and G2, we look at the point of first difference. In the alkoxy group `-O-iBu` of the ester, the oxygen is attached to a carbon. In the hydroxyl group `-O-H` of the acid, the oxygen is attached to a hydrogen. Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester side has higher priority.\n    *   **Priority Order:** `G1 (-CH₂COOiBu)` > `G2 (-CH₂COOH)` > `G3 (-Et)` > `G4 (-H)`\n\n### **3. Analyzing Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-Lactone`\n*   **Pathway:** LiBH₄ reduces the **ester** group (G1) to a primary alcohol. The resulting hydroxy-acid cyclizes.\n*   **Transformation of Groups:**\n    *   G1 (`-CH₂COOiBu`) becomes `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n    *   G2 (`-CH₂COOH`) remains `-CH₂COOH`.\n*   **New Priorities in Intermediate:** Comparing the new groups, the acid (`-CH₂COOH`) has higher priority than the alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n*   **Stereochemical Result:** The group that was originally Priority #1 has become a lower priority group, and the group that was Priority #2 is now the new Priority #1. The ranks of the top two groups have **swapped**. A swap in priority **inverts** the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To get an **(R)** product from an **inversion** pathway, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n### **4. Analyzing Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-Lactone`\n*   **Pathway:** BH₃ reduces the **carboxylic acid** group (G2) to a primary alcohol. The resulting hydroxy-ester cyclizes.\n*   **Transformation of Groups:**\n    *   G1 (`-CH₂COOiBu`) remains `-CH₂COOiBu`.\n    *   G2 (`-CH₂COOH`) becomes `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n*   **New Priorities in Intermediate:** Comparing the new groups, the ester (`-CH₂COOiBu`) still has higher priority than the alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n*   **Stereochemical Result:** The group that was originally Priority #1 remains Priority #1. The group that was Priority #2 was modified into a new group that is still of lower priority than the first. The priority order of the main groups has been **preserved**. This results in **retention** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** To get an **(S)** product from a **retention** pathway, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reaction pathways:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option D, where both A and B are the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem requires a detailed analysis of the chemoselectivity of two different reducing agents and a rigorous examination of the stereochemical consequences of the reactions. The key to solving this problem lies in determining how the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents on the chiral center change as a result of the chemical transformations.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Structure and Functional Group Identification**\n    *   **Starting Material:** `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n        *   Its structure is `HOOC-CH₂(a)-CH(Et)-CH₂(b)-COOiBu`.\n        *   It contains a carboxylic acid functional group (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester functional group (`-COOiBu`).\n        *   There is a single chiral center at the C3 position, the carbon bearing the ethyl group.\n    *   **Product:** `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n        *   This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone).\n        *   The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4).\n\n2.  **Reagent Selectivity**\n    *   **LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride):** This is a selective reducing agent that reduces **esters** to primary alcohols much faster than it reduces carboxylic acids.\n    *   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent shows the opposite selectivity. It reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols much faster than it reduces esters.\n\n3.  **Stereochemical Analysis (The Decisive Step)**\n    The core of the problem is determining if the R/S designation is retained or inverted. While no bonds are broken at the chiral center itself, the R/S *label* can change if the CIP priorities of the attached groups are altered by the reactions.\n\n    *   **CIP Priorities in the Starting Material (at C3):**\n        The four groups attached to the chiral center are: -H, -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), `-CH₂COOH` (the acid arm), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (the ester arm).\n        To determine the priority between the acid and ester arms, we compare them atom-by-atom from the chiral center. In the ester arm, the oxygen of the alkoxy group (`-O-iBu`) is attached to a carbon atom. In the acid arm, the oxygen of the hydroxyl group (`-OH`) is attached to a hydrogen atom. Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester arm has a higher priority.\n        *   **Priority 1 (P1):** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n        *   **Priority 2 (P2):** `-CH₂COOH`\n        *   **Priority 3 (P3):** `-CH₂CH₃`\n        *   **Priority 4 (P4):** `-H`\n\n4.  **Tracing Reaction A: A + LiBH₄ → (R)-Lactone**\n    *   **Reaction Pathway:** `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester group (P1)** to a primary alcohol. The **acid group (P2)** is untouched and later forms the carbonyl of the lactone.\n    *   **Mapping to Product:** The original **P1** (`-CH₂COOiBu`) becomes the `-CH₂CH₂OH` group, which forms the ether part of the lactone. The original **P2** (`-CH₂COOH`) forms the carbonyl part of the lactone (`-CH₂C(=O)O-`).\n    *   **Priority Change:** In the final product, the carbonyl part has a higher priority than the ether part. Therefore, the group that was originally **P2** is now the higher priority group, and the group that was originally **P1** is now the lower priority group. The priority ranks of the top two groups are swapped.\n    *   **Stereochemical Result:** A swap in the priorities of two groups on a chiral center results in an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-lactone via a reaction pathway that causes inversion, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n5.  **Tracing Reaction B: B + BH₃ → (S)-Lactone**\n    *   **Reaction Pathway:** `BH₃` reduces the **acid group (P2)** to a primary alcohol. The **ester group (P1)** is untouched and later forms the carbonyl of the lactone.\n    *   **Mapping to Product:** The original **P1** (`-CH₂COOiBu`) forms the carbonyl part of the lactone (`-CH₂C(=O)O-`). The original **P2** (`-CH₂COOH`) is reduced and forms the ether part of the lactone (`-CH₂CH₂O-`).\n    *   **Priority Change:** In the final product, the carbonyl part has a higher priority than the ether part. Therefore, the group that was originally **P1** is still the highest priority group, and the group that was originally **P2** has been transformed into a new group that is still of lower priority. The priority order of the top two groups is maintained.\n    *   **Stereochemical Result:** Since the priority order is maintained, the R/S designation is **retained**.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-lactone via a reaction pathway that causes retention, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same (S)-enantiomer. This matches the description in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem requires a careful, step-by-step analysis of two distinct chemical reactions, focusing on both the selectivity of the reagents and the stereochemical consequences of the transformations.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Structures**\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is a stereoisomer of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`\n    *   This molecule contains two functional groups that can be reduced: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COO-iBu`).\n    *   It has one chiral center at Carbon-3, which is bonded to an ethyl group.\n*   **Product:** The product of both reactions is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone).\n    *   The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Selectivity of the Reducing Agents**\nThis is the key to understanding which part of the starting molecule is modified in each reaction.\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride):** Selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols. It is not effective at reducing carboxylic acids under these conditions.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** Selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. It is much less reactive towards esters.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemical Consequences using CIP Rules**\nThis is the most critical and subtle part of the problem. While no bonds at the chiral center itself are broken (preserving the 3D arrangement), the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) R/S designation can change if the priorities of the attached chemical groups are altered by the reaction.\n\n**3.1. Priorities in the Starting Material**\nThe four groups attached to the chiral center C3 are:\n1.  `-H` (Hydrogen)\n2.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n3.  The arm with the carboxylic acid: `-CH₂COOH`\n4.  The arm with the ester: `-CH₂COOiBu`\n\nTo compare the acid arm and the ester arm, we follow the CIP rules. The ester arm (`-CH₂-C(=O)O-C₄H₉`) has higher priority than the acid arm (`-CH₂-C(=O)O-H`) because the oxygen is attached to a carbon in the former and a hydrogen in the latter. Carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen.\n*   **Priority Order (Start):** `-CH₂COOiBu` (P1) > `-CH₂COOH` (P2) > `-CH₂CH₃` (P3) > `-H` (P4).\n\n**3.2. Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction A**\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-Lactone`\n*   **Transformation:** `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester group** (original P1) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The carboxylic acid group (original P2) is untouched. The resulting hydroxy-acid then cyclizes.\n*   **Change in Priorities:** The groups attached to the chiral center in the hydroxy-acid intermediate are `-CH₂COOH` and `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The carboxylic acid group now has a higher priority than the new alcohol group.\n*   **Result:** The original highest priority group (P1, ester) has become a lower priority group. The original second priority group (P2, acid) is now the highest priority group. Since the ranks of the top two groups have been swapped, the R/S designation is **INVERTED**.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-lactone via a reaction pathway that causes inversion, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n**3.3. Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction B**\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-Lactone`\n*   **Transformation:** `BH₃` reduces the **carboxylic acid group** (original P2) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group (original P1) is untouched. The resulting hydroxy-ester then cyclizes.\n*   **Change in Priorities:** The groups attached to the chiral center in the hydroxy-ester intermediate are `-CH₂COOiBu` and `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The ester group still has a higher priority than the new alcohol group.\n*   **Result:** The original highest priority group (P1, ester) remains the highest priority group. The original second priority group (P2, acid) has become a group that is still lower in priority than P1. The relative priority order is maintained. This results in **RETENTION** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-lactone via a reaction pathway that causes retention, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n*   For reaction A, starting material A is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   For reaction B, starting material B is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBoth A and B are the same starting material, the (S)-enantiomer. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis is an organic chemistry problem that requires a deep understanding of reaction mechanisms, reagent selectivity, and stereochemistry, specifically the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structures:**\n    *   **Starting Material**: `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This is a dicarboxylic acid derivative with a chiral center at C3. Its structure can be represented as `HOOC–CH₂–CH(Et)–CH₂–COOiBu`. It has two functional groups susceptible to reduction: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOiBu`).\n    *   **Product**: `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, known as a delta-lactone. Its chiral center is at C4, which corresponds to the C3 of the starting material.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reagent Selectivity:**\n    The two reactions use different reducing agents with opposing selectivity, which is the key to this problem.\n    *   **Reaction A (`LiBH₄`):** Lithium borohydride is a selective reducing agent that reduces **esters** to alcohols but does not react with carboxylic acids under these conditions.\n    *   **Reaction B (`BH₃`):** Borane is a selective reducing agent that reduces **carboxylic acids** to alcohols but reacts much more slowly with esters.\n\n3.  **Perform Stereochemical Analysis (The Decisive Step):**\n    The R/S designation of the product depends not just on the 3D arrangement of atoms at the chiral center (which remains unchanged) but on the **priority** of the attached groups, as defined by CIP rules. If the reaction changes the chemical nature of the groups, their priorities can change, potentially \"inverting\" the R/S label.\n\n    *   **CIP Priorities in the Starting Material (at C3):**\n        The four groups on the chiral center are -H, -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl), `-CH₂COOH` (acid arm), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester arm).\n        To assign priority, we compare the acid and ester arms. The ester arm (`-O-C(isobutyl)`) outranks the acid arm (`-O-H`) because Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen.\n        *   **Priority 1 (P1): `-CH₂COOiBu`**\n        *   **Priority 2 (P2): `-CH₂COOH`**\n        *   Priority 3 (P3): `-CH₂CH₃`\n        *   Priority 4 (P4): `-H`\n\n    *   **Tracing Reaction A (`A + LiBH₄ → (R)-Lactone`):**\n        1.  The `LiBH₄` reduces the ester group (**P1**) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n        2.  The acid group (**P2**) remains unchanged.\n        3.  The resulting intermediate is a hydroxy-acid. When it cyclizes, the unchanged acid group (P2) forms the high-priority carbonyl side of the lactone. The reduced ester group (P1) forms the lower-priority ether side of the lactone.\n        4.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The group that was P1 becomes a lower-priority group in the product, and the group that was P2 becomes the highest-priority group. Since the ranks of the top two groups swap, the stereochemical designation is **INVERTED** (an S starting material gives an R product).\n        5.  **Conclusion for A**: To obtain the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n    *   **Tracing Reaction B (`B + BH₃ → (S)-Lactone`):**\n        1.  The `BH₃` reduces the carboxylic acid group (**P2**) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n        2.  The ester group (**P1**) remains unchanged.\n        3.  The resulting intermediate is a hydroxy-ester. When it cyclizes, the unchanged ester group (P1) forms the high-priority carbonyl side of the lactone. The reduced acid group (P2) forms the lower-priority ether side of the lactone.\n        4.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The group that was P1 remains the highest priority, and the group that was P2 is modified but remains a lower-priority group. The relative priority order is maintained. Therefore, the stereochemical designation is **RETAINED** (an S starting material gives an S product).\n        5.  **Conclusion for B**: To obtain the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting Material A = **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting Material B = **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis means both starting materials are the same (S)-enantiomer. Matching this with the provided options:\nA) A = (S)-acid, B = (R)-acid\nB) A = (R)-acid, B = (R)-acid\nC) A = (R)-acid, B = (S)-acid\nD) A = (S)-acid, B = (S)-acid\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n**1. Deconstruction of the Problem**\n*   **Goal**: Determine the absolute stereochemistry (R/S) for the starting materials A and B.\n*   **Starting Material**: Stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`), an ester (`-COOiBu`), and a single chiral center at C3 with an ethyl group.\n*   **Product**: Stereoisomers of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, which is a δ-lactone (six-membered cyclic ester).\n*   **Reaction A**: `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-product`\n*   **Reaction B**: `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-product`\n\n**2. Reagent Selectivity**\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**: This reagent selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane)**: This reagent has the opposite selectivity, reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n**3. Stereochemical Analysis (The Deciding Factor)**\nThe key to this problem is not just the reagent selectivity but how the resulting chemical change affects the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center. While no bonds at the chiral center itself are broken (preserving the 3D arrangement), the R/S *label* can change if the group priorities are altered.\n\n**Step 3.1: CIP Priorities in the Starting Material**\nThe chiral center (C3) is attached to four groups:\n1.  -H\n2.  -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl)\n3.  `-CH₂COOH` (The \"acid arm\")\n4.  `-CH₂C(=O)O-iBu` (The \"ester arm\")\n\nTo determine the priority between the acid and ester arms, we look at the first point of difference. The oxygen in the acid's hydroxyl group is attached to H. The oxygen in the ester's alkoxy group is attached to C (from the isobutyl group). Since C has a higher atomic number than H, the ester arm has a higher priority.\n*   **Priority Order (Starting Material):** **(P1)** `-CH₂COOiBu` > **(P2)** `-CH₂COOH` > **(P3)** `-CH₂CH₃` > **(P4)** `-H`.\n\n**Step 3.2: Analyzing Reaction A (using LiBH₄)**\n1.  **Transformation**: LiBH₄ reduces the ester (the P1 group) to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid (the P2 group) remains unchanged and will form the carbonyl of the final lactone.\n2.  **Priority Change**: In the resulting 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid intermediate, we now compare the `-CH₂COOH` group (from original P2) with the new `-CH₂CH₂OH` group (from original P1). The acid group has a higher priority than the alcohol group.\n3.  **Conclusion**: The group that was originally P1 has become a new group with a lower priority than the group that was originally P2. The priority order of the top two groups has been swapped. A swap in priorities leads to an **INVERSION** of the stereochemical designation.\n4.  **Determination of A**: The reaction is `A → (R)-product` with inversion. Therefore, starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n**Step 3.3: Analyzing Reaction B (using BH₃)**\n1.  **Transformation**: BH₃ reduces the acid (the P2 group) to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester (the P1 group) remains unchanged and will form the carbonyl of the final lactone.\n2.  **Priority Change**: In the resulting 5-hydroxyester intermediate, we compare the `-CH₂COOiBu` group (original P1) with the new `-CH₂CH₂OH` group (from original P2). The ester group still has a higher priority than the new alcohol group.\n3.  **Conclusion**: The group that was originally P1 is still P1'. The group that was originally P2 has been converted to a new group that is still of lower priority. The relative priority order is maintained. This leads to **RETENTION** of the stereochemical designation.\n4.  **Determination of B**: The reaction is `B → (S)-product` with retention. Therefore, starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n**4. Final Answer Synthesis**\n*   Starting material A must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material B must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBoth reactions start with the same (S)-enantiomer. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Identify the Key Chemical Question\nThe problem asks for the stereochemistry of two starting materials, A and B, which are enantiomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This requires analyzing two different reactions and their stereochemical outcomes. The core of the problem involves:\n1.  **Chemoselectivity**: Which functional group (ester or carboxylic acid) is reduced by each reagent?\n2.  **Stereochemistry**: Does the reaction cause the R/S designation of the chiral center to be retained or inverted?\n\n### 2. Analyze Reagent Selectivity\n*   **Reaction A uses LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**: This reagent is known to selectively reduce esters (`-COOR`) to primary alcohols (`-CH₂OH`) while leaving carboxylic acids (`-COOH`) unaffected.\n*   **Reaction B uses BH₃ (Borane)**: This reagent has the opposite selectivity, reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols while leaving esters largely unaffected under the same conditions.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Stereochemical Outcome\nThis is the most crucial part of the analysis. The R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center. A chemical reaction can change a functional group, altering its priority, which can flip the R/S label even if the 3D structure is preserved.\n\n**Step 3a: Assign CIP Priorities in the Starting Material**\n*   The chiral center is C3. The four groups attached are H, ethyl (`-CH₂CH₃`), the acid-side chain (`-CH₂COOH`), and the ester-side chain (`-CH₂COOiBu`).\n*   To compare the acid and ester chains, we look at the first point of difference. The ester's alkoxy oxygen is attached to a carbon (from the isobutyl group), whereas the acid's hydroxyl oxygen is attached to a hydrogen. Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester-side chain has higher priority.\n*   **Priority Order (Start):**\n    1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (**P1**)\n    2.  `-CH₂COOH` (**P2**)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (**P3**)\n    4.  `-H` (**P4**)\n\n**Step 3b: Analyze Pathway A (LiBH₄)**\n1.  **Transformation**: The ester group (**P1**) is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group (**P2**) remains unchanged.\n2.  **New Priorities**: We now compare the unchanged acid group (`-CH₂COOH`) with the new alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group has higher priority.\n3.  **Result**: The group that was originally **P1** is now lower priority than the group that was originally **P2**. The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. This results in an **INVERSION** of the stereochemical designation (an S starting material gives an R product).\n4.  **Conclusion for A**: The reaction `A → (R)-product` proceeds with inversion. Therefore, starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n**Step 3c: Analyze Pathway B (BH₃)**\n1.  **Transformation**: The acid group (**P2**) is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group (**P1**) remains unchanged.\n2.  **New Priorities**: We now compare the unchanged ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) with the new alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group still has higher priority.\n3.  **Result**: The group that was originally **P1** remains the highest priority group. The group that was **P2** is transformed into a group that is still of lower priority than P1. The priority order of the top two groups is maintained. This results in **RETENTION** of the stereochemical designation (an S starting material gives an S product).\n4.  **Conclusion for B**: The reaction `B → (S)-product` proceeds with retention. Therefore, starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same enantiomer. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Identify the Core Task**\n\nThe goal is to determine the absolute stereochemistry (R or S) of two starting materials, A and B, based on the stereochemistry of the products formed after two different reduction reactions. This requires understanding:\n*   The structure of the molecules involved.\n*   The specific reactivity (chemoselectivity) of each reducing agent.\n*   The rules for assigning stereochemical configurations (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog or CIP rules) and how the configuration can be affected by the reactions.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Structures**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting compound is `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`\n    *   It contains a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COO-iBu`).\n    *   It has one chiral center at Carbon-3, which is bonded to an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`), a hydrogen atom, and two different carbon chains.\n\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered lactone (cyclic ester).\n    *   The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4). The 3D arrangement of the groups at this center is not changed, but the R/S label might change.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Chemoselectivity of the Reagents**\n\nThis is the first critical step that determines the reaction pathway.\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride):** Selectively reduces **esters** to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids untouched.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** Selectively reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols while leaving esters untouched.\n\n### **4. Analyze the Stereochemical Outcome (The Decisive Step)**\n\nThe R/S designation depends on the CIP priority of the groups attached to the chiral center. We must check if the chemical modifications alter these priorities.\n\n**Step 4.1: Assign Priorities in the Starting Material**\nThe four groups on the chiral center C3 are:\n1.  `-H`\n2.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n3.  `-CH₂COOH` (The \"acid arm\")\n4.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (The \"ester arm\")\n\nTo compare the acid and ester arms, we follow the chain atom-by-atom. In the ester's alkoxy group (`-O-iBu`), the oxygen is bonded to a carbon. In the acid's hydroxyl group (`-OH`), the oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen. Since carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen, the ester arm has higher priority.\n*   **Priority Order (Starting Material):**\n    *   **Priority 1:** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n    *   **Priority 2:** `-CH₂COOH`\n    *   **Priority 3:** `-CH₂CH₃`\n    *   **Priority 4:** `-H`\n\n**Step 4.2: Analyze Reaction A (LiBH₄ reduction)**\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-Lactone`\n*   **Transformation:** The **ester** group (original Priority 1) is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group (original Priority 2) is unchanged.\n*   **Priority Change:** In the resulting intermediate, we compare the new arms: `-CH₂COOH` vs. `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The acid group now has a higher priority than the alcohol group.\n*   **Stereochemical Consequence:** The group that was Priority 1 is now lower priority than the group that was Priority 2. The priority ranks of the top two groups have **swapped**. A swap of priorities at a chiral center **inverts** its stereochemical designation (an S starting material becomes an R product, and vice versa).\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Since the reaction pathway `A → (R)-Lactone` proceeds with inversion, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n**Step 4.3: Analyze Reaction B (BH₃ reduction)**\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-Lactone`\n*   **Transformation:** The **acid** group (original Priority 2) is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group (original Priority 1) is unchanged.\n*   **Priority Change:** In the resulting intermediate, we compare the new arms: `-CH₂COOiBu` vs. `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The ester group is still higher priority than the new alcohol group.\n*   **Stereochemical Consequence:** The group that was Priority 1 remains Priority 1. The relative priority order of the groups on the chiral center is **maintained**. This results in a **retention** of the stereochemical designation (an S starting material becomes an S product).\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Since the reaction pathway `B → (S)-Lactone` proceeds with retention, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material A must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material B must also be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis problem requires a multi-step analysis involving both chemoselectivity of reducing agents and the stereochemical consequences determined by Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Reaction Pathways and Reagent Selectivity**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The common starting material is `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, which contains both a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) and an ester group (`-COO-iBu`). The chiral center is at C3.\n*   **Product:** The common product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered lactone.\n*   **Reaction A:** The reagent is `LiBH₄` (Lithium borohydride). It is known to selectively reduce **esters** to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids largely unaffected.\n    *   **Pathway:** Ester is reduced -> creates a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid -> cyclizes to lactone.\n*   **Reaction B:** The reagent is `BH₃` (Borane). It selectively reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols while leaving esters largely unaffected.\n    *   **Pathway:** Carboxylic acid is reduced -> creates a 5-hydroxy ester -> cyclizes to lactone.\n\n### **Step 2: Perform Stereochemical Analysis using CIP Priorities**\n\nThis is the most critical step. The R/S designation depends on the priority of the groups attached to the chiral center. If these priorities change due to the chemical transformation, the R/S label can change even if the 3D structure is preserved.\n\n1.  **Priorities in the Starting Material (at Chiral Center C3):**\n    *   The four groups attached are -H, -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl), `-CH₂COOH` (Acid arm), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (Ester arm).\n    *   The ester arm (`-CH₂COOiBu`) has a higher priority than the acid arm (`-CH₂COOH`) because the oxygen in the ester is attached to a carbon (`-O-C...`), while the oxygen in the acid is attached to a hydrogen (`-O-H`).\n    *   Therefore, the initial priority order is:\n        *   **P1**: `-CH₂COOiBu`\n        *   **P2**: `-CH₂COOH`\n        *   **P3**: `-CH₂CH₃`\n        *   **P4**: `-H`\n\n2.  **Analysis of Reaction A (LiBH₄): `A → (R)-Lactone`**\n    *   The ester group (P1) is reduced to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group (P2) is unchanged.\n    *   In the resulting intermediate, we now compare the priorities of `-CH₂COOH` and `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The acid group now has the higher priority.\n    *   **Stereochemical Result:** The original P1 group has become the new P2 group, and the original P2 group has become the new P1 group. Since the ranks of the top two priority groups have been swapped, the R/S designation is **INVERTED**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** To get the **(R)** product via an inversion pathway, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Reaction B (BH₃): `B → (S)-Lactone`**\n    *   The acid group (P2) is reduced to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group (P1) is unchanged.\n    *   In the resulting intermediate, we compare the priorities of `-CH₂COOiBu` and `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The ester group still has the higher priority.\n    *   **Stereochemical Result:** The original P1 group remains the highest priority group. The priority order of the groups is unchanged. Therefore, the R/S designation is **RETAINED**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** To get the **(S)** product via a retention pathway, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis:\n*   Starting Material **A** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting Material **B** is also **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis means both starting materials are the same enantiomer. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nB) A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nC) A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid , B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nD) A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid , B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis is a problem involving the chemoselectivity of reducing agents and stereochemistry, which requires a careful analysis of how Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities change during a reaction.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material and Product Structures**\n    *   **Starting Material**: `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Its structure is `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`. It contains a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`), an ester (`-COOiBu`), and a single chiral center at the C3 carbon, which is bonded to the ethyl group (`Et`).\n    *   **Product**: `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone). The chiral center from the starting material becomes the chiral center in the product.\n\n2.  **Determine Reagent Selectivity**\n    This is the first key step to determine which part of the molecule is reduced in each reaction.\n    *   **Reaction A uses `LiBH₄`**: Lithium borohydride is a mild reducing agent that selectively reduces **esters** to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Reaction B uses `BH₃`**: Borane is a reducing agent that selectively reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n3.  **Perform Stereochemical Analysis (CIP Priorities)**\n    This is the most critical step. The R/S designation of the chiral center depends on the priority ranking of the four attached groups. Even if no bonds at the chiral center are broken, the designation can change if the chemical modification alters the priority ranking.\n\n    *   **Priorities in the Starting Material (at C3):**\n        The four groups are: `-H`, `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl), `-CH₂COOH` (the \"acid arm\"), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (the \"ester arm\").\n        To compare the acid and ester arms, we look for the first point of difference. In the ester arm, the oxygen of the alkoxy group is attached to a carbon (`-O-C`), while in the acid arm, the hydroxyl oxygen is attached to a hydrogen (`-O-H`). Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester arm has higher priority.\n        *   **Priority 1 (P1):** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n        *   **Priority 2 (P2):** `-CH₂COOH`\n        *   **Priority 3 (P3):** `-CH₂CH₃`\n        *   **Priority 4 (P4):** `-H`\n\n4.  **Trace Reaction A (`A + LiBH₄`)**\n    *   **Reaction Pathway**: `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester group** (P1) to a primary alcohol. The acid group (P2) is left unchanged. The resulting 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid cyclizes to form the lactone.\n    *   **Change in Priorities**: In the intermediate, the original P1 group has become `-CH₂CH₂OH`, while the original P2 group is still `-CH₂COOH`. The acid group now has a higher priority than the alcohol group.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome**: The original P1 group has become the new lower-priority group (P'2), and the original P2 group has become the new higher-priority group (P'1). Since the priority ranking of the top two groups is swapped, the R/S designation is **INVERTED**.\n    *   **Conclusion for A**: To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product from a reaction pathway that causes inversion, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n5.  **Trace Reaction B (`B + BH₃`)**\n    *   **Reaction Pathway**: `BH₃` reduces the **carboxylic acid group** (P2) to a primary alcohol.

The resulting 5-hydroxy ester cyclizes to form the lactone.\n    *   **Change in Priorities**: In the intermediate, the original P1 group is still `-CH₂COOiBu`, while the original P2 group has become `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The ester group still has a higher priority than the new alcohol group.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome**: The original P1 group remains the highest priority group. The priority order between the main arms is preserved. Therefore, the R/S designation is **RETAINED**.\n    *   **Conclusion for B**: To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product from a reaction pathway that causes retention, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n*   Starting Material A must be: **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting Material B must also be: **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option **C**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires a careful, step-by-step analysis of two different chemical reactions. The key to solving it is to correctly determine both the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents and the resulting stereochemical outcome for each pathway.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Molecules and Reagents\n\n*   **Starting Material**: `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Its structure is `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`. It contains a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`). It has a single chiral center at the C3 carbon.\n*   **Product**: `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone) formed by cyclization.\n*   **Reagents**:\n    *   **Reaction A**: `LiBH₄` (Lithium borohydride) selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Reaction B**: `BH₃` (Borane) selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n\n### Step 2: Assign Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priorities\n\nThis step is crucial for determining the stereochemical outcome (retention or inversion of the R/S label).\n\n*   **At the Chiral Center (C3) of the Starting Material:** The four attached groups are:\n    1.  `-H` (Hydrogen)\n    2.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n    3.  `-CH₂COOH` (The \"acid arm\")\n    4.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (The \"ester arm\")\n\n    To determine the priority between the acid and ester arms, we follow the chain. The first carbon in each arm (`-CH₂-`) is identical. The second carbon in each arm is a carbonyl carbon. The point of difference is what the carbonyl's oxygen is attached to. In the acid arm, it's `-OH`. In the ester arm, it's `-O-C₄H₉` (isobutyl). Since Carbon (C) has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen (H), the ester arm has higher priority.\n\n    *   **Priority Order (Starting Material):**\n        *   **P1**: `-CH₂COOiBu`\n        *   **P2**: `-CH₂COOH`\n        *   **P3**: `-CH₂CH₃`\n        *   **P4**: `-H`\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Reaction A\n\n*   **Reaction**: `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-Lactone`\n*   **Mechanism**: `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester group (P1)** to a primary alcohol. The acid group (P2) is unaffected and becomes the carbonyl group of the final lactone.\n*   **Stereochemical Analysis**:\n    *   The group that was **P1** (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is reduced and becomes the `-CH₂CH₂O-` part of the lactone ring.\n    *   The group that was **P2** (`-CH₂COOH`) becomes the `-CH₂C(=O)O-` part of the ring.\n    *   In the final lactone, the carbonyl part (`-CH₂C(=O)O-`) has a higher priority than the ether part (`-CH₂CH₂O-`).\n    *   Therefore, the starting P1 becomes the new lower priority group, and the starting P2 becomes the new higher priority group. The priorities of the top two groups are **swapped**. A swap of priorities at a chiral center results in an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for A**: Since the reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration, to obtain the **(R)**-product, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Reaction B\n\n*   **Reaction**: `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-Lactone`\n*   **Mechanism**: `BH₃` reduces the **acid group (P2)** to a primary alcohol. The ester group (P1) is unaffected and becomes the carbonyl group of the final lactone.\n*   **Stereochemical Analysis**:\n    *   The group that was **P1** (`-CH₂COOiBu`) becomes the `-CH₂C(=O)O-` part of the ring.\n    *   The group that was **P2** (`-CH₂COOH`) is reduced and becomes the `-CH₂CH₂O-` part of the ring.\n    *   The carbonyl part retains its higher priority over the ether part.\n    *   Therefore, the starting P1 becomes the new higher priority group, and the starting P2 becomes the new lower priority group. The priority order is **preserved**. This results in **retention** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for B**: Since the reaction proceeds with retention of configuration, to obtain the **(S)**-product, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### Step 5: Final Determination\n\n*   Starting Material A must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting Material B must also be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same (S)-enantiomer. This matches the description in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
