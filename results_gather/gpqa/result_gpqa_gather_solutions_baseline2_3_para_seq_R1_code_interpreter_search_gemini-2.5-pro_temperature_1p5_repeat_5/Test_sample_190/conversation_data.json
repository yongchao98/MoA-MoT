This molecule contains three distinct functional groups: a ketone (C=O), a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n    *   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n    *   **Careful Points:** NaH is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will react with the most acidic proton in the molecule. The pKa of a primary alcohol (~17) is lower (more acidic) than that of the protons alpha to the ketone (~20). Therefore, NaH will selectively deprotonate the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide is a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon of benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction. This is a classic protection strategy for alcohols, converting the hydroxymethyl group into a benzyl ether.\n    *   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n    *   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic acid (HCl).\n    *   **Careful Points:** This is a standard condensation reaction where a ketone or aldehyde reacts with a hydrazine derivative. The ketone at C-1 of Product 1 reacts with the tosylhydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs), with the elimination of a water molecule. This step prepares the molecule for the Shapiro reaction.\n    *   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Deoxygenation (Shapiro Reaction)**\n    *   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n    *   **Careful Points:** These are the conditions for a Shapiro reaction. n-BuLi is a very strong base. Two equivalents are used to first deprotonate the -NHTs group and then the less-hindered α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the C=N bond). The resulting dianion is unstable and collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and lithium p-toluenesulfinate. This process forms a vinyllithium intermediate, where the original ketone position is now part of a double bond. The aqueous ammonium chloride quench provides a proton to replace the lithium. The net result is the complete removal of the original ketone and its replacement with a C=C double bond.\n    *   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative, specifically a molecule like 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis**\n    *   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n    *   **Careful Points:** This is a powerful reduction step with two key consequences for Product 3:\n        1.  **Hydrogenation:** The hydrogen gas, activated by the palladium catalyst, adds across all carbon-carbon double bonds, reducing them to single bonds. This saturates both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain, converting them to a cyclohexane ring and an isopropyl group, respectively.\n        2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** Crucially, H₂/Pd-C is the standard reagent for cleaving benzyl ethers (a deprotection reaction called hydrogenolysis). The benzyl protecting group is removed from the ether, regenerating the original primary alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4:** The final molecule is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The relative 1,3-relationship of these groups is preserved.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe final product's structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**. Comparing this name with the provided options:\n\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This structure results if the benzyl ether protecting group is not removed in the final step.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This implies an erroneous reaction pathway where n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile.\n*   **C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** **Correct.** This name accurately describes the final product after hydrogenation of all alkenes and hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether.\n*   D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This is an intermediate structure that is eliminated in the Shapiro reaction.\n\nThe comprehensive analysis confirms that Product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the four-reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, Product 4.\n\n**Careful Points & Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Alcohol Protection (Williamson Ether Synthesis)**\n    *   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule has a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene. NaH is a strong base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton available. The alcohol's proton (pKa ≈ 17) is significantly more acidic than the ketone's α-protons (pKa ≈ 20). Thus, NaH selectively forms a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile and attacks benzyl bromide, forming a benzyl ether. This step protects the reactive alcohol group.\n    *   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Product 1.\n    *   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂), catalytic HCl.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a standard acid-catalyzed condensation reaction. The ketone functional group reacts with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone, eliminating a molecule of water. This is the first step in setting up the Shapiro reaction.\n    *   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1, where the C=O group has been replaced by a C=N-NHTs group.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Shapiro Reaction**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (the tosylhydrazone).\n    *   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a Shapiro reaction. A key point is that n-BuLi acts as a strong *base*, not a nucleophile, under these conditions. Two equivalents of n-BuLi deprotonate the tosylhydrazone, leading to the elimination of very stable nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group. This process forms a vinyllithium intermediate. The aqueous NH₄Cl then acts as a mild proton source to quench the reaction.\n    *   **Transformation:** The overall effect is the replacement of the original ketone with a carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative still containing the benzyl ether and the isopropenyl group, for example, 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis (Deprotection)**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Product 3.\n    *   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a powerful reduction step that performs two crucial transformations:\n        *   **Alkene Hydrogenation:** It saturates all carbon-carbon double bonds. The double bond in the ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain are both reduced to single bonds. This converts the ring to cyclohexane and the side chain to an isopropyl group.\n        *   **Benzyl Ether Hydrogenolysis:** A critical function of H₂/Pd-C is the cleavage of benzyl ethers. This deprotection step removes the benzyl group and regenerates the original alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4:** The final product is a fully saturated cyclohexane ring with two substituents: a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) and an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂]. Their original 1,3-relationship on the ring is maintained.\n\n**Final Structure and Matching to Options:**\n\nThe final product's structure corresponds to the name **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This would arise if n-BuLi acted as a nucleophile (wrong for Shapiro) and the benzyl group wasn't removed.\n*   B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: **Correct**. This name perfectly describes the final product derived from the complete and correct reaction sequence.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This is an intermediate that is consumed in Step 3.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if the hydrogenation occurred but the deprotection (hydrogenolysis) of the benzyl ether failed. H₂/Pd-C is a standard reagent for this cleavage.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the four-step reaction sequence to determine the final structure of Product 4.\n\n**Careful Points & Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Alcohol Protection (Williamson Ether Synthesis)**\n    *   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule has three reactive functional groups: a primary alcohol, a ketone, and an alkene. Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic site. The proton of the primary alcohol (-OH, pKa ≈ 17) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons next to the ketone (pKa ≈ 20). Therefore, NaH selectively forms a sodium alkoxide from the alcohol.\n    *   **Transformation:** This alkoxide is a potent nucleophile that attacks the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis. The purpose of this step is to \"protect\" the alcohol group so it doesn't interfere with later steps.\n    *   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The alcohol is now a benzyl ether.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Product 1 (a ketone).\n    *   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a standard acid-catalyzed condensation reaction. The ketone carbonyl group (C=O) reacts with the hydrazine to form a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs). This reaction is the first step in the Shapiro reaction sequence.\n    *   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Ketone Removal (Shapiro Reaction)**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (a tosylhydrazone).\n    *   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n    *   **Analysis:** These are the conditions for the Shapiro reaction. It is crucial to recognize that n-BuLi acts as a strong base here, not a nucleophile. Two equivalents of n-BuLi are used to deprotonate the tosylhydrazone twice (once on the nitrogen, once on the adjacent carbon). The resulting unstable dianion collapses, irreversibly eliminating a molecule of very stable nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosylate group. This forms a vinyllithium intermediate. The aqueous NH₄Cl then acts as a mild proton source to quench the reaction and protonate the vinyllithium.\n    *   **Transformation:** The net result is the complete replacement of the original ketone functional group with a carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative still containing the benzyl ether and the isopropenyl group, such as 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Product 3 (contains two alkenes and a benzyl ether).\n    *   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation step that performs two key transformations simultaneously.\n        *   **Alkene Hydrogenation:** All carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced (saturated) to single bonds. This converts the double bond in the ring to a C-C single bond (making the ring a cyclohexane) and reduces the isopropenyl side chain to an isopropyl group.\n        *   **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** A standard and important use of H₂/Pd-C is the cleavage of benzyl ethers. This is a common deprotection strategy. The benzyl protecting group is removed, regenerating the original primary alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4 (Final Product):** Combining these transformations, the final molecule is a fully saturated cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) and an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂]. The initial 1,3-relationship of these groups on the ring is preserved.\n\n**Conclusion and Final Answer Identification**\n\nThe final product's structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nNow, let's match this structure to the given options:\n\n*   **A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether protecting group was not removed in the final step. Hydrogenolysis is an expected reaction under H₂/Pd-C conditions.\n*   **B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** **Correct.** This name accurately describes the final product: a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.\n*   **C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** Incorrect. This structure results from an incorrect assumption that n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile in the Shapiro reaction.\n*   **D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** Incorrect. This is an intermediate structure that still contains the tosylhydrazone group, which is eliminated in Step 3.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the four-step reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, Product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Alcohol Protection (Williamson Ether Synthesis)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** The starting material has three functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene. Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base that deprotonates the most acidic proton. The hydroxyl proton of the alcohol (pKa ≈ 17) is significantly more acidic than the protons alpha to the ketone (pKa ≈ 20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbon of benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction. This is a Williamson ether synthesis that protects the alcohol as a benzyl ether.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, which contains a ketone group.\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard acid-catalyzed condensation reaction. The ketone carbonyl group (C=O) reacts with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs), with the elimination of a water molecule.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Shapiro Reaction (Deoxygenation)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, the tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the conditions for the Shapiro reaction. The strong base n-BuLi (used in excess, typically 2 equivalents) deprotonates the tosylhydrazone, leading to the elimination of the highly stable nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group. This process forms a vinyllithium intermediate. The reaction is quenched with aqueous ammonium chloride, which acts as a proton source to replace the lithium. The net result is the replacement of the original ketone functionality with a carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative with a benzyl ether protecting group and an isopropenyl side chain, for example, 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, which contains two C=C double bonds and a benzyl ether.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Analysis:** This powerful reduction step performs two key transformations:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation:** The hydrogen gas, in the presence of the Pd catalyst, reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds. This saturates the double bond in the cyclohexene ring (forming a cyclohexane ring) and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain (forming an isopropyl group).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** This is the standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers. The benzyl protecting group is removed, regenerating the original alcohol functional group.\n*   **Product 4 (Final Product):** Combining these transformations, the final molecule is a saturated cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. Their original 1,3-relationship is maintained. The correct IUPAC name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the final product is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol. Now, let's match this correct structure to the given options:\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This structure is incorrect because it is the product of hydrogenation but not hydrogenolysis; the benzyl ether protecting group remains.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This structure is incorrect as it results from a misunderstanding of the Shapiro reaction, where n-BuLi is presumed to act as a nucleophile.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This structure is incorrect as it is an intermediate that is consumed in Step 3.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This is the correct name for the final product derived from the complete four-step synthesis.\n\nThe consensus from the reasoning of all provided answers points to the same chemical structure. The variance in their final letter choices is due to the options being shuffled for each agent. Based on the options provided in the question prompt, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Alcohol Protection (Williamson Ether Synthesis)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains three functional groups that can potentially react: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It deprotonates the most acidic proton available. The hydroxyl proton of the alcohol (pKa ≈ 17) is significantly more acidic than the protons alpha to the ketone (pKa ≈ 20). Therefore, NaH will selectively deprotonate the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis and serves to \"protect\" the alcohol group from the reagents in subsequent steps.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction where a ketone reacts with a hydrazine derivative. The acid catalyst facilitates the reaction between the ketone's carbonyl group and the tosylhydrazide, eliminating a molecule of water.\n*   **Transformation:** The ketone group (C=O) is converted to a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs). This sets the stage for the next elimination reaction.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Deoxygenation of Ketone (Shapiro Reaction)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the conditions for the Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of the strong base n-BuLi. This causes a double deprotonation, which leads to the collapse of the intermediate, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂, a very stable molecule, providing a strong thermodynamic driving force) and the tosyl group. The result is a vinyllithium intermediate. The aqueous ammonium chloride quench then protonates this intermediate.\n*   **Transformation:** The net result of the Shapiro reaction is the replacement of the original ketone with a carbon-carbon double bond, effectively deoxygenating the ring at that position.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative, such as 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis (Deprotection)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation step that will perform two crucial transformations on Product 3.\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** Hydrogen gas, in the presence of the palladium catalyst, will reduce all carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds. This means the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain are both saturated. This converts the ring to a cyclohexane ring and the side chain to an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** Critically, H₂/Pd-C is a standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers. This reaction, known as hydrogenolysis, removes the benzyl protecting group, regenerating the original alcohol.\n*   **Final Product (Product 4):** Applying these transformations, the final molecule is a fully saturated cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. Their 1,3-relationship is preserved throughout the synthesis. The correct name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This structure still contains the tosylhydrazone group, which is eliminated in Step 3.\n*   B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: **Correct**. This name perfectly describes the final product: a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.\n*   C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure would result from an incorrect reaction pathway where n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile, which is not what happens in a Shapiro reaction. It also fails to account for the deprotection in Step 4.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if the alkenes were hydrogenated but the benzyl ether was not cleaved. Standard H₂/Pd-C conditions cause this cleavage, so this is only an intermediate and not the final product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the four-step organic synthesis to determine the structure of the final product, Product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Alcohol Protection (Williamson Ether Synthesis)**\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), a ketone (C=O), and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** Sodium hydride is a strong base that selectively deprotonates the most acidic proton. The hydroxyl proton of the alcohol (pKa ≈ 17) is significantly more acidic than the protons alpha to the ketone (pKa ≈ 20). The resulting alkoxide ion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbon of benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis used to protect the alcohol functional group.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The alcohol group is now protected as a benzyl ether.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction. The ketone functional group in Product 1 reacts with the tosylhydrazide under acid catalysis to form a tosylhydrazone, eliminating a molecule of water. This is the required substrate for the next step.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group (C=O) is converted to a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs).\n\n**Step 3: Ketone Elimination (Shapiro Reaction)**\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the conditions for the Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone (Product 2) is treated with two equivalents of the strong base n-BuLi. This causes a sequence of deprotonations leading to the elimination of stable nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group. The overall effect is to replace the original ketone with a carbon-carbon double bond, forming a vinyllithium intermediate which is then protonated by the ammonium chloride workup.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative, such as 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Analysis:** This powerful reduction step performs two key transformations on Product 3:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation:** All carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced (saturated) to single bonds. This means the double bond in the cyclohexene ring is eliminated to form a cyclohexane ring, and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain is reduced to form an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** These conditions are standard for cleaving benzyl ether protecting groups. The C-O bond of the benzyl ether is broken, regenerating the original primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4 (Final Product):** Combining these transformations, the final molecule is a saturated cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The original 1,3-relationship of these groups on the ring is maintained. The name of this molecule is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe final product of the complete reaction sequence is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**. Now we match this name with the provided options:\n\n*   **A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** Incorrect. This structure retains the benzyl ether protecting group. The H₂/Pd-C conditions would have cleaved it.\n*   **B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** Correct. This name accurately describes the final product derived from the full reaction sequence.\n*   **C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** Incorrect. This is an intermediate structure that has not undergone the Shapiro reaction (Step 3) or final reduction (Step 4).\n*   **D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** Incorrect. This structure arises from an incorrect assumption that n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile in Step 3 and a failure to account for the deprotection in Step 4.\n\nThe correct structure for Product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the four-reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, Product 4.\n\n**1. Starting Material:**\nThe initial compound is **3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**. This molecule contains three important functional groups on a cyclohexane ring:\n*   A **ketone** (C=O) at position 1.\n*   A **primary alcohol** in a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) at position 3.\n*   An **alkene** in an isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) at position 5.\n\n**2. Step 1: Reaction with NaH, then Benzyl Bromide (BnBr)**\n*   **Purpose:** Alcohol Protection.\n*   **Analysis:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The proton on the hydroxyl group (-OH) of the alcohol (pKa ≈ 17) is much more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 20). Therefore, NaH selectively forms a sodium alkoxide.\n*   This alkoxide is a nucleophile and subsequently reacts with benzyl bromide (BnBr) in a Williamson ether synthesis (Sₙ2 reaction) to form a benzyl ether. This step protects the alcohol from reacting in the following steps.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**3. Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and cat. HCl**\n*   **Purpose:** Formation of a Tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction where a ketone is converted into its tosylhydrazone. The ketone group of Product 1 reacts with the hydrazide, eliminating a water molecule. This is the first part of the Shapiro reaction.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1, where the C=O group at C1 is now a C=N-NHTs group.\n\n**4. Step 3: Reaction with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), then aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)**\n*   **Purpose:** Deoxygenation of the ketone via the Shapiro Reaction.\n*   **Analysis:** This two-step procedure is a Shapiro reaction. Two equivalents of the strong base n-BuLi are used to deprotonate the tosylhydrazone, leading to the elimination of stable nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group. This process forms a vinyllithium intermediate where the original ketone was. The aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) is a mild proton source that quenches the reaction, protonating the vinyllithium.\n*   **Net Result:** The original ketone functional group is completely replaced by a carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative with the benzyl ether and isopropenyl group intact, for example, 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**5. Step 4: Reaction with Pd/C under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere**\n*   **Purpose:** Hydrogenation of alkenes and Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether.\n*   **Analysis:** Catalytic hydrogenation using Pd/C and H₂ is a powerful reduction method that affects multiple functional groups in Product 3.\n    *   **Hydrogenation:** Both C=C double bonds (the one in the ring formed in Step 3 and the one in the isopropenyl side chain) are reduced (saturated) to C-C single bonds. This converts the ring to **cyclohexane** and the side chain to an **isopropyl group**.\n    *   **Hydrogenolysis:** This is the standard method for cleaving a benzyl ether protecting group. The C-O bond of the benzyl ether is broken, regenerating the original primary alcohol.\n*   **Product 4 (Final Product):** Combining these transformations yields a saturated cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group, which maintain their 1,3-relationship from the start.\n\n**Final Product Structure and Name:** The final product is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Matching to Options:**\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. Assumes incorrect reaction of n-BuLi and failure to cleave the ether.\n*   **B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** **Correct.** This name accurately describes the final product derived from the complete sequence.\n*   C) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This is the product if the benzyl ether is not cleaved, which is highly unlikely with H₂/Pd-C.\n*   D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This is an intermediate structure.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Reaction with NaH and Benzyl Bromide**\n    *   **Functional Groups in Starting Material:** The initial molecule, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, contains three distinct functional groups: a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), a ketone (C=O), and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n    *   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. Benzyl bromide (BnBr) is an electrophilic alkylating agent.\n    *   **Reaction Pathway:** The most acidic proton in the molecule is on the alcohol's hydroxyl group (pKa ≈ 17), which is more acidic than the protons alpha to the ketone (pKa ≈ 20). Therefore, NaH selectively deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. This reaction serves to \"protect\" the alcohol group from reacting in subsequent steps.\n    *   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide**\n    *   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic acid (HCl).\n    *   **Reaction Pathway:** This is a classic condensation reaction between a ketone and a hydrazine derivative. Under acidic catalysis, the ketone group reacts to form a tosylhydrazone, eliminating a molecule of water.\n    *   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1, where the C=O group is converted to a C=N-NHTs group.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Reaction with n-BuLi**\n    *   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), a very strong base, followed by an aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) quench.\n    *   **Reaction Pathway:** These are the conditions for the **Shapiro reaction**. It is crucial to recognize that n-BuLi acts as a *base*, not a nucleophile, in this context. It deprotonates the tosylhydrazone twice, leading to an intermediate that collapses by eliminating stable nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosylate group. This forms a vinyllithium intermediate. The aqueous quench provides a proton to this intermediate. The net result is the complete removal of the original ketone functionality and its replacement with a carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative containing the benzyl ether protecting group and the isopropenyl side chain. A possible structure is 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Reaction with Pd/C and H₂**\n    *   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n    *   **Reaction Pathway:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation step that performs two key transformations on Product 3. It's a common error to miss one of these.\n        1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** All carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced (saturated) to single bonds. This converts the cyclohexene ring into a cyclohexane ring and the isopropenyl side chain into an isopropyl group.\n        2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** A standard and important function of H₂/Pd-C is the cleavage of benzyl ethers. This is a deprotection step that removes the benzyl group and regenerates the original alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4:** Combining these effects, the final product is a fully saturated cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) and an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂]. The original 1,3-relationship of these substituents is maintained.\n\n**Final Structure and Matching with Options**\n\nThe final product's chemical name is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**. Let's evaluate the given options against this structure:\n\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This structure retains the tosylhydrazone group, which is eliminated in Step 3.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure results from erroneously treating the Shapiro reaction (Step 3) as a nucleophilic addition of a butyl group. It also fails to account for the deprotection in Step 4.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: **Correct.** This name and the corresponding structure perfectly match the result of the full four-step synthesis.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if only the alkenes were hydrogenated, but the benzyl ether protecting group was not removed. Hydrogenolysis is an expected reaction under these standard conditions.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the four-reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, Product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Alcohol Protection (Williamson Ether Synthesis)**\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains three distinct functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It selectively deprotonates the most acidic proton in the molecule. The proton of the hydroxyl group (-OH, pKa ≈ 17) is significantly more acidic than the protons alpha to the ketone (α-protons, pKa ≈ 20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide is nucleophilic and reacts with the electrophile, benzyl bromide, in an Sₙ2 reaction. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis used here to protect the alcohol.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) is converted to a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn). The structure is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, which contains a ketone.\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction. The ketone's carbonyl group reacts with the primary amine of the tosylhydrazide under acid catalysis to form a tosylhydrazone, eliminating a molecule of water.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group (C=O) at the C1 position is converted into a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NHTs).\n\n**Step 3: Deoxygenation (Shapiro Reaction)**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the hallmark conditions for the Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of the strong base n-BuLi. This causes a series of deprotonations and subsequent elimination of stable nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosylate group, forming a vinyllithium intermediate. The reaction is quenched with the mild proton source, aqueous ammonium chloride, which protonates the vinyllithium to form a stable alkene.\n*   **Transformation:** The net result is the complete removal of the original ketone functionality, replacing it with a carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative still containing the benzyl ether and the isopropenyl group. An example regioisomer would be 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Deprotection (Hydrogenolysis)**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, a molecule containing two alkene groups and a benzyl ether.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Analysis:** This powerful catalytic hydrogenation setup performs two crucial transformations simultaneously:\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** Hydrogen gas adds across all carbon-carbon double bonds, reducing them to single bonds. This saturates both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring (forming a cyclohexane ring) and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain (forming an isopropyl group).\n    2.  **Benzyl Ether Hydrogenolysis:** These are the standard conditions for cleaving a benzyl ether protecting group. The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen is cleaved by hydrogen, regenerating the original alcohol functional group.\n*   **Product 4 (Final Product):** Applying both transformations to Product 3 results in a fully saturated cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The 1,3-relationship of these groups on the ring is preserved throughout the synthesis.\n\n**Conclusion and Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe final product's chemical structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**. Now we match this with the given options:\n\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This is an intermediate structure. The tosylhydrazone group is eliminated in Step 3.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This would be the product if the alkenes were hydrogenated but the benzyl ether was not cleaved. Standard H₂/Pd-C conditions would cause this cleavage.\n*   C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This structure results from an incorrect assumption that n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile in Step 3.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This name and structure perfectly match the final product derived from the complete and correct reaction sequence.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n**Step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Starting Material + Sodium Hydride (NaH) and Benzyl Bromide (BnBr) → Product 1**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a **Williamson ether synthesis** used to protect the alcohol group.\n    *   **Analysis:** The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, contains three functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene.

The alcohol group is now protected as a benzyl ether (-OBn).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 + p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl → Product 2**\n    *   **Reaction:** Formation of a **tosylhydrazone**.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction. The ketone group of Product 1 reacts with the tosylhydrazide under acidic conditions to form a tosylhydrazone, eliminating one molecule of water.\n    *   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1, where the ketone (C=O) at position 1 is replaced by a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NHTs).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 + n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) and aqueous NH₄Cl → Product 3**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is the **Shapiro reaction**.\n    *   **Analysis:** The tosylhydrazone (Product 2) is treated with a strong base (n-BuLi), which typically deprotonates it twice. The resulting unstable dianion collapses, eliminating a stable molecule of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) is a mild proton source used to quench the reaction and protonate the vinyllithium.\n    *   **Net Transformation:** The Shapiro reaction effectively replaces the original ketone functional group with a carbon-carbon double bond, resulting in deoxygenation.\n    *   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative containing the benzyl ether and the isopropenyl group, for example, 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 + Pd/C and Hydrogen (H₂) → Product 4**\n    *   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a powerful and general reduction method that affects two different functional groups in Product 3.\n        1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** Hydrogen gas adds across all carbon-carbon double bonds, saturating them to single bonds.

It will react with the most acidic proton in the molecule. The proton of the hydroxyl group (-OH, pKa ≈ 17) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH₂O⁻Na⁺). This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic benzyl bromide, forming a benzyl ether.

It selectively deprotonates the most acidic proton available. The proton of the hydroxyl group (-OH, pKa ≈ 17) is significantly more acidic than the protons alpha to the ketone (pKa ≈ 20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   **Transformation:** The hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) is converted into a benzyl ether (-CH₂OBn), protecting the alcohol from subsequent reaction conditions.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, which contains a ketone group.\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction. Under acidic catalysis, the ketone's carbonyl group reacts with the primary amine of the tosylhydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone, eliminating one molecule of water.\n*   **Transformation:** The ketone group (C=O) is converted to a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs).\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Deoxygenation (Shapiro Reaction)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, the tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** These conditions are characteristic of the Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with at least two equivalents of the strong base n-BuLi. This leads to a series of deprotonations and eliminations, resulting in the expulsion of stable nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The reaction is then quenched with a mild proton source (aqueous NH₄Cl).\n*   **Transformation:** The net result is the replacement of the original ketone functional group with a carbon-carbon double bond. The ketone is effectively removed from the ring.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative containing the benzyl ether protecting group and the isopropenyl side chain (e.g., 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene).\n\n**Step 4: Hydrogenation and Deprotection (Hydrogenolysis)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, which contains two different C=C double bonds and a benzyl ether.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation step that performs two critical transformations:\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** The hydrogen gas, catalyzed by Pd/C, reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds. This saturates the double bond in the cyclohexene ring (forming a cyclohexane ring) and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain (forming an isopropyl group).\n    2.  **Benzyl Ether Hydrogenolysis:** These are the standard conditions for cleaving benzyl ethers (deprotection). The C-O bond of the benzyl ether is broken, regenerating the original alcohol (-CH₂OH) and producing toluene as a byproduct.\n*   **Transformation:** Both alkenes are saturated, and the alcohol is deprotected.\n*   **Product 4:** The final molecule consists of a saturated cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The 1,3-relationship of these substituents on the ring is maintained throughout the synthesis. The correct IUPAC name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion and Evaluation of Options**\n\nThe step-by-step analysis consistently leads to the final structure of **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**. Now we match this with the provided options:\n\n*   **A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** Incorrect. This is an intermediate structure before the Shapiro reaction (Step 3) is complete.\n*   **B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** Incorrect. This structure implies an incorrect reaction pathway where n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile, which does not happen in a Shapiro reaction.\n*   **C) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved (de-protected) in the final step. Hydrogenolysis is an expected and standard outcome under these conditions.\n*   **D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** **Correct**. This name perfectly describes the final product derived from the complete reaction sequence.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the four-step organic synthesis to determine the structure of Product 4. The analysis integrates the consistent reasoning provided across all candidate answers.\n\n### Analysis of the Reaction Sequence\n\n**Step 1: Alcohol Protection (Williamson Ether Synthesis)**\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule has three distinct functional groups: a ketone (C=O), a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction:** NaH is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic functional group. The alcohol's proton (pKa ≈ 17) is significantly more acidic than the ketone's α-protons (pKa ≈ 20). NaH selectively deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   **Outcome:** The alcohol is \"protected\" by converting it into a benzyl ether. The ketone and alkene groups remain unchanged.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard acid-catalyzed condensation reaction. The ketone functional group of Product 1 reacts with the tosylhydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone, eliminating one molecule of water.\n*   **Outcome:** The ketone's C=O group is converted to a C=N-NHTs group. This is the first step of the Shapiro reaction sequence.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Deoxygenation (Shapiro Reaction)**\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Reaction:** These are the conditions for a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone (Product 2) is treated with two equivalents of the strong base n-BuLi. This causes a sequence of deprotonations leading to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosylate group, forming a vinyllithium intermediate. The reaction is then quenched with a mild proton source (aq. NH₄Cl) to protonate the intermediate.\n*   **Outcome:** The net result is the replacement of the original ketone functional group with a carbon-carbon double bond. The ketone is effectively removed from the ring.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative containing the benzyl ether protecting group and the isopropenyl side chain (e.g., 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene).\n\n**Step 4: Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation step that performs two critical transformations on Product 3:\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** All carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced (saturated) to single bonds. This converts the double bond in the cyclohexene ring to a single bond (forming a cyclohexane ring) and reduces the isopropenyl side chain to an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** A standard and important function of H₂/Pd-C is the cleavage of benzyl ethers. The benzyl protecting group is removed, regenerating the original alcohol functional group.\n*   **Outcome:** The molecule becomes fully saturated, and the alcohol is deprotected. The final molecule is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group, retaining their original 1,3-relationship.\n*   **Product 4:** The name of this final structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe final product of the complete reaction sequence is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**. Now we match this structure to the given options:\n\n*   **A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** This name correctly describes the final product derived from the complete and correct reaction pathway.\n*   **B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** This would be the product if the final deprotection step (hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether) did not occur. It is an incomplete transformation under these standard conditions.\n*   **C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This structure results from multiple incorrect assumptions about the reaction pathway, such as n-BuLi acting as a nucleophile.\n*   **D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** This is an intermediate structure that has not undergone the Shapiro elimination.\n\nBased on the consistent chemical reasoning across all provided analyses and a correct application of reaction principles, the final product is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, Product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Alcohol Protection (Williamson Ether Synthesis)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains three distinct functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The proton on the hydroxyl group of the alcohol (pKa ≈ 17) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons adjacent to the ketone (pKa ≈ 20). Therefore, NaH selectively deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbon of benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   **Transformation:** The hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) is converted into a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn). This serves to \"protect\" the alcohol from reacting in the subsequent steps.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, which contains a ketone.\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction. The ketone carbonyl group reacts with the tosylhydrazide under acidic catalysis, leading to the formation of a tosylhydrazone and the elimination of one molecule of water.\n*   **Transformation:** The ketone group (C=O) is converted to a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NHTs).\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Shapiro Reaction (Deoxygenation/Elimination)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, the tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the classic conditions for the Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of the strong base n-BuLi. The first equivalent deprotonates the -NHTs group, and the second deprotonates the less hindered α-carbon. The resulting dianion spontaneously eliminates a molecule of highly stable nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosylate group, forming a vinyllithium intermediate. The reaction is then \"quenched\" with a mild proton source (aqueous NH₄Cl), which protonates the vinyllithium.\n*   **Transformation:** The net result of the Shapiro reaction is the complete replacement of the original ketone functional group with a carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative containing the isopropenyl side chain and the benzyl ether protecting group, for example, 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis (Deprotection)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, a molecule containing two alkene groups and a benzyl ether.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation step that induces two critical transformations simultaneously.\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** The hydrogen gas, catalyzed by Pd/C, reduces (saturates) all carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds. This converts the double bond in the cyclohexene ring to form a cyclohexane ring and reduces the isopropenyl side chain to an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Benzyl Ether Hydrogenolysis:** Pd/C with H₂ is a standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers, a common deprotection strategy. The C-O bond of the benzyl ether is broken, regenerating the original alcohol (-CH₂OH) and producing toluene as a byproduct.\n*   **Transformation:** The entire molecule is made saturated, and the alcohol is deprotected.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group, with their original 1,3-relationship on the ring preserved.\n\n**Final Conclusion and Evaluation of Options**\n\nThe final product is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**. Now, we must match this structure with the given choices:\n\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure implies n-BuLi acted as a nucleophile (wrong for Shapiro) and that the final deprotection did not occur.\n*   B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This is an intermediate structure that retains the tosylhydrazone group, which is eliminated in Step 3.\n*   **C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** **Correct.** This name perfectly describes the final product derived from the complete, four-step reaction sequence, including both alkene reduction and benzyl ether cleavage.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if the final hydrogenolysis step (cleavage of the benzyl ether) did not occur. H₂/Pd-C is a standard and effective reagent for this transformation.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

This molecule contains three distinct functional groups: a ketone (C=O), a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n    *   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n    *   **Careful Points:** NaH is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will react with the most acidic proton in the molecule. The pKa of a primary alcohol (~17) is lower (more acidic) than that of the protons alpha to the ketone (~20). Therefore, NaH will selectively deprotonate the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide is a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon of benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction. This is a classic protection strategy for alcohols, converting the hydroxymethyl group into a benzyl ether.\n    *   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n    *   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic acid (HCl).\n    *   **Careful Points:** This is a standard condensation reaction where a ketone or aldehyde reacts with a hydrazine derivative. The ketone at C-1 of Product 1 reacts with the tosylhydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs), with the elimination of a water molecule. This step prepares the molecule for the Shapiro reaction.\n    *   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Deoxygenation (Shapiro Reaction)**\n    *   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n    *   **Careful Points:** These are the conditions for a Shapiro reaction. n-BuLi is a very strong base. Two equivalents are used to first deprotonate the -NHTs group and then the less-hindered α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the C=N bond). The resulting dianion is unstable and collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and lithium p-toluenesulfinate. This process forms a vinyllithium intermediate, where the original ketone position is now part of a double bond. The aqueous ammonium chloride quench provides a proton to replace the lithium. The net result is the complete removal of the original ketone and its replacement with a C=C double bond.\n    *   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative, specifically a molecule like 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis**\n    *   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n    *   **Careful Points:** This is a powerful reduction step with two key consequences for Product 3:\n        1.  **Hydrogenation:** The hydrogen gas, activated by the palladium catalyst, adds across all carbon-carbon double bonds, reducing them to single bonds. This saturates both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain, converting them to a cyclohexane ring and an isopropyl group, respectively.\n        2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** Crucially, H₂/Pd-C is the standard reagent for cleaving benzyl ethers (a deprotection reaction called hydrogenolysis). The benzyl protecting group is removed from the ether, regenerating the original primary alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4:** The final molecule is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The relative 1,3-relationship of these groups is preserved.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe final product's structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**. Comparing this name with the provided options:\n\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This structure results if the benzyl ether protecting group is not removed in the final step.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This implies an erroneous reaction pathway where n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile.\n*   **C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** **Correct.** This name accurately describes the final product after hydrogenation of all alkenes and hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether.\n*   D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This is an intermediate structure that is eliminated in the Shapiro reaction.\n\nThe comprehensive analysis confirms that Product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the four-reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, Product 4.\n\n**Careful Points & Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Alcohol Protection (Williamson Ether Synthesis)**\n    *   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule has a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene. NaH is a strong base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton available. The alcohol's proton (pKa ≈ 17) is significantly more acidic than the ketone's α-protons (pKa ≈ 20). Thus, NaH selectively forms a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile and attacks benzyl bromide, forming a benzyl ether. This step protects the reactive alcohol group.\n    *   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Product 1.\n    *   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂), catalytic HCl.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a standard acid-catalyzed condensation reaction. The ketone functional group reacts with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone, eliminating a molecule of water. This is the first step in setting up the Shapiro reaction.\n    *   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1, where the C=O group has been replaced by a C=N-NHTs group.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Shapiro Reaction**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (the tosylhydrazone).\n    *   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a Shapiro reaction. A key point is that n-BuLi acts as a strong *base*, not a nucleophile, under these conditions. Two equivalents of n-BuLi deprotonate the tosylhydrazone, leading to the elimination of very stable nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group. This process forms a vinyllithium intermediate. The aqueous NH₄Cl then acts as a mild proton source to quench the reaction.\n    *   **Transformation:** The overall effect is the replacement of the original ketone with a carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative still containing the benzyl ether and the isopropenyl group, for example, 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis (Deprotection)**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Product 3.\n    *   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a powerful reduction step that performs two crucial transformations:\n        *   **Alkene Hydrogenation:** It saturates all carbon-carbon double bonds. The double bond in the ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain are both reduced to single bonds. This converts the ring to cyclohexane and the side chain to an isopropyl group.\n        *   **Benzyl Ether Hydrogenolysis:** A critical function of H₂/Pd-C is the cleavage of benzyl ethers. This deprotection step removes the benzyl group and regenerates the original alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4:** The final product is a fully saturated cyclohexane ring with two substituents: a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) and an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂]. Their original 1,3-relationship on the ring is maintained.\n\n**Final Structure and Matching to Options:**\n\nThe final product's structure corresponds to the name **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This would arise if n-BuLi acted as a nucleophile (wrong for Shapiro) and the benzyl group wasn't removed.\n*   B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: **Correct**. This name perfectly describes the final product derived from the complete and correct reaction sequence.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This is an intermediate that is consumed in Step 3.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if the hydrogenation occurred but the deprotection (hydrogenolysis) of the benzyl ether failed. H₂/Pd-C is a standard reagent for this cleavage.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the four-step reaction sequence to determine the final structure of Product 4.\n\n**Careful Points & Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Alcohol Protection (Williamson Ether Synthesis)**\n    *   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule has three reactive functional groups: a primary alcohol, a ketone, and an alkene. Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic site. The proton of the primary alcohol (-OH, pKa ≈ 17) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons next to the ketone (pKa ≈ 20). Therefore, NaH selectively forms a sodium alkoxide from the alcohol.\n    *   **Transformation:** This alkoxide is a potent nucleophile that attacks the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis. The purpose of this step is to \"protect\" the alcohol group so it doesn't interfere with later steps.\n    *   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The alcohol is now a benzyl ether.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Product 1 (a ketone).\n    *   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a standard acid-catalyzed condensation reaction. The ketone carbonyl group (C=O) reacts with the hydrazine to form a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs). This reaction is the first step in the Shapiro reaction sequence.\n    *   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Ketone Removal (Shapiro Reaction)**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (a tosylhydrazone).\n    *   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n    *   **Analysis:** These are the conditions for the Shapiro reaction. It is crucial to recognize that n-BuLi acts as a strong base here, not a nucleophile. Two equivalents of n-BuLi are used to deprotonate the tosylhydrazone twice (once on the nitrogen, once on the adjacent carbon). The resulting unstable dianion collapses, irreversibly eliminating a molecule of very stable nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosylate group. This forms a vinyllithium intermediate. The aqueous NH₄Cl then acts as a mild proton source to quench the reaction and protonate the vinyllithium.\n    *   **Transformation:** The net result is the complete replacement of the original ketone functional group with a carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative still containing the benzyl ether and the isopropenyl group, such as 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Product 3 (contains two alkenes and a benzyl ether).\n    *   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation step that performs two key transformations simultaneously.\n        *   **Alkene Hydrogenation:** All carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced (saturated) to single bonds. This converts the double bond in the ring to a C-C single bond (making the ring a cyclohexane) and reduces the isopropenyl side chain to an isopropyl group.\n        *   **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** A standard and important use of H₂/Pd-C is the cleavage of benzyl ethers. This is a common deprotection strategy. The benzyl protecting group is removed, regenerating the original primary alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4 (Final Product):** Combining these transformations, the final molecule is a fully saturated cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) and an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂]. The initial 1,3-relationship of these groups on the ring is preserved.\n\n**Conclusion and Final Answer Identification**\n\nThe final product's structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nNow, let's match this structure to the given options:\n\n*   **A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether protecting group was not removed in the final step. Hydrogenolysis is an expected reaction under H₂/Pd-C conditions.\n*   **B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** **Correct.** This name accurately describes the final product: a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.\n*   **C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** Incorrect. This structure results from an incorrect assumption that n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile in the Shapiro reaction.\n*   **D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** Incorrect. This is an intermediate structure that still contains the tosylhydrazone group, which is eliminated in Step 3.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the four-step reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, Product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Alcohol Protection (Williamson Ether Synthesis)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** The starting material has three functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene. Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base that deprotonates the most acidic proton. The hydroxyl proton of the alcohol (pKa ≈ 17) is significantly more acidic than the protons alpha to the ketone (pKa ≈ 20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbon of benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction. This is a Williamson ether synthesis that protects the alcohol as a benzyl ether.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, which contains a ketone group.\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard acid-catalyzed condensation reaction. The ketone carbonyl group (C=O) reacts with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs), with the elimination of a water molecule.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Shapiro Reaction (Deoxygenation)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, the tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the conditions for the Shapiro reaction. The strong base n-BuLi (used in excess, typically 2 equivalents) deprotonates the tosylhydrazone, leading to the elimination of the highly stable nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group. This process forms a vinyllithium intermediate. The reaction is quenched with aqueous ammonium chloride, which acts as a proton source to replace the lithium. The net result is the replacement of the original ketone functionality with a carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative with a benzyl ether protecting group and an isopropenyl side chain, for example, 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, which contains two C=C double bonds and a benzyl ether.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Analysis:** This powerful reduction step performs two key transformations:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation:** The hydrogen gas, in the presence of the Pd catalyst, reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds. This saturates the double bond in the cyclohexene ring (forming a cyclohexane ring) and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain (forming an isopropyl group).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** This is the standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers. The benzyl protecting group is removed, regenerating the original alcohol functional group.\n*   **Product 4 (Final Product):** Combining these transformations, the final molecule is a saturated cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. Their original 1,3-relationship is maintained. The correct IUPAC name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the final product is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol. Now, let's match this correct structure to the given options:\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This structure is incorrect because it is the product of hydrogenation but not hydrogenolysis; the benzyl ether protecting group remains.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This structure is incorrect as it results from a misunderstanding of the Shapiro reaction, where n-BuLi is presumed to act as a nucleophile.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This structure is incorrect as it is an intermediate that is consumed in Step 3.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This is the correct name for the final product derived from the complete four-step synthesis.\n\nThe consensus from the reasoning of all provided answers points to the same chemical structure. The variance in their final letter choices is due to the options being shuffled for each agent. Based on the options provided in the question prompt, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Alcohol Protection (Williamson Ether Synthesis)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains three functional groups that can potentially react: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It deprotonates the most acidic proton available. The hydroxyl proton of the alcohol (pKa ≈ 17) is significantly more acidic than the protons alpha to the ketone (pKa ≈ 20). Therefore, NaH will selectively deprotonate the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis and serves to \"protect\" the alcohol group from the reagents in subsequent steps.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction where a ketone reacts with a hydrazine derivative. The acid catalyst facilitates the reaction between the ketone's carbonyl group and the tosylhydrazide, eliminating a molecule of water.\n*   **Transformation:** The ketone group (C=O) is converted to a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs). This sets the stage for the next elimination reaction.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Deoxygenation of Ketone (Shapiro Reaction)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the conditions for the Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of the strong base n-BuLi. This causes a double deprotonation, which leads to the collapse of the intermediate, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂, a very stable molecule, providing a strong thermodynamic driving force) and the tosyl group. The result is a vinyllithium intermediate. The aqueous ammonium chloride quench then protonates this intermediate.\n*   **Transformation:** The net result of the Shapiro reaction is the replacement of the original ketone with a carbon-carbon double bond, effectively deoxygenating the ring at that position.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative, such as 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis (Deprotection)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation step that will perform two crucial transformations on Product 3.\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** Hydrogen gas, in the presence of the palladium catalyst, will reduce all carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds. This means the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain are both saturated. This converts the ring to a cyclohexane ring and the side chain to an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** Critically, H₂/Pd-C is a standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers. This reaction, known as hydrogenolysis, removes the benzyl protecting group, regenerating the original alcohol.\n*   **Final Product (Product 4):** Applying these transformations, the final molecule is a fully saturated cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. Their 1,3-relationship is preserved throughout the synthesis. The correct name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This structure still contains the tosylhydrazone group, which is eliminated in Step 3.\n*   B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: **Correct**. This name perfectly describes the final product: a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.\n*   C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure would result from an incorrect reaction pathway where n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile, which is not what happens in a Shapiro reaction. It also fails to account for the deprotection in Step 4.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if the alkenes were hydrogenated but the benzyl ether was not cleaved. Standard H₂/Pd-C conditions cause this cleavage, so this is only an intermediate and not the final product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the four-step organic synthesis to determine the structure of the final product, Product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Alcohol Protection (Williamson Ether Synthesis)**\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), a ketone (C=O), and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** Sodium hydride is a strong base that selectively deprotonates the most acidic proton. The hydroxyl proton of the alcohol (pKa ≈ 17) is significantly more acidic than the protons alpha to the ketone (pKa ≈ 20). The resulting alkoxide ion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbon of benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis used to protect the alcohol functional group.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The alcohol group is now protected as a benzyl ether.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction. The ketone functional group in Product 1 reacts with the tosylhydrazide under acid catalysis to form a tosylhydrazone, eliminating a molecule of water. This is the required substrate for the next step.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group (C=O) is converted to a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs).\n\n**Step 3: Ketone Elimination (Shapiro Reaction)**\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the conditions for the Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone (Product 2) is treated with two equivalents of the strong base n-BuLi. This causes a sequence of deprotonations leading to the elimination of stable nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group. The overall effect is to replace the original ketone with a carbon-carbon double bond, forming a vinyllithium intermediate which is then protonated by the ammonium chloride workup.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative, such as 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Analysis:** This powerful reduction step performs two key transformations on Product 3:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation:** All carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced (saturated) to single bonds. This means the double bond in the cyclohexene ring is eliminated to form a cyclohexane ring, and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain is reduced to form an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** These conditions are standard for cleaving benzyl ether protecting groups. The C-O bond of the benzyl ether is broken, regenerating the original primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4 (Final Product):** Combining these transformations, the final molecule is a saturated cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The original 1,3-relationship of these groups on the ring is maintained. The name of this molecule is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe final product of the complete reaction sequence is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**. Now we match this name with the provided options:\n\n*   **A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** Incorrect. This structure retains the benzyl ether protecting group. The H₂/Pd-C conditions would have cleaved it.\n*   **B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** Correct. This name accurately describes the final product derived from the full reaction sequence.\n*   **C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** Incorrect. This is an intermediate structure that has not undergone the Shapiro reaction (Step 3) or final reduction (Step 4).\n*   **D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** Incorrect. This structure arises from an incorrect assumption that n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile in Step 3 and a failure to account for the deprotection in Step 4.\n\nThe correct structure for Product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the four-reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, Product 4.\n\n**1. Starting Material:**\nThe initial compound is **3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**. This molecule contains three important functional groups on a cyclohexane ring:\n*   A **ketone** (C=O) at position 1.\n*   A **primary alcohol** in a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) at position 3.\n*   An **alkene** in an isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) at position 5.\n\n**2. Step 1: Reaction with NaH, then Benzyl Bromide (BnBr)**\n*   **Purpose:** Alcohol Protection.\n*   **Analysis:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The proton on the hydroxyl group (-OH) of the alcohol (pKa ≈ 17) is much more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 20). Therefore, NaH selectively forms a sodium alkoxide.\n*   This alkoxide is a nucleophile and subsequently reacts with benzyl bromide (BnBr) in a Williamson ether synthesis (Sₙ2 reaction) to form a benzyl ether. This step protects the alcohol from reacting in the following steps.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**3. Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and cat. HCl**\n*   **Purpose:** Formation of a Tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction where a ketone is converted into its tosylhydrazone. The ketone group of Product 1 reacts with the hydrazide, eliminating a water molecule. This is the first part of the Shapiro reaction.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1, where the C=O group at C1 is now a C=N-NHTs group.\n\n**4. Step 3: Reaction with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), then aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)**\n*   **Purpose:** Deoxygenation of the ketone via the Shapiro Reaction.\n*   **Analysis:** This two-step procedure is a Shapiro reaction. Two equivalents of the strong base n-BuLi are used to deprotonate the tosylhydrazone, leading to the elimination of stable nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group. This process forms a vinyllithium intermediate where the original ketone was. The aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) is a mild proton source that quenches the reaction, protonating the vinyllithium.\n*   **Net Result:** The original ketone functional group is completely replaced by a carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative with the benzyl ether and isopropenyl group intact, for example, 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**5. Step 4: Reaction with Pd/C under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere**\n*   **Purpose:** Hydrogenation of alkenes and Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether.\n*   **Analysis:** Catalytic hydrogenation using Pd/C and H₂ is a powerful reduction method that affects multiple functional groups in Product 3.\n    *   **Hydrogenation:** Both C=C double bonds (the one in the ring formed in Step 3 and the one in the isopropenyl side chain) are reduced (saturated) to C-C single bonds. This converts the ring to **cyclohexane** and the side chain to an **isopropyl group**.\n    *   **Hydrogenolysis:** This is the standard method for cleaving a benzyl ether protecting group. The C-O bond of the benzyl ether is broken, regenerating the original primary alcohol.\n*   **Product 4 (Final Product):** Combining these transformations yields a saturated cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group, which maintain their 1,3-relationship from the start.\n\n**Final Product Structure and Name:** The final product is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Matching to Options:**\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. Assumes incorrect reaction of n-BuLi and failure to cleave the ether.\n*   **B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** **Correct.** This name accurately describes the final product derived from the complete sequence.\n*   C) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This is the product if the benzyl ether is not cleaved, which is highly unlikely with H₂/Pd-C.\n*   D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This is an intermediate structure.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Reaction with NaH and Benzyl Bromide**\n    *   **Functional Groups in Starting Material:** The initial molecule, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, contains three distinct functional groups: a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), a ketone (C=O), and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n    *   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. Benzyl bromide (BnBr) is an electrophilic alkylating agent.\n    *   **Reaction Pathway:** The most acidic proton in the molecule is on the alcohol's hydroxyl group (pKa ≈ 17), which is more acidic than the protons alpha to the ketone (pKa ≈ 20). Therefore, NaH selectively deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. This reaction serves to \"protect\" the alcohol group from reacting in subsequent steps.\n    *   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide**\n    *   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic acid (HCl).\n    *   **Reaction Pathway:** This is a classic condensation reaction between a ketone and a hydrazine derivative. Under acidic catalysis, the ketone group reacts to form a tosylhydrazone, eliminating a molecule of water.\n    *   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1, where the C=O group is converted to a C=N-NHTs group.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Reaction with n-BuLi**\n    *   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), a very strong base, followed by an aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) quench.\n    *   **Reaction Pathway:** These are the conditions for the **Shapiro reaction**. It is crucial to recognize that n-BuLi acts as a *base*, not a nucleophile, in this context. It deprotonates the tosylhydrazone twice, leading to an intermediate that collapses by eliminating stable nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosylate group. This forms a vinyllithium intermediate. The aqueous quench provides a proton to this intermediate. The net result is the complete removal of the original ketone functionality and its replacement with a carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative containing the benzyl ether protecting group and the isopropenyl side chain. A possible structure is 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Reaction with Pd/C and H₂**\n    *   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n    *   **Reaction Pathway:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation step that performs two key transformations on Product 3. It's a common error to miss one of these.\n        1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** All carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced (saturated) to single bonds. This converts the cyclohexene ring into a cyclohexane ring and the isopropenyl side chain into an isopropyl group.\n        2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** A standard and important function of H₂/Pd-C is the cleavage of benzyl ethers. This is a deprotection step that removes the benzyl group and regenerates the original alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4:** Combining these effects, the final product is a fully saturated cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) and an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂]. The original 1,3-relationship of these substituents is maintained.\n\n**Final Structure and Matching with Options**\n\nThe final product's chemical name is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**. Let's evaluate the given options against this structure:\n\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This structure retains the tosylhydrazone group, which is eliminated in Step 3.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure results from erroneously treating the Shapiro reaction (Step 3) as a nucleophilic addition of a butyl group. It also fails to account for the deprotection in Step 4.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: **Correct.** This name and the corresponding structure perfectly match the result of the full four-step synthesis.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if only the alkenes were hydrogenated, but the benzyl ether protecting group was not removed. Hydrogenolysis is an expected reaction under these standard conditions.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the four-reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, Product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Alcohol Protection (Williamson Ether Synthesis)**\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains three distinct functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It selectively deprotonates the most acidic proton in the molecule. The proton of the hydroxyl group (-OH, pKa ≈ 17) is significantly more acidic than the protons alpha to the ketone (α-protons, pKa ≈ 20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide is nucleophilic and reacts with the electrophile, benzyl bromide, in an Sₙ2 reaction. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis used here to protect the alcohol.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) is converted to a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn). The structure is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, which contains a ketone.\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction. The ketone's carbonyl group reacts with the primary amine of the tosylhydrazide under acid catalysis to form a tosylhydrazone, eliminating a molecule of water.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group (C=O) at the C1 position is converted into a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NHTs).\n\n**Step 3: Deoxygenation (Shapiro Reaction)**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the hallmark conditions for the Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of the strong base n-BuLi. This causes a series of deprotonations and subsequent elimination of stable nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosylate group, forming a vinyllithium intermediate. The reaction is quenched with the mild proton source, aqueous ammonium chloride, which protonates the vinyllithium to form a stable alkene.\n*   **Transformation:** The net result is the complete removal of the original ketone functionality, replacing it with a carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative still containing the benzyl ether and the isopropenyl group. An example regioisomer would be 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Deprotection (Hydrogenolysis)**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, a molecule containing two alkene groups and a benzyl ether.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Analysis:** This powerful catalytic hydrogenation setup performs two crucial transformations simultaneously:\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** Hydrogen gas adds across all carbon-carbon double bonds, reducing them to single bonds. This saturates both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring (forming a cyclohexane ring) and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain (forming an isopropyl group).\n    2.  **Benzyl Ether Hydrogenolysis:** These are the standard conditions for cleaving a benzyl ether protecting group. The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen is cleaved by hydrogen, regenerating the original alcohol functional group.\n*   **Product 4 (Final Product):** Applying both transformations to Product 3 results in a fully saturated cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The 1,3-relationship of these groups on the ring is preserved throughout the synthesis.\n\n**Conclusion and Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe final product's chemical structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**. Now we match this with the given options:\n\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This is an intermediate structure. The tosylhydrazone group is eliminated in Step 3.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This would be the product if the alkenes were hydrogenated but the benzyl ether was not cleaved. Standard H₂/Pd-C conditions would cause this cleavage.\n*   C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This structure results from an incorrect assumption that n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile in Step 3.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This name and structure perfectly match the final product derived from the complete and correct reaction sequence.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n**Step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Starting Material + Sodium Hydride (NaH) and Benzyl Bromide (BnBr) → Product 1**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a **Williamson ether synthesis** used to protect the alcohol group.\n    *   **Analysis:** The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, contains three functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene. Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton available. The proton of the hydroxyl group (-OH) of the alcohol (pKa ≈ 17) is significantly more acidic than the alpha-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 20). Therefore, NaH selectively forms a sodium alkoxide. This nucleophilic alkoxide then attacks the electrophilic carbon of benzyl bromide, displacing the bromide and forming a benzyl ether.\n    *   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The alcohol group is now protected as a benzyl ether (-OBn).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 + p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl → Product 2**\n    *   **Reaction:** Formation of a **tosylhydrazone**.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction. The ketone group of Product 1 reacts with the tosylhydrazide under acidic conditions to form a tosylhydrazone, eliminating one molecule of water.\n    *   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1, where the ketone (C=O) at position 1 is replaced by a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NHTs).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 + n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) and aqueous NH₄Cl → Product 3**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is the **Shapiro reaction**.\n    *   **Analysis:** The tosylhydrazone (Product 2) is treated with a strong base (n-BuLi), which typically deprotonates it twice. The resulting unstable dianion collapses, eliminating a stable molecule of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) is a mild proton source used to quench the reaction and protonate the vinyllithium.\n    *   **Net Transformation:** The Shapiro reaction effectively replaces the original ketone functional group with a carbon-carbon double bond, resulting in deoxygenation.\n    *   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative containing the benzyl ether and the isopropenyl group, for example, 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 + Pd/C and Hydrogen (H₂) → Product 4**\n    *   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a powerful and general reduction method that affects two different functional groups in Product 3.\n        1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** Hydrogen gas adds across all carbon-carbon double bonds, saturating them to single bonds. This converts the cyclohexene ring into a cyclohexane ring and the isopropenyl side chain into an isopropyl group.\n        2.  **Benzyl Ether Hydrogenolysis:** Crucially, H₂/Pd-C are the standard conditions used to cleave benzyl ethers (deprotection). The benzyl protecting group is removed, regenerating the original primary alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4 (Final Product):** Combining these transformations, the final molecule has a fully saturated cyclohexane ring with two substituents: a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) and an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂]. Their original 1,3-relationship on the ring is preserved.\n\n**Conclusion and Evaluation of Options:**\n\nThe final product's chemical name is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**. Now we match this structure to the given options:\n\n*   **A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** Incorrect. This structure retains the tosylhydrazone group, which is an intermediate that is eliminated in Step 3.\n*   **B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** Incorrect. This structure arises from a misunderstanding of the Shapiro reaction (assuming nucleophilic addition of butyl) and fails to account for the deprotection in Step 4.\n*   **C) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** Incorrect. This is the structure that would result from the hydrogenation of the alkenes but without the cleavage of the benzyl ether protecting group. Standard H₂/Pd-C conditions cause this cleavage (hydrogenolysis).\n*   **D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** **Correct.** This name and the implied structure perfectly match the outcome of the entire four-step synthesis.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis task requires a detailed, step-by-step analysis of a four-part organic synthesis reaction sequence.

Under acid catalysis, the ketone's carbonyl group is converted into a tosylhydrazone.\n    *   **Transformation:** The ketone group (C=O) becomes a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NHTs).\n    *   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Deoxygenation (Shapiro Reaction)**\n    *   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n    *   **Process:** These are the conditions for the Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of the strong base n-BuLi, leading to elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group.

This converts the cyclohexene ring to a cyclohexane ring and the isopropenyl side chain to an isopropyl group.\n        2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** This is the standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers. The benzyl protecting group is removed, regenerating the original alcohol.\n    *   **Transformation:** All points of unsaturation are removed, and the alcohol is deprotected.\n    *   **Product 4:** The final molecule is a saturated cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) and an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂] in a 1,3-relationship.

This molecule has three distinct functional groups: a ketone (C=O), a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction:** NaH is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic functional group. The alcohol's proton (pKa ≈ 17) is significantly more acidic than the ketone's α-protons (pKa ≈ 20). NaH selectively deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   **Outcome:** The alcohol is \"protected\" by converting it into a benzyl ether.

The ketone functional group of Product 1 reacts with the tosylhydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone, eliminating one molecule of water.\n*   **Outcome:** The ketone's C=O group is converted to a C=N-NHTs group. This is the first step of the Shapiro reaction sequence.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Deoxygenation (Shapiro Reaction)**\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Reaction:** These are the conditions for a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone (Product 2) is treated with two equivalents of the strong base n-BuLi. This causes a sequence of deprotonations leading to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosylate group, forming a vinyllithium intermediate. The reaction is then quenched with a mild proton source (aq.

The final molecule is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group, retaining their original 1,3-relationship.\n*   **Product 4:** The name of this final structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe final product of the complete reaction sequence is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**. Now we match this structure to the given options:\n\n*   **A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** This name correctly describes the final product derived from the complete and correct reaction pathway.\n*   **B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** This would be the product if the final deprotection step (hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether) did not occur. It is an incomplete transformation under these standard conditions.\n*   **C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This structure results from multiple incorrect assumptions about the reaction pathway, such as n-BuLi acting as a nucleophile.\n*   **D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** This is an intermediate structure that has not undergone the Shapiro elimination.\n\nBased on the consistent chemical reasoning across all provided analyses and a correct application of reaction principles, the final product is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, Product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Alcohol Protection (Williamson Ether Synthesis)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains three distinct functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The proton on the hydroxyl group of the alcohol (pKa ≈ 17) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons adjacent to the ketone (pKa ≈ 20). Therefore, NaH selectively deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbon of benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   **Transformation:** The hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) is converted into a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn). This serves to \"protect\" the alcohol from reacting in the subsequent steps.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, which contains a ketone.\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction. The ketone carbonyl group reacts with the tosylhydrazide under acidic catalysis, leading to the formation of a tosylhydrazone and the elimination of one molecule of water.\n*   **Transformation:** The ketone group (C=O) is converted to a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NHTs).\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Shapiro Reaction (Deoxygenation/Elimination)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, the tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the classic conditions for the Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of the strong base n-BuLi. The first equivalent deprotonates the -NHTs group, and the second deprotonates the less hindered α-carbon. The resulting dianion spontaneously eliminates a molecule of highly stable nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosylate group, forming a vinyllithium intermediate. The reaction is then \"quenched\" with a mild proton source (aqueous NH₄Cl), which protonates the vinyllithium.\n*   **Transformation:** The net result of the Shapiro reaction is the complete replacement of the original ketone functional group with a carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative containing the isopropenyl side chain and the benzyl ether protecting group, for example, 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis (Deprotection)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, a molecule containing two alkene groups and a benzyl ether.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation step that induces two critical transformations simultaneously.\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** The hydrogen gas, catalyzed by Pd/C, reduces (saturates) all carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds. This converts the double bond in the cyclohexene ring to form a cyclohexane ring and reduces the isopropenyl side chain to an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Benzyl Ether Hydrogenolysis:** Pd/C with H₂ is a standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers, a common deprotection strategy. The C-O bond of the benzyl ether is broken, regenerating the original alcohol (-CH₂OH) and producing toluene as a byproduct.\n*   **Transformation:** The entire molecule is made saturated, and the alcohol is deprotected.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group, with their original 1,3-relationship on the ring preserved.\n\n**Final Conclusion and Evaluation of Options**\n\nThe final product is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**. Now, we must match this structure with the given choices:\n\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure implies n-BuLi acted as a nucleophile (wrong for Shapiro) and that the final deprotection did not occur.\n*   B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This is an intermediate structure that retains the tosylhydrazone group, which is eliminated in Step 3.\n*   **C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** **Correct.** This name perfectly describes the final product derived from the complete, four-step reaction sequence, including both alkene reduction and benzyl ether cleavage.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if the final hydrogenolysis step (cleavage of the benzyl ether) did not occur. H₂/Pd-C is a standard and effective reagent for this transformation.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
