Simplify the Formula (A Careful Point)**\nAs many of the more detailed answers correctly pointed out, using this large formula directly can lead to calculation errors. A crucial step for both accuracy and simplicity is to simplify the formula for the specific case of the (111) plane, where h=k=l=1.\n\n*   Substitute h=k=l=1: The terms `(h² + k² + l²)` and `(hk + kl + hl)` both become 3.\n*   After algebraic factorization of the numerator and denominator, common terms cancel out, leading to a much simpler and more robust formula:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d^2_{111}} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1+2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\n*   Solving for the distance, $d_{111}$:\n$$ d_{111} = a \\sqrt{\\frac{1+2\\cos\\alpha}{3}} $$\nThis simplification represents the most careful and efficient way to approach the calculation.\n\n### **4. Perform the Calculation**\nNow, we substitute the given values into the simplified formula:\n*   `a = 10` Angstrom\n*   `α = 30°`, so `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n\n$$ d_{111} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 2(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})}{3}} $$\n$$ d_{111} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n\nTo get the numerical value:\n$$ d_{111} \\approx 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.73205}{3}} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{2.73205}{3}} $$\n$$ d_{111} \\approx 10 \\times \\sqrt{0.91068} \\approx 10 \\times 0.954297 $$\n$$ d_{111} \\approx 9.54 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\n\n### **5.

This is the most important takeaway.\n*   **Source of Disagreement**: The different final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) are not due to calculation errors.

The core calculation is consistently performed correctly. The primary source of discrepancy is the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D), which arises because the multiple-choice options were presented in a different, randomized order to each agent.

Final Answer Determination**: The final step is to match this confirmed numerical result with the list of options provided in the question.\n\n*   **Question's Options**:\n    *   **A) 9.54 Angstrom**\n    *   B) 9.08 Angstrom\n    *   C) 8.95 Angstrom\n    *   D) 10.05 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated value of 9.54 Angstrom perfectly matches option **A**. The confusion seen in some candidate answers regarding the correct letter is confirmed to be due to shuffled option lists, and not an error in calculation.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem and Verify Given Information\nThe core task is to calculate the interplanar distance `d` for the (111) plane of a rhombohedral crystal.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n*   **Crystal System**: Rhombohedral\n*   **Lattice Parameter `a`**: 10 Angstrom\n*   **Interaxial Angles `α = β = γ`**: 30°\n*   **Miller Indices `(hkl)`**: (111)\n\n### Step 2: Verify the Physical Formula\nThe interplanar distance `d_hkl` in a rhombohedral crystal system is correctly identified by all candidate answers using the following general formula:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d^2_{hkl}} = \\frac{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk + kl + lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1 - 3\\cos^2\\alpha + 2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Formula Simplification for the (111) Plane\nA key insight, highlighted by a majority of the candidate answers, is that this complex formula can be greatly simplified for the specific case of the (111) plane where `h=k=l=1`. By factoring the numerator and the denominator, the formula reduces to a much simpler and less error-prone version:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d^2_{111}} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\nRearranging to solve for the distance `d_111` gives:\n$$ d_{111} = a \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 2\\cos\\alpha}{3}} $$\nThis simplification is algebraically correct and its use by multiple agents demonstrates a robust understanding of the problem.\n\n### Step 4: Perform the Calculation\nThe next step is to substitute the given values into the simplified formula:\n*   `a = 10` Angstrom\n*   `α = 30°`, therefore `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n\n$$ d_{111} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 2(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})}{3}} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n\nTo get the numerical result, we can use the value of √3 ≈ 1.73205:\n$$ d_{111} \\approx 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.73205}{3}} \\approx 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{2.73205}{3}} \\approx 10 \\times \\sqrt{0.91068} \\approx 9.54297 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\nThe calculated value, rounded to two decimal places, is **9.54 Angstrom**.\n\n### Step 5: Synthesize and Conclude\nThere is an overwhelming consensus among all candidate answers on the numerical result. Almost every agent who performed the calculation correctly arrived at a value of approximately **9.54 Angstrom**. The primary discrepancy between the agents' final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) is due to the multiple-choice options being presented to them in a different, shuffled order.\n\nTo determine the final correct answer, we must map the consensus numerical result to the option list provided in the user's question:\n\n*   **A)** 9.08 Angstrom\n*   **B)** 8.95 Angstrom\n*   **C)** 9.54 Angstrom\n*   **D)** 10.05 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated value of 9.54 Angstrom directly matches option **C**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nAn analysis of the provided answers and a step-by-step verification confirms the following:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Key Information\n- **Crystal System:** Rhombohedral\n- **Lattice Parameter (`a`):** 10 Angstrom\n- **Interaxial Angle (`α`):** 30°\n- **Miller Indices `(hkl)`:** (111)\n\n### Step 2: Select and Simplify the Correct Formula\nThe general formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral crystal is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk+kl+lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1 - 3\\cos^2\\alpha + 2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\nFor the specific case of the (111) plane, this complex formula simplifies to a much more manageable expression, as correctly identified by most of the provided candidate answers:\n$$ d_{111} = a \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 2\\cos\\alpha}{3}} $$\n\n### Step 3: Perform the Calculation\nUsing the simplified formula and the given values:\n- `a = 10`\n- `α = 30°`\n\n$$ d_{111} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 2\\cos(30^\\circ)}{3}} $$\nThe executed code `print(10 * math.sqrt((1 + 2 * math.cos(math.radians(30))) / 3))` provides a high-precision result.\n- **Calculation Result:** 9.542974... Angstrom.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with Options and Conclude\nThe calculated value, when rounded to two decimal places, is **9.54 Angstrom**.\n\nThere is a strong consensus among the candidate answers regarding this numerical result. The discrepancies in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) in the provided examples are due to differently ordered option lists in their original context.\n\nWe must compare our verified numerical result to the option list provided in the problem description:\n- A) 9.08 Angstrom\n- **B) 9.54 Angstrom**\n- C) 8.95 Angstrom\n- D) 10.05 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 9.54 Angstrom matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the calculation method and the final numerical result. The primary source of discrepancy is the lettering of the multiple-choice options, which varies between the candidates. The following is a definitive step-by-step resolution.\n\n### **1. Identify the Physics Problem**\nThe task is to calculate the interplanar distance, often denoted as $d_{hkl}$, for the (111) plane of a rhombohedral crystal.\n\n**Given Information:**\n*   Crystal System: Rhombohedral\n*   Lattice Parameter (`a`): 10 Angstrom\n*   Interaxial Angles (`α` = `β` = `γ`): 30°\n*   Miller Indices `(hkl)`: (111)\n\n### **2. Select the Correct Formula**\nThe interplanar spacing `d` for a rhombohedral lattice is given by the general formula:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk+kl+lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1 - 3\\cos^2\\alpha + 2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\nThis formula was correctly identified by nearly all candidate agents.\n\n### **3. Simplify the Formula for the (111) Plane**\nA crucial step, which demonstrates a thorough understanding and leads to a more robust calculation, is to simplify the general formula for the specific case where h=k=l=1.\n*   The term `(h² + k² + l²)` becomes 3.\n*   The term `(hk + kl + lh)` becomes 3.\n\nAs shown correctly by multiple agents, algebraic simplification of the trigonometric terms in the numerator and denominator yields a much simpler expression specifically for the (111) plane:\n$$ d_{111} = a \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 2\\cos\\alpha}{3}} $$\n\n### **4. Perform the Numerical Calculation**\nSubstitute the given values into the simplified formula:\n*   `a = 10` Angstrom\n*   `α = 30°`, therefore `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n$$ d_{111} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 2(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})}{3}} $$\n$$ d_{111} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n\nUsing numerical values ($\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.73205$):\n$$ d_{111} \\approx 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.73205}{3}} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{2.73205}{3}} $$\n$$ d_{111} \\approx 10 \\times \\sqrt{0.910683} \\approx 10 \\times 0.954297 $$\n$$ d_{111} \\approx 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\n\n### **5.

This high level of agreement establishes the correctness of the numerical result.\n*   **Discrepancy Resolution:** The different letter choices (A, B, C, D) submitted by the various candidates are a result of them being presented with differently ordered lists of the same four numerical answers.
