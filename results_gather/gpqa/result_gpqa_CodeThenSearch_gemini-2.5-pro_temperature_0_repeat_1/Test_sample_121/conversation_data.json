    "The search results confirm the plausibility of the reaction sequence. Specifically, the reaction of ethyl cyanoacetate with dihaloalkanes to form cycloalkane derivatives is documented. The analysis of 1H NMR spectra of substituted cyclohexanes is also a well-established field, confirming that geminal protons on a ring are often diastereotopic and that symmetry dictates the number of signals. My initial analysis of the final product's symmetry and the resulting number of NMR signals appears to be correct. No information found contradicts my step-by-step deduction. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Product 1:** Acetic acid is treated with bromine and a catalyst (pyridine). This is an α-halogenation reaction (a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction), which brominates the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group.\n    *   **Reactant:** CH₃COOH (Acetic acid)\n    *   **Reaction:** α-bromination\n    *   **Product 1:** Br-CH₂-COOH (Bromoacetic acid)\n\n2.  **Product 2:** Bromoacetic acid is heated with ethanol and sulfuric acid. This is a classic Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid is converted to an ester.\n    *   **Reactant:** Br-CH₂-COOH\n    *   **Reaction:** Fischer Esterification with ethanol\n    *   **Product 2:** Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃ (Ethyl bromoacetate)\n\n3.  **Product 3:** Ethyl bromoacetate is treated with sodium cyanide. This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction, where the cyanide ion displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Reactant:** Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃\n    *   **Reaction:** Sₙ2 with NaCN\n    *   **Product 3:** NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃ (Ethyl cyanoacetate)\n\n4.  **Product 4:** Ethyl cyanoacetate is treated with excess sodium hydride (a strong base) and 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    *   First, the acidic α-hydrogen of ethyl cyanoacetate is removed by NaH to form an enolate.\n    *   This enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the brominated carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   Since excess NaH is used, the second (and now only) α-hydrogen is also removed, creating a new enolate.\n    *   This second enolate undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentane chain to displace the second bromine and form a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Reactant:** NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃\n    *   **Reaction:** Double alkylation followed by intramolecular cyclization.\n    *   **Product 4:** 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n### ¹H NMR Analysis of Product 4:\n\nThe final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted at the C1 position with both a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₂CH₃) group. To determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n          CN\n          |\n       /--C--\\\n      |  |    |\n    H₂C  COOCH₂CH₃\n      |       |\n    H₂C     CH₂\n      \\       /\n       CH₂-CH₂\n    ```\n\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C1 and C4 carbons of the ring, as well as the cyano and ester substituents. This symmetry makes the protons on one side of the ring (C2, C3) equivalent to the protons on the other side (C6, C5).\n\n*   **Counting the Signals:**\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):** The two methylene (-CH₂-) protons are equivalent to each other, and the three methyl (-CH₃) protons are equivalent to each other. These two groups are in different chemical environments. This gives **2 signals**.\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   **C2 and C6:** These positions are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. On each carbon, the two protons (axial and equatorial) are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. The axial proton on C2 is equivalent to the axial on C6, and the equatorial on C2 is equivalent to the equatorial on C6. This results in **2 signals** from these four protons.\n        *   **C3 and C5:** Similar to the C2/C6 positions, these are equivalent. The axial and equatorial protons are distinct from each other and from the C2/C6 protons. This gives another **2 signals**.\n        *   **C4:** This position lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two protons (axial and equatorial) are diastereotopic and not equivalent to each other or any other protons. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Signals:** Adding them up: 2 (from ethyl group) + 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) = **8 distinct signals**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
