    "Here is a step-by-step calculation of the non-Gaussianity (nG) for the given Schrödinger cat state.\n\n### 1. Understand the Definition of Non-Gaussianity\nThe non-Gaussianity (`nG`) is measured by the relative entropy between the given state (`ρ`) and a reference Gaussian state (`τ`). The formula provided, `del_b = trace(ρ*ln(ρ)) - trace(τ*ln(τ))`, can be rewritten as `S(τ) - S(ρ)`, where `S` is the von Neumann entropy.\n\n*   **State `ρ`**: The Schrödinger cat state `|psi>` is a pure state. For any pure state, the von Neumann entropy `S(ρ) = -trace(ρ*ln(ρ))` is zero.\n*   **Reference State `τ`**: The reference Gaussian state `τ` is defined as the Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments (mean displacement and covariance matrix) as `ρ`.\n*   **Simplified nG**: Therefore, the non-Gaussianity is simply the von Neumann entropy of the reference Gaussian state: `nG = S(τ)`.\n\n### 2. Define the State for the Given Parameters\nThe Schrödinger cat state is given by:\n`|psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N`\n\nFor the specific parameters `phi = -π/4` and `alpha = 0.5`:\n*   `cos(-π/4) = 1/√2`\n*   `sin(-π/4) = -1/√2`\n*   `sin(2*phi) = sin(-π/2) = -1`\n*   `N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)) = sqrt(1 - exp(-2*0.5^2)) = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5))`\n\nSubstituting these into the state definition gives the \"odd cat state\":\n`|psi> = ( (1/√2)|alpha> - (1/√2)|-alpha> ) / sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5))`\n`|psi> = (|alpha> - |-alpha>) / sqrt(2 * (1 - exp(-2*|alpha|^2)))`\n\n### 3. Determine the Reference Gaussian State `τ`\nTo find the entropy `S(τ)`, we first need to characterize `τ` by calculating the first and second moments of `ρ`.\n\n*   **First Moment (Displacement):** The average displacement `<a> = <psi|a|psi>` is zero for this state.\n*   **Second Moments:** We need the average photon number `n = <a†a>` and the squeezing term `<a^2>`.\n    *   The average photon number for the odd cat state is `n = |alpha|^2 * coth(|alpha|^2)`.\n    *   The state `|psi>` is an eigenstate of the `a^2` operator, with the eigenvalue `alpha^2`. Thus, `<a^2> = alpha^2`.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Entropy of the Reference State `S(τ)`\nThe entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state is determined by its symplectic eigenvalue `ν`. The entropy is given by:\n`S(τ) = (ν + 1/2)ln(ν + 1/2) - (ν - 1/2)ln(ν - 1/2)`\n\nThe symplectic eigenvalue `ν` is calculated from the second moments:\n`ν = sqrt( (n + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2 )`\n\n### 5. Perform the Numerical Calculation\nNow, we plug in the value `alpha = 0.5`. Let `x = |alpha|^2 = 0.25`.\n\n1.  **Calculate the average photon number `n`**:\n    `n = x * coth(x) = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`\n    `coth(0.25) ≈ 4.08302`\n    `n ≈ 0.25 * 4.08302 ≈ 1.02076`\n\n2.  **Calculate the squeezing term `<a^2>`**:\n    `|<a^2>| = |alpha^2| = 0.25`\n\n3.  **Calculate the symplectic eigenvalue `ν`**:\n    `ν = sqrt( (1.02076 + 0.5)^2 - 0.25^2 )`\n    `ν = sqrt( 1.52076^2 - 0.0625 )`\n    `ν = sqrt( 2.3127 - 0.0625 ) = sqrt(2.2502) ≈ 1.50007`\n\n    The result for `ν` is remarkably close to 1.5.\n\n4.  **Calculate the entropy `S(τ)`**:\n    The entropy formula can be expressed in terms of an equivalent thermal photon number `n_s = ν - 1/2`.\n    `n_s ≈ 1.50007 - 0.5 = 1.00007`\n    `S(τ) = (n_s + 1)ln(n_s + 1) - n_s ln(n_s)`\n    `S(τ) ≈ (2.00007)ln(2.00007) - (1.00007)ln(1.00007)`\n\n    Since `n_s` is very close to 1, the entropy will be very close to the value for `n_s = 1`:\n    `S(τ) for n_s=1 = (1+1)ln(1+1) - 1*ln(1) = 2ln(2)`\n    `2ln(2) ≈ 2 * 0.693147 = 1.38629`\n\nThis value is extremely close to the option B. The slight deviation in the calculation arises because `alpha` is small but finite. For `alpha -> 0`, the odd cat state becomes the single-photon Fock state `|1>`, for which the non-Gaussianity is exactly `2ln(2)`. Given the options, it's clear that this is the intended answer.\n\nFinal Answer is approximately 1.38.\n\n<<<B>>>"
