    "### Deciphering the Chemical Puzzle\n\nBased on the provided clues, the mysterious **Substance X** is identified as **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how the clues lead to this conclusion:\n\n*   **Isotopic Composition and Reagent Type:** The substance incorporates a heavier isotope and is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, with a very close analog. This points to a deuterated reagent, with its regular hydrogen (protium) version being the common analog. LiAlD₄ fits this, with its widely used analog being Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). LiAlH₄ is a powerful reducing agent. The problem states that the reaction of a keto acid with substance X yields a product with two oxygen atoms, which is consistent with the strong reducing power of LiAlH₄ (and by extension, LiAlD₄) that can reduce both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group to alcohol groups.\n\n*   **Violent Reaction and Gaseous Product (W):** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W whose molecules contain an equal number of protons and neutrons. If Substance X is LiAlD₄ and it reacts with heavy water (D₂O) as liquid Y, the reaction produces deuterium gas (D₂). A deuterium atom has one proton and one neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has two protons and two neutrons, fitting the description of gas W. The reaction is: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. This reaction is known to be violent, similar to the reaction of LiAlH₄ with water.\n\n*   **Precipitate (G) and Product B:** The reaction forms a precipitate G, which upon heating, releases B. In the proposed reaction, the precipitate G is aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). Heating this compound causes it to decompose into aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) and heavy water (D₂O), which would be substance B.\n\n*   **Melting Point of B:** The melting point of B is very close to 277 K. Heavy water (D₂O) has a melting point of 3.82°C, which is 276.97 K. This is an extremely close match and strongly confirms that B is D₂O.\n\n### Calculation of Cumulative Atomic Masses\n\nHaving identified Substance X as LiAlD₄, the next step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of its lightest and heaviest elements.\n\n1.  **Elements in LiAlD₄:** The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (present as its heavier isotope, Deuterium 'D').\n2.  **Lightest and Heaviest Elements:**\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n3.  **Summation of Masses:** The problem requires summing the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the molecule.\n    *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminum):** There is one atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its most stable isotope is 27.\n    *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** There are four atoms of the Deuterium isotope. The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n    *   **Total Mass of Lightest Element's Isotopes:** 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = 8 amu.\n4.  **Cumulative Atomic Mass:**\n    *   Sum = (Mass of Aluminum) + (Total mass of Deuterium atoms)\n    *   Sum = 27 + 8 = 35\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>"
