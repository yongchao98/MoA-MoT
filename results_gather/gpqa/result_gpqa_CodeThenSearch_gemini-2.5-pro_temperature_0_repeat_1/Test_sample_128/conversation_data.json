    "Here is a step-by-step identification of compound E based on the provided reaction scheme and hints.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A**\n\n*   **Hint (b)** states that the IR spectrum of compound A has a strong peak around 1750 cm⁻¹. This high-frequency absorption for a carbonyl group is characteristic of a five-membered ring ketone (a cyclopentanone), where ring strain increases the stretching frequency. In contrast, a less-strained six-membered ring ketone (a cyclohexanone) shows a peak around 1715 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Hint (a)** describes a Wittig reaction between compound A and a phosphorus ylide to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. A Wittig reaction converts a ketone or aldehyde into an alkene. The \"propan-2-ylidene\" part of the product, =C(CH₃)₂, comes from the ylide, meaning the ketone's oxygen atom was replaced by this group. Although the IUPAC name provided in the hint appears to be numbered unconventionally, the structure implies that the starting ketone was a dimethylcyclopentanone. Based on the likely structure and the IR data, **Compound A is 3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Trace the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Compound A → Compound B:** Compound A (3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one) reacts with HCN. This is a nucleophilic addition where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming a cyanohydrin.\n    *   **Compound B is 1-cyano-3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-ol.**\n\n*   **Compound B → Compound C:** Compound B is reduced with H₂ in the presence of a Palladium (Pd) catalyst. This reaction reduces the nitrile group (-C≡N) to a primary amine (-CH₂NH₂).\n    *   **Compound C is 1-(aminomethyl)-3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-ol.**\n\n*   **Compound C → Compound D:** Compound C, a primary amine, reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂). This process, called diazotization, converts the primary amino group into an unstable diazonium salt.\n    *   **Compound D is the [(1-hydroxy-3,4-dimethylcyclopentyl)methyl]diazonium ion.**\n\n*   **Compound D → Compound E:** The aliphatic diazonium salt (Compound D) is highly unstable and spontaneously eliminates a molecule of nitrogen gas (N₂), the \"inert gas\" mentioned. This loss generates a highly reactive primary carbocation. This intermediate then undergoes a rearrangement to form a more stable product. This specific sequence—the reaction of a 1-aminomethyl-cycloalkanol with nitrous acid to yield a ring-expanded ketone—is known as the **Tiffeneau–Demjanov rearrangement**.\n\n    *   In this rearrangement, the five-membered cyclopentane ring expands to a six-membered cyclohexane ring. The carbon atom from the -CH₂NH₂ group is incorporated into the new ring.\n    *   The methyl groups, originally at positions 3 and 4 of the cyclopentanone, remain at positions 3 and 4 relative to the newly formed carbonyl group in the cyclohexanone product.\n    *   Therefore, **Compound E is 3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.**\n\n**Step 3: Final Verification**\n\n*   The identity of Compound E as 3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is consistent with **Hint (b)**, which states that its IR spectrum shows a strong peak around 1715 cm⁻¹. This is the typical absorption frequency for a cyclohexanone.\n*   Comparing this result with the given options, it directly matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
