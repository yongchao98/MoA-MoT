    "The \"impulse\" approximation in many-body nuclear calculations is a foundational concept that simplifies the complex problem of particle interactions within a nucleus. It posits that the interaction can be treated as a rapid event involving a single nucleon, which behaves as if it were a free particle at the moment of interaction. This approximation is underpinned by a set of core assumptions.\n\nThe key assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons:** This is the primary tenet of the approximation. The complex interaction with the A-nucleon system is reduced to a sum of incoherent interactions with each of the A nucleons. This means the probe, for instance in an electroweak interaction, engages with just one nucleon at a time.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon:** This assumption, often called the \"transparency assumption,\" posits that the incoming probe can reach any nucleon and the outgoing particles can leave the nucleus without significant secondary interactions with the other nucleons. The interaction is treated as an isolated event between the probe and the single, selected nucleon.\n\n3.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces:** During the very short timescale of the interaction, the forces that bind the nucleon to the rest of the nucleus are considered negligible. The nucleon is treated as a free particle at the instant of the collision.\n\nThe assumption that the quarks internal to the nucleon are non-relativistic is not a required component of the impulse approximation itself. The impulse approximation operates at the level of nucleons within a nucleus, not at the sub-nucleonic level of quarks. While relativistic effects concerning the nucleons themselves can be considered (leading to the Relativistic Impulse Approximation), the internal dynamics of the quarks are a separate consideration.\n\nTherefore, the three assumptions that jointly define the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
