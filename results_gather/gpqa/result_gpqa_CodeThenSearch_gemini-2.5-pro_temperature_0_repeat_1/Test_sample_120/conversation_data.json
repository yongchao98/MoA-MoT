    "The reaction in question is the ring-opening of an epoxide with an organocuprate, also known as a Gilman reagent. The fundamental principles governing this reaction are well-established in organic chemistry.\n\nFirst, the regioselectivity of the reaction dictates where the nucleophile will attack. For organocuprates reacting with epoxides, the attack occurs at the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. This is a characteristic of a reaction proceeding through an S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism. In the starting material, (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, the epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6. C1 is substituted with a methyl group, making it a tertiary center, while C6 is a secondary center. Therefore, the incoming methyl group from the lithium dimethylcuprate (Me₂CuLi) will attack the less hindered C6.\n\nSecond, the stereoselectivity of the reaction is critical. The ring-opening of epoxides by organocuprates proceeds with an inversion of configuration at the carbon atom that is attacked by the nucleophile. This is a hallmark of the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction mechanism, where the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the carbon-oxygen bond.\n\nLet's apply these principles to the specific molecule:\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n2.  **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi, which provides a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n3.  **Regioselectivity:** The attack occurs at C6, the less substituted carbon of the epoxide.\n4.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack at C6, which has an (S) configuration, will cause an inversion, leading to an (R) configuration at this carbon in the product.\n5.  **Fate of other stereocenters:** The configurations of the chiral centers not involved in the bond-breaking and bond-making process (C3 and C4) will remain unchanged. The stereocenter at C1, which becomes the site of the hydroxyl group after the ring opens and is protonated during workup, also retains its configuration.\n\n**Product Analysis:**\n\n*   The initial stereochemistry is (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n*   The nucleophilic methyl group attacks C6.\n*   The configuration at C6 inverts from (S) to (R).\n*   The configurations at C1, C3, and C4 remain (R).\n*   The resulting product is a cyclohexanol derivative with four methyl groups. We must re-number the ring according to IUPAC rules for cyclohexanols, where the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated C1.\n    *   Original C1 becomes the new C1 (bearing an -OH and a methyl group). Its configuration remains (R).\n    *   Original C6 becomes the new C2 (now bearing a new methyl group). Its configuration has inverted from (S) to (R).\n    *   Original C4 becomes the new C4 (bearing a methyl group). Its configuration remains (R).\n    *   Original C3 becomes the new C5 (bearing a methyl group). Its configuration remains (R).\n*   The substituents are located at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5, so the base name is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n*   The final stereochemistry is (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R).\n\nThis corresponds to the product (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<D>>>"
