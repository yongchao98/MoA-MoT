    "The total minimum energy of this system is the sum of the potential energies of all possible pairs of charges. This can be divided into two parts: the potential energy of the 12 charges on the sphere interacting with each other (U_sphere), and the potential energy of the 12 charges on the sphere interacting with the central charge (U_center).\n\n**1. Interaction with the Central Charge (U_center)**\n\nEach of the 12 charges on the sphere is at a distance R = 2 m from the central charge at point P. The potential energy of a single one of these pairs is given by Coulomb's law:\n\nU_pair = k * q1 * q2 / r\n\nwhere:\n*   k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.98755 x 10^9 N⋅m²/C²\n*   q1 and q2 are the charges of the particles, which are both 2e.\n*   e is the elementary charge, approximately 1.602176634 x 10⁻¹⁹ C\n*   r is the distance between the charges, which is R = 2 m.\n\nThe charge of each particle is q = 2 * (1.602176634 x 10⁻¹⁹ C) = 3.204353268 x 10⁻¹⁹ C.\n\nSince there are 12 charges on the sphere, the total potential energy from their interaction with the central charge is:\n\nU_center = 12 * (k * (2e)² / R)\nU_center = 12 * (8.98755 x 10⁹ * (3.204353268 x 10⁻¹⁹)² / 2)\nU_center = 5.5374 x 10⁻²⁷ J\n\n**2. Interaction Between the 12 Charges on the Sphere (U_sphere)**\n\nTo achieve minimum energy, the 12 identical charges on the surface of the sphere will arrange themselves into a configuration that maximizes their separation. For 12 charges, this configuration is the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n\nThe potential energy of this system of 12 charges is the sum of the potential energies of all possible pairs. There are (12 * 11) / 2 = 66 pairs. The distances between the vertices of an icosahedron are not all equal. For an icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius R, there are:\n*   30 pairs of adjacent vertices, separated by a distance 'a'.\n*   30 pairs of vertices separated by a distance 'b'.\n*   6 pairs of diametrically opposite vertices, separated by a distance of 2R.\n\nThe distances 'a' and 'b' can be calculated from the angles subtended by the vertices at the center of the sphere. For an icosahedron:\n*   The angle between adjacent vertices is approximately 63.43°.\n*   The angle between the next nearest vertices is approximately 116.57°.\n\nThe distances are calculated as d = 2 * R * sin(θ/2):\n*   a = 2 * (2 m) * sin(63.43° / 2) ≈ 2.1029 m\n*   b = 2 * (2 m) * sin(116.57° / 2) ≈ 3.4026 m\n*   c = 2 * R = 4 m\n\nThe total potential energy of the 12 charges on the sphere is:\n\nU_sphere = k * (2e)² * [ (30 / a) + (30 / b) + (6 / c) ]\nU_sphere = (8.98755 x 10⁹ * (3.204353268 x 10⁻¹⁹)²) * [ (30 / 2.1029) + (30 / 3.4026) + (6 / 4) ]\nU_sphere ≈ 9.229 x 10⁻²⁸ * [ 14.266 + 8.817 + 1.5 ]\nU_sphere ≈ 9.229 x 10⁻²⁸ * 24.583\nU_sphere ≈ 2.2688 x 10⁻²⁶ J\n\n**3. Total Minimum Energy**\n\nThe total minimum energy of the system is the sum of these two components:\n\nU_total = U_sphere + U_center\nU_total ≈ 2.2688 x 10⁻²⁶ J + 5.5374 x 10⁻²⁷ J\nU_total ≈ 2.2688 x 10⁻²⁶ J + 0.55374 x 10⁻²⁶ J\nU_total ≈ 2.82254 x 10⁻²⁶ J\n\nRounding to three decimal places, the minimum energy is 2.823 x 10⁻²⁶ J. This corresponds to option C, which is 2.822 x 10⁻²⁶ J. The minor difference is likely due to rounding of constants during calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
