    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product and the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is combined with 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at an elevated temperature.\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** The combination of a bis(dihalomethyl) compound and sodium iodide is a method to generate a highly reactive diene for in-situ trapping. While the provided starting material is unusual, the most plausible reactive intermediate formed is **o-xylylene** (also known as o-quinodimethane). This diene then undergoes a Diels-Alder reaction with the norbornadiene derivative, which acts as the dienophile.\n*   The norbornadiene has two equivalent double bonds. The o-xylylene will add across one of them. This reaction forms a new six-membered ring fused to the norbornane skeleton. The other double bond of the norbornadiene remains untouched. The tert-butoxy group remains on the C7 bridge.\n*   **Product 1** is the resulting polycyclic Diels-Alder adduct.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** Strong aqueous acid is used to cleave tert-butyl ethers. The tert-butoxy group (-O-C(CH₃)₃) on the C7 bridge is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Product 2** is the corresponding alcohol.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO.\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** This set of reagents corresponds to the **Parikh-Doering oxidation**. It is a mild method for oxidizing secondary alcohols to ketones. The hydroxyl group at C7 is oxidized to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **Product 3** is a ketone. Its core structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-**2**-en-7-one, which is substituted with the fused ring system from the initial Diels-Alder reaction.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3 is heated to 150°C.\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** The thermal reaction of bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-en-7-one derivatives is a well-documented cheletropic extrusion. The C7-carbonyl bridge is eliminated as carbon monoxide (CO), and the remaining six carbon atoms of the bicyclic core (C1 through C6) rearrange to form a stable aromatic benzene ring. The substituent that was fused to the C5 and C6 positions of the norbornene system is now fused to the newly formed benzene ring.\n*   The initial Diels-Alder adduct from o-xylylene is a 1,4-dihydronaphthalene system. When the norbornene core it is attached to transforms into a benzene ring, the final product is a fusion of these two systems.\n*   **Product 4** is **1,4-dihydroanthracene**.\n\n**Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nTo find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must examine the symmetry of 1,4-dihydroanthracene.\n\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C9 and C10 atoms and bisects the molecule. This plane makes pairs of hydrogen atoms on opposite sides of the plane equivalent.\n*   **Hydrogen Environments:**\n    1.  The hydrogen atom on C9 is unique.\n    2.  The hydrogen atom on C10 is unique.\n    3.  The aromatic hydrogens on the outer benzene ring are paired by symmetry: H5 is equivalent to H8, and H6 is equivalent to H7. This gives two distinct types.\n    4.  The vinylic hydrogens on the central ring are equivalent by symmetry: H2 is equivalent to H3. This gives one distinct type.\n    5.  The hydrogens on the saturated carbons (C1 and C4) are methylene (-CH₂) groups. Due to the overall chirality of the molecule's shape, the two hydrogens on each methylene group are diastereotopic (not equivalent). However, the plane of symmetry makes the pair on C1 equivalent to the pair on C4. Therefore, there are two distinct types of methylene hydrogens.\n\n*   **Total Count:** Summing up the distinct types: 1 (H9) + 1 (H10) + 2 (outer aromatic H's) + 1 (vinylic H's) + 2 (methylene H's) = **7**.\n\nThere are 7 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on the final product, 1,4-dihydroanthracene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
