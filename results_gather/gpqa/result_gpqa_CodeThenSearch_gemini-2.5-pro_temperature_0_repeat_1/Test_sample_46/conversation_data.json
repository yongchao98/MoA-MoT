    "Based on the detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the compound is identified as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Here is a breakdown of how the data corresponds to the structure:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):** The formula is consistent with ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, also known as Benzocaine. The calculated degree of unsaturation is 5, which accounts for a benzene ring (4 degrees) and a carbonyl group (1 degree).\n\n*   **IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The medium to strong bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is indicative of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. This frequency is typical for an ester that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This triplet signal with an integration of three protons represents a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The broadness is due to quadripolar relaxation and exchange.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This quartet, integrating to two protons, corresponds to a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group. Its downfield chemical shift indicates it is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom, as in an ethyl ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pair of doublets in the aromatic region is a classic pattern for a 1,4- (or para-) disubstituted benzene ring. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-donating amino group, while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ethyl ester group.\n\nAll other possible isomers are inconsistent with one or more of the provided data points. For example, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would show a formyl proton signal in the NMR, and 4-aminophenyl propionate would have a different splitting pattern for the alkyl chain. Therefore, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the identification of the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
