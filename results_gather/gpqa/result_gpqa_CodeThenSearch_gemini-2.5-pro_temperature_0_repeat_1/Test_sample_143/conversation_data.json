    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the mean decay distance of the X meson resonance.\n\n**1. Understand the concepts and formulas**\n\n*   **Proper lifetime (τ):** The lifetime of a particle in its own rest frame. It is related to the decay width (Γ) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The formula is:\n    τ = ħ / Γ\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s).\n\n*   **Lorentz factor (γ) and β:** These factors describe the relativistic effects due to the particle's high velocity.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is the ratio of the total energy (E) to the rest mass energy (m₀c²):\n        γ = E / (m₀c²)\n    *   β is the ratio of the particle's velocity (v) to the speed of light (c): β = v/c. It can be calculated from γ:\n        β = √(1 - 1/γ²)\n\n*   **Mean decay distance (L):** This is the average distance the particle travels in the laboratory frame before it decays. Due to time dilation, the particle's lifetime in the lab frame (t') is longer than its proper lifetime (τ): t' = γτ. The distance is this lab lifetime multiplied by the particle's velocity (v = βc).\n    L = v * t' = (βc) * (γτ) = βγcτ\n\n**2. List the given values**\n\n*   Total energy (Eₓ): 8 GeV = 8000 MeV\n*   Rest mass (mₓ): 1.2 GeV/c². This means the rest mass energy (mₓc²) is 1.2 GeV = 1200 MeV.\n*   Decay width (Γₓ): 320 MeV\n*   Speed of light (c): ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s\n*   Reduced Planck constant (ħ): ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s\n*   A useful combination is ħc ≈ 197.3 MeV·fm (1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m).\n\n**3. Perform the calculations**\n\n*   **Step 3a: Calculate the proper decay length (cτ).**\n    It is often easier to calculate the product cτ directly using ħc.\n    cτ = ħc / Γₓ\n    cτ = (197.3 MeV·fm) / 320 MeV\n    cτ ≈ 0.6166 fm, which is 0.6166 x 10⁻¹⁵ m.\n\n*   **Step 3b: Calculate the relativistic factor βγ.**\n    First, calculate γ:\n    γ = Eₓ / (mₓc²) = 8000 MeV / 1200 MeV = 20 / 3\n    Now, we can find βγ using the relation βγ = √(γ² - 1):\n    βγ = √((20/3)² - 1) = √(400/9 - 1) = √(391/9) = √391 / 3\n    βγ ≈ 19.774 / 3 ≈ 6.591\n\n*   **Step 3c: Calculate the mean decay distance (L).**\n    L = βγ * (cτ)\n    L ≈ 6.591 * (0.6166 x 10⁻¹⁵ m)\n    L ≈ 4.0655 x 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\n**4. Compare with the given options**\n\nThe calculated mean decay distance is approximately 4.0655 x 10⁻¹⁵ m. This matches option B.\n\nA) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁶ m\nB) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\nC) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁶ m\nD) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
