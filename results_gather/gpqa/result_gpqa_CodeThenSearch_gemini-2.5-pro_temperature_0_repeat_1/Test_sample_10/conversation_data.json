    "All the provided statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are accurate, with one exception. After a thorough review of the current scientific literature, the incorrect statement has been identified.\n\n**A) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.** This statement is correct. Studies have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a protein can induce apoptosis by activating caspase-8, a key initiator of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. This activation occurs without altering the levels of Bcl-2, a primary regulator of the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway, indicating that ORF3a initiates apoptosis through the extrinsic route. While the extrinsic pathway can subsequently trigger the intrinsic pathway, the initial mechanism described is accurate.\n\n**B) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates.** This statement is questionable and likely an oversimplification. Research indicates that frameshifting efficiency correlates with the \"conformational plasticity\" of the pseudoknot—its ability to form alternative structures—rather than its mechanical stability. However, the claim of a specific *linear* correlation with the *number* of conformations is not strongly supported in the literature. Furthermore, while studies have identified multiple conformations, including at least two under tension for SARS-CoV-2, the exact number and the direct comparison to SARS-CoV in this context are complex and still under investigation.\n\n**C) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.** This statement is correct. Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) is a conserved mechanism in all coronaviruses where the ribosome shifts back one nucleotide at a specific \"slippery sequence.\" [2, 5, 13] This event, stimulated by a downstream RNA pseudoknot, allows for the translation of two different open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) from the 5' end of the genome, producing polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab. [4, 5] Structural analyses have confirmed that the pseudoknot structures of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are nearly identical and have the same conformation. [3, 6]\n\n**D) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA.** This statement is incorrect. The nsp10/nsp14 complex does indeed form a heterodimer where nsp10 activates the N-terminal exoribonuclease (ExoN) domain of nsp14, which functions as a proofreading or mismatch repair enzyme. [4, 5, 6] However, the function of this exonuclease complex is to *excise* or *degrade* RNA strands—including both single-stranded (ssRNA) and double-stranded (dsRNA)—to remove misincorporated nucleotides. [1, 8] Therefore, the complex actively causes the breakdown of RNA at the site of an error; it does not prevent it.\n\n<<<D>>>"
