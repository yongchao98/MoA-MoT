    "The less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome (47,XXY) compared to Down's syndrome (Trisomy 21) are primarily due to the process of X-chromosome inactivation, which compensates for the extra X chromosome. In individuals with Klinefelter's syndrome, one of the two X chromosomes is largely silenced in a process that involves epigenetic modifications like DNA and histone methylation. This renders the extra X chromosome mostly inactive, mitigating the effects of the additional chromosome.\n\nIn contrast, individuals with Down's syndrome have an extra copy of an autosome, chromosome 21. There is no equivalent biological mechanism to inactivate an entire extra autosome. Consequently, there is an overexpression of most genes on the third copy of chromosome 21, leading to a more significant gene dosage imbalance and more severe and widespread developmental effects.\n\nWhile X-inactivation in Klinefelter's syndrome is extensive, it is not complete. About 15% of genes on the inactivated X chromosome, particularly in the pseudoautosomal regions, escape inactivation and are still expressed. The expression of these \"escapee\" genes from the extra X chromosome is thought to contribute to the specific features of Klinefelter's syndrome, such as tall stature and infertility.\n\nTherefore, the molecular mechanism responsible is the epigenetic silencing of the extra X chromosome, a process for which chromatin methylation is a key component. This occurs after fertilization in the developing embryo.\n\n<<<B>>>"
