    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine how many of the listed stars would be detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph.\n\nA star is considered detectable if it meets two main criteria:\n1.  It must be observable from the Paranal Observatory in Chile.\n2.  It must be bright enough to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 in a one-hour exposure with a single 8m VLT unit.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine ESPRESSO's Limiting Magnitude**\n\nThe requirement is to achieve an S/N of 10 in a one-hour exposure. According to documentation from the European Southern Observatory (ESO), ESPRESSO, when used with a single VLT Unit Telescope (1-UT mode), can reach an S/N of 10 for stars with a visual magnitude (V) of about 17. Some documentation suggests this limit could be as faint as V ≈ 18 in certain binned modes. For this analysis, we will use a conservative limiting magnitude of V = 17. Any star with an apparent magnitude brighter than (i.e., a smaller value than) 17 will be considered detectable in terms of brightness.\n\n### **Step 2: Check the Observability of Each Star from Paranal**\n\nThe Paranal Observatory is located in the Southern Hemisphere at a latitude of approximately -24.6 degrees. This location restricts the visibility of stars in the northern sky. A star's north-south position is given by its declination (DEC).\n\n*   **a) Canopus:** Has a declination of approximately -52° 41'. Being in the southern celestial hemisphere, it is easily observable from Paranal.\n*   **b) Polaris:** Has a declination of about +89° 15'. As the North Star, it is located very close to the north celestial pole and is not visible from southern latitudes like Paranal. Therefore, Polaris is **not detectable**.\n*   **c), d), e), f) Stars at DEC = 0 deg:** A declination of 0 degrees places these stars on the celestial equator, making them readily observable from Paranal.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Apparent Magnitude of Each Star**\n\nNext, we need the apparent visual magnitude (m) for each star to compare with ESPRESSO's limiting magnitude.\n\n*   **a) Canopus:** This is the second brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent magnitude of approximately -0.74. This is significantly brighter than the V=17 limit.\n*   **b) Polaris:** While not observable, its apparent magnitude is about 1.98.\n*   **c), d), e), f) Stars with Absolute Magnitude (M) of 15:** For these stars, we must calculate the apparent magnitude (m) using the distance modulus formula: `m = M + 5 * log10(d/10)`, where `d` is the distance in parsecs (pc).\n\n    *   **c) Star at 10 pc:**\n        m = 15 + 5 * log10(10 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(1) = 15 + 0 = **15.0**\n    *   **e) Star at 5 pc:**\n        m = 15 + 5 * log10(5 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(0.5) ≈ 15 + 5 * (-0.301) ≈ 15 - 1.5 = **13.5**\n    *   **f) Star at 50 pc:**\n        m = 15 + 5 * log10(50 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(5) ≈ 15 + 5 * (0.699) ≈ 15 + 3.5 = **18.5**\n    *   **d) Star at 200 pc:**\n        m = 15 + 5 * log10(200 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(20) ≈ 15 + 5 * (1.301) ≈ 15 + 6.5 = **21.5**\n\n### **Step 4: Final Count of Detectable Stars**\n\nLet's summarize the findings for each star:\n\n*   **a) Canopus:** Observable (DEC ≈ -52°) and very bright (m ≈ -0.74). **Detectable.**\n*   **b) Polaris:** Not observable from Paranal (DEC ≈ +89°). **Not Detectable.**\n*   **c) Star at 10 pc:** Observable (DEC = 0°) and bright enough (m = 15.0). **Detectable.**\n*   **d) Star at 200 pc:** Observable (DEC = 0°) but too faint (m = 21.5). **Not Detectable.**\n*   **e) Star at 5 pc:** Observable (DEC = 0°) and bright enough (m = 13.5). **Detectable.**\n*   **f) Star at 50 pc:** Observable (DEC = 0°) but too faint (m = 18.5). **Not Detectable.**\n\nCounting the detectable stars (a, c, and e), we find there are a total of **3**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
