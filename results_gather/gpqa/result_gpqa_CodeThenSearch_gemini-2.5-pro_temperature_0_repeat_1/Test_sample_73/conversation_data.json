    "Here is the step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Principle of Radioactive Decay\n\nRadioactive decay is a random process governed by the laws of quantum mechanics. A key characteristic of this process is that it is \"memoryless.\" This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is constant and does not depend on how long the atom has already existed. Therefore, the fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes does not change its inherent decay probability for any future period.\n\n### 2. Determine the Decay Constant (λ)\n\nThe probability of an atom *not* decaying within a certain time `t` is given by the exponential decay formula:\n\n*P(survival) = e^(-λt)*\n\nWhere:\n*   `e` is the base of the natural logarithm.\n*   `λ` is the decay constant, which is unique to the atomic nucleus in question.\n*   `t` is the time interval.\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%. This means the probability of survival is:\n\n*P(survival in 100 min) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68*\n\nNow, we can use this information to find the decay constant `λ`:\n\n*0.68 = e^(-λ * 100)*\n\nTo solve for `λ`, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\n*ln(0.68) = -100λ*\n\n*λ = -ln(0.68) / 100*\n\n### 3. Calculate the Probability of Decay in the Next 150 Minutes\n\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Because the process is memoryless, this is equivalent to calculating the decay probability for a fresh atom over a 150-minute period.\n\nThe probability of decay within a time `t` is:\n\n*P(decay) = 1 - P(survival) = 1 - e^(-λt)*\n\nWe will use the `λ` we found in the previous step and set `t = 150` minutes:\n\n*P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)*\n\nSubstitute the expression for `λ`:\n\n*P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^([-ln(0.68) / 100] * 150)*\n\n*P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(ln(0.68) * 1.5)*\n\nUsing the property of logarithms that `e^(ln(x)) = x`, we can simplify:\n\n*P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - (e^ln(0.68))^1.5*\n\n*P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5*\n\n### 4. Final Calculation\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n\n*   First, calculate `0.68` raised to the power of `1.5`:\n    *(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.558*\n*   Next, subtract this value from 1:\n    *1 - 0.558 = 0.442*\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n\n*0.442 * 100 = 44.2%*\n\nThis value is closest to 44%.\n\nThe probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>"
