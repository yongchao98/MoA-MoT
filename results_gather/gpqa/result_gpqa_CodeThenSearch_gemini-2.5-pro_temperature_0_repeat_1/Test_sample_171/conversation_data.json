    "To determine the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the two stars, we must use the Boltzmann equation, which is appropriate here given the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\nThe Boltzmann equation describes the ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy state (N_b) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (N_a). The formula is:\n\nN_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   `g_b` and `g_a` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the energy levels.\n*   `E_b - E_a` is the energy difference between the two levels (ΔE).\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nIn this problem, we are comparing the \"excitation\" of iron atoms in two different stars. We can define the excitation as the ratio of atoms in a specific excited state to those in the ground state.\n\nFor star 1, with temperature T_1, the excitation is:\n(N_b / N_a)_1 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n\nFor star 2, with temperature T_2, the excitation is:\n(N_b / N_a)_2 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nThe problem states that the excitation in star 1 is twice that in star 2:\n(N_b / N_a)_1 = 2 * (N_b / N_a)_2\n\nSubstituting the Boltzmann expressions into this relation gives:\n(g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * [(g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]]\n\nThe term for the statistical weights, (g_b / g_a), is a property of the iron atom and cancels out from both sides:\nexp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nTo solve for the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\nln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this simplifies to:\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for ln(2):\nln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)\n\nFactoring out the common term ΔE / k:\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\nCombining the fractions in the parenthesis:\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)]\n\nThe problem provides the energy difference ΔE as approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. The Boltzmann constant, k, is approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K. Therefore, the ratio ΔE / k is approximately 1 K.\n\nSubstituting this value into the equation:\nln(2) = 1 * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)]\n\nThis simplifies to the final correct equation:\nln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\n<<<A>>>"
