    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Normalize the State Vector |α>\n\nThe given state is proportional to `(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`. Let's call the unnormalized state `|ψ>`.\n`|ψ> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`\n\nTo normalize this state, we need to find the normalization constant C such that `|α> = C|ψ>` and `<α|α> = 1`.\nThe inner product `<ψ|ψ>` is calculated as:\n`<ψ|ψ> = <(1+i)up + (2-i)down | (1+i)up + (2-i)down>`\nSince `|up>` and `|down>` are orthonormal, `<up|up> = 1`, `<down|down> = 1`, and `<up|down> = <down|up> = 0`.\n`<ψ|ψ> = (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i) = (1² + 1²) + (2² + 1²) = 2 + 5 = 7`\n\nThe normalization constant C is `1/sqrt(<ψ|ψ>)`, so `C = 1/sqrt(7)`.\nThe normalized state is:\n`|α> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n\nIn matrix notation, where `|up> = [1, 0]` and `|down> = [0, 1]`, the state vector is:\n`|α> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]`\n\n### 2. Define the Operator A and Find its Eigenstates and Eigenvalues\n\nThe operator A has matrix elements `Aij = hbar/2` for `i ≠ j` and `Aij = 0` for `i = j`. This gives the matrix:\n`A = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\nThis operator is proportional to the Pauli-X spin matrix.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[-λ, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -λ]]) = λ² - (hbar/2)² = 0`\nThe eigenvalues are `λ₁ = +hbar/2` and `λ₂ = -hbar/2`.\n\nNext, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors.\n*   **For λ₁ = +hbar/2:**\n    `(A - λ₁I)v₁ = 0` => `[[-hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -hbar/2]] * [x, y] = 0`\n    This yields the equation `-x + y = 0`, or `x = y`. The unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, 1]`.\n    Normalizing this gives the eigenvector `|a₁> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1]`, which corresponds to `(1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n\n*   **For λ₂ = -hbar/2:**\n    `(A - λ₂I)v₂ = 0` => `[[hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, hbar/2]] * [x, y] = 0`\n    This yields the equation `x + y = 0`, or `x = -y`. The unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, -1]`.\n    Normalizing this gives the eigenvector `|a₂> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1]`, which corresponds to `(1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Measurement Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue is the squared magnitude of the inner product of the corresponding eigenstate with the system's state `|α>`.\n\n*   **Probability of measuring λ₁ = +hbar/2 (P₁):**\n    `P₁ = |<a₁|α>|²`\n    `<a₁|α> = [(1/sqrt(2)) * (1, 1)] * [(1/sqrt(7)) * (1+i, 2-i)]`\n    `<a₁|α> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [1*(1+i) + 1*(2-i)] = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1 + i + 2 - i) = 3/sqrt(14)`\n    `P₁ = (3/sqrt(14))² = 9/14 ≈ 0.643`\n\n*   **Probability of measuring λ₂ = -hbar/2 (P₂):**\n    `P₂ = |<a₂|α>|²`\n    `<a₂|α> = [(1/sqrt(2)) * (1, -1)] * [(1/sqrt(7)) * (1+i, 2-i)]`\n    `<a₂|α> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [1*(1+i) - 1*(2-i)] = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1 + i - 2 + i) = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)`\n    `P₂ = |(-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1 + 4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357`\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Average (Expectation) Value of the Operator\n\nThe expectation value `<A>` can be calculated in two ways.\n\n*   **Method 1: Using eigenvalues and probabilities**\n    `<A> = P₁*λ₁ + P₂*λ₂`\n    `<A> = (9/14)*(hbar/2) + (5/14)*(-hbar/2) = (hbar/28) * (9 - 5) = 4*hbar/28 = hbar/7`\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the formula `<A> = <α|A|α>`**\n    First, calculate `A|α>`:\n    `A|α> = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]`\n    `A|α> = (hbar / (2*sqrt(7))) * [2-i, 1+i]`\n    Now, calculate the inner product `<α|A|α>`:\n    `<A> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1-i, 2+i] * (hbar / (2*sqrt(7))) * [2-i, 1+i]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [(2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1)] = (hbar/14) * [1 - 3i + 1 + 3i] = (hbar/14) * 2 = hbar/7`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of the operator is `hbar/7`. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
