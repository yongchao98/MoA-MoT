    "To find the numerical value of \"a\", we must use the normalization condition from quantum mechanics. This principle states that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere in all of space must be equal to 1. This is calculated by integrating the square of the modulus of the wave function over the entire space where the particle can exist.\n\nThe given wave function is Ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i. The problem states that the particles are only found in the region between x=1 and x=3.\n\nFirst, we need to find the square of the modulus of the wave function, |Ψ(x)|². For a complex number of the form A + Bi, the modulus squared is A² + B². In this case, the real part is A = a / sqrt(1 + x) and the imaginary part is B = -0.5.\n\nSo, |Ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25.\n\nNext, we set up the normalization integral. The integral of |Ψ(x)|² over the allowed region must equal 1:\n∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nNow, we solve the integral:\n∫(a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = a² * ∫(1 / (1 + x)) dx + ∫0.25 dx\n= a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25x\n\nWe evaluate this definite integral from x=1 to x=3:\n[a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3] - [a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1]\n= [a² * ln(4) + 0.75] - [a² * ln(2) + 0.25]\n= a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5\nUsing the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B), this simplifies to:\n= a² * ln(4/2) + 0.5\n= a² * ln(2) + 0.5\n\nFinally, we set this result equal to 1 and solve for \"a\":\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the value ln(2) ≈ 0.6931:\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931\na² ≈ 0.7214\na ≈ sqrt(0.7214)\na ≈ 0.849\n\nThis value is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<D>>>"
