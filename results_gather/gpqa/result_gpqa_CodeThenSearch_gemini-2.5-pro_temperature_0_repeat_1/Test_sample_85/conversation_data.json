    "This problem requires an understanding of the selectivity of different reducing agents toward various functional groups, specifically carboxylic acids and esters. The final product in both reactions is a lactone (a cyclic ester), which is formed by the intramolecular esterification of a hydroxy acid. The stereochemistry at the 4-position of the lactone is determined by the stereochemistry of the starting material.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\nThe starting material in both cases is a derivative of 3-ethyl-5-oxopentanoic acid, which contains both a carboxylic acid group and an ester group. The two reactions use different reducing agents, leading to different intermediate products and ultimately different stereoisomers of the final lactone.\n\n**Reaction A: Reduction with LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride)**\n\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a selective reducing agent. It readily reduces esters to primary alcohols but does not typically reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  Starting material A, which is (R)- or (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, is treated with LiBH₄.\n    2.  The LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group intact.\n    3.  This forms a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid intermediate.\n    4.  The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization), where the hydroxyl group attacks the carboxylic acid to form the six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The chiral center at the 3-position of the starting material (which becomes the 4-position in the lactone) is not involved in the reaction. Therefore, its configuration is retained. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**Reaction B: Reduction with BH₃ (Borane)**\n\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is a strong reducing agent that shows a high preference for reducing carboxylic acids over esters.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  Starting material B, which is (R)- or (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, is treated with BH₃.\n    2.  The BH₃ will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol, leaving the isobutyl ester group intact.\n    3.  This forms an isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate intermediate.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol to form the six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the stereocenter at the 3-position is unaffected. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### Final Determination\n\nBased on the selectivity of the reducing agents and the stereochemical outcomes:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
