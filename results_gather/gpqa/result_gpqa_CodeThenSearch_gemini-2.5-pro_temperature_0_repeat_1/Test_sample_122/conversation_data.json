    "This problem requires the application of the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n**1. Understand the Frames of Reference:**\n*   **Galaxy's Frame:** This is the \"stationary\" frame of reference.\n*   **Ejecta's Frame:** This is the \"moving\" frame of reference.\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information:**\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is 60,000 km/s.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is 50 seconds. This is the proper time because it's measured by an observer in the same frame as the event.\n\n**3. Determine the Goal:**\n*   Calculate the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n**4. The Physics:**\nAccording to special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object. This effect is called time dilation. The distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is this dilated time multiplied by the object's velocity.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt)**\n\nThe formula for time dilation is:\nΔt = γ * Δt₀\n\nWhere:\n*   **Δt** is the time measured in the stationary frame (Galaxy).\n*   **Δt₀** is the proper time measured in the moving frame (ejecta), which is 50 s.\n*   **γ (gamma)** is the Lorentz factor.\n\nThe Lorentz factor is calculated as:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nFirst, let's find the ratio of the ejecta's velocity to the speed of light (c ≈ 300,000 km/s):\n*   v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n\nNow, calculate the Lorentz factor:\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²)\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04)\n*   γ = 1 / √(0.96)\n*   γ ≈ 1.02062\n\nNow, we can find the time that has passed in the Galaxy's frame:\n*   Δt = γ * Δt₀\n*   Δt ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s\n*   Δt ≈ 51.031 s\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d)**\n\nThe distance is the velocity multiplied by the time measured in the same frame.\n*   d = v * Δt\n*   d = 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s\n*   d ≈ 3,061,860 km\n\nThis result is very close to option A.\n\nAlternatively, we can combine the formulas:\nd = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀) = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)\n*   d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √(1 - 0.2²)\n*   d = 3,000,000 km / √(0.96)\n*   d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798\n*   d ≈ 3,061,862 km\n\nThe calculated distance of approximately 3,061,862 km is closest to 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<A>>>"
