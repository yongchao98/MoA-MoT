    "To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we need to find the ratio of their periods (P₂/P₁). This can be derived from the principles of the radial velocity (RV) method.\n\n### Key Principles:\n\n1.  **Doppler Shift and Radial Velocity:** The periodic shift in the wavelength (Δλ) of a star's spectral line is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) caused by the orbiting planet. Therefore, the amplitude of the radial velocity variation, known as the semi-amplitude (K), is directly proportional to the maximum observed wavelength shift.\n    *   K₁ ∝ 5 miliangstrom\n    *   K₂ ∝ 7 miliangstrom\n    *   This gives the ratio of the semi-amplitudes: K₁/K₂ = 5/7.\n\n2.  **Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude Formula:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by the formula:\n    K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / M_star^(2/3))\n    where:\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   mₚ is the planet's mass.\n    *   M_star is the star's mass.\n    *   i is the orbital inclination.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n### Applying the Principles to the Problem:\n\nWe are given the following information:\n*   The stars have the same mass: M_star₁ = M_star₂.\n*   The planets have similar masses: m_p₁ ≈ m_p₂. In the context of the RV method, this implies that the measured minimum mass (mₚ sin(i)) is similar for both planets.\n*   Both orbits are circular.\n\nBased on these conditions, the term `(2πG)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / M_star^(2/3))` is approximately constant for both systems.\n\nThis simplifies the relationship between the semi-amplitude (K) and the orbital period (P) to:\nK ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\n### Calculation:\n\nWe can establish a ratio between the two systems:\nK₁ / K₂ = (1 / P₁^(1/3)) / (1 / P₂^(1/3)) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital periods (P₂ / P₁), we can rearrange the equation:\nP₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3\n\nNow, we substitute the known ratio of the semi-amplitudes (which is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts):\nP₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)^3\n\nCalculating the final value:\nP₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This value corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
