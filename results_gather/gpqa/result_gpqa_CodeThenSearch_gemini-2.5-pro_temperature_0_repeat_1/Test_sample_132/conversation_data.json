    "To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4³⁻) in the solution, the following steps are taken:\n\n**1. Calculate the Moles of Each Component**\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of moles for each of the phosphate salts dissolved in the solution.\n\n*   **Moles of KH₂PO₄:**\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol of H₂PO₄⁻\n\n*   **Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O:**\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol of HPO₄²⁻\n\n**2. Calculate the Initial Molar Concentrations**\n\nNext, we find the initial concentrations of the dihydrogen phosphate (H₂PO₄⁻) and monohydrogen phosphate (HPO₄²⁻) ions in the 200.00 cm³ (0.200 L) solution.\n\n*   **Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻:**\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n\n*   **Concentration of HPO₄²⁻:**\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**3. Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]**\n\nThe solution is a buffer system composed of the conjugate acid-base pair H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻. The equilibrium for this buffer is governed by the second dissociation constant of phosphoric acid, Ka₂.\n\n*   **Equilibrium:** H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n*   **Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸**\n\nWe can rearrange the equilibrium expression to solve for the hydrogen ion concentration, [H⁺]:\n\n*   Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n*   [H⁺] = Ka₂ * [H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n*   [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M) / (0.02809 M)\n*   [H⁺] ≈ 8.11x10⁻⁸ M\n\n**4. Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]**\n\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the dissociation of the monohydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻). This equilibrium is governed by the third dissociation constant, Ka₃.\n\n*   **Equilibrium:** HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n*   **Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹²**\n\nWe rearrange the equilibrium expression for Ka₃ to solve for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO₄³⁻]:\n\n*   Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n*   [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * [HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺]\n\nNow, we substitute the known values:\n\n*   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M) / (8.11x10⁻⁸ M)\n*   [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is approximately 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<B>>>"
