    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as an extension of the Standard Model, incorporating higher-dimensional operators to parameterize potential new physics at energy scales beyond the electroweak scale. The construction of the SMEFT Lagrangian adheres to certain fundamental symmetries.\n\n1.  **Lorentz and Poincaré Symmetry:** The SMEFT is required to be a Lorentz-invariant local effective field theory. The operators in the SMEFT are constructed from the Standard Model fields in a way that respects the symmetries of the Poincaré group, which includes both Lorentz transformations (boosts and rotations) and spacetime translations. Therefore, both Lorentz and Poincaré symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT.\n\n2.  **CP Symmetry:** The Standard Model itself contains sources of CP violation, and the SMEFT provides a framework to parameterize additional, new sources of CP violation from physics beyond the Standard Model. Consequently, CP symmetry is not a symmetry that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT; in fact, the study of CP-violating operators is a significant area of research within the SMEFT framework.\n\n3.  **CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a fundamental principle in quantum field theory which states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined transformation of charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T). Since the SMEFT is constructed to be a Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, it must respect CPT symmetry.\n\nTherefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<A>>>"
