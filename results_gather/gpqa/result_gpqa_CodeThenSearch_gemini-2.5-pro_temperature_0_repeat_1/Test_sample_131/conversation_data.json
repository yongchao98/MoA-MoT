    "The analysis of the problem and the initial reasoning appear to be correct. The search results confirm the expected NMR patterns for the compounds in question.\n\nHere is a summary of the analysis:\n\n### **1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlets around 6.7 ppm with a 1:1 integration ratio. This means the two compounds in the 1:1 mixture must each contribute an equal number of protons to two different singlet signals. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, each compound must have a singlet in the aromatic region, and the number of protons represented by each singlet must be the same.\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** Three singlets around 2.2 ppm with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. These signals come from the methyl groups.\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Option**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   *Symmetry:* High symmetry.\n    *   *Aromatic Protons:* Two equivalent protons at positions 3 and 6. This will produce **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   *Aliphatic Protons:* Four equivalent methyl groups. This will produce **one singlet** (12H).\n    *   *Chemical Shifts:* Aromatic protons at ~6.89 ppm and methyl protons at ~2.18 ppm.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   *Symmetry:* Lower symmetry.\n    *   *Aromatic Protons:* Two non-equivalent protons at positions 4 and 6. This will produce **two singlets** (1H each).\n    *   *Aliphatic Protons:* Three sets of methyl groups (C1/C3 are equivalent, C2 is unique, C5 is unique). This will produce **three singlets** in a 6H:3H:3H ratio (or 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   *Symmetry:* A plane of symmetry.\n    *   *Aromatic Protons:* Two equivalent protons at positions 5 and 6. This will produce **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   *Aliphatic Protons:* Two sets of equivalent methyl groups (C1/C4 and C2/C3). This will produce **two singlets** in a 6H:6H ratio (or 1:1).\n    *   *Chemical Shifts:* Aromatic protons at ~6.88 ppm and methyl protons at ~2.17 ppm and ~2.24 ppm.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   *Symmetry:* High symmetry.\n    *   *Aromatic Protons:* Four equivalent protons. This will produce **one singlet** (4H).\n    *   *Aliphatic Protons:* The ethyl groups will show coupling. A quartet for the -CH2- group and a triplet for the -CH3 group. This does not match the \"all singlets\" description for the aliphatic region.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixtures**\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would show three aromatic singlets (one 2H signal and two 1H signals), which contradicts the data.\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** This is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene would show a quartet and a triplet, not just singlets, in the aliphatic region.\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would show three aromatic singlets (one 2H signal and two 1H signals), which contradicts the data.\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio** (2H:2H). This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives two 6H singlets. The combination in the mixture gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of **12H:6H:6H**, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that accounts for all the signals and their integration ratios described in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
