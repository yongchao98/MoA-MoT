    "To determine the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we must equate the amplitude of the two signals.\n\n### 1. Brightness Variation from Starspots\n\nThe change in a star's brightness due to spots is caused by the rotational modulation of cooler, darker regions on its surface. The maximum brightness (flux) occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer, while the minimum brightness occurs when the hemisphere with dark spots is in view.\n\nThe flux emitted by a surface is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the flux is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (F ∝ T⁴).\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** When the unspotted hemisphere (temperature T_eff) faces us, the flux is proportional to T_eff⁴.\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** When the spotted hemisphere faces us, 20% of the area (the filling factor, *f*) is at a cooler temperature (T_spot), and the remaining 80% is at the normal temperature (T_eff). The flux is proportional to (1 - *f*) * T_eff⁴ + *f* * T_spot⁴.\n\nThe amplitude of this variation is the fractional drop in flux:\n\nAmplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n\nBy substituting the expressions for flux, this simplifies to:\n\nAmplitude = *f* * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)\n\nGiven the values:\n*   Effective Temperature (T_eff) = 6000 K\n*   Spot Temperature (T_spot) = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n*   Filling Factor (*f*) = 0.20\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n\nAmplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)\nAmplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)\nAmplitude = 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225)\nAmplitude = 0.20 * 0.51775\nAmplitude ≈ 0.10355\n\nSo, the star's brightness varies by approximately 10.36% due to the spotted hemisphere.\n\n### 2. Brightness Variation from an Exoplanet Transit\n\nWhen an exoplanet passes in front of its star, it blocks a portion of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of this transit is equal to the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n\nTransit Depth = (Area_planet / Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n### 3. Equating the Signals\n\nTo find the exoplanet size that mimics the starspot signal, we set the transit depth equal to the amplitude of the spot-induced variation:\n\n(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude\n(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius (R_pl / R_star) by taking the square root:\n\nR_pl / R_star = √0.10355\nR_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis result indicates that a hypothetical planet with a radius of approximately 0.32 times the radius of the star would produce a transit signal with the same amplitude as the variation caused by the starspots.\n\n<<<A>>>"
