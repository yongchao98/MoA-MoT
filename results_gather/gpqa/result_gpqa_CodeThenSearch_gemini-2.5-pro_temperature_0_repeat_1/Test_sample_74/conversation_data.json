  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "To determine why the protein is not being overexpressed, the provided DNA sequence must be analyzed.\n\nThe sequence begins with `ATG`, which is the correct start codon for translation. Following the start codon is the sequence `TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC`. This corresponds to the amino acid sequence YPYDVPDYA, which is the standard sequence for the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag. Therefore, the antigenic determinant sequence is correct and does not contain a missense mutation.\n\nThe key to the problem lies in the codons immediately following the HA tag sequence. Let's analyze the DNA sequence in triplets (codons) from the beginning:\n\n*   **5' ATG** - Start Codon (Methionine)\n*   **TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC** - HA Tag (YPYDVPDYA)\n*   **AAA** - Codes for Lysine\n*   **TGA** - Stop Codon\n\nThe sequence contains a `TGA` codon immediately after the HA tag and a single lysine codon. `TGA` is one of the three stop codons (along with `TAA` and `UAG`) that signal the termination of translation. When the ribosome encounters this premature termination codon (PTC), it releases the mRNA, resulting in a very short, truncated peptide consisting of only the HA tag and one or two other amino acids. The full-length GADD45G protein is never synthesized.\n\nEvaluating the given options:\n*   A) The lack of a linker sequence is not the primary issue. While linkers can be important, the presence of a premature stop codon is a definitive reason for failed expression.\n*   B) The ribosome terminated translation early. This is the correct conclusion, as the `TGA` stop codon halts protein synthesis prematurely.\n*   C) The tRNA for the UAA codon is irrelevant. The stop codon here is TGA, and stop codons are recognized by protein release factors, not tRNAs, to terminate translation.\n*   D) The sequence for the antigenic determinant (HA tag) is correct. The issue arises immediately after it.\n\nTherefore, the presence of a premature stop codon is the reason for the failure to express the full-length protein.\n\n<<<B>>>"
