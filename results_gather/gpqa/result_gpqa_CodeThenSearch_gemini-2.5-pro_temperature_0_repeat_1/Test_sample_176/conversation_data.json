    "The search results confirm the physics principles I used.\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: Luminosity (L) is proportional to the radius squared (R²) and the temperature to the fourth power (T⁴). The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴. This confirms my initial formula for the luminosity ratio: L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴.\n\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law**: The peak emission wavelength (λ_max) is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature (T). The formula is λ_max = b/T. This confirms that temperature can be determined from the peak wavelength.\n\n3.  **Doppler Effect**: The observed wavelength of light is shifted if there is a relative velocity between the source and the observer. For an object moving away (receding), the wavelength is increased (redshifted), and for an object moving towards, it is decreased (blueshifted). The non-relativistic formula for the observed wavelength (λ_obs) in terms of the emitted wavelength (λ_emitted) and radial velocity (v) is λ_obs ≈ λ_emitted * (1 + v/c). A positive velocity conventionally denotes recession.\n\nMy initial reasoning seems correct. The problem states the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same. Star 1 has zero radial velocity, so its observed peak wavelength is its true (rest) peak wavelength. Star 2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, so its observed peak wavelength is Doppler-shifted. Assuming the positive velocity means it is receding, its light is redshifted, meaning its observed wavelength is longer than its emitted wavelength.\n\nLet's re-state the logic:\n*   λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2\n*   v₁ = 0, so λ_obs,1 = λ_emitted,1\n*   v₂ = 700 km/s, so λ_obs,2 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c)\n*   Therefore, λ_emitted,1 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c)\n*   Using Wien's Law (λ_emitted = b/T): b/T₁ = (b/T₂) * (1 + v₂/c)\n*   This simplifies to T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n*   The luminosity ratio is L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n*   Substituting the known values: L₁/L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n*   L₁/L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700,000 / 299,792,458)⁴\n*   L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002335)⁴\n*   L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00937\n*   L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23. The mass information is indeed extraneous, as the mass-luminosity relation is a general trend for main-sequence stars and is not needed when radius and temperature can be determined.\n\nThe calculation is complete and confirmed by the underlying physics principles found in the search results.\n\nFinal check of the calculation:\n(1.5)^2 = 2.25\nv/c = 700 / 299792.458 ≈ 0.00233495\n(1 + v/c) = 1.00233495\n(1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 1.009370\n2.25 / 1.009370 ≈ 2.22906\n\nThe result is robust.\n\nFinal Answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>The problem requires calculating the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The luminosity of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law.\n\n### Key Principles and Formulas:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a spherical black body is given by the formula L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law**: The wavelength at which a black body's radiation is most intense (λ_max) is inversely proportional to its temperature (T). The formula is λ_max = b/T, where b is Wien's constant. This wavelength corresponds to the star's intrinsic color and temperature.\n3.  **Doppler Effect**: When a light source moves relative to an observer, its observed wavelength is shifted. For a source moving away with a radial velocity (v), the observed wavelength (λ_obs) is longer than the emitted wavelength (λ_emitted), an effect known as redshift. For non-relativistic speeds, the formula is λ_obs ≈ λ_emitted * (1 + v/c), where c is the speed of light.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio**: We need to find the ratio L₁ / L₂.\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n2.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂).\n    Therefore, (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n3.  **Temperature Ratio**: The temperature ratio can be found by comparing the peak emission wavelengths. The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same for both stars (λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2).\n\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0 km/s, so there is no Doppler shift. Its observed wavelength is its true emitted wavelength: λ_obs,1 = λ_emitted,1.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. A positive radial velocity conventionally indicates the object is receding. This causes a redshift, so its observed wavelength is longer than its emitted wavelength: λ_obs,2 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2, we have: λ_emitted,1 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n\n4.  **Connecting Wavelength and Temperature**: Using Wien's Law (λ_emitted = b/T), we can substitute temperature into the equation.\n    b/T₁ = (b/T₂) * (1 + v₂/c)\n    1/T₁ = (1/T₂) * (1 + v₂/c)\n    This gives us the temperature ratio: T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: Now, substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation.\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\n    Using the values v₂ = 700 km/s = 7 x 10⁵ m/s and c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s:\n    v₂/c ≈ (7 x 10⁵) / (3 x 10⁸) ≈ 0.002333\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23. The information about the stars' masses is not needed for this calculation.\n\nTherefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<B>>>"
