    "To determine the probability of obtaining 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements, we must follow the principles of quantum mechanics for sequential measurements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1.  **Normalize the Initial State:**\n    The initial state of the system is given by the column matrix `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]`.\n    First, we need to normalize this state. The squared norm is:\n    `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n    The normalized state `|ψ_norm⟩` is:\n    `|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]`\n\n2.  **First Measurement: Operator P**\n    The operator P is represented by the matrix:\n    `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n\n    We need to find the probability of measuring the eigenvalue 0 for P. According to the postulates of quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator. The probability of obtaining a specific eigenvalue is the squared magnitude of the projection of the state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector.\n\n    *   **Find the eigenvector of P for the eigenvalue 0:**\n        We solve the equation `P|v⟩ = 0|v⟩`:\n        `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z] = [0, 0, 0]`\n        This yields the system of equations:\n        *   `y/√2 = 0  => y = 0`\n        *   `x/√2 + z/√2 = 0  => x = -z`\n        An unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, 0, -1]`.\n    *   **Normalize the eigenvector:**\n        The norm is `√(1² + 0² + (-1)²) = √2`.\n        The normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue 0, `|v_P=0⟩`, is:\n        `|v_P=0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`\n    *   **Calculate the probability of measuring P=0:**\n        `Prob(P=0) = |⟨v_P=0|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n        `⟨v_P=0|ψ_norm⟩ = [(1/√2) * (1, 0, -1)] . [(1/√6) * (-1, 2, 1)]`\n        `= (1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1) = -2/√12 = -1/√3`\n        `Prob(P=0) = (-1/√3)² = 1/3`\n\n3.  **State Collapse after the First Measurement**\n    After measuring P and obtaining the value 0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding eigenvector. The new state of the system, `|ψ'⟩`, is:\n    `|ψ'⟩ = |v_P=0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`\n\n4.  **Second Measurement: Operator Q**\n    The operator Q is represented by the matrix:\n    `Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\n    Now, we measure the observable Q on the new state `|ψ'⟩`. We want to find the probability of obtaining the eigenvalue -1.\n\n    *   **Find the eigenvector of Q for the eigenvalue -1:**\n        Since Q is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements (1, 0, -1) and its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. The eigenvector for the eigenvalue -1, `|v_Q=-1⟩`, is:\n        `|v_Q=-1⟩ = [0, 0, 1]`\n    *   **Calculate the probability of measuring Q=-1:**\n        This probability is calculated using the collapsed state `|ψ'⟩`.\n        `Prob(Q=-1) = |⟨v_Q=-1|ψ'⟩|²`\n        `⟨v_Q=-1|ψ'⟩ = [0, 0, 1] . [(1/√2) * (1, 0, -1)]`\n        `= (1/√2) * (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1)) = -1/√2`\n        `Prob(Q=-1) = (-1/√2)² = 1/2`\n\n5.  **Total Probability**\n    The probability of a sequence of independent events is the product of their individual probabilities. The probability of measuring P=0 and then measuring Q=-1 is:\n    `Total Prob = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 after P=0)`\n    `Total Prob = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`\n\nThe probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements is 1/6.\n\n<<<B>>>"
