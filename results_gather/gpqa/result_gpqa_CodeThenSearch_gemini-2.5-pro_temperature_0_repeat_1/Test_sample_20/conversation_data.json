    "### Analysis of the Compounds\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two isomers that can readily interconvert. A common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which typically requires a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (an alpha-hydrogen).\n\n*   **Benzoquinone:** In p-benzoquinone, the carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) groups are part of a double bond system within the ring. These carbons are sp² hybridized and do not have the necessary alpha-hydrogens on a saturated carbon that readily participate in tautomerism. While they have hydrogens, their removal to form a tautomer is energetically highly unfavorable as it would disrupt the conjugated system and create an unstable structure. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has methylene groups (-CH₂-) located between the carbonyl groups. The hydrogens on these carbons are alpha-hydrogens and are particularly acidic because they are adjacent to two carbonyl groups. This allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerization to its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is exceptionally stable because it is aromatic, meaning the equilibrium heavily favors the enol form. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of a chiral molecule is a chiral center, typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure of this molecule is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Because this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism, existing as two enantiomers (R and S forms).\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule has the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the ester groups are in a *trans* configuration across the carbon-carbon double bond. The molecule does not contain any chiral centers. It possesses a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, which makes it an achiral molecule. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
