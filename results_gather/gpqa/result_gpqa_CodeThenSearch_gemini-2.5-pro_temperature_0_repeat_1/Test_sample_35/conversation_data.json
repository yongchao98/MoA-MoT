    "The problem describes an absorption line observed in the spectrum of a very distant object, and asks to identify the corresponding phenomenon within our own galaxy, the Milky Way. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the analysis:\n\n### 1. Identify the Transition by Calculating its Rest Energy\nThe light from an object at a cosmological distance of 2.1 gigaparsecs (Gpc) is stretched by the expansion of the universe. This phenomenon, known as cosmological redshift (z), causes the observed energy of a spectral line to be lower than the energy it had when it was emitted (its rest energy).\n\nFirst, we determine the redshift (z) corresponding to a distance of 2.1 Gpc. While precise calculations require complex cosmological models, a good approximation for this distance is a redshift (z) of about 0.5.\n\nThe relationship between observed energy (E_obs), rest energy (E_rest), and redshift (z) is:\nE_rest = E_obs * (1 + z)\n\nGiven the observed energy of 3.9 µeV (3.9 x 10⁻⁶ eV), we can calculate the rest energy:\nE_rest = 3.9 µeV * (1 + 0.5) = 5.85 µeV\n\nThis calculated rest energy is remarkably close to the well-known energy of the hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen, which is 5.874 µeV. This transition corresponds to a wavelength of 21 cm and is a cornerstone of radio astronomy.\n\n### 2. Characterize the Interstellar Medium\nThe question asks what would be observed with this absorption line *in the Milky Way*. The 21 cm line is produced by neutral hydrogen atoms (HI). Therefore, the absorption is caused by atomic, not molecular, gas. This eliminates options A and B.\n\nNext, we must determine whether the medium is warm or cold. An absorption line is created when a cooler gas is positioned in front of a hotter background source. In the context of the interstellar medium (ISM), 21 cm absorption features are used to trace the Cold Neutral Medium (CNM), which has typical temperatures of about 40 to 200 K. The warmer phase, known as the Warm Neutral Medium (WNM), is more typically observed via its own emission rather than in absorption.\n\nTherefore, the absorption line is characteristic of cold atomic hydrogen.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe observed absorption line, when corrected for cosmological redshift, corresponds to the 21 cm line of neutral atomic hydrogen. In the Milky Way, this absorption feature is a primary indicator of the cold atomic interstellar medium.\n\n<<<C>>>"
