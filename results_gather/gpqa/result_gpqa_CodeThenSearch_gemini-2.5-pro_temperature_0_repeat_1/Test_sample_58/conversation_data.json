    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we must first calculate the moles of the acidic and basic species and then determine which is in excess after neutralization.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of each component\n\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume\n    *   Moles = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol CH3COOH\n\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume\n    *   Moles = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol HCl\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.080 moles of H⁺ ions.\n\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2), a strong base:**\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume\n    *   Moles = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol Ba(OH)2\n    *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that dissociates to yield two hydroxide ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol OH⁻\n\n### Step 2: Perform the neutralization reactions\n\nFirst, the strong base (OH⁻) will react with all available acid. We can sum the moles of acid from both the strong and weak sources.\n\n*   Total moles of acid (H⁺) = Moles from HCl + Moles from CH3COOH\n*   Total moles of acid (H⁺) = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = 0.130 mol\n\nNow, compare the total moles of acid with the total moles of base.\n\n*   Total moles of base (OH⁻) = 0.180 mol\n*   Total moles of acid (H⁺) = 0.130 mol\n\nSince the moles of base are greater than the moles of acid, the base is in excess.\n\n*   Moles of excess OH⁻ = Total OH⁻ - Total H⁺\n*   Moles of excess OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the final concentration and pH\n\nThe final solution contains an excess of a strong base (OH⁻). The pH will be determined by the concentration of these excess hydroxide ions.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   The relationship between pH and pOH at 25°C is pH + pOH = 14.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the resulting solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<D>>>"
