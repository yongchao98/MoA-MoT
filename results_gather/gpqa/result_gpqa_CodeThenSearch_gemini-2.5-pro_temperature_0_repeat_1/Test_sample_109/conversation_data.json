    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, two main criteria must be met: the star's apparent magnitude must be within the detection limits of both instruments, and the star must be geographically visible from both observatories.\n\n### 1. Magnitude Limits\n\nA star's brightness as seen from Earth is measured by its apparent magnitude; lower numbers indicate brighter stars. For a star to be observed by both instruments, it must be brighter than the limiting magnitude of each.\n*   **ESPRESSO (Paranal Observatory):** Can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude brighter than 17 (V < 17).\n*   **HIRES (Keck Observatory):** Can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude brighter than 16 (V < 16).\n\nTherefore, the combined requirement for a star to be detected by both is an **apparent V magnitude (m_V) brighter than 16**.\n\n### 2. Location and Visibility\n\nThe observatories are located in different hemispheres, which restricts their view of the sky.\n*   **Paranal Observatory (VLT):** Located in Chile at a latitude of approximately -24°. It can observe the southern sky and the northern sky up to a declination of about +66°.\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory:** Located in Hawaii at a latitude of about +20°. It can observe the northern sky and the southern sky down to a declination of about -70°.\n\nFor a star to be visible from both locations, its declination (DEC) must be within the range of **-70° < DEC < +66°**.\n\n### Analysis of Each Star\n\nThe apparent magnitude (m_V) is calculated from the absolute magnitude (M_V) and distance (d) in parsecs using the formula: m_V = M_V + 5*log10(d/10) + A_V, where A_V is the absorption due to interstellar dust.\n\n*   **Star1:**\n    *   **Magnitude:** With an absolute magnitude of 15.5 and a distance of 10 parsecs, its apparent magnitude is 15.5. This is brighter than 16.\n    *   **Location:** Its declination is -75°. This is too far south to be visible from Keck Observatory.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star2:**\n    *   **Magnitude:** Its apparent magnitude is given as 16.5. This is fainter than the HIRES limit of 16.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star3:**\n    *   **Magnitude:** Its apparent magnitude is given as 15.5. This is brighter than 16.\n    *   **Location:** Its declination is +48°. This is within the visible range for both observatories.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Observable by both.\n\n*   **Star4:**\n    *   **Magnitude:** With an absolute magnitude of 15.5, a distance of 10 parsecs, and an extinction (A_V) of 1.24 mag (3.1 * 0.4), its apparent magnitude is 16.74. This is fainter than the HIRES limit of 16.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star5:**\n    *   **Magnitude:** With an absolute magnitude of 16.5 and a distance of 5 parsecs, its apparent magnitude is approximately 14.995. This is brighter than 16.\n    *   **Location:** Its declination is +60°. This is within the visible range for both observatories.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Observable by both.\n\nBased on this analysis, only Star3 and Star5 meet both the magnitude and location requirements to be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n\n<<<A>>>"
