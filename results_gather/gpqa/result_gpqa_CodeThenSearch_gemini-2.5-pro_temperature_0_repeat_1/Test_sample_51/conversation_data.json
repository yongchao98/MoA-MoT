    "To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Titanium atoms in two energy levels changes, we can use the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of atoms over various energy states in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n### 1. Understanding the Ratio\nThe population of atoms in different energy levels is dependent on the temperature. The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two different energy levels (level i and level j) as:\n\nNᵢ / Nⱼ = (gᵢ / gⱼ) * exp[-(Eᵢ - Eⱼ) / (k * T)]\n\nHere, gᵢ and gⱼ are the statistical weights of the levels, Eᵢ and Eⱼ are their energies, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nThe problem states that the ratio of the number of atoms in level 1 and level 2 decreases when the star has spots. Spots cause the temperature to decrease from 6000 K to 5500 K. Let's analyze which ratio (N₁/N₂ or N₂/N₁) fits this description. Assume level 2 is the higher energy level (E₂ > E₁).\n\n*   If we consider the ratio R = N₁/N₂, the term -(E₁ - E₂) becomes positive (since E₂ > E₁). As temperature (T) decreases, 1/T increases, the exponent increases, and the ratio R increases. This contradicts the problem statement.\n*   If we consider the ratio R = N₂/N₁, the term -(E₂ - E₁) is negative. As temperature (T) decreases, 1/T increases, the exponent becomes more negative, and the ratio R decreases. This matches the observation that the ratio decreases when spots are present (lower temperature).\n\nTherefore, the ratio in question is R = N₂ / N₁.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Change Factor\nThe question asks for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. This is the ratio of the ratios: R_nospots / R_spots.\n\n*   Temperature without spots (T_nospots) = 6000 K\n*   Temperature with spots (T_spots) = 5500 K\n\nThe ratio of the ratios (F) can be calculated as:\n\nF = R_nospots / R_spots = [exp(-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_nospots))] / [exp(-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_spots))]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nF = exp[ (-(E₂ - E₁)/k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) ]\nF = exp[ ((E₂ - E₁)/k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]\n\n### 3. Determining the Energy Difference\nThe energy difference between the levels (ΔE = E₂ - E₁) can be found from the wavelength (λ) of the transition, which is given as 1448 Å (1.448 x 10⁻⁷ m). The relationship is ΔE = hc/λ, where h is the Planck constant and c is the speed of light.\n\nWe can calculate the term (E₂ - E₁)/k directly:\n\n*   h ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   c ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n*   k ≈ 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n*   λ = 1.448 x 10⁻⁷ m\n\n(E₂ - E₁)/k = (h * c) / (λ * k)\n(E₂ - E₁)/k ≈ (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ * 3.00 x 10⁸) / (1.448 x 10⁻⁷ * 1.381 x 10⁻²³)\n(E₂ - E₁)/k ≈ 99420 K\n\n### 4. Final Calculation\nNow, substitute the values back into the equation for the factor F:\n\nF = exp[ 99420 * (1/5500 - 1/6000) ]\nF = exp[ 99420 * ((12 - 11) / 66000) ]\nF = exp[ 99420 / 66000 ]\nF = exp[ 1.506 ]\nF ≈ 4.508\n\nThis value is approximately 4.5.\n\nThe ratio of the populations of the two energy levels is about 4.5 times higher when the star has no spots (T=6000 K) compared to when it is 40% covered by spots (T=5500 K).\n\n<<<D>>>"
