    "To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we first need to identify the color of the light it emits. The energy of the emitted light is given as 2.3393 eV.\n\nFirst, we calculate the wavelength of the emitted light using the formula E = hc/λ, where E is energy, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. A useful conversion for this calculation is hc ≈ 1240 eV·nm.\n\nWavelength (λ) = hc / E\nλ ≈ 1240 eV·nm / 2.3393 eV\nλ ≈ 530 nm\n\nNext, we determine the color corresponding to a wavelength of 530 nm. According to the visible light spectrum, a wavelength of 530 nm falls within the green range (approximately 495–570 nm). Therefore, the textile dye emits green light.\n\nThe color that a substance absorbs is the complementary color to the color it reflects or emits. The complementary color of green is red. Thus, the organic compound absorbs red light.\n\n<<<A>>>"
