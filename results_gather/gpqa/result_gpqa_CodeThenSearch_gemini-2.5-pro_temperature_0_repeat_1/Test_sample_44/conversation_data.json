    "### System of Four Spin-1/2 Particles in a 1D Infinite Potential Well\n\nFor a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the energy levels for a single particle are quantized and are given by the formula:\n\n*E<sub>n</sub>* = *n*² *π*² *ħ*² / (2*m*L²)\n\nwhere:\n- *n* is the principal quantum number (*n* = 1, 2, 3, ...)\n- *ħ* is the reduced Planck constant\n- *m* is the mass of the particle\n- *L* is the length of the well\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit E as:\n\nE = *π*² *ħ*² / (2*m*L²)\n\nTherefore, the energy of a single particle in the *n*-th level can be expressed as:\n\n*E<sub>n</sub>* = *n*²E\n\nThe particles in the system are identical spin-1/2 particles, which means they are fermions. According to the Pauli exclusion principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. For a particle in a 1D box, a quantum state is defined by the principal quantum number *n* and the spin quantum number *m<sub>s</sub>*, which can be +1/2 (spin up) or -1/2 (spin down). Consequently, each energy level *n* can accommodate a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n#### Ground State Energy\n\nTo determine the ground state of the four-particle system, we fill the lowest available energy levels in accordance with the Pauli exclusion principle:\n- **n = 1 level:** Can hold two particles (one spin up, one spin down). The energy of these two particles is 2 × *E*₁ = 2 × (1²E) = 2E.\n- **n = 2 level:** Can hold the remaining two particles (one spin up, one spin down). The energy of these two particles is 2 × *E*₂ = 2 × (2²E) = 2 × 4E = 8E.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n**Ground State Energy = 2E + 8E = 10E**\n\n#### First Excited State Energy\n\nTo find the energy of the first excited state, we move one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the lowest unoccupied energy level. In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2 and the lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n- The configuration becomes: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n- The energies of the particles in this configuration are:\n    - Two particles in n=1: 2 × *E*₁ = 2 × (1²E) = 2E.\n    - One particle in n=2: 1 × *E*₂ = 1 × (2²E) = 4E.\n    - One particle in n=3: 1 × *E*₃ = 1 × (3²E) = 9E.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n**First Excited State Energy = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E**\n\n#### Second Excited State Energy\n\nThe second excited state is the next lowest energy configuration possible after the first excited state. We must consider the different ways to excite the system from the ground state that result in a higher energy than the first excited state.\n\n1.  **Exciting one particle from n=1 to n=3:**\n    - Configuration: one particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    - Total Energy = (1 × 1²E) + (2 × 2²E) + (1 × 3²E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n\n2.  **Exciting two particles from n=2 to n=3:**\n    - Configuration: two particles in n=1 and two particles in n=3.\n    - Total Energy = (2 × 1²E) + (2 × 3²E) = 2E + 18E = **20E**.\n\n3.  **Exciting one particle from n=2 to n=4:**\n    - Configuration: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=4.\n    - Total Energy = (2 × 1²E) + (1 × 2²E) + (1 × 4²E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = **22E**.\n\nComparing these possible energies, the lowest energy level above the first excited state (15E) is 18E.\n\n**Second Excited State Energy = 18E**\n\nThus, the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\n<<<D>>>"
