    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Reaction**\nFirst, we need to dissolve iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, which is a base, using a strong monobasic acid (like HCl or HNO₃), which provides H⁺ ions. The neutralization reaction is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n**2. Calculate the Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\nWe need the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ to find out how many moles are in 0.1 g.\n*   The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is approximately 106.87 g/mol.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 moles.\n\n**3. Calculate the Moles of Acid Needed for the Reaction**\nFrom the balanced chemical equation, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺ ions.\n*   Moles of H⁺ for reaction = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n*   Moles of H⁺ for reaction = 3 × 0.0009357 mol ≈ 0.002807 moles.\n\n**4. Account for the Final pH of the Solution**\nAfter the Fe(OH)₃ has been neutralized, some excess H⁺ ions must remain in the solution to give it its final acidic pH. The total amount of acid added must cover both the neutralization and this final acidity.\n\nTotal Moles of H⁺ Added = (Moles of H⁺ for reaction) + (Moles of H⁺ remaining in solution)\n\nWe can test each of the given options to see which one is consistent with this principle. Let's analyze option D.\n\n**5. Test Option D: pH = 2.69; Volume = 30.09 cm³**\n\n*   **Calculate moles of H⁺ remaining in the solution:**\n    *   Final pH = 2.69\n    *   Final concentration of H⁺, [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻².⁶⁹ mol/L ≈ 0.002042 M.\n    *   Total solution volume = 100 cm³ = 0.1 L.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ remaining = [H⁺] × Total Volume = 0.002042 mol/L × 0.1 L ≈ 0.0002042 moles.\n\n*   **Calculate the total moles of H⁺ that must have been added:**\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = (Moles for reaction) + (Moles remaining)\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 + 0.0002042 = 0.0030112 moles.\n\n*   **Calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid required to provide this many moles:**\n    *   The acid has a concentration of 0.1 mol/L.\n    *   Volume (L) = Total Moles / Concentration\n    *   Volume (L) = 0.0030112 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.030112 L.\n    *   Volume (cm³) = 0.030112 L × 1000 cm³/L = 30.11 cm³.\n\nThe calculated volume of 30.11 cm³ is extremely close to the volume of 30.09 cm³ given in option D. The minor difference is due to rounding of constants during the calculation. Checking the other options reveals significant inconsistencies between the given pH and the calculated volume.\n\nAdditionally, for the iron to stay dissolved, the ion product Q = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ must be less than the solubility product constant, Ksp (which is on the order of 10⁻³⁹). A pH of 2.69 is sufficiently acidic to prevent the Fe(OH)₃ from precipitating back out of the solution, especially when considering the hydrolysis of the aqueous Fe³⁺ ion.\n\n<<<D>>>"
