    "To determine the approximate ratio of neutrino fluxes, we must first understand which nuclear reactions produce neutrinos in the specified energy bands and how the hypothetical shutdown of the pp-III branch affects them.\n\n### Neutrino Sources and Energy Bands\n\n*   **Band 1 (700-800 keV):** The primary source of neutrinos in this energy range is from the decay of Boron-8 (⁸B). This decay produces neutrinos with a continuous energy spectrum that extends up to about 14-15 MeV. Other sources like 'pp' neutrinos are below this energy range (up to ~420 keV), and 'pep' neutrinos are well above it (~1.44 MeV).\n*   **Band 2 (800-900 keV):** This energy band has two main contributors:\n    1.  The continuous spectrum from the decay of **Boron-8 (⁸B)**, just as in band 1.\n    2.  A strong, monoenergetic neutrino line at **861 keV** (0.861 MeV) from the electron capture of Beryllium-7 (⁷Be).\n\n### The Role of the pp-III Branch\n\nThe proton-proton (pp) chain has several branches. The crucial point is identifying which reaction belongs to which branch:\n*   The **pp-III branch** is the sequence of reactions that produces **Boron-8 (⁸B)**.\n*   The **pp-II branch** is the sequence that involves the electron capture on **Beryllium-7 (⁷Be)**, producing the 861 keV neutrinos.\n\n### Impact of the Hypothetical Shutdown\n\nThe problem states that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped. This has a direct consequence:\n*   The production of **⁸B ceases**, and therefore the flux of neutrinos from ⁸B decay across its entire energy spectrum drops to zero.\n\nHowever, all other reactions, including the pp-II branch, remain as they were. This means:\n*   The production of **⁷Be neutrinos continues** unaffected.\n\n### Calculating the New Flux Ratio\n\nWith the pp-III branch turned off, let's re-evaluate the flux in each band:\n\n*   **Flux (band 1: 700-800 keV):** This band was almost exclusively populated by ⁸B neutrinos. With their source gone, the flux in this band becomes essentially zero.\n*   **Flux (band 2: 800-900 keV):** This band originally contained contributions from both ⁸B and ⁷Be neutrinos. After the shutdown, the ⁸B component disappears, but the strong flux from the 861 keV ⁷Be neutrinos remains.\n\nTherefore, the ratio is:\n\nFlux (band 1) / Flux (band 2) ≈ 0 / (Flux from ⁷Be neutrinos) ≈ 0\n\nLooking at the given options, the value that best approximates zero is 0.01.\n\n<<<C>>>"
