    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], we first need to calculate the fraction of each cobalt-containing species in the solution. The formation of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes can be described by the following equilibria and their overall stability constants (β):\n\n*   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺ ; β₁ = 9\n*   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂] ; β₂ = 40\n*   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ ; β₃ = 63\n*   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ ; β₄ = 16\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co(II) ion and all the complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co²⁺], the thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻], and the respective stability constants. Since the total cobalt concentration (10⁻² M) is significantly lower than the thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M), we can assume that the concentration of free thiocyanate at equilibrium is approximately equal to its initial concentration, so [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M.\n\nThe fraction (αₙ) of each cobalt species can be calculated using the following general formula, which is derived from the stability constant expressions:\nαₙ = (βₙ[SCN⁻]ⁿ) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\nwhere β₀ is defined as 1.\n\nWe are interested in the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which corresponds to n=2.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the denominator (the sum of all terms), which we'll call Σ:\nΣ = 1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴\nΣ = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.1²) + (63 × 0.1³) + (16 × 0.1⁴)\nΣ = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.01) + (63 × 0.001) + (16 × 0.0001)\nΣ = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nΣ = 2.3646\n\nNext, we calculate the term for the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex in the numerator:\nTerm for [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n\nNow, we can calculate the fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]:\nFraction of [Co(SCN)₂] = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / Σ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] ≈ 0.16916 × 100% = 16.916%\n\nThis value is closest to 16.9%.\n\n<<<B>>>"
