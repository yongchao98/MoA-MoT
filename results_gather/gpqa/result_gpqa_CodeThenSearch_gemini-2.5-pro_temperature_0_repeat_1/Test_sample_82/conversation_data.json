    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.\n\n### 1. Initial Dilution of Acetic Acid\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid (V1) = 20.00 cm³\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M1) = 0.05 M\n*   Final volume (V2) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   Using the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2:\n    M2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n\nThe concentration of the diluted acetic acid to be titrated is **0.025 M**.\n\n### 2. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (CH₃COOH) has been neutralized by the NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This creates a buffer solution.\n\n*   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used to find the pH of a buffer solution:\n    pH = pKa + log (\\[A⁻]/\\[HA])\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of the conjugate base \\[A⁻] to the weak acid \\[HA] is 25% to 75%, or 1:3.\n*   Now, plug these values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    pH = 4.73 + log(25/75)\n    pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n    pH ≈ 4.26\n\nThe pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n\n### 3. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to sodium acetate. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻), which is a weak base.\n\n*   **Step 1: Find the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.**\n    *   Moles of acid = M_acid * V_acid = 0.025 mol/L * 0.040 L = 0.001 mol\n    *   Volume of base = Moles of acid / M_base = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion at the equivalence point.**\n    *   Total volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n    *   Concentration of acetate \\[CH₃COO⁻] = Moles of acetate / Total volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the pH from the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.**\n    *   The hydrolysis reaction is: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for the acetate ion.\n        Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    *   Set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis:\n        Kb = \\[[CH₃COOH]\\[OH⁻]] / \\[CH₃COO⁻]\n        5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    *   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n        5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02\n        x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 ≈ 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n        x = √1.082 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n    *   Here, x represents the concentration of hydroxide ions, \\[OH⁻].\n    *   Calculate the pOH:\n        pOH = -log(\\[OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   Calculate the pH:\n        pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 ≈ 8.52\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated pH values are **4.26** at 25% titration and **8.52** at the equivalence point. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
