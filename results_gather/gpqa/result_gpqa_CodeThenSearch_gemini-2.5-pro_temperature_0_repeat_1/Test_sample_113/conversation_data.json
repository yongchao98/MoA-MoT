    "The correct reagents for the given reactions are selected based on established chemical principles for cyanohydrin formation and nitrile hydrolysis.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis reaction is a nucleophilic addition known as cyanohydrin formation. The reaction requires a source of cyanide ions (NaCN) and a proton source to protonate the intermediate alkoxide ion. An acidic workup, represented by H3O+, provides the necessary proton to form the final hydroxyl group of the cyanohydrin. Therefore, reagent **A** is **H3O+**.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation can be achieved under either acidic or basic conditions. For acidic hydrolysis, the nitrile is typically heated with a strong mineral acid, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl). This process converts the nitrile into a carboxylic acid and an ammonium salt. Therefore, reagent **B** is **HCl**.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   **A = H3O+**\n*   **B = HCl**\n\nThis combination corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
