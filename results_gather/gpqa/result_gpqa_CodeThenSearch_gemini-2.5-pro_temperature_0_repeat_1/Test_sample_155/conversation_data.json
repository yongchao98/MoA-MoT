    "The analysis of the chemical reactions and the resulting products is correct.\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** The treatment of (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA results in a syn-addition epoxidation, forming a racemic mixture of the trans-epoxide. The subsequent acid-catalyzed ring-opening is an anti-addition, which leads to the formation of a single, achiral meso-compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This overall process is known as anti-dihydroxylation.\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** The treatment of (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA also undergoes syn-addition to form the corresponding cis-epoxide, which is a meso compound. The subsequent acid-catalyzed anti-addition ring-opening of this meso epoxide results in a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\nThe combined product mixture therefore contains three stereoisomers: the meso-diol from Reaction 1, and the pair of enantiomeric diols from Reaction 2.\n\nThe chromatographic separation of this mixture is as follows:\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** An achiral stationary phase cannot distinguish between enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. However, it can separate diastereomers, which have different physical properties. In this case, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, the meso compound will elute as one peak, and the two enantiomers will co-elute as a second peak. This results in a total of **two peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** A chiral stationary phase creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers. It interacts differently with each enantiomer, leading to different retention times. The column will also separate the meso compound from the enantiomers, as it is a diastereomer. Consequently, all three stereoisomers in the mixture—the meso compound, the (4R,4R)-enantiomer, and the (4S,5S)-enantiomer—will be resolved into distinct peaks. This results in a total of **three peaks**.\n\nTherefore, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<B>>>"
