    "To determine the number of optically active compounds, we must assess each one for chirality. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This usually occurs when a molecule has a chiral center and lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is the analysis of each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule is an alkene. Due to the double bond, the atoms connected to it lie in the same plane. This planarity creates a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name of this complex bridged-ring compound includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS, E). These descriptors specify a single, distinct stereoisomer. Such complex molecules with defined chiral centers are chiral and thus optically active.\n\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the (2R, 3S) configuration results in a meso compound. Meso compounds contain chiral centers but are achiral overall because they possess an internal plane of symmetry that makes them superimposable on their mirror image. Therefore, it is optically inactive.\n\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is a diastereomer of the meso form above. The (2R, 3R) configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. This molecule is one of a pair of enantiomers (the other being 2S, 3S) and is therefore chiral and optically active.\n\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The (R) designation indicates a specific configuration at the chiral center, which is carbon 1 (the carbon bearing the -OH group). The presence of this single, defined chiral center in a molecule that does not have other elements of symmetry to cancel it out makes it a single enantiomer, which is optically active.\n\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** This compound, also known as cis,cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, has hydroxyl groups on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. Despite having three chiral centers (carbons 1, 3, and 5), the molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane can pass through one hydroxyl group and the opposing CH2 group. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** The structure of this ketone is (CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl. An examination of the structure reveals no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups. The carbon in the `(CH3)2CH` group is attached to two identical methyl groups and is not a chiral center. Consequently, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nIn summary, the following three compounds will exhibit optical activity:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nTherefore, 3 of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<D>>>"
