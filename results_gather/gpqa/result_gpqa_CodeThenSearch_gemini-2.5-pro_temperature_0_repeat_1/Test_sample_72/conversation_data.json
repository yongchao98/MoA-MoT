    "To solve this problem, we will first calculate the relative speed of the two astronauts and then determine the total energy of the system.\n\n### Relative Speed (v_rel)\n\nTo find the relative speed between the two astronauts, we must use the relativistic velocity addition formula, as they are traveling at speeds close to the speed of light. The formula for the relative velocity (v_rel) of two objects moving in the same direction with velocities v1 and v2 is:\n\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c²)\n\nGiven:\n*   v1 = 0.6c\n*   v2 = 0.5c\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3c² / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\n**v_rel ≈ 0.14c**\n\n### Total Energy (E)\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the equation E = γmc², where γ (the Lorentz factor) is 1 / √(1 - v²/c²). The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies of the two astronauts.\n\n**Astronaut 1:**\n*   Mass (m1) = 2m\n*   Velocity (v1) = 0.6c\n*   Lorentz factor (γ1) = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √0.64 = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n*   Energy (E1) = γ1 * m1 * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²\n\n**Astronaut 2:**\n*   Mass (m2) = 3m\n*   Velocity (v2) = 0.5c\n*   Lorentz factor (γ2) = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √0.75 ≈ 1.1547\n*   Energy (E2) = γ2 * m2 * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.464 mc²\n\n**Total System Energy:**\n*   E_total = E1 + E2\n*   E_total = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc²\n*   **E_total ≈ 5.96 mc²**\n\nComparing our calculated values (v_rel ≈ 0.14c and E ≈ 5.96 mc²) with the given options, we find that option C is the correct choice.\n\n<<<C>>>"
