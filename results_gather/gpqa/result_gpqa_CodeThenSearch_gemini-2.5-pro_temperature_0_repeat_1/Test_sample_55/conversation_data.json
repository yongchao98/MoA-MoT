    "The decay of a hydrogen atom from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via a two-dipole transition follows specific quantum mechanical selection rules and associated probabilities.\n\n### 1. Determine the Allowed Transition Path\n\nFor an electric dipole transition, the quantum numbers must change according to the following selection rules:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l$, must be $\\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m$, must be $0, \\pm 1$.\n\nThe decay process occurs in two steps:\n\n**Step 1: Transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to an intermediate state $|2,l',m'\\rangle$**\n*   **Initial state:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   **Change in $l$:** Since the initial state has $l=0$, the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ dictates that the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n*   **Change in $m$:** The initial state has $m=0$. The selection rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' = 0, +1,$ or $-1$.\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Transition from the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   **Final state:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   **Change in $l$:** The intermediate state has $l'=1$. To reach the final state with $l=0$, the change must be $\\Delta l = -1$, which is an allowed transition.\n*   **Change in $m$:** The final state has $m=0$. This is an allowed transition from any of the possible intermediate states:\n    *   From $|2,1,0\\rangle$: $\\Delta m = 0$.\n    *   From $|2,1,1\\rangle$: $\\Delta m = -1$.\n    *   From $|2,1,-1\\rangle$: $\\Delta m = +1$.\n\nAll three pathways are permitted by the selection rules.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Transition Probability\n\nThe probability of a specific decay route is determined by the branching ratios of each step.\n\n*   **First step branching ratio:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the three degenerate intermediate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. The probability, or branching ratio, for transitioning to any one of these specific states is therefore $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Second step branching ratio:** From any of the intermediate $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only possible electric dipole transition to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Therefore, the branching ratio for this step is 1.\n\nThe total probability for any single, complete cascade route is the product of the branching ratios of its individual steps. For the route passing through $|2,1,0\\rangle$:\n\n$P = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n$P = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nThis same probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$ applies to the other two possible routes as well.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n*   A) Path is possible, but probability is $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect).\n*   B) Path is possible, but probability is $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect).\n*   C) Path is possible, but probability is $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect).\n*   D) The path $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is possible and the calculated probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct).\n\n<<<D>>>"
