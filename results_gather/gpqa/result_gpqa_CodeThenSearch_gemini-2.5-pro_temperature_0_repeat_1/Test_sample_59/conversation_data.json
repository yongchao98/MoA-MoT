    "To determine how long the journey will take from the astronaut's perspective, we need to apply the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. Here is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n**1. Determine the Distance:**\nThe Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. Its distance from Earth is estimated to be between 160,000 and 163,000 light-years. For this calculation, we will use the commonly cited figure of approximately 160,000 light-years.\n\n**2. Calculate Travel Time from Earth's Perspective:**\nFirst, we calculate the time it would take for the spacecraft to reach Earth as measured by an observer on Earth.\n\n*   **Distance (d):** 160,000 light-years\n*   **Speed (v):** 0.99999987 *c* (where *c* is the speed of light)\n\nThe time (t) is the distance divided by the speed:\nt = 160,000 light-years / 0.99999987 *c*\n\nSince a light-year is the distance light travels in one year, the calculation is approximately:\nt ≈ 160,000.02 years\n\nFrom an observer on Earth's point of view, the journey takes just over 160,000 years.\n\n**3. Calculate Time from the Astronaut's Perspective (Proper Time):**\nDue to the effects of time dilation, time passes more slowly for the astronaut traveling at near the speed of light. The formula for time dilation is:\n\nt₀ = t * √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nWhere:\n*   t₀ is the time experienced by the astronaut (proper time).\n*   t is the time measured by the observer on Earth.\n*   v is the velocity of the spacecraft.\n*   c is the speed of light.\n\nLet's calculate the term √(1 - v²/c²):\n*   v/c = 0.99999987\n*   (v/c)² = 0.9999997400000169\n*   1 - (v/c)² = 0.0000002599999831\n*   √(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 0.0005099\n\nNow, we can find the time experienced by the astronaut:\nt₀ ≈ 160,000.02 years * 0.0005099 ≈ 81.58 years\n\nThis means that while over 160,000 years have passed on Earth, the astronaut will have experienced approximately 81.6 years.\n\n**4. Determine the Astronaut's Age and Final Answer:**\nThe astronaut was 22 years old at the start of the journey. Adding the travel time from their perspective:\n\nFinal Age = 22 years + 81.6 years = 103.6 years\n\nSince the astronaut's average lifespan is 150 years, they will survive the journey. The time it takes for the astronaut to reach Earth from their point of view is approximately 81 years.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth. (Incorrect)\nB) 77 years (Incorrect)\nC) 72 years (Incorrect)\nD) 81 years (Correct)\n\n<<<D>>>"
