    "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, let's analyze each option:\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This describes a planet with the same density as Earth. The average density of Earth is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly stated as about 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** For a planet with an identical composition to Earth, a significantly larger mass will result in greater gravitational compression of its materials. This compression increases the planet's overall density. Therefore, this planet's density will be greater than Earth's density of 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Conversely, a planet with the same composition but a smaller mass will experience less gravitational compression. This results in an overall density that is lower than Earth's.\n\n**Comparison:**\n\n*   Planet (a) has a density of ~5.51 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (b) has a density of ~5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (c) has a density greater than 5.51 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (d) has a density less than 5.51 g/cm³.\n\nBased on this analysis, the planet described in option (c) will have the highest density.\n\n<<<C>>>"
