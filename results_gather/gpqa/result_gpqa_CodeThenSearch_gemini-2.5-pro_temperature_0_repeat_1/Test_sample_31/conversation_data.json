    "To determine the total energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus traveling at 0.96c, we will use the principles of special relativity.\n\n### 1. Identify the Nucleus and its Properties\nThe nucleus X is specified as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n*   Lithium has an atomic number (Z) of 3, which means it has 3 protons.\n*   With 3 neutrons (N), the mass number (A) is Z + N = 3 + 3 = 6.\n*   Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 ($^{6}_{3}Li$).\n\n### 2. Determine the Rest Mass (m₀)\nThe rest mass of the nucleus is required for the calculation. Based on experimental data, the nuclide mass of a Lithium-6 nucleus is approximately 6.0134771 atomic mass units (u).\n\n### 3. Convert Rest Mass to Energy (E₀ = m₀c²)\nThe rest energy (E₀) is the rest mass (m₀) multiplied by the speed of light squared (c²). We need to convert the mass from atomic mass units (u) to energy in Giga-electron Volts (GeV).\n*   The conversion factor is approximately 1 u = 931.5 MeV/c² or 0.9315 GeV/c².\n*   Rest Energy E₀ = 6.0134771 u * 0.9315 GeV/c² / u\n*   E₀ ≈ 5.6015 GeV\n\n### 4. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)\nThe Lorentz factor (gamma) accounts for relativistic effects at high speeds. It is calculated based on the velocity (v).\n*   Given speed v = 0.96c.\n*   The formula for the Lorentz factor is: γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96c)²/c²)\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\n*   γ = 1 / √(0.0784)\n*   γ = 1 / 0.28\n*   γ ≈ 3.5714\n\n### 5. Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E)\nThe total energy of the moving nucleus is the product of its rest energy and the Lorentz factor.\n*   The formula for total energy is: E = γ * E₀ = γ * m₀c²\n*   E ≈ 3.5714 * 5.6015 GeV\n*   E ≈ 20.005 GeV\n\nThis calculated value (20.005 GeV) is very close to option B. The small discrepancy can arise from using slightly different values for physical constants. For instance, if the calculation is performed by summing the individual masses of the 3 protons and 3 neutrons (ignoring the mass defect from binding energy), the result is approximately 20.12 GeV, which aligns even more closely with option B. Given the choices, 20.132 GeV is the intended answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
