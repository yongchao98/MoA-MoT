    "To determine which of the given organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we need to identify which molecules are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common sources of chirality in organic molecules are chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) and axial chirality (as seen in some substituted biphenyls).\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls can exhibit a type of chirality called atropisomerism if the rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is restricted. This typically happens when there are large, bulky substituents in the ortho positions (the 2, 2', 6, and 6' positions). In this compound, the nitro groups (-NO2) at the 6 and 6' positions and the dimethyl dicarboxylate groups (-COOCH3) at the 2 and 2' positions are large enough to prevent free rotation. This restricted rotation leads to two stable, non-superimposable mirror-image conformations (enantiomers). Therefore, this compound is optically active.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule has a central carbon atom (the second carbon in the propanoate chain) that is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are chiral and therefore optically active (unless they are part of a racemic mixture).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The central carbon atom in benzophenone is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. To be a chiral center, a carbon must be bonded to four *different* groups. Since this carbon is only bonded to three groups and two of them are identical (phenyl groups), it is not a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is achiral because it has a plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image. While it can crystallize into chiral solids, the individual molecule is not chiral.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of inversion symmetry, which makes it achiral. It does not have any chiral centers and is superimposable on its mirror image, so it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are optically active.\n\n<<<B>>>"
