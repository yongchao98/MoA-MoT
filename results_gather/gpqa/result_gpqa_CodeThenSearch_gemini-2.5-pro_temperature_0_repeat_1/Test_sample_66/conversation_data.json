    "The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, of two electrons and obtaining the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for both.\n\nThe state of the 2-electron system is given in the coupled angular momentum basis as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. Here, $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for the two electrons (since they are in p orbitals). The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$, and the quantum number for its z-component is $m=-1$.\n\nTo find the probability of a specific outcome for measurements of the individual components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, we need to express the given coupled state in the uncoupled basis, which is denoted by $|l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2\\rangle$. The probability of measuring the eigenvalues $m_1\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ and $m_2\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ is the square of the absolute value of the projection of the system's state onto the corresponding uncoupled state.\n\nThe transformation between the coupled and uncoupled bases is defined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The coupled state can be written as a linear combination of uncoupled states:\n$|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} \\langle l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle |l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2\\rangle$\n\nWe are interested in the probability of measuring $L_{1z} = -\\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\\hbar$. This corresponds to the final state where $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. The probability is given by:\n$P(m_1=-1, m_2=-1) = |\\langle 1, -1, 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe term $\\langle 1, -1, 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. A fundamental selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, $\\langle l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$, is that they are non-zero only if the magnetic quantum numbers sum correctly: $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- The total magnetic quantum number of the coupled state: $m = -1$.\n- The individual magnetic quantum numbers of the desired measurement outcome: $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\nLet's check the sum:\n$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\nSince $m_1 + m_2 = -2$ is not equal to $m = -1$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1, 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ is zero.\n\nTherefore, the probability of finding the system in the state with $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ is:\n$P(m_1=-1, m_2=-1) = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nThis means it is impossible to measure the z-component of the orbital angular momentum for both electrons to be $-\\hbar$ when the total system is in the state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
