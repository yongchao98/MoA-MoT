    "The correct sequence of reagents to synthesize the target molecule from ethynylcyclohexane is given in option B. The name \"1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde\" is likely an error for the actual product of this reaction sequence, which is 3-cyclohexyl-3-hydroxypropanal. The chemical pathway is the most logical among the choices.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the synthesis outlined in option B:\n\n1.  **Step 1: NaNH₂, methyl chloride**\n    *   Ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne, meaning it has an acidic proton on the triple-bonded carbon.\n    *   Sodium amide (NaNH₂) is a very strong base that deprotonates the alkyne to form a sodium acetylide salt.\n    *   This acetylide ion is a potent nucleophile and reacts with methyl chloride in an alkylation reaction to form 1-cyclohexylpropyne.\n\n2.  **Step 2: H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**\n    *   The internal alkyne, 1-cyclohexylpropyne, is then reduced.\n    *   H₂ with a palladium-calcium carbonate catalyst (Lindlar's catalyst) is used for the partial hydrogenation of an alkyne to a *cis*-alkene. This step produces *cis*-1-cyclohexylpropene.\n\n3.  **Step 3: O₃/ (CH₃)₂S**\n    *   This step is an ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup.\n    *   Ozone (O₃) cleaves the double bond of *cis*-1-cyclohexylpropene.\n    *   The subsequent treatment with dimethyl sulfide ((CH₃)₂S) works up the intermediate ozonide to produce two carbonyl compounds without further oxidation. The products are cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and acetaldehyde.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Ba(OH)₂**\n    *   This final step is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation.\n    *   Barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂) acts as a base to deprotonate acetaldehyde at its alpha-carbon, forming an enolate.\n    *   This enolate then nucleophilically attacks the carbonyl carbon of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n    *   The resulting product, after protonation, is a β-hydroxy aldehyde: 3-cyclohexyl-3-hydroxypropanal.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n*   **A)** Methanol would neutralize the NaNH₂ and prevent the initial alkylation.\n*   **C)** H₂/Pd would fully reduce the alkyne to an alkane, which is unreactive to the subsequent reagents.\n*   **D)** Ozonolysis with an H₂O workup is oxidative and would produce carboxylic acids instead of the aldehydes needed for the aldol reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
