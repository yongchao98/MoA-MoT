    "The structure of the major isomer of product 3 is determined by the stereochemical course of the three-step reaction sequence. A detailed analysis of each step reveals the specific stereochemistry of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclooctatetraene and Maleic Anhydride**\nThis reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition. Cyclooctatetraene acts as the diene and maleic anhydride is the dienophile. Due to steric hindrance from the non-reacting part of the cyclooctatetraene ring, the reaction proceeds to form the *exo*-adduct as the major product.\n\n**Step 2: Esterification**\nThe anhydride product from the first step is heated with methanol and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid. This is an acid-catalyzed esterification that opens the anhydride ring to form two methyl ester groups. This reaction does not change the stereochemistry of the ring system. Since the starting anhydride was a *cis*-dienophile, the resulting two ester groups are also in a *cis* relationship to each other.\n\n**Step 3: Second Diels-Alder Reaction**\nThe diester formed in step 2 reacts with cyclopentadiene in another Diels-Alder reaction. In this step, the diester acts as the dienophile, specifically at the strained double bond within its cyclobutene ring. Cyclopentadiene acts as the diene. The stereochemical outcome of this step is governed by two factors:\n*   **Facial Selectivity**: The large ester groups on the *exo* face of the molecule sterically hinder the approach of the cyclopentadiene from that side. Therefore, the cyclopentadiene adds to the opposite face, a process known as *anti*-attack.\n*   **Endo/Exo Selectivity**: As with most Diels-Alder reactions, there is a preference for the *endo* transition state due to favorable secondary orbital interactions.\n\nCombining these outcomes, the major isomer of the final product (Product 3) is the one resulting from *exo* addition in the first step, followed by an *anti-endo* addition in the third step.\n\n**Identifying the Correct Structure**\nThe options provided are different stereoisomers of the final product.\n*   **Option C** can be eliminated because its stereochemical descriptors (10R, 11R) indicate a *trans* relationship between the two ester groups. This is inconsistent with the use of maleic anhydride, a *cis*-dienophile.\n*   Comparing the structures corresponding to the remaining options, the name for **Option A** describes the isomer formed via the predicted *exo*, *anti-endo* pathway. The structure shows the ester groups and the methano bridge (from cyclopentadiene) on opposite sides of the molecule, which is characteristic of the *anti*-addition.\n*   The structure corresponding to **Option B** shows the ester groups and the methano bridge on the same side, which would result from a sterically hindered *syn*-addition, making it a minor product.\n\nTherefore, the structure of the major isomer is correctly represented by name A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
