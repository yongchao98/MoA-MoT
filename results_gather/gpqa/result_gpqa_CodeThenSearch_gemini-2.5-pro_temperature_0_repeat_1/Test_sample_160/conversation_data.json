    "### The mean free path for electrons is greater than for gas molecules.\n\nBased on the principles of kinetic theory and collision cross-sections, the mean free path for electrons scattering off gas molecules (λ2) is significantly longer than the mean free path for gas molecules colliding with each other (λ1). This is because the electron's size is negligible compared to a gas molecule, resulting in a smaller effective collision area.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n*   **Mean Free Path (λ):** This is the average distance a particle travels between successive collisions. It is inversely proportional to the number density of the target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ), as described by the approximate formula λ = 1/(nσ). In Mike's experiment, the number density of gas molecules (n) remains constant.\n\n*   **Collision Cross-Section (σ):** This represents the effective area that one particle presents to another for a collision to occur.\n    *   **λ1 (Gas-Gas Collisions):** For a gas molecule colliding with another identical gas molecule of diameter 'd', the collision cross-section (σ1) is approximately σ1 = πd². A more precise calculation that accounts for the motion of all particles includes a factor of the square root of 2, leading to the formula λ1 = 1/(√2 * n * πd²).\n    *   **λ2 (Electron-Gas Collisions):** For an electron colliding with a gas molecule, the electron's physical size is negligible. Therefore, the collision cross-section (σ2) is determined by the size of the gas molecule itself. A simplified model considers the cross-section to be related to the area of the molecule, which is significantly smaller than the cross-section for two molecules colliding.\n\n*   **Comparing λ1 and λ2:** Because the collision cross-section for an electron-molecule interaction (σ2) is considerably smaller than for a molecule-molecule interaction (σ1), the corresponding mean free path for the electron (λ2) will be longer. A simplified model suggests λ2 is roughly 4√2 (approximately 5.66) times larger than λ1.\n\nGiven this physical relationship, where λ2 is substantially greater than λ1, the only conclusion that fits is that λ2 is greater than or equal to 1.22 times λ1.\n\n<<<A>>>"
