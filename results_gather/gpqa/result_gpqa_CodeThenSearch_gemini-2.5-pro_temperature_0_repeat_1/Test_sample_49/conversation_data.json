    "The number of loops in a Feynman diagram can be determined from the mathematical expression for its contribution to a physical quantity. A key indicator is the presence of loop integration factors.\n\nIn a four-dimensional spacetime, each loop in a Feynman diagram introduces an integral over an unconstrained four-momentum. After carrying out the angular part of this integration, a characteristic factor of `1/(4π)²` (or `1/(16π²)`) emerges for each loop. Therefore, for a diagram with `L` loops, the resulting expression will contain a factor of `(1/(4π)²)^L`, which simplifies to `1/(4π)^(2L)`.\n\nThe expression found on the note is:\n`alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4π)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\nBy examining the factor involving `4π`, we can deduce the number of loops. The expression contains `1/(4π)^6`.\n\nEquating the general form to the specific factor, we get:\n`1/(4π)^(2L) = 1/(4π)^6`\n\nThis implies that `2L = 6`, and therefore, `L = 3`.\n\nThe other terms in the expression are consistent with a three-loop diagram:\n*   `alpha^3 * g^2`: These are coupling constants, indicating the types and number of interaction vertices in the diagram. The presence of five powers of coupling constants is plausible for a three-loop diagram.\n*   `(Q/M)^2`: This is a ratio of energy scales, which commonly appears in the results of loop calculations due to renormalization procedures.\n*   `sqrt(2)` and `8`: These are numerical factors that can arise from symmetry considerations of the diagram or from carrying out the mathematical integrals.\n\nBased on the loop integration factor, the diagram must have contained three loops.\n\n<<<B>>>"
