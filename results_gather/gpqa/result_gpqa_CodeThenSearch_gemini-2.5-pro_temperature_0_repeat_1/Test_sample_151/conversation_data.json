    "When a yeast cell, such as *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, is exposed to a mating pheromone, it undergoes a series of changes, including arresting its cell cycle in the G1 phase and forming a projection called a shmoo. This process involves a significant alteration in gene expression to prepare the cell for mating. The experiment described aims to identify the proteins present in *active chromatin* during this state. Active chromatin, or euchromatin, is the region of the genome that is undergoing active transcription.\n\nLet's analyze the likelihood of finding each complex in the active chromatin of a G1-arrested shmoo:\n\n*   **A) Pre-initiation complex (PIC):** This is a large assembly of proteins, including RNA polymerase II, that is required to start transcription. Since the formation of a shmoo involves extensive gene transcription, the PIC would be highly abundant on the active chromatin and would be a key component recovered in the assay.\n*   **C) Enhancer protein complex:** Enhancers are DNA sequences bound by activator proteins that significantly increase the rate of transcription of specific genes. These complexes are integral to regulating the massive transcriptional changes needed for shmoo formation and are a hallmark of active chromatin.\n*   **D) Nucleosome histone complex:** Nucleosomes are the fundamental structural units of all chromatin, consisting of DNA wrapped around histone proteins. In an experiment that recovers chromatin, nucleosomes will inherently be present. Furthermore, active chromatin is characterized by specific post-translational modifications on these histones, which are often the targets for the immunoprecipitation step in ChIP-MS assays.\n*   **B) Pre-replication complex (pre-RC):** This complex assembles on DNA at origins of replication during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Its function is to license these origins for DNA replication, which occurs in the subsequent S phase. Although the yeast cell is arrested in G1, the very phase when pre-RCs are assembled, the cell is prevented from entering S phase, and thus, DNA replication is not initiated. The experiment is designed to recover *transcriptionally active* chromatin. The pre-RC's function is related to DNA replication, not transcription. Therefore, while these complexes are present on the chromatin elsewhere, they are not a component of the active transcriptional machinery and would be the least observed protein complex in a sample specifically enriched for transcriptionally active chromatin.\n\n<<<B>>>"
