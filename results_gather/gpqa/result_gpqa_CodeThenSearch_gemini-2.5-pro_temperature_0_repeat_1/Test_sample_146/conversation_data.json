    "Here is the step-by-step derivation to determine the velocity of particle A.\n\nThe annihilation process is governed by the principle of conservation of energy.\n\n1.  **Calculate the Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$)**\n    The initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). Since the antiproton is described as \"slowly moving,\" we can approximate both particles as being at rest. The initial energy is therefore the sum of their rest mass energies. The mass of a proton and an antiproton are equal.\n\n    The rest mass energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938 MeV.\n\n    $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n    $E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n2.  **Calculate the Final Energy ($E_{final}$)**\n    The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Due to the conservation of momentum (starting from a near-zero momentum state), the four resulting particles will share the energy such that they all have the same speed ($v$).\n\n    The energy of each particle A is its total relativistic energy, given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor $\\left(\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}\\right)$.\n\n    The problem states that the rest mass energy of particle A ($m_A c^2$) is 300 MeV.\n\n    The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\n    $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\times \\gamma m_A c^2$\n    $E_{final} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times 300 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Energy**\n    By equating the initial and final energies, we can solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $1876 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\, \\text{MeV}$\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1876}{1200} \\approx 1.5633$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Velocity (v)**\n    Now, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity.\n\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n\n    Rearranging the formula to solve for $v/c$:\n    $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n    $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\n    Substituting the value of $\\gamma$:\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4092}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{0.5908}$\n    $v/c \\approx 0.7686$\n\nThe velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
