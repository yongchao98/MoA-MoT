    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the expectation value of the operator O = 10σz + 5σx for a spin-half particle in the given state.\n\nThe state of the particle is given by the linear superposition:\n|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩\n\nThe expectation value ⟨O⟩ is calculated as ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩. This can be broken down into:\n⟨O⟩ = ⟨ψ|(10σz + 5σx)|ψ⟩ = 10⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩ + 5⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩\n\nFirst, let's define the states and the Pauli matrices. The spin-up and spin-down states, which are the eigenstates of σz, can be represented as vectors:\n|↑⟩ =\n|↓⟩ =\n\nThe Pauli matrices σz and σx are:\nσz = [, [0, -1]]\nσx = [,]\n\nThe state |ψ⟩ can be written in vector form as:\n|ψ⟩ = 0.5 + (√3)/2 = [0.5, (√3)/2]\n\nNow, we can calculate the expectation values for σz and σx separately.\n\n**1. Expectation value of σz:**\n⟨σz⟩ = ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩\nFirst, we apply the σz operator to the state |ψ⟩:\nσz|ψ⟩ = σz(0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩) = 0.5(σz|↑⟩) + (√3)/2(σz|↓⟩)\nSince |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively:\nσz|ψ⟩ = 0.5(+1)|↑⟩ + (√3)/2(-1)|↓⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ - (√3)/2|↓⟩\n\nNow, we take the inner product with ⟨ψ|:\n⟨σz⟩ = (0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓|) * (0.5|↑⟩ - (√3)/2|↓⟩)\n= (0.5 * 0.5)⟨↑|↑⟩ - (0.5 * √3/2)⟨↑|↓⟩ + (√3/2 * 0.5)⟨↓|↑⟩ - (√3/2 * √3/2)⟨↓|↓⟩\nSince the states are orthonormal, ⟨↑|↑⟩ = 1, ⟨↓|↓⟩ = 1, and ⟨↑|↓⟩ = ⟨↓|↑⟩ = 0.\n⟨σz⟩ = 0.25 * 1 - 0 + 0 - (3/4) * 1 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5\n\n**2. Expectation value of σx:**\n⟨σx⟩ = ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩\nFirst, we apply the σx operator to the state |ψ⟩:\nσx|ψ⟩ = σx(0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩) = 0.5(σx|↑⟩) + (√3)/2(σx|↓⟩)\nThe σx operator flips the spins: σx|↑⟩ = |↓⟩ and σx|↓⟩ = |↑⟩.\nσx|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↓⟩ + (√3)/2|↑⟩\n\nNow, we take the inner product with ⟨ψ|:\n⟨σx⟩ = (0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓|) * ((√3)/2|↑⟩ + 0.5|↓⟩)\n= (0.5 * √3/2)⟨↑|↑⟩ + (0.5 * 0.5)⟨↑|↓⟩ + (√3/2 * √3/2)⟨↓|↑⟩ + (√3/2 * 0.5)⟨↓|↓⟩\n= (√3)/4 * 1 + 0 + 0 + (√3)/4 * 1\n= 2 * (√3)/4 = (√3)/2\n\n**3. Final Calculation:**\nNow, we combine the results to find the expectation value of the full operator:\n⟨O⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩\n⟨O⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * ((√3)/2)\n⟨O⟩ = -5 + 2.5 * √3\n\nUsing the approximation √3 ≈ 1.732:\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -0.67\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the value is -0.7.\n\n<<<C>>>"
