    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Physics\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to account for relativistic time dilation. A moving particle's lifetime appears longer to an observer in the lab (the bubble chamber) than its proper lifetime (the lifetime in its own rest frame). This extended lifetime results in a longer distance traveled before decay.\n\n*   **Proper Lifetime (τ₀):** The lifetime of the X⁰ particle in its own rest frame, given as 8 x 10⁻¹⁶ s.\n*   **Relativistic Effects:** Because the particle is moving at a high speed, its lifetime in the lab frame (τ) is dilated by the Lorentz factor (γ). The distance it travels before decaying (the decay length, L) is given by L = vτ, where v is its velocity.\n*   **Observation Condition:** To \"observe\" a decay, the particle's track must be distinguishable. The problem asks for the minimum resolution needed to see at least 30% of the decays. This means we need to find the track length `d` that 30% of the particles will exceed before they decay.\n\n### 2. Calculations\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n\nThe Lorentz factor relates the total energy (E) of a particle to its rest mass energy (m₀c²).\n\n*   E = γ * m₀c²\n*   Given: E = 27 GeV, m₀c² = 3.41 GeV\n*   γ = E / m₀c² = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.918\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length (L)**\n\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. A convenient formula for this is L = (p/m₀) * τ₀, where p is the particle's momentum.\n\nFirst, we find the momentum (p) using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)².\n\n*   (pc)² = E² - (m₀c²)²\n*   (pc)² = (27 GeV)² - (3.41 GeV)² = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.37 (GeV)²\n*   pc ≈ 26.78 GeV\n\nNow, we can calculate the mean decay length (L). We use the formula L = (pc / m₀c²) * c * τ₀.\n\n*   L = (26.78 GeV / 3.41 GeV) * (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * (8 x 10⁻¹⁶ s)\n*   L ≈ 7.854 * (2.4 x 10⁻⁷ m)\n*   L ≈ 1.885 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Required Resolution**\n\nThe decay of particles follows an exponential probability distribution. The probability that a particle will travel a distance `x` or greater before decaying is given by P(>x) = exp(-x/L).\n\nTo observe at least 30% of the decays, the detector's resolution `d` must be fine enough to see tracks that are longer than `d`. Therefore, the fraction of particles that travel further than `d` must be at least 0.30.\n\n*   exp(-d / L) ≥ 0.30\n*   -d / L ≥ ln(0.30)\n*   d ≤ -L * ln(0.30)\n\nWe are looking for the threshold resolution, so we use the equality:\n\n*   d = -L * ln(0.30)\n*   d ≈ - (1.885 x 10⁻⁶ m) * (-1.204)\n*   d ≈ 2.27 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated required resolution is approximately 2.27 x 10⁻⁶ m. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\n*   A) 2.08 x 10⁻¹ m\n*   B) 2.08 x 10⁻⁶ m\n*   C) 2.08 x 10⁻³ m\n*   D) 2.08 x 10⁻⁹ m\n\nThe value 2.27 x 10⁻⁶ m is closest to option B, 2.08 x 10⁻⁶ m. The small discrepancy (around 9%) is likely due to rounding of the initial constants (mass, energy, or lifetime) used when the problem was formulated. Both the calculated mean decay length (1.89 x 10⁻⁶ m) and the final resolution (2.27 x 10⁻⁶ m) are of the same order of magnitude and numerically closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
