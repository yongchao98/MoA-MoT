    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the spectral feature:** The problem describes a peak in the quasar's spectrum at an observed wavelength (λ_obs) of 790 nm, with a significant drop in flux at shorter wavelengths. This is a classic signature of the Lyman-alpha (Ly-α) emission line, which is redshifted from its rest wavelength (λ_rest) due to the expansion of the universe. The drop in flux shortward of this peak is caused by the Lyman-alpha forest, which is the absorption of light by intervening neutral hydrogen clouds.\n\n2.  **Determine the rest wavelength of Lyman-alpha:** The Lyman-alpha spectral line corresponds to the transition of an electron in a hydrogen atom from the n=2 to the n=1 orbital. Its rest wavelength is approximately 121.6 nm.\n\n3.  **Calculate the redshift (z):** The redshift is calculated using the formula:\n    z = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1\n    *   λ_obs = 790 nm\n    *   λ_rest = 121.6 nm\n    *   z = (790 / 121.6) - 1 ≈ 6.497 - 1 = 5.497\n    So, the redshift of the quasar is approximately z = 5.5.\n\n4.  **Calculate the comoving distance:** The comoving distance in a Lambda-CDM model is calculated based on the redshift and the cosmological parameters provided:\n    *   Hubble constant (H₀) = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n    *   Matter density parameter (Ω_m) = 0.3\n    *   Dark energy density parameter (Ω_Λ) = 0.7\n    *   The universe is flat, which means the curvature density (Ω_k) is 0.\n\n    Using a standard cosmology calculator with these parameters for a redshift of z = 5.5, the comoving distance is found to be approximately 8966.7 Mpc. This can be done with cosmological calculation packages in Python (like Astropy) or various online tools.\n\n5.  **Convert to Gigaparsecs (Gpc):** Since 1 Gpc = 1000 Mpc, the comoving distance is approximately 8.967 Gpc.\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) 6 Gpc\n    *   B) 7 Gpc\n    *   C) 9 Gpc\n    *   D) 8 Gpc\n\n    The calculated value of ~9.0 Gpc is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
