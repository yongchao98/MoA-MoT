    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio:**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    `T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\n    where `T_star` is the star's temperature, `R_star` is the star's radius, `A` is the planet's albedo, and `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n    We want to find the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`. Since both planets orbit the same star (`T_star` and `R_star` are the same) and have the same albedo (`A1 = A2`), the formula for the ratio simplifies to:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:**\n    Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period (P) to the semi-major axis (a):\n    `P² ∝ a³`\n    Therefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes can be expressed in terms of the ratio of the orbital periods:\n    `a2 / a1 = (P2 / P1)^(2/3)`\n\n3.  **Radial Velocity (RV) Amplitude Ratio:**\n    The Doppler shift (`Δλ`) is related to the radial velocity (`v_r`) by `Δλ / λ = v_r / c`. The maximum shift corresponds to the RV amplitude, K.\n    `K1 ∝ Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å`\n    `K2 ∝ Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å`\n    So, the ratio of the RV amplitudes is:\n    `K1 / K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4`\n\n4.  **Relating RV Amplitude to Orbital Period:**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit detected via the transit method (implying an edge-on orbit, so `sin(i) ≈ 1`), the RV amplitude K is given by:\n    `K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_p / M_star^(2/3))`\n    Since G and the star's mass (`M_star`) are constant for both planets, we can write the proportionality:\n    `K ∝ M_p * P^(-1/3)`\n\n    The ratio of the amplitudes is therefore:\n    `K1 / K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * (P1 / P2)^(-1/3) = (M_p1 / M_p2) * (P2 / P1)^(1/3)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Period Ratio:**\n    We can now substitute the known values (`K1/K2 = 3/4`, `M_p1 = 7 M_earth`, `M_p2 = 5 M_earth`) into the equation and solve for the period ratio (`P2 / P1`):\n    `3/4 = (7 / 5) * (P2 / P1)^(1/3)`\n    `(P2 / P1)^(1/3) = (3/4) * (5/7) = 15/28`\n    `P2 / P1 = (15/28)³`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Semi-Major Axis Ratio:**\n    Now, substitute the period ratio into the equation from Kepler's Third Law:\n    `a2 / a1 = (P2 / P1)^(2/3) = ((15/28)³)^(2/3) = (15/28)²`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:**\n    Finally, substitute the semi-major axis ratio into the temperature ratio equation:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt((15/28)²) = 15/28`\n\n    Calculating the numerical value:\n    `15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>"
