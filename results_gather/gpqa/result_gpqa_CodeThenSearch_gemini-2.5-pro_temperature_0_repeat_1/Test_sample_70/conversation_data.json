    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet\\_4 and Planet\\_2, we must first understand the relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature, its orbital period, and its distance from the host star.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates back into space. For a planet in a circular orbit, the equilibrium temperature is related to its distance from the star (d) by the following proportionality:\n\nT_eq ∝ (1/d^2)^(1/4) = d^(-1/2)\n\nThis indicates that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance.\n\nNext, we use Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion, which relates a planet's orbital period (P) to its orbital distance (d). For circular orbits, the law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance.\n\nP^2 ∝ d^3\n\nFrom this, we can express the orbital distance in terms of the orbital period:\n\nd ∝ P^(2/3)\n\nBy substituting this relationship into the equilibrium temperature proportionality, we can find the connection between the equilibrium temperature and the orbital period:\n\nT_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2) = P^(-1/3)\n\nThis shows that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the cube root of its orbital period.\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods for the five planets as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Therefore, the ratio of the orbital period of Planet\\_4 to Planet\\_2 is:\n\nP_4 / P_2 = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75\n\nNow, we can calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_4 / P_2)^(-1/3) = (1.75)^(-1/3) = 1 / (1.75)^(1/3)\n\nTo find the value, we can also express this as:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3) = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3) = (4 / 7)^(1/3)\n\nCalculating the cube root of (4/7):\n\n(4/7) ≈ 0.5714\n\n(0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83\n\nThus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet\\_4 and Planet\\_2 is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<D>>>"
