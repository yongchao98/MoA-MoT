    "In a universe where magnetic monopoles—isolated north or south magnetic poles—exist, two of Maxwell's four equations would be different. These equations are fundamental to our understanding of electromagnetism.\n\nThe standard form of Maxwell's equations does not account for magnetic charges. One of the equations, Gauss's law for magnetism, explicitly states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero (∇ ⋅ B = 0). This is the mathematical expression of the observation that magnetic poles always come in pairs, a north and a south pole. If an isolated magnetic pole, or magnetic charge, were to exist, this law would need to be modified to include a term for the magnetic charge density, much like Gauss's law for electricity relates the divergence of the electric field to the electric charge density.\n\nThe other equation that would change is Faraday's law of induction. In its standard form, this law describes how a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field (∇ × E = -∂B/∂t). The existence of magnetic monopoles would imply the existence of magnetic currents, which are moving magnetic charges. This magnetic current would act as another source for a circulating electric field, requiring an additional term in Faraday's law.\n\nThe other two of Maxwell's equations, Gauss's law for electricity and the Ampère-Maxwell law, would remain unchanged in their description of how electric charges and currents generate electric and magnetic fields.\n\nTherefore, the two equations that would be different are the one related to the divergence of the magnetic field and the one related to the circulation (curl) of the electric field.\n\n<<<A>>>"
