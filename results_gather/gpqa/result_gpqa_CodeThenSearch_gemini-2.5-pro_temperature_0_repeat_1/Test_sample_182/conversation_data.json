    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's determine its molecular formula.\n\n*   **Carbon Skeleton:** It has a six-membered cyclohexene ring.\n*   **Functional Groups:**\n    *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1.\n    *   A formyl group (-CHO) at position 2.\n    *   A double bond within the ring between carbons 3 and 4.\n    *   A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) at position 5.\n\n**Drawing the structure and counting the atoms:**\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH₂ = 10 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** We can deduce the number of hydrogens by ensuring each carbon has four bonds.\n    *   Ring hydrogens: 7\n    *   -COOH hydrogen: 1\n    *   -CHO hydrogen: 1\n    *   -CH=CH₂ hydrogens: 3\n    *   Total hydrogens = 7 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 hydrogens.\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\n\nThe molecular formula of the starting material is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (Red P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a very powerful reducing agent.\n\n*   It reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) to alkanes (-CH₃).\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) to alkanes (-CH₃).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n\nEssentially, all oxygen-containing functional groups and sites of unsaturation (double/triple bonds) are completely reduced to a saturated hydrocarbon (alkane).\n\n**3. Determine the Product**\n\nThe reaction will convert the starting material into a saturated hydrocarbon while preserving the original carbon skeleton.\n\n*   The C₁₀ carbon skeleton will remain.\n*   The carboxylic acid group, formyl group, and both vinyl and ring double bonds will be fully reduced.\n*   All oxygen atoms will be removed.\n*   The initial ring structure will remain, but it will become a saturated cyclohexane ring.\n\nThe product will be a C₁₀ saturated monocyclic alkane. The general formula for a cycloalkane is **CₙH₂ₙ**. Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nIHD = C - (H/2) + (N/2) + 1\n\nWhere C is the number of carbon atoms, H is the number of hydrogen atoms, and N is the number of nitrogen atoms.\n\nFor the product C₁₀H₂₀:\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 0 + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nAn IHD of 1 indicates the presence of either one ring or one double bond. Since the reaction with red P and HI reduces all double bonds, the IHD of 1 must correspond to the single ring structure of the cyclohexane skeleton.\n\n<<<A>>>"
