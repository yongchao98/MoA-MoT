    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak**: The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **M+2 Peak**: The peak at m/z = 158, with an intensity of about one-third (32%) of the M+ peak, is a characteristic isotopic pattern for a compound containing one chlorine atom. This is due to the natural abundance of chlorine isotopes: ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%), which have a mass difference of 2 amu and an abundance ratio of approximately 3:1.\n*   **Conclusion from MS**: The unknown compound has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol and contains one chlorine atom. All four options (A, B, C, and D) have the chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and a molecular weight of approximately 156.57 g/mol, which is consistent with this finding.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹)**: This very broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group, which is broadened due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹)**: This absorption is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl group in an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion from IR**: The presence of both the broad O-H and the C=O peaks strongly suggests the compound is a carboxylic acid. This makes options A and D likely candidates and rules out Phenyl chloroformate (B), which lacks the O-H group, and 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (C), which is an aldehyde with a phenolic hydroxyl group that would show different IR characteristics.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)**: A singlet appearing this far downfield is the classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). This further confirms the compound is a carboxylic acid.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H)**: These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is characteristic of a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of this substitution pattern results in only two distinct types of aromatic protons. The protons at 8.02 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, causing them to be more deshielded and shifted further downfield. The protons at 7.72 ppm are ortho to the chlorine atom.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR**: The spectrum indicates a *para*-substituted aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Options\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid**: This is an *ortho*-substituted ring. The four aromatic protons would not be symmetrical and would produce a more complex splitting pattern, not two simple doublets.\n*   **B) Phenyl chloroformate**: This is not a carboxylic acid and would not show a peak around 11 ppm in the ¹H NMR spectrum or the broad O-H stretch in the IR spectrum.\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**: This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would show an aldehyde proton signal (around 9-10 ppm) and a phenolic proton signal, but not the carboxylic acid proton at 11.0 ppm.\n*   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid**: This structure is a *para*-substituted benzoic acid. It perfectly matches all the spectral data: it contains a chlorine atom, has the correct molecular weight, is a carboxylic acid (matching the IR and the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm), and has a *para*-substituted ring that would produce two doublets for the aromatic protons in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of all the provided spectral data, the unidentified compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
