    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### Reaction I\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a ketone with a single chiral center at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, which reduces the ketone at the C3 position to a hydroxyl group. This reduction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n*   **Products:** The attack of the hydride on the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces. Since the starting material is already chiral, this leads to the formation of two different products that are diastereomers of each other: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n\n### Reaction II\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with sodium borohydride (NaBHâ‚„), which reduces both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:** The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. This results in the formation of three stereoisomers:\n    *   A pair of enantiomers: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   A meso compound: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### Combined Products\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the product mixture contains a total of five distinct compounds:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\nThis technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore will not be separated.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n\nLet's analyze the mixture:\n*   The two products from Reaction I, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will elute together as a **single peak**.\n*   The meso compound, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated, resulting in another **single peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C7 alcohols) and Reaction II (C5 diols) are structurally different and will have different retention times.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram will be 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase):**\nThis technique is designed to separate chiral molecules, including enantiomers.\n*   The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation.\n\nLet's analyze the five compounds in the mixture:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (chiral)\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (chiral)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (chiral)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (chiral)\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (achiral, meso)\n\n*   The chiral column will separate the two diastereomers from Reaction I.\n*   It will also separate the enantiomeric pair from Reaction II.\n*   The achiral meso compound will elute as a single peak, separated from the other compounds.\n\nAssuming the column can resolve all distinct species, each of the five compounds will produce a separate peak. Thus, the total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram will be **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<C>>>"
