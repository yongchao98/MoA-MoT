    "When a particle with a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes the magnetic moment to precess around the direction of the magnetic field. This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nInitially, the spin of the particle is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in a \"spin-up\" state along the z-axis. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the spin begins to precess around the new magnetic field axis.\n\nThe Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment μ in a magnetic field B is given by H = -μ ⋅ B. Given that the magnetic moment μ is proportional to the spin operator S (μ = γS), and the new magnetic field is B in the +Y direction, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -γB * S_y, where S_y is the y-component of the spin operator.\n\nThe time evolution of the expectation value of the z-component of the spin, <S_z>, will oscillate. The frequency of this oscillation is the Larmor frequency, which is given by the formula ω = γB. In this equation, ω is the angular frequency of precession, γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, and B is the magnitude of the magnetic field.\n\nTherefore, the average of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment will oscillate with a frequency of γB.\n\n<<<B>>>"
