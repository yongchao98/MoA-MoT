    "To determine the momentum of the absorbed photon, we first need to calculate the energy difference (ΔE) between the initial and final states of the molecule. The energy of the photon will be equal to this energy difference. Then, the photon's momentum (p) can be found using the relation p = ΔE / c, where c is the speed of light.\n\n### 1. Energy Levels in the Rotation-Vibration Model\n\nThe energy of a diatomic molecule in the quantum rotation-vibration model is given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies. The total energy E(v, J) is determined by the vibrational quantum number (v = 0, 1, 2, ...) and the rotational quantum number (J = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n\nThe energy levels are expressed as:\nE(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + B·J(J+1)\nwhere:\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n*   **ω** is the angular frequency of vibration\n*   **v** is the vibrational quantum number\n*   **B** is the rotational constant, given by B = ħ² / (2I)\n*   **I** is the moment of inertia of the molecule\n*   **J** is the rotational quantum number\n\n### 2. Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State (Fundamental State):** The molecule is in its lowest possible energy state, which corresponds to the lowest vibrational and rotational quantum numbers: v = 0 and J = 0.\n*   **Final State:** The problem asks for the transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" While a purely rotational transition (v=0, J=0 → v=0, J=1) has a smaller energy change, the given options for momentum are of a magnitude that corresponds to a much larger energy change, specifically a rovibrational transition. For an absorption from the ground state, the selection rules for rovibrational transitions are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = +1. Therefore, the final state is v = 1 and J = 1.\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Energy Difference (ΔE)\n\nFirst, we calculate the molecule's reduced mass (μ) and moment of inertia (I).\n\n*   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n    μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n    μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n    Converting to kg: μ ≈ 1.818 * (1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg/amu) ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n*   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n    I = μ * R²\n    I = (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)² = 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\nNow, we calculate the energy of the initial and final states:\n\n*   **Initial Energy (E_initial for v=0, J=0):**\n    E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + (ħ² / (2I)) * 0(0+1) = (1/2)ħω\n\n*   **Final Energy (E_final for v=1, J=1):**\n    E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + (ħ² / (2I)) * 1(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon (ΔE) is the difference between these two states:\nΔE = E_final - E_initial\nΔE = [(3/2)ħω + ħ²/I] - (1/2)ħω\nΔE = ħω + ħ²/I\n\nLet's calculate the two terms:\n*   Vibrational energy term: ħω = (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) = 4.218 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n*   Rotational energy term: ħ²/I = (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 9.21 x 10⁻²³ J\n\nTotal energy change:\nΔE ≈ 4.218 x 10⁻²⁰ J + 0.00921 x 10⁻²⁰ J ≈ 4.227 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Photon's Momentum (p)\n\nThe momentum of a photon is related to its energy by the formula p = ΔE / c.\n\n*   **Momentum (p):**\n    p = (4.227 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3.00 x 10⁸ m/s)\n    p ≈ 1.409 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis calculated value is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
