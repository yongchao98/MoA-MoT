    "The analysis of the provided spectroscopic data allows for a step-by-step deduction of the unknown compound's structure and, consequently, its chemical formula.\n\n### Spectroscopic Data Analysis:\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by other groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group. The ¹H NMR spectrum confirms this with two signals corresponding to the four aromatic hydrogens.\n\n2.  **FTIR shows an ester group:** The presence of an ester functional group (-COO-) is confirmed. This adds two oxygen atoms to the molecular formula.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Breakdown:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** This is consistent with the C6H4 ring.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). The doublet arises from one vinyl proton being split by the other vinyl proton. The doublet of quartets arises from the second vinyl proton being split by both the first vinyl proton and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** One of these methyl groups is part of the propenyl group identified above. The other must be part of the ester.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a critical constraint. It rules out possibilities like an ethyl ester (-O-CH2CH3), as that would produce a –CH2 signal.\n\n### Assembling the Molecular Structure:\n\nBased on the data, the molecule is composed of the following fragments:\n*   A C6H4 (aromatic ring) fragment.\n*   A -COO- (ester) fragment.\n*   A -CH=CH-CH3 (propenyl) fragment, which accounts for the vinyl and one methyl signal.\n*   A -CH3 (methyl) fragment, which must be part of the ester group.\n\nTo satisfy the \"no –CH2 groups\" rule, the ester must be a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate (-O-CO-CH3). Both arrangements lead to the same molecular formula.\n\nLet's calculate the formula by summing the atoms from the identified fragments:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from the ring) + 1 (from the carbonyl C in the ester) + 1 (from the methyl C in the ester) + 3 (from the propenyl group) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from the ring) + 3 (from the ester's methyl group) + 5 (from the propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**. This formula is consistent with known isomers like ethyl cinnamate and methyl isoeugenol, which fit the structural features deduced from the spectra.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula for the unknown compound is C11H12O2.\n\nA) C11H12O2\nB) C12H12O2\nC) C11H14O2\nD) C12H14O2\n\n<<<A>>>"
