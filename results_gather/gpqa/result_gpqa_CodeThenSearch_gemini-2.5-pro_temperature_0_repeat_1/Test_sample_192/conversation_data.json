    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine how the number of stars changes with distance:\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between distance and parallax.** The distance to a star (r) is inversely proportional to its parallax (plx). This fundamental relationship in astronomy is given by:\n    r ∝ 1/plx\n    This implies that parallax is also inversely proportional to distance:\n    plx ∝ 1/r\n\n2.  **Use the given information.** The problem states that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars observed varies with parallax as 1/plx⁵. Let's denote the number of stars per unit parallax interval as n(plx). So, we have:\n    n(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵\n\n3.  **Transform the distribution from parallax to distance.** We want to find the number of stars per unit range of distance, which we can denote as n(r). To do this, we need to relate the number of stars in a small parallax interval, d(plx), to the number of stars in the corresponding distance interval, dr. The number of stars must be the same, so:\n    n(r) |dr| = n(plx) |d(plx)|\n\n    From this, we can write:\n    n(r) = n(plx) * |d(plx)/dr|\n\n4.  **Calculate the derivative |d(plx)/dr|.** Since r = 1/plx (ignoring constants of proportionality), we have plx = 1/r. We can now differentiate plx with respect to r:\n    d(plx)/dr = d/dr (1/r) = -1/r²\n    The absolute value is:\n    |d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²\n\n5.  **Substitute the expressions back into the transformation equation.** Now we substitute the relationships for n(plx) and |d(plx)/dr| into the equation for n(r):\n    n(r) ∝ (1/plx⁵) * (1/r²)\n\n6.  **Express everything in terms of distance (r).** Finally, we replace plx with 1/r in the expression:\n    n(r) ∝ (1 / (1/r)⁵) * (1/r²)\n    n(r) ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²)\n    n(r) ∝ r³\n\nTherefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance with a proportionality of r³.\n\n<<<B>>>"
