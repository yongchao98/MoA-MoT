    "The reaction of a ketone with sodium nitrite (NaNO₂) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a known method for preparing 1,2-diketones. The reagents NaNO₂ and HCl generate nitrous acid (HONO) in situ. The reaction proceeds through the nitrosation of the α-carbon (the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group) of the ketone.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the process:\n1.  The ketone first tautomerizes to its enol form.\n2.  The enol then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic nitrosonium ion (NO⁺), which is formed from the protonation of nitrous acid.\n3.  This forms an unstable α-nitroso ketone, which quickly tautomerizes to a more stable α-oximino ketone (an oxime).\n4.  Finally, hydrolysis of the α-oximino ketone yields the 1,2-diketone.\n\nFor this reaction to occur, the starting ketone must have at least one hydrogen atom on an α-carbon.\n\n**Applying this to the specific reactions:**\n\n*   **Reaction A:** The product is 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione. This is a 1,2-diketone on a cyclohexane ring. The reaction introduces a second carbonyl group adjacent to an existing one. Therefore, the starting material must be **4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one**. The nitrosation occurs at the C-2 position, which has two α-hydrogens, leading to the desired product after hydrolysis.\n\n*   **Reaction B:** The product is 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione. This is a linear 2,3-diketone. This indicates the starting material was a ketone with the carbonyl group at either the C-2 or C-3 position. If the starting material is **5-methylhexan-2-one**, the nitrosation would occur at the more substituted α-carbon (C-3), which has two α-hydrogens, to form the 2,3-dione after hydrolysis.\n\n**Evaluating the given options:**\n\n*   **A) A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, B = 5-methylhexan-2-one:** Both starting materials are ketones that possess the necessary α-hydrogens to undergo nitrosation and subsequent hydrolysis to form the specified 1,2-diketones. This option is correct.\n*   **B) A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, B = 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol:** Starting material B is a diol, not a ketone. While diols can be oxidized to diketones, it is not the correct substrate for this specific reaction with NaNO₂ and HCl.\n*   **C) A = 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, B = 5-methylhexan-2-one:** Starting material A is an alcohol, not a ketone, and is incorrect for this transformation.\n*   **D) A = 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, B = 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol:** Both starting materials are incorrect for the described reaction.\n\nTherefore, the correct starting materials are 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one for A and 5-methylhexan-2-one for B.\n\n<<<A>>>"
