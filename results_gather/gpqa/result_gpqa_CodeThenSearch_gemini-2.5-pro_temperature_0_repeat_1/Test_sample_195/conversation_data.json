    "The derivation performed in the initial thought process is confirmed by the principles of special relativity and energy conservation. The total energy of the relativistic system is the sum of its relativistic kinetic energy and its potential energy.\n\nThe total energy E is given by:\nE = γmc² + U(x)\nwhere:\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²) is the Lorentz factor.\n*   m is the rest mass of the oscillator.\n*   c is the speed of light.\n*   v is the velocity of the oscillator.\n*   U(x) is the potential energy, which for a harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law is U(x) = (1/2)kx².\n\nThe total energy of the system is conserved. We can equate the total energy at the point of maximum displacement (amplitude A) with the total energy at the equilibrium position (x=0).\n\n1.  **At the maximum amplitude (x = A):**\n    The velocity of the mass is momentarily zero (v = 0).\n    Therefore, the Lorentz factor γ = 1 / √(1 - 0²/c²) = 1.\n    The total energy at this point is E = (1)mc² + (1/2)kA².\n\n2.  **At the equilibrium position (x = 0):**\n    The potential energy is zero (U(0) = 0).\n    The speed is at its maximum (v = v_max).\n    The Lorentz factor is γ_max = 1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²).\n    The total energy at this point is E = γ_max * mc².\n\nBy the principle of conservation of energy, the total energy at both points must be equal:\nγ_max * mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA²\n\nNow, we solve for v_max:\nDivide by mc²:\nγ_max = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²)\n\nSubstitute the expression for γ_max:\n1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²)\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for v_max:\n√(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 / (1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))\n\nSquare both sides:\n1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / (1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))²\n\nIsolate the v_max term:\nv_max²/c² = 1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))²\n\nFinally, solve for v_max:\nv_max = c * √[1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))²]\n\nThis result matches option D. As the amplitude of oscillation increases, the maximum velocity approaches, but never exceeds, the speed of light, a key feature of relativistic dynamics.\n\n<<<D>>>"
