    "Here is the step-by-step derivation to determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1.\n\n### Relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates back into space. For a planet in a circular orbit, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance (D) from the star. This relationship can be expressed as:\n\nT ∝ 1 / √D\n\nFrom this, we can establish a relationship for the orbital distance in terms of temperature:\n\nD ∝ 1 / T²\n\n### Calculating the Ratio of Orbital Distances\n\nWe are given the following ratios of equilibrium temperatures:\n\n*   T₁ / T₂ ≈ 1.4\n*   T₂ / T₃ ≈ 2.3\n\nUsing the relationship D ∝ 1 / T², we can find the ratios of the orbital distances:\n\n*   D₂ / D₁ = (T₁ / T₂)² ≈ 1.4² = 1.96\n*   D₃ / D₂ = (T₂ / T₃)² ≈ 2.3² = 5.29\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet3 to Planet1, we multiply these two ratios:\n\nD₃ / D₁ = (D₃ / D₂) * (D₂ / D₁) ≈ 5.29 * 1.96 ≈ 10.3684\n\n### Relationship between Orbital Period and Orbital Distance\n\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of the orbital period (P) of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis, which for a circular orbit is the orbital radius (D). This is expressed as:\n\nP² ∝ D³\n\nTherefore, the orbital period is proportional to the orbital distance to the power of 3/2:\n\nP ∝ D^(3/2)\n\n### Calculating the Ratio of Orbital Periods\n\nNow, we can use the ratio of the orbital distances to find the ratio of the orbital periods of Planet3 and Planet1:\n\nP₃ / P₁ = (D₃ / D₁)^(3/2) ≈ (10.3684)^(3/2)\n\nCalculating this value:\n\nP₃ / P₁ ≈ 33.38\n\nThis result is approximately 33.4. The information regarding the masses of the planets and their albedo is not necessary for this specific calculation, as the albedo is the same for all three planets and the mass of the planets is negligible compared to the star's mass when applying Kepler's Third Law in this form.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) ~ 10.4\nB) ~ 3.2\nC) ~ 4.4\nD) ~ 33.4\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
