    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State\n\nFirst, we establish the energy and momentum of the electron and positron before the collision. The rest mass of both an electron and a positron is denoted by *m₀*.\n\n*   **Electron**: Moving from the left with a Lorentz factor (γ_e) of 4.\n*   **Positron**: Moving from the right with a Lorentz factor (γ_p) of 2.\n\nThe total energy (E) of a relativistic particle is given by the formula E = γ * m₀ * c², where *c* is the speed of light.\n\nThe relativistic momentum (p) is given by p = √(γ² - 1) * m₀ * c.\n\n*   **Initial Total Energy (E_i)**:\n    The total energy before the collision is the sum of the energies of the electron and the positron.\n    E_i = (γ_e * m₀ * c²) + (γ_p * m₀ * c²) = (4 + 2) * m₀ * c² = 6 * m₀ * c²\n\n*   **Initial Total Momentum (P_i)**:\n    Momentum is a vector. Assuming the electron moves in the positive x-direction and the positron in the negative x-direction, the total initial momentum is:\n    p_e = √(4² - 1) * m₀ * c = √15 * m₀ * c\n    p_p = √(2² - 1) * m₀ * c = √3 * m₀ * c\n    P_i = p_e - p_p = (√15 - √3) * m₀ * c\n\n### 2. Define the Final State\n\nAfter annihilation, two photons are produced.\n\n*   They have the same energy, which we'll call E_ph.\n*   One photon moves upper-right at an angle *θ* to the horizontal axis.\n*   The other moves lower-right at an angle *-θ* to the horizontal axis.\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation Laws\n\nThe total energy and momentum of the system must be conserved.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy**:\n    The initial energy equals the final energy. The final energy is the sum of the energies of the two photons.\n    E_i = E_f\n    6 * m₀ * c² = E_ph + E_ph = 2 * E_ph\n    Therefore, the energy of each photon is:\n    E_ph = 3 * m₀ * c²\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum**:\n    The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by p_ph = E_ph / c.\n    p_ph = (3 * m₀ * c²) / c = 3 * m₀ * c\n\n    The total final momentum (P_f) is the vector sum of the two photon momenta. Due to the symmetric angles, the vertical components of their momenta cancel each other out, and the horizontal components add up.\n    P_f = p_ph * cos(θ) + p_ph * cos(-θ) = 2 * p_ph * cos(θ)\n    P_f = 2 * (3 * m₀ * c) * cos(θ) = 6 * m₀ * c * cos(θ)\n\n    Now, we equate the initial and final momentum:\n    P_i = P_f\n    (√15 - √3) * m₀ * c = 6 * m₀ * c * cos(θ)\n\n### 4. Calculate the Angle\n\nWe can now solve for the angle *θ*.\n\ncos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\n\nUsing the approximate values for the square roots:\n√15 ≈ 3.873\n√3 ≈ 1.732\n\ncos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568\nθ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°\n\nThe question asks for the angle **between** the directions of the two photons, which is 2*θ*.\n\nAngle = 2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° ≈ 138.2°\n\nThis value is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
