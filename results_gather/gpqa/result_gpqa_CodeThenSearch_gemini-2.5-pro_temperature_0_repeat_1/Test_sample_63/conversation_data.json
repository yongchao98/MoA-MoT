    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the total number of atoms in salts A and B.\n\n### **1. Analysis of Gaseous Products**\n\nFirst, we identify the gaseous products and their quantities based on the experimental results.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases like CO₂ or NO₂ were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** The remaining 2.24 liters of gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP) did not react with any of the previous substances. This indicates an inert gas.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   Given that the original substances are salts likely containing nitrogen, the inert gas C is most probably nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### **2. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe decomposition produced water (H₂O), oxygen (O₂), and nitrogen (N₂). This means the original salts must be composed of Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O). Since they are salts, a logical assumption is that they are ammonium salts with nitrogen-oxygen anions.\n\nThe two most common salts fitting this description are:\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\nLet's examine their thermal decomposition reactions:\n*   The decomposition of ammonium nitrite is: **NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)**\n*   The decomposition of ammonium nitrate can vary with temperature. While it often produces N₂O and H₂O, under strong heating, it can decompose according to the reaction: **2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)**. This reaction pathway fits the observed products (N₂, O₂, and H₂O).\n\n### **3. Stoichiometric Verification**\n\nThe problem states that the initial mixture was equimolar. Let 'x' be the number of moles for both salt A (NH₄NO₂) and salt B (NH₄NO₃).\n\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol.\n*   The total mass is 7.20 g.\n\nWe can set up the equation:\nx * (64.04 g/mol) + x * (80.04 g/mol) = 7.20 g\nx * (144.08) = 7.20\nx = 7.20 / 144.08 ≈ 0.05 mol\n\nSo, the initial mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected amount of products:\n*   **From 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂:**\n    *   Moles of N₂ = 0.05 mol\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 2 * 0.05 = 0.1 mol\n*   **From 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃:**\n    *   Moles of N₂ = (2/2) * 0.05 = 0.05 mol\n    *   Moles of O₂ = (1/2) * 0.05 = 0.025 mol\n    *   Moles of H₂O = (4/2) * 0.05 = 0.1 mol\n\n**Total products:**\n*   **Total N₂:** 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.1 mol (Matches the 2.24 L of Gas C).\n*   **Total H₂O:** 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2 mol (Mass = 0.2 mol * 18.02 g/mol ≈ 3.60 g. Matches the result from tube №1).\n*   **Total O₂:** 0.025 mol (Mass = 0.025 mol * 32.00 g/mol = 0.80 g. Matches the result from tube №3).\n\nThe calculations confirm that salts A and B are indeed ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n### **4. Calculation of Total Atoms**\n\nFinally, we calculate the total number of atoms in one molecule of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = **8 atoms**\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = **9 atoms**.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each:\nTotal Atoms = 8 + 9 = 17\n\n<<<D>>>"
