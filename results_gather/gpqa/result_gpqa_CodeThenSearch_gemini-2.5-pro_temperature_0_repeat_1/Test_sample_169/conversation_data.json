    "To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, `<S_y>`, for an electron in the spin state `|ψ⟩ = (3i, 4)`, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Normalize the spin state:** A quantum state vector must be normalized. The normalization condition is `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 1`.\n    *   First, we find the inner product of the state with itself. The \"bra\" `⟨ψ|` is the conjugate transpose of the \"ket\" `|ψ⟩`.\n        `|ψ⟩ = [3i, 4]^T`\n        `⟨ψ| = [-3i, 4]`\n    *   The inner product is:\n        `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = -9i² + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25`\n    *   The normalization constant is `1/√25 = 1/5`.\n    *   The normalized state `|ψ_norm⟩` is:\n        `|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/5) * [3i, 4]^T`\n\n2.  **Define the spin operator `S_y`:** The spin operator in the y-direction is given by `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`, where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant and `σ_y` is the Pauli Y matrix.\n    *   Given `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`, the `S_y` operator is:\n        `S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n\n3.  **Calculate the expectation value:** The expectation value `⟨S_y⟩` is calculated using the formula `⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ_norm| S_y |ψ_norm⟩`.\n    *   `⟨S_y⟩ = (1/5) * [-3i, 4] * ( (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] ) * ( (1/5) * [3i, 4]^T )`\n    *   Let's combine the constants:\n        `⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ / (2 * 25)) * [-3i, 4] * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i, 4]^T`\n    *   First, we'll perform the matrix-vector multiplication:\n        `[[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i, 4]^T = [0*(3i) + (-i)*4, i*(3i) + 0*4]^T = [-4i, 3i²]^T = [-4i, -3]^T`\n    *   Now, we perform the inner product (row vector times column vector):\n        `[-3i, 4] * [-4i, -3]^T = (-3i)*(-4i) + (4)*(-3) = 12i² - 12 = -12 - 12 = -24`\n    *   Finally, we multiply by the constant factor:\n        `⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ / 50) * (-24)`\n        `⟨S_y⟩ = -24ħ / 50`\n        `⟨S_y⟩ = -12ħ / 25`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) -25*hbar/2\nB) -12*hbar/25\nC) 12*hbar/25\nD) 25*hbar/2\n\nThe calculated expectation value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
