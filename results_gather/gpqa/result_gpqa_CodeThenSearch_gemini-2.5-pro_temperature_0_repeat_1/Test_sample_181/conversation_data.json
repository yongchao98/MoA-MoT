    "The Mott-Gurney equation is valid under a specific set of assumptions. Based on the principles of space-charge-limited current (SCLC), the key conditions for the equation's validity are:\n\n*   **Single-Carrier Device:** The current is carried by only one type of charge carrier, either electrons or holes.\n*   **Trap-Free Semiconductor:** The material is assumed to be an insulator or an intrinsic semiconductor with no charge traps within its bandgap. The presence of traps would alter the relationship between current and voltage.\n*   **Ohmic Contacts:** The contacts between the semiconductor and the electrodes must be Ohmic. This means there is no energy barrier for the injection of charge carriers from the electrode into the semiconductor, ensuring that the carrier reservoir is sufficient to supply the SCLC. A lack of an injection barrier is a key characteristic of an ideal Ohmic contact.\n*   **Negligible Diffusion Current:** The model assumes that the dominant charge transport mechanism is drift current, which is driven by the electric field. The current arising from the diffusion of charge carriers is considered negligible.\n\nAnalyzing the given options:\nA) This is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney law applies to single-carrier, not two-carrier, devices.\nC) This is incorrect because the SCLC is a drift-dominated current; therefore, the drift current cannot be negligible.\nD) This is incorrect because the equation requires Ohmic contacts for ideal charge injection, not Schottky contacts, which create an energy barrier.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is the one that describes a trap-free, single-carrier device with a non-blocking (Ohmic) contact and assumes the current is dominated by drift (negligible diffusion).\n\n<<<B>>>"
