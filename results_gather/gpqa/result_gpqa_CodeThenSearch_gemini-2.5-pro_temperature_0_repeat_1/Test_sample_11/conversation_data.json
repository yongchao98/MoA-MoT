    "The initial calculation is confirmed by multiple sources. The decay of a stationary pion (π+) into a muon (μ+) and a muon neutrino (νμ) is a classic two-body decay problem where the principles of conservation of energy and momentum determine the kinetic energies of the products.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n**1. Initial State:**\n*   The positive pion (π+) is at rest.\n*   Its total energy is its rest energy: E_π = m_π * c² = 139.6 MeV.\n*   Its momentum is p_π = 0.\n\n**2. Final State:**\n*   The products are a positive muon (μ+) and a muon neutrino (νμ).\n*   According to the conservation of momentum, the muon and the neutrino must move in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitudes (p_μ = p_ν = p).\n\n**3. Conservation of Energy:**\n*   The initial energy equals the total energy of the products:\n    E_π = E_μ + E_ν\n*   The total energy for the massive muon is E_μ = KE_μ + m_μc² = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²).\n*   Assuming the neutrino is massless (a standard assumption for this calculation), its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy and is related to its momentum by E_ν = KE_ν = pc.\n\n**4. Calculation:**\n*   Substituting the energy expressions into the conservation equation:\n    m_πc² = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²) + pc\n*   Rearranging to solve for the momentum (pc):\n    m_πc² - pc = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n*   Squaring both sides:\n    (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n*   Simplifying the equation:\n    (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² = 2(m_πc²)(pc)\n*   Solving for pc:\n    pc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2 * m_πc²]\n*   Plugging in the given rest masses (m_πc² = 139.6 MeV and m_μc² = 105.7 MeV):\n    pc = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]\n    pc = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2\n    pc = 8315.67 / 279.2\n    pc ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\n**5. Determining Kinetic Energies:**\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the neutrino (KE_ν):**\n    Since the neutrino is treated as massless, its kinetic energy is equal to its momentum energy.\n    KE_ν = pc ≈ 29.8 MeV.\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the muon (KE_μ):**\n    The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest energy (KE = E - mc²).\n    KE_μ = E_π - E_ν - m_μc²\n    KE_μ = 139.6 MeV - 29.8 MeV - 105.7 MeV\n    KE_μ = 4.1 MeV.\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. This matches the values in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
