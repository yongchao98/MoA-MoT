    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.\n\nThe standard notation for elemental abundance ratios in astronomy is [A/B], defined as:\n[A/B] = log₁₀(Nₐ/Nₑ)ₛₜₐᵣ - log₁₀(Nₐ/Nₑ)ₛᵤₙ\nwhere Nₐ and Nₑ are the number densities of elements A and B.\n\nA useful identity derived from this definition is:\n[A/B] = [A/H] - [B/H]\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the two stars. In the context of stellar photospheres, this is interpreted as the ratio of their silicon abundances relative to hydrogen, which is the primary component of a star. We need to find the value of (n_Si₁/n_H₁) / (n_Si₂/n_H₂).\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the silicon abundance of Star_1, [Si/H]₁.**\nWe are given the following for Star_1:\n*   [Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3 dex\n*   [Fe/H]₁ = 0 dex\n\nUsing the identity [A/B] = [A/H] - [B/H], we can write:\n[Si/Fe]₁ = [Si/H]₁ - [Fe/H]₁\nSubstituting the given values:\n0.3 = [Si/H]₁ - 0\nTherefore, the silicon abundance for Star_1 is:\n[Si/H]₁ = 0.3 dex\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the silicon abundance of Star_2, [Si/H]₂.**\nWe are given the following for Star_2:\n*   [Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3 dex\n*   [Mg/H]₂ = 0 dex\n\nUsing the same identity:\n[Mg/Si]₂ = [Mg/H]₂ - [Si/H]₂\nSubstituting the given values:\n0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]₂\nTherefore, the silicon abundance for Star_2 is:\n[Si/H]₂ = -0.3 dex\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the ratio of the silicon abundances.**\nWe have the silicon abundances of each star relative to the Sun:\n1.  [Si/H]₁ = log₁₀(n_Si₁/n_H₁) - log₁₀(n_Si/n_H)_sun = 0.3\n2.  [Si/H]₂ = log₁₀(n_Si₂/n_H₂) - log₁₀(n_Si/n_H)_sun = -0.3\n\nLet A₁ = (n_Si₁/n_H₁) and A₂ = (n_Si₂/n_H₂). We want to find the ratio A₁/A₂.\nFrom the equations above:\n*   log₁₀(A₁) = 0.3 + log₁₀(n_Si/n_H)_sun\n*   log₁₀(A₂) = -0.3 + log₁₀(n_Si/n_H)_sun\n\nTo find the ratio A₁/A₂, we can subtract the second logarithmic equation from the first:\nlog₁₀(A₁) - log₁₀(A₂) = (0.3 + log₁₀(n_Si/n_H)_sun) - (-0.3 + log₁₀(n_Si/n_H)_sun)\nlog₁₀(A₁/A₂) = 0.3 - (-0.3)\nlog₁₀(A₁/A₂) = 0.6\n\nTo find the final ratio, we take the antilogarithm:\nA₁/A₂ = 10⁰.⁶\nA₁/A₂ ≈ 3.981\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9. The information regarding the stellar masses and the specific solar abundances of Fe and Mg are not required for this calculation.\n\nThe calculated ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately 3.9.\n\n<<<B>>>"
