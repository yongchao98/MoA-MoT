    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1\n\nToluene is treated with a mixture of nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a classic electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction known as nitration. The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an ortho-, para-directing group. The reaction yields a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. Due to less steric hindrance, the major product is para-nitrotoluene.\n\n*   **Product 1:** p-Nitrotoluene\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2\n\nProduct 1 (p-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This combination of reagents is used for oxidation. While strong oxidizing agents like potassium permanganate (KMnO₄) are commonly used to oxidize the methyl group of toluene derivatives to a carboxylic acid, the reaction conditions are important. However, a more plausible reaction, especially to form a suitable substrate for the next step, is the oxidation of the methyl group to an aldehyde. The MnO₂/H₂SO₄ mixture can oxidize p-nitrotoluene to p-nitrobenzaldehyde. This is a more likely intermediate for the subsequent reaction with acetone.\n\n*   **Product 2:** p-Nitrobenzaldehyde\n\n### Step 3: Formation of Product 3\n\nProduct 2 (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This reaction is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, specifically known as the Claisen-Schmidt condensation. In this reaction, the base (NaOH) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from acetone to form an enolate ion. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde, which lacks α-hydrogens and thus can only act as the electrophile. The initial aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone. The major isomer formed is the trans (E) isomer due to its greater stability.\n\n*   **Product 3:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one\n\nThe structure of Product 3 is a planar molecule with a nitro group and a butenone group attached in the para positions of the benzene ring.\n\n### Step 4: Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3\n\nTo determine the molecular symmetry group (point group) of (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one, we must identify its symmetry elements.\n\n1.  **Identity (E):** Present in all molecules.\n2.  **Proper Rotation Axis (Cₙ):** There is no axis of rotation (other than C₁) that leaves the molecule unchanged. For example, a C₂ rotation through the center of the benzene ring would move the butenone group to the nitro group's position and vice-versa, which are not equivalent.\n3.  **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not possess a center of inversion.\n4.  **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** The molecule is essentially planar. The plane containing the benzene ring, the C=C double bond, the carbonyl group (C=O), and the nitro group (NO₂) acts as a plane of symmetry. This plane bisects the methyl group (CH₃).\n5.  **Improper Rotation Axis (Sₙ):** Since there are no Cₙ axes (for n>1), there can be no Sₙ axes.\n\nThe molecule possesses only two symmetry elements: the identity (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ). A molecule with only these two symmetry elements belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\n<<<D>>>"
