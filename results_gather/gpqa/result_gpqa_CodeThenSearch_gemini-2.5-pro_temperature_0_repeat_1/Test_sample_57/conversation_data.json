    "Based on the analysis of the provided options, Superstring Theory is the only theory that is understood to be free of ultraviolet divergences, and therefore does not require regularization at high energies.\n\n*   **A) Superstring Theory:** Supersymmetric string theories are believed to be completely free of any ultraviolet divergences. Instead of the point-particle interactions of quantum field theory which lead to infinities, string theory's fundamental objects are extended strings, which \"smears out\" the interactions and avoids these divergences. It is stated that superstring theory does not have a perturbative regulator because it has no ultraviolet divergences.\n\n*   **B) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** QED was the first quantum field theory where the need for regularization and renormalization became apparent. Calculations involving loop diagrams in QED lead to infinite results, which must be handled by introducing a regulator.\n\n*   **C) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** As a quantum field theory describing the strong force, QCD also suffers from ultraviolet divergences in perturbative calculations. Various regularization schemes, such as dimensional regularization and lattice regularization, are essential tools in making calculations in QCD.\n\n*   **D) Classical Electrodynamics:** The problem of infinities first arose in classical electrodynamics with the concept of a point-like electron. The self-energy of a classical point charge is infinite, indicating a breakdown of the theory at very small distances (high energies) and necessitating a form of regularization.\n\nTherefore, Superstring Theory is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
