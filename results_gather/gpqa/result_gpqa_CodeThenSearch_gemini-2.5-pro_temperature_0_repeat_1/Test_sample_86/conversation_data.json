    "The problem asks to identify the correct 1H NMR data for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound containing 8 carbon atoms, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** A 6-membered aromatic ring implies a benzene core (C6). Since it's di-substituted, its formula is C6H4.\n*   **Total Carbons:** The compound has 8 carbon atoms in total. The benzene ring accounts for 6, so the two substituents together must contribute 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups:** The compound contains a carbonyl group (C=O) and a halogen bonded directly to the aromatic ring (-X).\n\nLet's deduce the two substituents:\n1.  One substituent is the halogen atom (-X).\n2.  The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The only common and stable substituent that fits this description is an acetyl group, -C(=O)CH3.\n\nCombining these parts, the molecular structure is a haloacetophenone: X-C6H4-C(=O)CH3. This structure has 8 carbons (6 in the ring, 2 in the acetyl group), a di-substituted aromatic ring, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Possible Isomers and Predict their 1H NMR Spectra\n\nThe two substituents (-X and -COCH3) can be arranged in ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) positions on the benzene ring.\n\n*   **General 1H NMR Features:**\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** The three protons of the methyl group are adjacent to a carbonyl group. They will appear as a single sharp peak (a singlet, 's') because there are no protons on the adjacent carbonyl carbon. The typical chemical shift (δ) for such a group is around 2.0-2.7 ppm.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are four protons on the di-substituted ring. Their chemical shifts will be in the aromatic region (typically 7.0-8.5 ppm), and their splitting pattern depends on the substitution pattern.\n\n*   **Predicting Patterns for Isomers:**\n    *   **Ortho/Meta Isomers:** These isomers lack symmetry and would result in four distinct and complex signals for the four aromatic protons.\n    *   **Para Isomer (1,4-substitution):** This isomer has a plane of symmetry. This symmetry makes the two protons ortho to the acetyl group equivalent to each other, and the two protons ortho to the halogen group equivalent to each other. This typically results in a pattern of two doublets ('d'), each integrating to two protons (2H).\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Given 1H NMR Options\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks the required four aromatic protons in the typical 7.0-8.5 ppm region. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **2.3 (3H, s):** This is a singlet integrating to three protons, which is perfectly consistent with the methyl group of an acetyl substituent (-COCH3). The chemical shift of 2.3 ppm is within the expected range.\n    *   **7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d):** This pattern of two doublets, each for two protons, is the classic signature of a para-substituted (1,4-substituted) benzene ring. The chemical shifts are in the correct downfield region for an aromatic ring with two electron-withdrawing groups. For example, the reported spectrum for 4'-Chloroacetophenone shows signals at δ 7.91 (d, 2H), 7.45 (d, 2H), and 2.61 (s, 3H). The data in this option is highly consistent with a para-haloacetophenone structure.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum does not show any signals in the aromatic proton region. This option is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe data presented in option C perfectly matches the predicted 1H NMR spectrum for a para-haloacetophenone. It correctly identifies the singlet for the methyl ketone group and the characteristic pair of doublets for the para-substituted aromatic protons.\n\n<<<C>>>"
