    "To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to calculate the total mass of each binary system and then find their ratio.\n\nThe total mass (M_total = m₁ + m₂) of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system can be determined from the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves (K₁ and K₂) of the two stars. The relationship is derived from Kepler's Third Law. For an eclipsing binary, the inclination of the orbit (i) is close to 90°, which means sin(i) is approximately 1. This simplifies the mass calculation.\n\nThe formula for the total mass is:\nM_total = [P * (K₁ + K₂)^3] / [2πG * sin³(i)]\n\nSince both systems are eclipsing, we can assume sin³(i) ≈ 1 for both. The term 2πG is a constant that will cancel out when we take the ratio of the masses. Therefore, the total mass is proportional to P * (K_total)³.\n\nM_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)^3\n\nLet's calculate this value for each system.\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Orbital Period (P₁): 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total,1): 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Orbital Period (P₂): 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total,2): 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M₁) to the total mass of system_2 (M₂):\n\nRatio = M₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K_total,1)³] / [P₂ * (K_total,2)³]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nRatio = (2 years / 1 year) * (15 km/s / 25 km/s)³\nRatio = 2 * (3/5)³\nRatio = 2 * (27 / 125)\nRatio = 54 / 125\nRatio = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\nTherefore, system_1 is about 0.432 times as massive as system_2. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
