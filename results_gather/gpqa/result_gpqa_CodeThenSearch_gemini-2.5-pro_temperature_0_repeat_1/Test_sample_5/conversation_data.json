    "To find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle, we first need to express the given potential in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\nV(r, θ) = ½ kr² + ³⁄₂ kr² cos²(θ)\n\nWe can convert this to Cartesian coordinates (x, y) using the relations x = r cos(θ) and r² = x² + y².\n\nSubstituting these into the potential energy equation:\nV(x, y) = ½ k(x² + y²) + ³⁄₂ k(x²)\nV(x, y) = ½ kx² + ½ ky² + ³⁄₂ kx²\nV(x, y) = (½ k + ³⁄₂ k)x² + ½ ky²\nV(x, y) = 2kx² + ½ ky²\n\nThis potential represents a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The potential is separable, meaning it can be written as a sum of potentials for each coordinate: V(x, y) = Vₓ(x) + Vᵧ(y), where Vₓ(x) = 2kx² and Vᵧ(y) = ½ ky².\n\nBecause the potential is separable, the total energy E is the sum of the energies for the motion in the x and y directions: E = Eₓ + Eᵧ.\n\nThe energy for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with potential V(z) = ½ mω²z² is given by Eₙ = (n + ½)ħω.\n\nFor the x-direction:\nThe potential is Vₓ(x) = 2kx². Comparing this to the standard form V(x) = ½ mωₓ²x², we find:\n½ mωₓ² = 2k\nωₓ² = 4k/m\nωₓ = 2√(k/m)\n\nThe energy in the x-direction is:\nEₙₓ = (nₓ + ½)ħωₓ = (nₓ + ½)ħ(2√(k/m)) = (2nₓ + 1)ħ√(k/m)\n\nFor the y-direction:\nThe potential is Vᵧ(y) = ½ ky². Comparing this to the standard form V(y) = ½ mωᵧ²y², we find:\n½ mωᵧ² = ½ k\nωᵧ² = k/m\nωᵧ = √(k/m)\n\nThe energy in the y-direction is:\nEₙᵧ = (nᵧ + ½)ħωᵧ = (nᵧ + ½)ħ√(k/m)\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of the energies in the x and y directions.\nE = Eₙₓ + Eₙᵧ\nE = (2nₓ + 1)ħ√(k/m) + (nᵧ + ½)ħ√(k/m)\nE = (2nₓ + 1 + nᵧ + ½)ħ√(k/m)\nE = (2nₓ + nᵧ + ³⁄₂)ħ√(k/m)\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
