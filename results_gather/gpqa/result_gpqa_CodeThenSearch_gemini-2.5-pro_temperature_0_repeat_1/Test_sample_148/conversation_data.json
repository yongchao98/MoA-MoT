    "The observations from both ¹H NMR and LC-MS point towards the presence of two distinct but closely related chemical species in a roughly equal ratio. Let's analyze the evidence in the context of the given options.\n\n### Analysis of the Observations:\n\n1.  **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Two peaks for the same alpha-proton:** In a pure, conformationally rigid compound, each unique proton should give a single peak (or a single multiplet due to spin-spin coupling). The presence of two peaks for a single proton indicates that this proton exists in two different chemical environments.\n    *   **Similar chemical shifts and equal integrals:** The similar chemical shifts suggest the two environments are very much alike. The equal integrals, summing to the expected 1H, indicate that the two species are present in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Spin-spin coupling ruled out:** This confirms the two peaks are not simply a splitting pattern of a single signal but represent two distinct populations of the proton.\n\n2.  **LC-MS Analysis:**\n    *   **Two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities:** Liquid chromatography (LC) separates compounds based on their physical properties. The presence of two peaks demonstrates that there are two separable chemical species in the sample. Their equal intensities corroborate the 1:1 ratio observed in the NMR.\n    *   **Same mass spectrum for both peaks:** Mass spectrometry (MS) provides the mass-to-charge ratio of a molecule. The fact that both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which matches the expected product, confirms that the two species are isomers (they have the same molecular formula and thus the same mass) and not an impurity with a different chemical formula.\n\n### Evaluating the Options:\n\n*   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** This is inconsistent with the LC-MS data. A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular weight and therefore a different mass spectrum.\n*   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable and give identical spectra. Therefore, you would not observe two separate peaks for the alpha-proton. While they can be separated on a chiral LC column, the NMR data makes this explanation highly unlikely.\n*   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical properties and are distinguishable by both NMR and chromatography.\n    *   In an NMR spectrum, corresponding protons in diastereomers are in different chemical environments and are expected to have different chemical shifts. This perfectly explains the two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n    *   Because they have different physical properties, diastereomers can be separated by standard liquid chromatography, explaining the two peaks in the LC trace.\n    *   Since they are isomers, they have the same mass, consistent with both LC peaks giving the same mass spectrum.\n    *   A common source of diastereoisomerism in peptides is restricted rotation around the amide (peptide) bond, leading to *cis* and *trans* isomers. These isomers, also known as rotamers or atropisomers, are a type of diastereomer and often exist in a mixture at room temperature, giving rise to doubled peaks in the NMR spectrum. The energy barrier to their interconversion can be high enough to allow for their separation by chromatography.\n*   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This is not a standard chemical term and does not provide a clear mechanistic explanation for the presence of two stable, isomeric species. The observations are classic indicators of isomerism, making a stereochemical explanation far more probable.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe evidence strongly supports the conclusion that the crude compound is a mixture of two diastereomers in a 1:1 ratio. These diastereomers are separable by LC and distinguishable by NMR, and as isomers, they share the same mass.\n\n<<<C>>>"
