    "To solve this problem, we must analyze the structure of each of the four candidate molecules and predict the splitting patterns in their ¹H NMR spectra. The key information is the presence of two specific complex signals: a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** and a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\nThe FTIR data, showing a broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ (O-H stretch) and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ (C=O stretch), confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. Since all four options are carboxylic acids, this information does not help differentiate between them. The identification must come from the ¹H NMR data.\n\nLet's analyze the splitting for a proton in each environment using the n+1 rule, where a proton's signal is split by 'n' neighboring, non-equivalent protons.\n*   A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: one proton (giving a doublet), a group of two equivalent protons (giving a triplet), and a group of three equivalent protons (giving a quartet).\n*   A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: one proton (giving a doublet), a group of two equivalent protons (giving a triplet), and another, non-equivalent group of two equivalent protons (giving another triplet).\n\nNow, let's examine each candidate:\n\n**A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-Dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n```\n      CH₃   CH₃\n      |     |\nHOOC-CH₂-CH(b)-CH(c)-CH₃\n  1   2   3     4     5\n```\n*   Proton H(b) at C3 is coupled to the two protons at C2 (triplet) and the single proton at C4 (doublet). This signal would be a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n*   Proton H(c) at C4 is coupled to the proton at C3 (doublet) and the three protons of the terminal methyl group at C5 (quartet). This signal would be a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\nThis molecule does not show a dtq or a dtt.\n\n**B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-Diethylpentanoic acid)**\n```\n      C₂H₅    C₂H₅\n      |       |\nHOOC-CH(a)----CH(b)----CH₂CH₃\n  1   2       3        4  5\n```\n*   Proton H(b) at C3 is coupled to:\n    *   The single proton at C2 (H(a)) → doublet\n    *   The two protons of the ethyl group on C3 → triplet\n    *   The two protons of the main chain at C4 → triplet\n    This signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n*   Let's check for a dtq. No other proton in this molecule is coupled to a combination of 1, 2, and 3 protons. For example, the proton H(a) at C2 is coupled to H(b) (doublet) and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (triplet), giving a **doublet of triplets (dt)**. The various CH₂ groups are coupled to one proton and three protons, giving **doublet of quartets (dq)** signals.\nThis molecule has a `dtt` but not a `dtq`.\n\n**C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-Diethylpentanoic acid)**\n```\n      C₂H₅    C₂H₅\n      |       |\nHOOC-CH₂-CH(b)----CH(c)----CH₃\n  1   2   3       4        5\n```\n*   Proton H(c) at C4 is coupled to:\n    *   The single proton at C3 (H(b)) → doublet\n    *   The two protons of the ethyl group on C4 → triplet\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group at C5 → quartet\n    This signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   Now let's check for a dtt. Let's analyze proton H(b) at C3. It is coupled to:\n    *   The single proton at C4 (H(c)) → doublet\n    *   The two protons at C2 → triplet\n    *   The two protons of the ethyl group on C3 → triplet\n    This signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. (Note: some might label this a triplet of doublets of triplets (tdt), but the key is that it is coupled to one proton, a set of two protons, and another set of two protons).\n\nSince this molecule, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, is the only one that gives rise to both a `dtq` signal (from the proton at C4) and a `dtt` signal (from the proton at C3), it is the correct structure.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-Dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n```\n      CH₃   CH₃\n      |     |\nHOOC-CH(a)-CH(b)-CH₂CH₃\n  1   2     3     4  5\n```\n*   Proton H(a) at C2 is coupled only to the proton at C3 (doublet).\n*   Proton H(b) at C3 is coupled to the proton at C2 (doublet) and the two protons at C4 (triplet). This signal would be a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\nThis molecule does not show a dtq or a dtt.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, only compound C matches the provided NMR data.\n\n<<<C>>>"
