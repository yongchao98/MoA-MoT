    "The problem asks to identify Compound X (C11H12O) based on a reaction it undergoes and the NMR data of the resulting product.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reaction Conditions\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Compound X with the molecular formula C11H12O.\n*   **Reagents:** 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), a non-nucleophilic base.\n*   **Conditions:** Nonpolar solvent, high temperature (403 K or 130 °C), and long duration (1 day).\n\nThese conditions are characteristic of a base-catalyzed rearrangement. Specifically, the use of DABCO at high temperatures is known to promote the Meinwald rearrangement of epoxides into carbonyl compounds. The reaction involves the isomerization of an epoxide to a ketone or aldehyde.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Structure of the Product from NMR Data\n\nThe provided ¹H-NMR and ¹³C-NMR spectra are for the product of the reaction.\n\n*   **¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 197.7 (1C, s):** This signal is in the characteristic range for a carbonyl carbon, specifically a ketone.\n    *   **δ 126.9 (2C, s) to 144.1 (1C, s):** Six signals in this region indicate an aromatic ring. The presence of two signals that each account for two carbons (126.9 and 129.1 ppm) strongly suggests a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   **δ 21.3 (1C, s) and 28.4 (1C, s):** These are aliphatic carbons. Given their chemical shifts and the other structural features, they are likely methyl groups.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 7.71 (2H, d) and 7.08 (2H, d):** This A'A'B'B' pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n    *   **δ 7.68 (1H, d) and 6.75 (1H, d):** These two doublets in the vinyl region indicate two protons on a double bond that are coupled to each other, likely in a *trans* configuration due to the expected large coupling constant.\n    *   **δ 2.28 (3H, s) and 2.31 (3H, s):** These two sharp singlets, each integrating to three protons, correspond to two methyl groups that have no adjacent protons. One is likely attached to the aromatic ring (a tolyl group), and the other is likely an acetyl methyl group (-C(=O)CH₃).\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    Based on the NMR analysis, the product contains:\n    1.  A ketone group.\n    2.  A para-substituted benzene ring with a methyl group (a *p*-tolyl group).\n    3.  A second methyl group attached to the ketone (an acetyl group).\n    4.  A *trans*-disubstituted carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n    The only structure that fits all these features and has the molecular formula C11H12O is **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**, also known as 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n    Product Structure: CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃\n\n### Step 3: Identify Compound X by Relating it to the Product\n\nThe reaction is a rearrangement of Compound X (an epoxide) to 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. We need to determine which of the given options for Compound X would yield this specific product. This type of base-catalyzed epoxide isomerization is known as the Meinwald rearrangement.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\n*   **A) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** The name is ambiguous, and if interpreted as 2-methyl-3-(phenylethenyl)oxirane, the molecular formula (C₁₀H₁₀O) does not match C₁₁H₁₂O.\n*   **B) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** This name most systematically refers to 2-[2-(4-methylphenyl)ethenyl]oxirane.\n    *   **Formula:** C₁₁H₁₂O. This matches.\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂. This is a terminal vinylic epoxide.\n    *   **Rearrangement:** DABCO acts as a base to deprotonate the most acidic proton, which is on the carbon of the epoxide ring adjacent to the vinyl group. The resulting anion undergoes ring-opening to form an enolate, which then tautomerizes to the final ketone product.\n        CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂ → [Base] → CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(O⁻)=CH₂ (Enolate) → [Tautomerization] → CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This mechanism correctly predicts the formation of 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n*   **C) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:**\n    *   **Formula:** C₁₁H₁₂O. This matches.\n    *   **Structure:** [Ph-CH=C(CH₃)]-CH(O)CH₂.\n    *   **Rearrangement:** This would rearrange to 3-methyl-4-phenylpent-3-en-2-one. The NMR spectrum of this product would be significantly different (e.g., only one vinyl proton, which would be a singlet), and it lacks the *p*-tolyl group.\n*   **D) 2-styrylepoxide:** This is likely 2-(phenylethenyl)oxirane, which has the formula C₁₀H₁₀O and is therefore incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the product of the reaction is 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. The only starting material, Compound X, that has the correct molecular formula and would rearrange to this specific product under the given conditions is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<B>>>"
