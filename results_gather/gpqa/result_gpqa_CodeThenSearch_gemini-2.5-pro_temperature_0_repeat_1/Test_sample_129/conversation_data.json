    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of large neutral hydrogen clouds that absorb light at the Lyman-alpha wavelength, allowing for their detection by ground-based optical telescopes, we must consider the wavelength ranges involved.\n\nThe Lyman-alpha transition of neutral hydrogen occurs at a wavelength of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å). This wavelength falls within the ultraviolet (UV) portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Earth's atmosphere is largely opaque to UV radiation, meaning this light cannot reach ground-based telescopes directly.\n\nFor these absorption features to be detectable from the ground, the light must be redshifted into the optical part of the spectrum, which is accessible through the Earth's \"atmospheric window\". The optical spectrum visible to ground-based telescopes begins at approximately 3800 Å to 4000 Å.\n\nThe relationship between redshift (z), the emitted wavelength (λ_emitted), and the observed wavelength (λ_observed) is given by the formula:\n\n1 + z = λ_observed / λ_emitted\n\nTo find the minimum redshift, we set λ_emitted to 1216 Å and λ_observed to the minimum wavelength detectable by ground-based optical telescopes, approximately 4000 Å.\n\n1 + z = 4000 Å / 1216 Å\n1 + z ≈ 3.29\nz ≈ 2.29\n\nThis calculation provides an estimated lower limit for the redshift. Now, let's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) 2.4:** A redshift of 2.4 would shift the Lyman-alpha line to an observed wavelength of 1216 Å * (1 + 2.4) = 4134.4 Å. This wavelength is within the observable optical range for ground-based telescopes.\n*   **B) 3:** A redshift of 3 would result in an observed wavelength of 1216 Å * (1 + 3) = 4864 Å, which is also well within the optical range.\n*   **C) 1.2:** This redshift would shift the line to 1216 Å * (1 + 1.2) = 2675.2 Å, which is still in the ultraviolet and would be blocked by the atmosphere.\n*   **D) 1.9:** This redshift corresponds to an observed wavelength of 1216 Å * (1 + 1.9) = 3526.4 Å. This is in the near-UV and would still be significantly absorbed by the atmosphere, making it very difficult to detect from the ground.\n\nComparing the calculated minimum redshift of ~2.29 with the options, the lowest value that ensures the Lyman-alpha line is shifted into the visible spectrum is 2.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
