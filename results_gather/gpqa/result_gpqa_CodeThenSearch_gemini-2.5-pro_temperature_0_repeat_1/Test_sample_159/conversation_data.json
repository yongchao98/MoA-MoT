    "An N-sided polygon with an infinitely large number of sides (N → ∞) and a constant apothem 'a' approximates a circle. The apothem of this polygon becomes the radius of the resulting circle. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nIn the far-field region, the diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central disk, called the Airy disk, surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The angular positions of the minima (dark rings) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function.\n\nFor a circular aperture of diameter D, the angular positions (θ) of the diffraction minima are given by the formula:\nsin(θ) ≈ θ = m * (λ / D)\n\nWhere:\n*   λ is the wavelength of the monochromatic light.\n*   D is the diameter of the aperture.\n*   m is a coefficient corresponding to the order of the minimum.\n\nIn this problem, the apothem 'a' becomes the radius of the circular aperture, so the diameter D = 2a.\n\nThe values of the coefficient 'm' for the first few minima are approximately:\n*   First minimum (m₁): 1.220\n*   Second minimum (m₂): 2.233\n\nUsing the small angle approximation (sin(θ) ≈ θ), we can find the angular positions of the first two minima:\n\n*   **Angular position of the first minimum (θ₁):**\n    θ₁ = 1.220 * (λ / D) = 1.220 * (λ / 2a) = 0.610 * (λ / a)\n\n*   **Angular position of the second minimum (θ₂):**\n    θ₂ = 2.233 * (λ / D) = 2.233 * (λ / 2a) ≈ 1.1165 * (λ / a)\n\nThe question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is the difference between their angular positions (Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁).\n\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (1.1165 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\nΔθ = (1.1165 - 0.610) * (λ / a)\nΔθ = 0.5065 * (λ / a)\n\nThis value is approximately 0.506 λ / a.\n\n<<<A>>>"
