    "Assuming stars are distributed uniformly in space, the number of stars per unit volume is constant. Let's denote this constant number density as ρ.\n\nThe number of stars, dN, within a thin spherical shell of radius *r* and thickness *dr* is given by the volume of the shell multiplied by the star density:\ndN = 4πr² * ρ * dr\n\nThe parallax, *plx*, is inversely proportional to the distance, *r*. We can write this relationship as:\nr = 1/plx\n\nTo find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (dN/d(plx)) changes with parallax, we need to express *r* and *dr* in terms of *plx*.\n\nFrom r = 1/plx, we can find the differential *dr* by differentiating *r* with respect to *plx*:\ndr/d(plx) = -1/plx²\nSo, dr = - (1/plx²) d(plx)\n\nThe negative sign indicates that as the distance *r* increases, the parallax *plx* decreases. For our purpose of counting stars in a shell, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign.\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for *r* and *dr* into the equation for dN:\ndN = 4π(1/plx)² * ρ * (1/plx²) d(plx)\ndN = (4πρ / plx⁴) d(plx)\n\nTo find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide by d(plx):\ndN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴\n\nSince 4, π, and ρ are constants, we can see the relationship:\ndN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax as approximately 1/plx⁴.\n\n<<<B>>>"
