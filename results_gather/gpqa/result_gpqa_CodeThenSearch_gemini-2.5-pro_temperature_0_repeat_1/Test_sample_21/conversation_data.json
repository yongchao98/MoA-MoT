    "Based on the provided information, here is the correct combination to complete the statement:\n\n**Thermodynamic Analysis:**\n\nTo determine if oxygen is a stronger or weaker oxidant in a basic solution, we must compare its standard reduction potential (E°) in both acidic and basic conditions. A more positive reduction potential indicates a stronger oxidant.\n\n*   In an **acidic solution**, the reduction of oxygen is: O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l), with a standard potential of **+1.23 V**.\n*   In a **basic solution**, the reduction of oxygen is: O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq), with a standard potential of **+0.40 V**.\n\nSince the standard reduction potential of oxygen is lower in a basic solution (+0.40 V) compared to an acidic solution (+1.23 V), it is thermodynamically a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n\n**Kinetic Analysis:**\n\nTo determine if oxygen reacts faster or slower in acidic solutions, we look at the kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).\n\n*   The oxygen reduction reaction is known for having slow (sluggish) kinetics.\n*   Sources indicate that alkaline (basic) media promote faster electron transfer kinetics for the ORR compared to acidic media. One reason for this is the corrosive nature of acidic environments and the complexities of proton-coupled electron transfer.\n*   Therefore, kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe correct words to complete the sentence are **weaker** and **slower**.\n\nThermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
