    "Here is a step-by-step calculation of the enthalpy of formation.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure\n\nFirst, we identify the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n*   **Carbon (C) atoms:** There are 12 carbon atoms.\n*   **Hydrogen (H) atoms:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms.\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n### Step 2: Count the Chemical Bonds\n\nNext, we count the number of each type of bond in the molecule to calculate its total bond energy.\n*   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 C-H bonds.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** There are 2 C=C bonds.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** There are 9 C-C bonds.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization of the compound is the energy required to break all of its bonds. Using the provided bond energies:\n*   Energy from C-H bonds = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from C=C bonds = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from C-C bonds = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol\n\nTotal Enthalpy of Atomization (Compound) = 8800 + 600 + 1800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements\n\nThis is the energy required to convert the elements in their standard state (12 moles of solid carbon and 11 moles of H2 gas) into gaseous atoms.\n*   **For Carbon:** The enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol.\n    *   Energy for 12 moles of Carbon = 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ.\n*   **For Hydrogen:** The bond energy of H-H is 100 kJ/mol. This is the energy to form 2 moles of H atoms from 1 mole of H2. We need to form 22 moles of H atoms, which requires 11 moles of H2.\n    *   Energy for 22 moles of Hydrogen = 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ.\n\nTotal Enthalpy of Atomization (Elements) = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the enthalpy of atomization of the elements and the enthalpy of atomization of the compound.\n*   ΔH_f = (Enthalpy of atomization of elements) - (Enthalpy of atomization of compound)\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n### Step 6: Convert to kJ/g\n\nThe options provided include units of kJ/g. To compare our result, we convert it using the molar mass of C12H22.\n*   Molar Mass of C12H22 = (12 * 12.0 g/mol) + (22 * 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n*   ΔH_f in kJ/g = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options, option B matches our calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
