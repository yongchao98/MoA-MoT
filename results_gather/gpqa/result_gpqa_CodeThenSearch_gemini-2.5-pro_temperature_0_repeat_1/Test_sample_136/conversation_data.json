    "To determine the number of revolutions the proton makes in the synchrocyclotron, we need to calculate the energy gained per revolution and divide the final kinetic energy by this value.\n\n1.  **Energy Gained per Acceleration:**\n    The energy gained by a charged particle when it passes through a potential difference `U` is given by `ΔE = qU`. For a proton, the charge `q` is equal to the elementary charge `e`. The accelerating voltage is given as a sinusoidal function `U(t) = U₀ cos(2πν(α)t + Φ₀)`. The energy gained during each acceleration depends on the phase of the voltage when the proton crosses the accelerating gap. The problem provides a phase constant `Φ₀ = π/4`. This represents the synchronous phase at which the proton is accelerated. Therefore, the energy gained in a single acceleration event is:\n    `ΔE_accel = e * U₀ * cos(Φ₀)`\n\n2.  **Energy Gained per Revolution:**\n    The problem states that the proton \"undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator.\" In a typical cyclotron or synchrocyclotron, particles are accelerated twice per revolution as they cross the gap between the two \"D\"-shaped electrodes (dees) or as they enter and leave a single dee. Thus, the total energy gained in one full revolution is twice the energy gained in a single acceleration.\n    `ΔE_rev = 2 * ΔE_accel = 2 * e * U₀ * cos(Φ₀)`\n\n3.  **Calculation:**\n    We are given:\n    *   Final kinetic energy, `T₁ = 950 MeV = 950,000 keV`\n    *   Peak voltage, `U₀ = 190 kV`\n    *   Synchronous phase, `Φ₀ = π/4`\n\n    First, let's calculate the energy gained per revolution in units of keV:\n    `ΔE_rev = 2 * (190 keV) * cos(π/4)`\n    Since `cos(π/4) = 1/√2 ≈ 0.7071`,\n    `ΔE_rev = 380 * (1/√2) keV ≈ 268.7 keV`\n\n4.  **Number of Revolutions:**\n    The total number of revolutions `N` is the total kinetic energy gained divided by the energy gained per revolution.\n    `N = T₁ / ΔE_rev`\n    `N = 950,000 keV / (380 * cos(π/4) keV)`\n    `N ≈ 950,000 / 268.7`\n    `N ≈ 3535.5`\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, the proton makes approximately 3536 revolutions.\n\n<<<A>>>"
