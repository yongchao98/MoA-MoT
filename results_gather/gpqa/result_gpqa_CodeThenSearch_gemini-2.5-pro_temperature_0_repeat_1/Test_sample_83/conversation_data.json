    "When solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods, the semi-discretization process leads to a system of first-order ordinary differential equations. The solution of this system involves the computation of a matrix exponential function. To efficiently handle this computation, especially in a parallel computing environment, a fractional approximation of the matrix exponential is employed.\n\nThe core principle that facilitates the conversion of a sequential algorithm into a parallel one is the decomposition of the fractional approximation into a sum of simpler terms through partial fraction expansion. This mathematical technique breaks down the complex rational function into a linear combination of simpler fractions. Each of these simpler terms can then be solved independently and concurrently on separate processors. After the individual computations are complete, their results are combined to obtain the final solution.\n\nThis approach is highlighted in various studies where parallel algorithms are developed for solving the heat equation. The use of a rational approximation with distinct real poles for the matrix exponential function is a common strategy, which readily allows for parallelization via partial fraction expansion. Each term in the partial fraction expansion corresponds to a system of linear equations that can be solved in parallel.\n\nTherefore, the key factor in converting the sequential algorithm into a parallel one is the ability to express the fractional approximation as a linear combination of terms that can be processed independently.\n\n<<<A>>>"
