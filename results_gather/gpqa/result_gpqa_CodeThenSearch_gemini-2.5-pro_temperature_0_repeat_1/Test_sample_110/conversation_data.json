    "The analysis of the two reactions is based on fundamental principles of organic chemistry, specifically the Michael addition.\n\n**Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a classic Michael addition reaction.\n2.  **Reactants:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** The enolate of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is strong and will deprotonate the ketone at the α-carbon. The ketone has two α-carbons, C2 and C6. C2 is a quaternary carbon with no protons. C6 has one acidic proton. Therefore, the enolate will form exclusively at C6.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate, an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n3.  **Mechanism:** The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. A subsequent protonation step yields the final product.\n4.  **Product Structure:** A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. The resulting product is 6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n5.  **Nomenclature:** To match the options provided, the product must be named as a propanoate derivative. This requires renumbering the cyclohexyl ring. If the point of attachment to the propanoate chain is designated as C1 of the ring, then the original C6 becomes the new C1. Consequently, the original C1 (carbonyl carbon) becomes the new C2, and the original C2 becomes the new C3.\n    *   New C1 has a methyl group and the propanoate substituent.\n    *   New C2 has the oxo group.\n    *   New C3 has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    This corresponds to the name: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition.\n2.  **Reactants:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** The nitronate anion of 1-nitropropane. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the carbon alpha to the nitro group (C1 of 1-nitropropane), which is the most acidic position.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n3.  **Mechanism:** The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the butenenitrile. Protonation follows to give the final product.\n4.  **Product Structure:** A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C1 of the 1-nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile. The resulting structure is `CH3-CH2-CH(NO2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN`.\n5.  **Nomenclature:** The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the compound is named as a nitrile. The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon has six carbons, making it a hexanenitrile. Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon:\n    *   `CN(1)-CH2(2)-CH(CH3)(3)-CH(NO2)(4)-CH2(5)-CH3(6)`\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    The correct IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these products with the given options:\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A, Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct A, Correct B**)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A, Correct B)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Correct A, Incorrect B)\n\nTherefore, option B correctly identifies both major products.\n\n<<<B>>>"
