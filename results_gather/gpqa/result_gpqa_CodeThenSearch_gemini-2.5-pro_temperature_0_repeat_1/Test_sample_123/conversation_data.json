    "This problem can be solved using the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and the law of radioactive decay.\n\n### 1. The Physics of Particle Decay\n\nThe fraction of particles, N/N₀, that remain after a time *t* in the laboratory's frame of reference is given by the exponential decay law:\n\nN/N₀ = e<sup>(-t / τ_lab)</sup>\n\nHere, τ_lab is the particle's lifetime as measured in the lab. Due to time dilation, this lifetime is longer than the particle's \"proper lifetime\" (τ), which is its lifetime in its own rest frame. The relationship is given by:\n\nτ_lab = γ * τ\n\nwhere γ is the Lorentz factor.\n\nThe time *t* it takes for the particles to travel from the center to the inner wall of the detector is the radius (R) divided by the particle's velocity (v). Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity is approximately the speed of light (c).\n\nt ≈ R / c\n\nBy substituting these into the decay equation, we get the fraction of particles that reach the detector:\n\nN/N₀ = e<sup>(-R / (c * γ * τ))</sup>\n\n### 2. Using the Given Information\n\nWe are given two scenarios.\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor (γ₁): ~20\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector (N/N₀)₁: 1/3\n*   Detector radius (R): 30 m\n\nPlugging these values into our equation:\n\n1/3 = e<sup>(-30 / (c * 20 * τ))</sup>\n\nLet's simplify the constant part of the exponent, `30 / (c * τ)`, into a single constant `k`.\n\n1/3 = e<sup>(-k / 20)</sup>\n\nWe can solve for `k` by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(1/3) = -k / 20\n-ln(3) = -k / 20\nk = 20 * ln(3)\n\n### 3. Calculating the New Lorentz Factor\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   Target fraction of particles (N/N₀)₂: 2/3\n*   Required Lorentz factor (γ₂): ?\n\nWe use the same decay equation with the new desired fraction and the constant `k` we just found:\n\n2/3 = e<sup>(-k / γ₂)</sup>\n\nAgain, we take the natural logarithm:\n\nln(2/3) = -k / γ₂\n-ln(3/2) = -k / γ₂\nγ₂ = k / ln(3/2)\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for `k` that we found earlier:\n\nγ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)\n\n### 4. Final Calculation\n\nUsing the approximate values for the natural logarithms (ln(3) ≈ 1.0986 and ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055):\n\nγ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055\nγ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055\nγ₂ ≈ 54.19\n\nThis calculated value is very close to 54.\n\nTherefore, a Lorentz factor of approximately 54 is needed for about two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls.\n\n<<<C>>>"
