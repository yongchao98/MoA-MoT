    "To determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule, a systematic approach based on IUPAC nomenclature rules is required.\n\n### 1. Identify the Parent Structure\nThe molecule is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group, which is the highest priority functional group present. Therefore, the parent structure is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is designated as position C1.\n\n### 2. Determine the Positions of the Substituents\nBased on the description, we can map out the substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is at C1.\n*   **Carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl)** and a **cyano (-CN)** group are meta to the carboxylic acid and to each other. This places them at C3 and C5.\n*   A **methoxy group (-OCH3)** is para to the carboxylic acid, placing it at C4.\n*   A **hydroxyl (-OH)** and a **dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)** group are ortho to the carboxylic acid, placing them at C2 and C6.\n*   The methoxy group (at C4) and the hydroxyl group are both ortho to the nitrile group. If the nitrile (-CN) is at C5, its ortho positions are C4 and C6. This confirms the methoxy group is at C4 and places the **hydroxyl group (-OH)** at C6.\n*   With the hydroxyl group at C6, the remaining ortho position to the carboxylic acid (C2) must be occupied by the **dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2)**.\n*   This leaves C3 for the **carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl)** group and C5 for the **cyano (-CN)** group.\n\nThe resulting substitution pattern is:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n*   C3: -CHO (formyl)\n*   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n*   C5: -CN (cyano)\n*   C6: -OH (hydroxy)\n\n### 3. Number the Ring\nThe numbering starts at the principal functional group, the carboxylic acid (C1). We then number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants (position numbers).\n*   **Clockwise numbering:** Substituents are at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n*   **Counter-clockwise numbering:** Substituents are also at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\nSince both numbering directions result in the same set of locants, we must use alphabetical order of the substituent names as a tie-breaker. The substituent that comes first alphabetically is given the lower number.\n*   The substituents are: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, and **m**ethoxy.\n*   Comparing the two possible numbering schemes at the first point of difference (C2 vs. C6):\n    *   Clockwise: C2 is **d**imethylamino, C6 is **h**ydroxy.\n    *   Counter-clockwise: C2 is **h**ydroxy, C6 is **d**imethylamino.\n*   Since \"dimethylamino\" comes before \"hydroxy\" alphabetically, it is assigned the lower number, C2. Therefore, the clockwise numbering is correct.\n\n### 4. Assemble the Final Name\nThe substituents are listed in alphabetical order, preceded by their locants.\n1.  **c**yano (at C5)\n2.  **d**imethylamino (at C2)\n3.  **f**ormyl (at C3)\n4.  **h**ydroxy (at C6)\n5.  **m**ethoxy (at C4)\n\nCombining these in alphabetical order gives: **5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
