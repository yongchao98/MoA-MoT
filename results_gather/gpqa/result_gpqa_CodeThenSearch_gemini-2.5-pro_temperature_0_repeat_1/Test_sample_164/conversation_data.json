    "Based on the research, here is an evaluation of each statement:\n\n**A) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.**\nThis statement is correct. The Chevron Phillips chemical company utilizes a chromium-based catalyst for the trimerization of ethylene into 1-hexene. Chromium is a Group VIa transition metal. This 1-hexene is then used as a comonomer to introduce regular, short-chain branches into the polyethylene backbone. The process indeed uses specific activators, such as triethylaluminum.\n\n**B) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.**\nThis statement is also correct. Sasol operates a commercial plant in Lake Charles, Louisiana, that uses a proprietary process for the selective tetramerization of ethylene to produce 1-octene and 1-hexene. These alpha-olefins are key comonomers for producing branched polyethylene. Similarly, the Chevron Phillips technology is used in industrial applications. These represent industrial-scale systems that achieve the overall goal of producing branched polyethylene from ethylene.\n\n**C) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The \"essential additional reaction step\" is the oligomerization of ethylene (e.g., trimerization to 1-hexene). The industrially successful Chevron-Phillips process explicitly uses an aluminum-based activator, triethylaluminum (TEA), as a cocatalyst for their chromium-based trimerization catalyst.\n\n**D) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.**\nThis statement is correct. Palladium (a noble metal) catalysts, particularly α-diimine palladium complexes, are known to catalyze ethylene polymerization and can produce highly branched polyethylene through a \"chain-walking\" mechanism. However, the practical industrial application of these palladium-based systems is noted to be limited due to factors like their scarcity, lower activity, and the complexity and cost of the required ligands, making them generally too expensive for large-scale commodity polymer production.\n\nGiven that statements A, B, and D are all factually correct based on the research, there may be an ambiguity in the question's premise of having only one correct answer. However, if forced to choose the most direct and fundamental chemical statement among the options, statement A is a strong candidate as it describes the specific class of catalyst that is at the heart of a major industrial process for the key chemical transformation required.\n\nAfter careful re-evaluation of the prompt which implies a single best answer, statement A stands out as a direct, fundamental, and undisputed fact about the chemistry central to the problem described.\n\n<<<A>>>"
