    "The problem asks for the evaluation of the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field, ∫∇⋅f dV, within a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. The vector field f has a magnitude of 1/r² and is directed radially outward.\n\nThe vector field can be expressed in spherical coordinates as:\nf(r) = (1/r²) * r̂\nwhere r̂ is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the Divergence Theorem, also known as Gauss's Theorem. The Divergence Theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume V is equal to the surface integral of the vector field over the closed surface S that encloses the volume V.\n∫ᵥ (∇⋅f) dV = ∮ₛ (f ⋅ n) dS\n\nHere, S is the surface of the sphere of radius R, and n is the outward-pointing unit normal vector to the surface. For a sphere centered at the origin, the outward unit normal vector is the same as the radial unit vector, n = r̂.\n\nThe surface element dS in spherical coordinates is given by R²sin(θ)dθdφ.\n\nNow, we can set up the surface integral:\nThe dot product f ⋅ n is:\nf ⋅ n = (1/R²) r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1/R²\n\nThe surface integral becomes:\n∮ₛ (1/R²) dS\n\nSubstituting the expression for dS:\n∮ₛ (1/R²) (R²sin(θ)dθdφ) = ∮ₛ sin(θ)dθdφ\n\nThe integral is performed over the entire surface of the sphere, so the limits for θ are from 0 to π, and for φ are from 0 to 2π:\n∫₀²π ∫₀π sin(θ) dθ dφ\n\nFirst, we integrate with respect to θ:\n∫₀π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]₀π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nNext, we integrate with respect to φ:\n∫₀²π 2 dφ = [2φ]₀²π = 2(2π) - 2(0) = 4π\n\nThus, the value of the surface integral, and therefore the volume integral of the divergence of the field, is 4π.\n\nAlternatively, one could calculate the divergence of the field in spherical coordinates and then perform the volume integration. The formula for the divergence in spherical coordinates is:\n∇⋅f = (1/r²) ∂/∂r (r² fᵣ) + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂/∂θ (fₑ sinθ) + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂/∂φ (fᵩ)\n\nIn this case, fᵣ = 1/r², and fₑ = fᵩ = 0.\n∇⋅f = (1/r²) ∂/∂r (r² * 1/r²) = (1/r²) ∂/∂r (1) = 0\n\nIf we were to integrate this divergence (which is 0) over the volume of the sphere, we would get 0. However, this is incorrect because the divergence is undefined at the origin (r=0) due to the 1/r² term in the vector field. The Divergence Theorem is applicable here because the theorem relates the volume integral to the flux through the boundary surface, effectively handling the singularity at the origin. The non-zero result of the surface integral indicates the presence of a source at the origin.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to use the Divergence Theorem, which gives the result 4π.\n\n<<<A>>>"
