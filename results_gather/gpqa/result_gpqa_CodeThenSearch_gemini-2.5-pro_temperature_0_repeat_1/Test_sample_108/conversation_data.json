    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the permitted and non-permitted partial waves based on the provided physical principles.\n\n### 1. Initial State Analysis: 1S0\n\nThe initial two-nucleon (NN) system is in a `1S0` state. The notation `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers:\n*   **Total Spin (S):** 2S+1 = 1  =>  S = 0\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L):** The letter 'S' corresponds to L = 0.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (J):** J = 0.\n*   **Parity (P):** The parity of the NN state is given by P = (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1.\n*   **Isospin (T):** The generalized Pauli principle for a two-nucleon system requires that the total wavefunction be antisymmetric. This leads to the condition that L + S + T must be an odd number. For the initial state, L=0 and S=0, so 0 + 0 + T must be odd, which implies T = 1.\n\n### 2. Conservation Laws and Selection Rules\n\nThe problem states several conditions that must be met for a transition to be permitted.\n\n*   **Particle X:** It has an intrinsic parity of -1. Its orbital angular momentum is denoted by a lowercase letter (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3, etc.). We assume particle X is spinless, so its total angular momentum is equal to its orbital angular momentum, l_X.\n\n*   **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total angular momentum must be conserved. The initial state has J = 0. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's total angular momentum (J') and the angular momentum of particle X (l_X). For the final total angular momentum to be 0, we must have **J'** + **l_X** = 0, which means their magnitudes must be equal: **J' = l_X**.\n\n*   **Parity Conservation:** The total parity must be conserved.\n    *   Initial Parity: P_initial = P(NN_initial) = (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1.\n    *   Final Parity: P_final = P(NN_final) * P(X_intrinsic) * P(X_orbital) = (-1)^L' * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^(L' + l_X + 1).\n    *   For parity to be conserved, P_initial = P_final, so +1 = (-1)^(L' + l_X + 1). This requires the exponent (L' + l_X + 1) to be an even number, which means **L' + l_X must be an odd number**.\n\n*   **Pauli Statistics for the Final State:** The problem explicitly gives the condition for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   It is also given that the final NN state has isospin **T' = 0**.\n    *   Substituting T'=0 into the rule gives: 0 = S' + L' + 1 (mod 2).\n    *   This implies that S' + L' + 1 must be an even number, which means **S' + L' must be an odd number**.\n\n*   **Fundamental Property of Two-Nucleon Systems:** Nucleons are spin-1/2 particles. The total spin (S') of a two-nucleon system can only be S' = 0 (singlet state) or S' = 1 (triplet state). Any other value for S' is impossible.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Options\n\nLet's check each proposed transition against these rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): S'=1, L'=2, J'=3.\n*   Particle X (`f`-wave): l_X=3.\n1.  **S' validity:** S'=1 is possible. (OK)\n2.  **Pauli (S' + L' odd?):** S' + L' = 1 + 2 = 3. This is odd. (OK)\n3.  **Parity (L' + l_X odd?):** L' + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5. This is odd. (OK)\n4.  **Ang. Mom. (J' = l_X?):** J' = 3 and l_X = 3. They are equal. (OK)\n*Conclusion: This transition is permitted.*\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): 2S'+1=7 => S'=3. L'=2, J'=1.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): l_X=1.\n1.  **S' validity:** S'=3 is **not possible** for a two-nucleon system.\n*Conclusion: This transition is not permitted because the final state `7D1` is not a valid state for two nucleons.*\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): S'=1, L'=0, J'=1.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): l_X=1.\n1.  **S' validity:** S'=1 is possible. (OK)\n2.  **Pauli (S' + L' odd?):** S' + L' = 1 + 0 = 1. This is odd. (OK)\n3.  **Parity (L' + l_X odd?):** L' + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1. This is odd. (OK)\n4.  **Ang. Mom. (J' = l_X?):** J' = 1 and l_X = 1. They are equal. (OK)\n*Conclusion: This transition is permitted.*\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): S'=1, L'=1, J'=0.\n*   Particle X (`s`-wave): l_X=0.\n1.  **S' validity:** S'=1 is possible. (OK)\n2.  **Pauli (S' + L' odd?):** S' + L' = 1 + 1 = 2. This is even. This **violates** the condition that S' + L' must be odd for a final state with T'=0.\n3.  **Parity (L' + l_X odd?):** L' + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1. This is odd. (OK)\n4.  **Ang. Mom. (J' = l_X?):** J' = 0 and l_X = 0. They are equal. (OK)\n*Conclusion: This transition is not permitted because it violates the Pauli statistics requirement for a final state with T=0.*\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBoth options B and D describe transitions that are not permitted.\n*   **Option B** is forbidden because the final state `7D1` requires a total spin S'=3, which is impossible to form with two spin-1/2 nucleons. This is a violation of the fundamental rules of angular momentum addition.\n*   **Option D** is forbidden because the final state `3P0` has S'=1 and L'=1, making S'+L'=2 (even). According to the Pauli statistics rule provided for a final state with T'=0, S'+L' must be odd. This transition is therefore forbidden by a selection rule.\n\nBoth are impossible transitions. However, the violation in option B is arguably more fundamental as the proposed final state `7D1` cannot exist in the Hilbert space of a two-nucleon system at all. The state `3P0` in option D can exist, but it cannot have T=0 as required by the reaction conditions. In many contexts, proposing a non-existent state like `7D1` is considered a more direct violation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
