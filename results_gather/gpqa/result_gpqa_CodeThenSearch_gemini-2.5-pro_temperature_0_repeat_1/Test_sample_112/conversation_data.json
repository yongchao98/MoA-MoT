    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch. When considered with the broad O-H peak, this strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    *   Another strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbon atoms of a double bond.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ fragment.\n\n### Evaluating the Options using Degree of Unsaturation\n\nThe degree of unsaturation (DoU) is a calculation that determines the total number of rings and π bonds in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2), where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens. Oxygen atoms do not affect this calculation.\n\nThe spectroscopic data indicate the presence of one C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). This means the molecule must have a degree of unsaturation of at least 2.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the given options:\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n    This DoU of 2 perfectly matches the presence of one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n    This formula lacks a second oxygen for the carboxylic acid and only accounts for one double bond or ring.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n    While the DoU is correct, this formula only has one oxygen atom, which contradicts the evidence for a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   **D) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n    This DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid and does not allow for the C=C double bond confirmed by FTIR and ¹H NMR.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence strongly supports the presence of both a carboxylic acid group and a carbon-carbon double bond. The only chemical formula that fits all the data, including the required degree of unsaturation of 2, is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>"
