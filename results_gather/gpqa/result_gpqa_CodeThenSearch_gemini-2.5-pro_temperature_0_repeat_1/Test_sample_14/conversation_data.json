    "To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we need to compare their individual transit probabilities. The geometric probability of a planet transiting its host star, for a circular orbit, is given by the ratio of the star's radius (R_s) to the planet's semi-major axis (a).\n\n*   **Probability of Transit (P_transit) ≈ R_s / a**\n\nWe are given the following information for the two systems:\n\n*   **Orbital Periods:** The period of Planet_1 (P1) is one-third that of Planet_2 (P2).\n    *   P1 = P2 / 3\n*   **Host Star Masses:** The mass of Planet_1's host star (M_s1) is twice that of Planet_2's host star (M_s2).\n    *   M_s1 = 2 * M_s2\n*   **Host Star Radii:** The radii of the two host stars are equal.\n    *   R_s1 = R_s2\n\nTo compare the transit probabilities, we can set up a ratio:\n\n*   Ratio = P_transit_1 / P_transit_2 = (R_s1 / a1) / (R_s2 / a2)\n\nSince we know R_s1 = R_s2, the equation simplifies to:\n\n*   Ratio = a2 / a1\n\nNow, we need to find the relationship between the semi-major axes (a1 and a2). We can use Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion. The law states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) and inversely proportional to the mass of the host star (M_s). The formula is:\n\n*   P² ∝ a³ / M_s\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis:\n\n*   a³ ∝ M_s * P²\n*   a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3)\n\nNow we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes, a1 / a2:\n\n*   a1 / a2 = [ (M_s1 * P1²) / (M_s2 * P2²) ]^(1/3)\n\nSubstitute the known relationships (M_s1 = 2 * M_s2 and P1 = P2 / 3):\n\n*   a1 / a2 = [ (2 * M_s2 * (P2 / 3)²) / (M_s2 * P2²) ]^(1/3)\n*   a1 / a2 = [ (2 * M_s2 * P2² / 9) / (M_s2 * P2²) ]^(1/3)\n*   a1 / a2 = (2 / 9)^(1/3)\n\nThe ratio of the transit probabilities is the inverse of this, a2 / a1:\n\n*   Ratio = a2 / a1 = 1 / (2/9)^(1/3) = (9/2)^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3)\n\nCalculating the final value:\n\n*   Ratio ≈ 1.65096\n\nThis result shows that the transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
