    "To arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction, we must analyze the directing effects of the substituent on each benzene ring.\n\nThe substituents can be classified into two main groups:\n1.  **Activating and Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups donate electron density to the benzene ring, making it more reactive towards electrophiles, particularly at the ortho and para positions.\n2.  **Deactivating and Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups withdraw electron density from the benzene ring, making it less reactive. They direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position, resulting in very low yields of ortho and para isomers.\n3.  **Deactivating and Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** Halogens are an exception; they are deactivating overall but direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions.\n\nLet's analyze each substance:\n\n*   **Substances with Meta-Directing Groups (Lowest Para Yield):**\n    *   **4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group (-NO2) is a very strong electron-withdrawing and deactivating group. It directs substitution almost exclusively to the meta position, leading to a negligible amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   **6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. It is less deactivating than the nitro group.\n    *   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** The ester group (-COOC2H5) is also deactivating and meta-directing. Its deactivating effect is generally considered slightly weaker than that of a carboxylic acid group. For a similar reaction (nitration), ethyl benzoate yields about 5% of the para isomer.\n\n    Therefore, for the meta-directing compounds, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: Nitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate (4 < 6 < 2).\n\n*   **Substances with Ortho, Para-Directing Groups (Highest Para Yield):**\n    *   **1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The methyl group (-CH3) is an activating, ortho, para-directing group. It yields a mixture of ortho and para products.\n    *   **5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is also an activating, ortho, para-directing group. Compared to the methyl group, the ethyl group is larger and provides more steric hindrance at the ortho positions. This steric hindrance makes the para position more accessible to the incoming electrophile, resulting in a higher proportion of the para-isomer compared to toluene.\n    *   **3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group (-Cl) is deactivating but ortho, para-directing. Halogens tend to produce a high percentage of the para-isomer, often more than simple alkylbenzenes, due to a combination of inductive and resonance effects. For example, in nitration, chlorobenzene gives a 70% yield of the para-isomer, which is significantly higher than that for toluene.\n\n    Therefore, for the ortho, para-directing compounds, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene (1 < 5 < 3).\n\n**Final Order:**\n\nCombining the two groups, we arrange the substances from the lowest para-isomer yield to the highest:\n\n**4 (Nitrobenzene) < 6 (Benzoic acid) < 2 (Ethyl benzoate) < 1 (Toluene) < 5 (Ethylbenzene) < 3 (Chlorobenzene)**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
