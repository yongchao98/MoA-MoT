    "To clearly distinguish between two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than the natural energy width of each level. This energy width is determined by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nThe principle states that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the lifetime of the state (Δt or τ) are related by the inequality:\nΔE * τ ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nA shorter lifetime leads to a larger uncertainty in the energy, resulting in a broader energy level. To resolve two levels, the separation between them must be larger than their energy widths. The most stringent condition is set by the state with the shorter lifetime, as it will have the larger energy width.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the energy uncertainty (or \"width\") for each state:\n\n1.  **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime (τ₁) = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width (ΔE₁) ≈ ħ / τ₁\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n2.  **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime (τ₂) = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width (ΔE₂) ≈ ħ / τ₂\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nThe state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) has the broader energy width of approximately 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV. For the two energy levels to be clearly resolved, their energy difference must be significantly greater than this larger width.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n*   A) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is smaller than the energy width of both states.\n*   B) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than the energy width of the first state.\n*   C) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much larger than the energy width of either state (10⁻⁴ >> 6.58 x 10⁻⁷).\n*   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is significantly smaller than the energy width of both states.\n\nThe only option that provides a large enough energy separation to clearly distinguish the two levels is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
