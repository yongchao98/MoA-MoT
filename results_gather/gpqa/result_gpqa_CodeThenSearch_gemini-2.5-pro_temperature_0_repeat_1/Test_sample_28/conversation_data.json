    "To eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, the gene responsible for its synthesis must be rendered non-functional. This is most effectively achieved by a mutation that either stops protein production prematurely or significantly alters the protein's structure. Let's analyze the impact of each mutation:\n\n*   **Intact Gene Codons:** `ATG` (Start), `TTT` (Phe), `CTC` (Leu), `GCT` (Ala), ...\n*   **Mutant 1:** The sequence changes result in a `CTC` to `TAC` mutation. This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid (Leucine) for another (Tyrosine). While this could potentially affect the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely.\n*   **Mutant 2:** The sequence changes result in a `CTC` to `TAA` mutation. `TAA` is a stop codon. This is a **nonsense mutation** that introduces a premature stop signal early in the gene sequence. This causes protein synthesis to terminate, resulting in a severely shortened and non-functional protein. This is a very effective way to knock out gene function.\n*   **Mutant 3:** This mutant has an insertion of a single nucleotide (`T`). This causes a **frameshift mutation**. A frameshift alters the three-letter codon reading frame, changing every amino acid that follows the insertion and often leading to a premature stop codon downstream. This almost always results in a non-functional protein.\n*   **Mutant 4:** This mutation appears to be a more complex change, likely resulting in an in-frame deletion of an amino acid. Removing one amino acid might alter the protein's function, but it is less likely to cause a complete loss of function compared to a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth Mutant 2 (nonsense mutation) and Mutant 3 (frameshift mutation) are highly likely to eliminate the gene's function. However, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a definitive stop signal at the third codon. This guarantees the production of a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide that is unequivocally non-functional. Therefore, it represents the most certain and direct method among the choices to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
