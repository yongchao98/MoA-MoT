  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental results to determine the interactions between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### Analysis of the Mutant Phenotypes\n\n1.  **Single Mutants:**\n    *   **g1:** 75% resistance. This indicates a partial contribution of gene G1 to the resistance pathway.\n    *   **g2:** 0% resistance. This is a complete loss of resistance, suggesting G2 plays a critical role in the pathway.\n    *   **g3:** 50% resistance. This shows a partial, but more significant, contribution of G3 to resistance compared to G1.\n\n2.  **Double Mutants:**\n    *   **g1g2, g2g3:** Both show 0% resistance. The phenotype of these double mutants is identical to the g2 single mutant.\n    *   **g1g3:** 10% resistance. This phenotype is much more severe than either of the single mutants (g1 or g3).\n\n### Drawing Conclusions on Gene Interactions\n\n*   **Identifying the Upstream Gene (Epistasis):** Epistasis occurs when the effect of one gene masks the effect of another. In this experiment, the g2 mutation (0% resistance) completely masks the phenotypes of the g1 (75% resistance) and g3 (50% resistance) mutations, as the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 also show 0% resistance. This indicates that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. In a genetic pathway, the epistatic gene often acts upstream of the masked genes. A gene that, when knocked out, causes a complete loss of function and is epistatic to other genes in the same pathway is a strong candidate for a key regulatory element, such as a transcription factor that controls the expression of the downstream genes. Therefore, it is very likely that **G2 is a transcription factor** that activates G1 and G3.\n\n*   **Analyzing the Interaction between G1 and G3:**\n    *   The single mutants g1 and g3 each lead to a partial loss of resistance.\n    *   The double mutant g1g3 results in a resistance level (10%) that is far below what would be expected from a simple additive effect of the two single mutations (which would be 75% + 50% - 100% = 25% resistance).\n    *   This more severe phenotype in the double mutant is known as a synergistic interaction. Synergy often implies that the two genes have partially overlapping or redundant functions. If G1 and G3 perform similar roles in parallel pathways contributing to resistance, the loss of both would have a much greater impact than the loss of just one. This concept is known as **gene redundancy**.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n*   **G2 is a transcription factor.**\n*   **G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.**\n*   **G1 and G3 show gene redundancy** (or a synergistic interaction).\n*   There is **no epistasis** between G1 and G3, because the double mutant phenotype (10%) is not the same as either the g1 (75%) or g3 (50%) phenotype.\n\nLet's evaluate the given choices:\n\n*   **A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** This is incorrect because G2, not G1, is the likely transcription factor.\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** While it correctly identifies G2 as a transcription factor, there is no evidence for pleiotropy (a single gene affecting multiple traits), and G1 is not epistatic to G3.\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** This correctly identifies G2 as a transcription factor, but we cannot conclude they share a promoter from this data, and G3 is not epistatic to G1.\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This option correctly identifies **G2 as a transcription factor** and correctly describes the relationship between G1 and G3 as **gene redundancy**. Although the statement \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" is incorrect based on the data, this option contains two out of three correct and highly significant conclusions drawn directly from the experimental results. The other options contain at most one correct conclusion and other statements that are either incorrect or cannot be supported by the data. Therefore, this represents the best possible conclusion among the choices.\n\n<<<D>>>"
