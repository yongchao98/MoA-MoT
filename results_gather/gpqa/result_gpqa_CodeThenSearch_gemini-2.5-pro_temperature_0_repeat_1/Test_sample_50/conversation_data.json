    "To determine the net potential energy of the system, we employ the method of images. A charge *q* is placed at a distance *d* from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius *R*.\n\nThe principle of the method of images allows us to replace the grounded sphere with a fictitious \"image charge\" that, along with the original charge *q*, satisfies the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero.\n\nFor a point charge *q* at a distance *d* from the center of the sphere, the image charge, *q'*, is located along the same line at a distance *b* from the center, where:\n*   The magnitude of the image charge is *q'* = -*q*(R/d).\n*   The position of the image charge is *b* = R²/d.\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge *q* from infinity to its position at distance *d*. This work is equal to half of the interaction potential energy between the real charge *q* and the image charge *q'*. The factor of 1/2 arises because the induced charge distribution on the sphere (which the image charge represents) changes as the real charge is brought in from infinity.\n\nThe distance between the real charge *q* and the image charge *q'* is *d* - *b* = *d* - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d.\n\nThe interaction potential energy between *q* and *q'* is:\nU_interaction = k * q * q' / (distance between them)\nU_interaction = k * q * (-qR/d) / ((d² - R²)/d)\nU_interaction = - k * q² * R / (d² - R²)\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is half of this interaction energy:\nU = (1/2) * U_interaction\nU = (1/2) * [- k * q² * R / (d² - R²)]\nU = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nB) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
