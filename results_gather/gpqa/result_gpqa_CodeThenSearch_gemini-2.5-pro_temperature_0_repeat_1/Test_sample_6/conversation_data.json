    "To determine the energy at which high-energy γ-rays have their lifetimes limited by annihilation with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons, we need to calculate the threshold energy for electron-positron pair production ($\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$).\n\nThis interaction is governed by the principles of special relativity. The minimum energy required for this process occurs in a head-on collision between the high-energy gamma-ray and a CMB photon. The total energy in the center-of-mass frame must be at least the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair.\n\nThe threshold condition for this reaction is given by the formula:\n\n$E_\\gamma \\epsilon \\ge (m_e c^2)^2$\n\nWhere:\n*   $E_\\gamma$ is the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray.\n*   $\\epsilon$ is the energy of the CMB photon.\n*   $m_e c^2$ is the rest mass energy of an electron.\n\nWe are given:\n*   The average energy of a CMB photon, $\\epsilon = 10^{-3}$ eV.\n*   The rest mass of an electron is approximately 9.109 × 10⁻³¹ kg, which is equivalent to a rest mass energy of about 0.511 MeV.\n\nFirst, we need to express the electron's rest mass energy in electron volts (eV):\n$m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$\n\nNow, we can rearrange the threshold energy formula to solve for the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray ($E_\\gamma$):\n\n$E_\\gamma \\ge \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{\\epsilon}$\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n$E_\\gamma \\ge \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n$E_\\gamma \\ge \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n$E_\\gamma \\ge 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n\nThe question provides the answers in Giga-electron volts (GeV), so we need to convert our result:\n1 GeV = $10^9$ eV\n\n$E_\\gamma \\ge \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}}$\n\n$E_\\gamma \\ge 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis result is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
