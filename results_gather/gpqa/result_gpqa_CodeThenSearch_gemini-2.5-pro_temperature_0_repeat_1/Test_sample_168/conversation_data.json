    "In the original decay, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V, the final state consists of four light particles (two E and two V) in addition to the two heavy nucleons B. The total energy released in the decay, known as the Q-value, is shared among these final particles. Because there are multiple light particles sharing this energy in a variable manner, the energy spectrum of any one of these particles, or the combined energy of the two E particles, is continuous. This is analogous to beta decay, where the electron and the antineutrino share the decay energy, resulting in a continuous energy spectrum for the electron.\n\nIn the variant decay, 2A -> 2B + 2E + M, the two V particles are replaced by a single exotic, massless particle M. The final state now consists of three light particles (two E and one M) besides the heavy nucleons.\n\nFirst, let's consider the nature of the energy spectrum.\nSince the final state of the variant decay still contains more than two particles that share the decay energy (the two E particles and the M particle), the energy distribution among them is still variable. A discrete energy spectrum, which consists of a sharp energy peak, is characteristic of a two-body decay where the kinematics are fully constrained by the conservation of energy and momentum. As the variant decay results in a three-body light particle final state, the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles will remain continuous, although the shape of the distribution will change due to the different kinematics (phase space) of a 3-body versus a 4-body decay. This eliminates options A and B.\n\nNext, let's compare the endpoint of the energy spectrum.\nThe endpoint of the spectrum represents the maximum possible kinetic energy of the particles of interest, which in this case is the total kinetic energy of the two E particles. This maximum value is equal to the total decay energy, the Q-value, which is determined by the difference in rest mass between the initial and final states (Q = Δmc²).\n\nLet's define the masses of the particles as m_A, m_B, m_E, m_V, and m_M.\n\n*   The Q-value for the original decay is:\n    Q_original = [2m_A - (2m_B + 2m_E + 2m_V)]c²\n*   The Q-value for the variant decay is:\n    Q_variant = [2m_A - (2m_B + 2m_E + m_M)]c²\n\nThe problem states that the particle M is massless, so m_M = 0. The particle V, analogous to a neutrino in such decays, has a small but non-zero rest mass (m_V > 0).\n\nComparing the total rest mass of the final products (excluding the heavy nucleons which are common to both):\n*   Mass of light products in original decay = 2m_E + 2m_V\n*   Mass of light products in variant decay = 2m_E + m_M = 2m_E + 0\n\nSince 2m_V is greater than zero, the total rest mass of the final particles is smaller in the variant decay. A smaller final rest mass means that more mass is converted into energy during the decay, resulting in a larger Q-value. Therefore, Q_variant > Q_original.\n\nBecause the endpoint of the E particles' energy spectrum is determined by the Q-value of the decay, and the Q-value for the variant decay is higher, the endpoint of the spectrum increases.\n\nThus, the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.\n\n<<<C>>>"
