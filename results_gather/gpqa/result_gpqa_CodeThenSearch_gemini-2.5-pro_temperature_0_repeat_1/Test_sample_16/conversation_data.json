    "To determine the concentration of calcium ions in the solution, we need to consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the following equilibrium:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe formation constant (K_f), also known as the stability constant, is given by:\nK_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n*   Initial stoichiometric concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex = 0.02 M\n*   Formation constant (K_f) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n*   The pH is ideal, which means we can assume that all EDTA not bound to calcium is in the EDTA⁴⁻ form.\n\nNow, let's set up an equilibrium calculation for the dissociation of the complex:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n*   **Initial concentration:**\n    *   [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 M\n    *   [Ca²⁺] = 0 M\n    *   [EDTA⁴⁻] = 0 M\n\n*   **Change in concentration:**\n    *   Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that forms from the dissociation.\n    *   [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] decreases by x.\n    *   [Ca²⁺] increases by x.\n    *   [EDTA⁴⁻] increases by x.\n\n*   **Equilibrium concentration:**\n    *   [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 - x\n    *   [Ca²⁺] = x\n    *   [EDTA⁴⁻] = x\n\nNow, we substitute these equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\nK_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nBecause the formation constant is very large, the dissociation of the complex will be minimal. This means 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can therefore make the simplifying assumption that:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nNow, we solve for x, which represents the [Ca²⁺]:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx = 2 x 10⁻⁶.⁵\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. Comparing this to the options provided:\n\nA) 1.0x10⁻² M\nB) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\nC) 2.0x10⁻² M\nD) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
