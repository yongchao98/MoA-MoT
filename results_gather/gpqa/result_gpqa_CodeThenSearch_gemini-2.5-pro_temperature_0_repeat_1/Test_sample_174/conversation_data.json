    "An oscillating charge distribution, particularly one with a non-uniform shape like a spheroid, can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole, assuming its size is much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation.\n\nThe power radiated per unit solid angle, denoted as dP/dΩ, by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to sin²(θ), where θ is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation. In this case, the symmetry axis is the z-axis. The formula for the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle is given by:\n\ndP/dΩ = (c * k⁴ * p² / (8π)) * sin²(θ)\n\nWhere:\n*   c is the speed of light\n*   k is the wave number (2π/λ)\n*   p is the amplitude of the electric dipole moment\n*   θ is the angle with the axis of oscillation\n\nThe maximum radiated power, A, occurs when sin²(θ) is at its maximum value of 1, which happens at θ = 90°.\n\nTo find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at an angle of θ = 30°, we calculate the ratio of the power at 30° to the maximum power:\n\n(dP/dΩ at 30°) / (dP/dΩ at 90°) = sin²(30°) / sin²(90°)\n\nSince sin(30°) = 1/2 and sin(90°) = 1, the fraction is:\n\n(1/2)² / 1² = 1/4\n\nThe total power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency (ω⁴). Since the angular frequency ω is related to the wavelength λ by ω = 2πc/λ, the radiated power is proportional to (1/λ)⁴, or λ⁻⁴. The function f, representing the radiated power per unit solid angle, will also have this λ⁻⁴ dependence.\n\nTherefore, the fraction of the maximum power A radiated at an angle of 30° is 1/4, and a possible form for the function f is proportional to λ⁻⁴.\n\n<<<B>>>"
