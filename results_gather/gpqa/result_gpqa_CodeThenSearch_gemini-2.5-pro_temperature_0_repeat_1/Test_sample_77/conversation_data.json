    "The problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge, which are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials describe the electromagnetic field generated by a point charge in arbitrary motion, taking into account the finite speed of light, `c`.\n\nThe key concept is that the fields observed at a point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` are determined by the state of the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time `tr`. This retarded time is earlier than `t` by the amount of time it takes for the signal to travel from the charge's position to the observation point.\n\nLet:\n*   `q` be the charge.\n*   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ be the position of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   $\\vec{v}$ be the velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   $\\vec{r}$ be the observation point.\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ be the vector from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}|$ be the magnitude of this vector.\n*   The retarded time is defined by the relation $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\nThe Liénard-Wiechert potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations. The standard expressions for the scalar potential (V) and the vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) at position $\\vec{r}$ and time `t` are given by:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nTo match these with the given options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nThese expressions are the relativistically correct potentials for a moving point charge. The term $(d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ in the denominator accounts for the relativistic effects of the moving source.\n\nComparing these derived formulas with the given options:\n\n*   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**: This is incorrect. The scalar potential resembles the static case, and the vector potential relationship is wrong.\n*   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**: This matches the correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials. We can also see that $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v}}{1} V = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$, which is the correct relationship between the potentials for a point charge.\n*   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**: This is incorrect due to the plus sign in the denominator. This would correspond to the \"advanced\" potentials, which are typically not physically realized.\n*   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**: This is incorrect. While the relationship between $\\vec{A}$ and $V$ is correct, the expression for the scalar potential $V$ is that of a static charge and does not account for the motion-dependent denominator.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions are given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
