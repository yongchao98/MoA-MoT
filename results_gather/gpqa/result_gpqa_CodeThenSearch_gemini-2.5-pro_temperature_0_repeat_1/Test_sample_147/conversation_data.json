    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y:**\n    *   The prompt describes five binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y. One of these, A1, is a bright-red, thermally unstable substance that decomposes at room temperature (293 K) and can oxidize xenon.\n    *   The ability to oxidize xenon under normal conditions is a characteristic of extremely powerful oxidizing agents. The most famous examples are platinum hexafluoride (PtF6) and other hexafluorides of platinum-group metals, such as ruthenium hexafluoride (RuF6).\n    *   Ruthenium (Ru) is known to form multiple binary fluorides: RuF3, RuF4, RuF5, and RuF6. While this is four compounds, the existence of a fifth less stable or polymeric fluoride is plausible in the context of such a problem.\n    *   Ruthenium hexafluoride (RuF6) is a dark-brown/red-brown solid that is thermally unstable and decomposes above 20°C (293 K). It is a strong enough oxidant to react with xenon. This makes Ruthenium a very strong candidate for element Y, and RuF6 a strong candidate for substance A1.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Decomposition of A1:**\n    *   A1 (RuF6) decomposes into A2 and fluorine: `RuF6 → A2 + F2`. The logical product of this decomposition would be a lower fluoride, most likely ruthenium pentafluoride (RuF5). So, A2 is likely RuF5.\n    *   The problem states that A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let's check this for our proposed compounds:\n        *   The actual ɷF in RuF5 is approximately 48.5%.\n        *   The ɷF in RuF4 is approximately 42.9%.\n        *   The ɷF in RuF3 is approximately 36.1%.\n    *   None of these match the given 31.96%. This indicates a likely error in the problem's quantitative data. However, the qualitative chemical properties (reaction with xenon, thermal instability) are very specific and strongly point towards Ruthenium. We will proceed by relying on the chemical properties.\n\n3.  **Identify Substances A1, A2, and A3:**\n    *   **Y** = Ruthenium (Ru)\n    *   **A1** = **RuF6** (Matches the description of a powerful, unstable oxidant).\n    *   **A2** = **RuF5** (The logical decomposition product of RuF6).\n    *   **A3** is obtained by the fluorination of element Y and also interacts with xenon. The direct, exhaustive fluorination of ruthenium yields RuF6. Thus, **A3 = RuF6**.\n\n4.  **Identify Substances A4 and A5:**\n    *   The prompt states: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" This describes the reaction: `Ru + A4 → A5`.\n    *   This 1:1 molar ratio of an element with one of its compounds suggests a comproportionation reaction, where the product's oxidation state is intermediate between the reactants. A classic example of this stoichiometry is `M + MF_{2n} → 2MF_n`.\n    *   Let's hypothesize that A4 is **RuF4**. The reaction would be `Ru + RuF4 → 2RuF2`. This perfectly matches the 1:1 molar ratio of the reactants (Ru and RuF4). In this case, A5 would be RuF2.\n    *   The final clue is that A5 decomposes in water into two substances. The hydrolysis of a metal fluoride like RuF2 to form a ruthenium oxide and hydrofluoric acid (HF) is a plausible reaction that yields two products. Ruthenium(III) fluoride is known to be insoluble in water, making it an unlikely candidate for A5.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, substance A4 is **RuF4** (Ruthenium tetrafluoride).\n    *   Now, we calculate its molecular weight:\n        *   Atomic weight of Ruthenium (Ru) ≈ 101.07 g/mol\n        *   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 18.998 g/mol\n        *   Molecular weight of RuF4 = 101.07 + (4 × 18.998) = 101.07 + 75.992 = **177.062 g/mol**.\n\n6.  **Select the Correct Range:**\n    *   The calculated molecular weight of 177.062 g/mol falls within the range given in option B.\n        *   A) 220-240\n        *   B) 160-180\n        *   C) 140-160\n        *   D) 110-130\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of substance A4 falls in the range of 160-180 g/mol.\n\n<<<B>>>"
