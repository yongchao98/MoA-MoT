    "To find the partition function Z for the system of three spins S1, S2, and S3, we must sum the term e^(-βE) over all possible configurations of the spins. Each spin can take a value of +1 or -1, leading to a total of 2^3 = 8 possible states for the system.\n\nThe energy of the system is given by the formula:\nE = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]\n\nWe need to calculate the energy E for each of the 8 possible spin configurations. Let's group the configurations by the number of up spins (+1) and down spins (-1).\n\n**Case 1: All spins are aligned (either all up or all down).**\n\n*   **Configuration 1: All spins up (+1, +1, +1)**\n    S1 = 1, S2 = 1, S3 = 1\n    E₁ = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n*   **Configuration 2: All spins down (-1, -1, -1)**\n    S1 = -1, S2 = -1, S3 = -1\n    E₂ = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\nThere are 2 states that have an energy of -3J.\n\n**Case 2: Two spins are in one direction, and one spin is in the opposite direction.**\n\n*   **Configuration 3: Two spins up, one spin down**\n    This can occur in three ways: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), and (-1, +1, +1). Let's calculate the energy for one of them, for instance (+1, +1, -1):\n    S1 = 1, S2 = 1, S3 = -1\n    E₃ = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    All three of these configurations have the same energy, J.\n\n*   **Configuration 4: One spin up, two spins down**\n    This can also occur in three ways: (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), and (-1, -1, +1). Let's calculate the energy for (+1, -1, -1):\n    S1 = 1, S2 = -1, S3 = -1\n    E₄ = -J[(1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    All three of these configurations also have the same energy, J.\n\nIn total, there are 3 + 3 = 6 states that have an energy of J.\n\n**Calculating the Partition Function (Z)**\n\nThe partition function is the sum over all states (i) of the Boltzmann factor e^(-βEᵢ), which can be written as a sum over energy levels, multiplying each term by its degeneracy (gᵢ), the number of states with that energy.\nZ = Σᵢ gᵢ * e^(-βEᵢ)\n\nFrom our analysis, we have two distinct energy levels:\n*   E₁ = -3J with a degeneracy g₁ = 2.\n*   E₂ = J with a degeneracy g₂ = 6.\n\nNow, we can write the partition function:\nZ = (g₁ * e^(-βE₁)) + (g₂ * e^(-βE₂))\nZ = (2 * e^(-β(-3J))) + (6 * e^(-β(J)))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nThis result corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
