    "### Analysis of Compound X\n\nFirst, the structure of the starting material, Compound X, is determined by interpreting its Infrared (IR) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra.\n\n**IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   A very broad absorption in the range of **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n*   The strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, which is consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n*   Absorptions at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are typical for C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n\n**¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   A broad singlet at **10.5 ppm (1H)** is a classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n*   Two doublets at **8.0 ppm (2H)** and **7.2 ppm (2H)** suggest a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield signal at 7.2 ppm is next to an alkyl substituent.\n*   The signals in the alkyl region are interpreted as follows:\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A methine (CH) group, likely attached to the benzene ring.\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A methylene (CH₂) group.\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A methyl (CH₃) group coupled to a single proton (the methine group).\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A methyl (CH₃) group coupled to a methylene group.\n*   Assembling these fragments reveals a *sec*-butyl group [-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)] attached to the benzene ring.\n\nBased on this spectroscopic data, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### Reaction and Final Product\n\nCompound X, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, is treated with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent. Specifically, red P and HI are known to completely reduce carboxylic acids to their corresponding alkanes. The reaction involves the reduction of the carboxyl group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\nThe reaction proceeds as follows:\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Reagents:** Red P / HI\n*   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group is reduced to a methyl group. The *sec*-butyl group and the aromatic ring are unaffected by these reagents.\n*   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule is a benzene ring substituted with a *sec*-butyl group and a methyl group at the para positions (positions 1 and 4).\n\nThe name of the final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\n*   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n*   B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material, not the final product.\n*   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - This has an isobutyl group, not the *sec*-butyl group from the starting material.\n*   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This correctly identifies the final product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
