    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Define Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is `M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   The more massive fragment is `m1`, and the less massive is `m2`.\n    *   Mass relationship: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\n\nWe can determine the rest-mass energies of the two fragments:\n\n*   Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the sum equation:\n    `2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n*   Now find `m1`:\n    `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, we convert these masses to their rest-mass energies:\n\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1 (`m1`):\n    `m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2 (`m2`):\n    `m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released\n\nThe energy released during the fission is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy (T_total) = (M * c^2) - (m1 * c^2 + m2 * c^2)`\n*   `T_total = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nSo, the sum of the kinetic energies of the two fragments is `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, the kinetic energy is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is the momentum. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum of the fragments must be zero. This means their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction (`p1 = p2 = p`).\n\n*   `T1_classical = p^2 / (2 * m1)`\n*   `T2_classical = p^2 / (2 * m2)`\n\nThe ratio of their kinetic energies is:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = m2 / (2 * m2) = 1/2`\nSo, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T1\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, we use the conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The magnitudes of the momenta are equal: `p1 = p2 = p`.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before equals the total energy after.\n    `E_initial = E_final`\n    `M * c^2 = E1 + E2`\n    `300 GeV = E1 + E2`\n    where `E1` and `E2` are the total energies (rest mass + kinetic) of the fragments.\n\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n\nFrom this, we can write:\n`(p*c)^2 = E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2`\n`(p*c)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n\nTherefore:\n`E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n`E1^2 - E2^2 = (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n`(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1*c^2 - m2*c^2)(m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n\nNow, substitute the known values:\n*   `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n*   `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 198 + 99 = 297 GeV`\n*   `m1*c^2 - m2*c^2 = 198 - 99 = 99 GeV`\n\n`(E1 - E2) * (300 GeV) = (99 GeV) * (297 GeV)`\n`E1 - E2 = (99 * 297) / 300 GeV = 98.01 GeV`\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations:\n1.  `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n2.  `E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nAdding the two equations gives:\n`2 * E1 = 398.01 GeV`\n`E1 = 199.005 GeV`\n\nThe kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy `E1` minus the rest-mass energy `m1*c^2`:\n`T1_relativistic = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n`T1_relativistic = 1005 MeV`\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\n\nFinally, calculate the difference between the relativistic and classical values for T1.\n\n*   `Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe difference is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>"
