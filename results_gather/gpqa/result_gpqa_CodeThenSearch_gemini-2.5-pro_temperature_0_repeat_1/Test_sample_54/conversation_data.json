    "The identification of the unknown compound is based on the detailed analysis of its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Analysis of the 1H NMR Data:\n\n1.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal is a singlet, indicating the three protons are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with. This is characteristic of the methyl group in an acetate (CH₃COO-) functional group. All four possible compounds contain an acetate group, so this signal confirms that structural feature.\n2.  **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal is a doublet, meaning the three protons of this methyl group are coupled to a single adjacent proton. This is consistent with a methyl group attached to a double bond, specifically a -CH=CH-CH₃ structure. This eliminates the butenyl acetate options, which would have an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) attached to the double bond and would show more complex signals (a triplet and a quartet).\n3.  **Signals at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz) and 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** These two signals are in the vinyl region, corresponding to the protons on the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   The proton at 7.0 ppm is a doublet, meaning it is coupled to only one other proton. Its downfield shift is due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent oxygen atom from the acetate group.\n    *   The proton at 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets (dq). The doublet splitting is from coupling to the other vinyl proton (at 7.0 ppm), and the quartet splitting is from coupling to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (at 1.6 ppm).\n    *   Crucially, the coupling constant (J value) between the two vinyl protons is 16.0 Hz. Coupling constants for vinylic protons in a *trans* configuration are typically in the range of 11-18 Hz, while *cis* protons show smaller coupling constants, usually between 5-10 Hz. The observed J value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates a *trans* geometry.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe combination of a methyl singlet (acetate), a methyl doublet (from CH₃-CH=), and two vinyl protons with a large coupling constant (16.0 Hz) uniquely identifies the compound as **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n*   **Cis-propenyl acetate** would show a smaller J-coupling constant.\n*   **Cis- and Trans-butenyl acetate** would have different signals for the alkyl group attached to the double bond (an ethyl group, not a methyl group).\n\nTherefore, the data is a perfect match for Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
