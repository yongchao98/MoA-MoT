    "The reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed ammonia proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate. The use of isotopic labeling is a classic method to elucidate this reaction pathway.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the possible reaction pathways and products:\n\n1.  **Formation of Benzyne Intermediates:** The strong base, amide ion (NH2-), abstracts a proton from the position ortho to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions with different isotopes: a deuterium at C2 and a hydrogen at C6.\n\n    *   **Path A: Abstraction of Hydrogen:** The amide ion can abstract the hydrogen atom from the C6 position. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion, resulting in a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains at the C2 position.\n    *   **Path B: Abstraction of Deuterium:** Alternatively, the amide ion can abstract the deuterium atom from the C2 position. This leads to the formation of a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. In this intermediate, the deuterium atom has been removed.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Attack and Product Formation:** The amide ion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyne intermediates. This is followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent to yield the final products.\n\n    *   **From the C1-C6 Benzyne (with Deuterium at C2):**\n        *   Attack at C1: The amino group attaches to C1. Subsequent protonation at C6 yields **2-deuterioaniline** (*o*-deuterioaniline).\n        *   Attack at C6: The amino group attaches to C6. Subsequent protonation at C1 yields **3-deuterioaniline** (*m*-deuterioaniline).\n\n    *   **From the C1-C2 Benzyne (without Deuterium):**\n        *   Attack at either C1 or C2 by the amide ion, followed by protonation, results in the formation of **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\nTherefore, the reaction yields a mixture of three possible organic products: aniline, 2-deuterioaniline, and 3-deuterioaniline.\n\n<<<C>>>"
