    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n**1. Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\nThe problem states that substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   The percentage of hydrogen is approximately 1/7th of the total mass (100 / 7 ≈ 14.28).\n*   For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is approximately `y / (12x + y)`.\n*   If we test the general formula for cycloalkanes, CₙH₂ₙ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7`.\n*   This matches the given 14.28%.\n*   The problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent. Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) is a common cycloalkane solvent.\n*   Therefore, substance Z is **Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**2. Characterize Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated.\n*   Substance Z (Cyclohexane) is one of the components of mixture Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only Cyclohexane.\n*   Let the components of Y be Cyclohexane and liquid D. Since hydrogenating D yields Cyclohexane, and D does not decolorize bromine water, D must be a substance that is resistant to bromination but can be hydrogenated to Cyclohexane. Aromatic compounds like benzene fit this description. Benzene does not react with bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and Benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Unravel the Disproportionation Reaction**\n*   Mixture X, an equimolar mixture of two liquids (A and B), reacts on a heated platinum catalyst to form mixture Y (Cyclohexane and Benzene). This is described as a disproportionation.\n*   In this context, disproportionation refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction where one reactant is reduced (gains hydrogen) and the other is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n*   The overall reaction is: A + B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆).\n*   Since the reaction starts with an equimolar mixture (A and B) and produces an equimolar mixture, the stoichiometry is 1:1 for all components.\n*   The total atoms must balance: Formula(A) + Formula(B) = C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆ = C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Cyclohexane, which means both A and B must be unsaturated compounds with a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n*   For the hydrogen transfer to be possible, one reactant must have more hydrogen than benzene (C₆H₆) and the other must have less hydrogen than cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   Let's test possible C₆ unsaturated cyclic compounds. A logical choice for A and B would be cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and a cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n*   Let's check if these fit: C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ = C₁₂H₁₈. This balances perfectly.\n*   The reaction is: **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) + Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)**. In this reaction, cyclohexadiene is oxidized to benzene, and cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane. This type of hydrogen transfer is a known catalytic process.\n\n**4. Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n*   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, which is true for both cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene.\n*   A crucial constraint is that the compounds in mixture X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) has only one double bond, so it has no conjugated bonds.\n*   Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) has two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated).\n*   Given the constraint, the diene must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**.\n*   Therefore, mixture X consists of **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) = 10\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) = 8\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<D>>>"
