    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula. This is a known scenario, famously demonstrated by the Fizeau experiment, which confirmed that the simple addition of velocities does not apply to light in a moving medium.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference:**\n    *   Let the laboratory be the stationary frame of reference (Frame S).\n    *   Let the moving glass be the other frame of reference (Frame S').\n\n2.  **Define the velocities:**\n    *   The velocity of the glass (Frame S') relative to the lab (Frame S) is `v`.\n    *   The speed of light within the glass, as measured in the rest frame of the glass (Frame S'), is `u'`. This speed is determined by the glass's index of refraction, `n`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the speed of light in the glass's rest frame (`u'`):**\n    *   The index of refraction `n` is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`). So, `n = c / u'`.\n    *   The problem states to take the speed of light in a vacuum `c = 1`.\n    *   Therefore, `n = 1 / u'`, which can be rearranged to `u' = 1/n`.\n\n4.  **Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula:**\n    *   The formula for adding velocities in the same direction in special relativity is: `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v / c²)`.\n    *   Here, `u` is the speed of light in the glass as measured by the observer in the laboratory.\n\n5.  **Substitute the known values into the formula:**\n    *   Substitute `u' = 1/n` and `c = 1` into the velocity addition formula.\n    *   `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) * v / 1² )`\n\n6.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    *   `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n    *   To clear the fractions in the numerator and denominator, multiply both by `n`:\n    *   `u = n * ( (1/n) + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n    *   `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
