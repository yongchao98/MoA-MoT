These salts dissociate completely in water to form a buffer system composed of the weak acid, dihydrogen phosphate (H₂PO₄⁻), and its conjugate base, hydrogen phosphate (HPO₄²⁻).\n*   The equilibrium governing this buffer is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, characterized by Ka₂:\n    H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ ; Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸\n*   The species we want to find, the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻), is formed in the third dissociation step, characterized by Ka₃:\n    HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻ ; Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹²\n\n**2. Calculation of Initial Molar Concentrations**\n*   First, we must calculate the moles of each salt added to the solution.\n    *   Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄) = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol\n    *   Moles of HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O) = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol\n*   Next, we convert these molar amounts to concentrations using the solution volume (200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L).\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**3. Calculation of the Hydrogen Ion Concentration, [H⁺]**\n*   The [H⁺] of the buffer is determined by the Ka₂ equilibrium. We rearrange the Ka₂ expression to solve for [H⁺]:\n    Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n*   Plugging in the values:\n    [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**4. Calculation of the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration, [PO₄³⁻]**\n*   Now, we use the Ka₃ equilibrium expression and the [H⁺] we just calculated to find [PO₄³⁻]. We rearrange the Ka₃ expression:\n    Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n*   Plugging in the values:\n    [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M) ≈ 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n**Analysis of Provided Answers:**\n*   A majority of the candidate answers correctly identify the method and perform the calculation, arriving at a numerical result of approximately 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M. For instance, Answer 1, Answer 3, Answer 4, Answer 10, and Answer 11 all show a clear derivation leading to this value.\n*   The Python code execution in Answer 13 confirms this result precisely (`6.24e-07`).\n*   Several agents (e.g., 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14, 15) correctly calculate the numerical value but incorrectly assign it to the wrong letter option (e.g., assigning 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M to B, C, or D).

Together, they form a phosphate buffer solution.\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components:**\n    *   **Volume:** The total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.20000 L.\n    *   **Moles of H₂PO₄⁻:**\n        *   Molar mass of KH₂PO₄ = 136.09 g/mol.\n        *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol.\n    *   **Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻:**\n        *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.03674 M.\n    *   **Moles of HPO₄²⁻:**\n        *   Molar mass of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = 177.99 g/mol.\n        *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol.\n    *   **Concentration of HPO₄²⁻:**\n        *   [HPO₄²⁻] = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.02809 M.\n\n3.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] of the buffer:**\n    *   The buffer system is governed by the second dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid:\n        H₂PO₄⁻(aq) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + HPO₄²⁻(aq)\n    *   The equilibrium constant is Ka₂ = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸.\n    *   The equilibrium expression is: Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   We can rearrange this equation to solve for [H⁺]:\n        [H⁺] = Ka₂ × ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n        [H⁺] = (6.2 × 10⁻⁸) × (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n        [H⁺] ≈ 8.11 × 10⁻⁸ M\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO₄³⁻]:**\n    *   The concentration of the orthophosphate ion, PO₄³⁻, is determined by the third dissociation equilibrium:\n        HPO₄²⁻(aq) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + PO₄³⁻(aq)\n    *   The equilibrium constant is Ka₃ = 1.8 × 10⁻¹².\n    *   The equilibrium expression is: Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   We rearrange this equation to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ × ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   We use the [H⁺] concentration calculated from the buffer (Step 3) and the initial concentration of [HPO₄²⁻] (from Step 2), as the amount of HPO₄²⁻ that dissociates is negligible due to the extremely small value of Ka₃.\n        [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 × 10⁻¹²) × (0.02809 M / 8.11 × 10⁻⁸ M)\n        [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.236 × 10⁻⁷ M\n\n5.  **Compare with the options:**\n    *   The calculated value is 6.236 × 10⁻⁷ M, which rounds to 6.24 × 10⁻⁷ M.\n    *   This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
