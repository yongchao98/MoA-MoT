    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for the system.\n\n**1. Understand the System**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Since they are identical and have half-integer spin, they are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. For a particle in a 1D potential well, a quantum state is defined by its principal quantum number (n) and its spin projection quantum number (m_s).\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy levels for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L are given by:\n    $E_n = n^2 * (\\frac{π^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2})$\n    where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n*   **Given Energy Unit (E):** The problem defines $E = \\frac{π^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. So, the single-particle energy levels can be written as:\n    $E_n = n^2 E$\n*   **State Occupancy:** Since the particles are spin-1/2, their spin can be either \"up\" (m_s = +1/2) or \"down\" (m_s = -1/2). According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**2. Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_gs)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four fermions, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **n = 1 level (Energy E₁ = 1²E = E):** We can place two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   **n = 2 level (Energy E₂ = 2²E = 4E):** We have two particles remaining, so we place them in this next available level (one spin up, one spin down).\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n$E_{gs} = (1E + 1E) + (4E + 4E) = 2 \\times E_1 + 2 \\times E_2$\n$E_{gs} = 2(E) + 2(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n**3. Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nTo get the first excited state, we need to create the lowest-energy excitation from the ground state. This is done by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   **Ground state configuration:** 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2.\n*   **Highest occupied level:** n = 2.\n*   **Lowest unoccupied level:** n = 3.\n*   **Excitation:** Move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n\nThe new configuration for the first excited state is:\n*   2 particles in n=1 (Energy E₁ = E)\n*   1 particle in n=2 (Energy E₂ = 4E)\n*   1 particle in n=3 (Energy E₃ = 3²E = 9E)\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n$E_{1st} = 2 \\times E_1 + 1 \\times E_2 + 1 \\times E_3$\n$E_{1st} = 2(E) + 1(4E) + 1(9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n**4. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nTo find the second excited state, we must find the next-lowest energy configuration above the first excited state. We must consider all possible low-energy excitations from the ground state.\n\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E (from configuration: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3).\n*   Let's consider other possible single-particle promotions from the ground state:\n    *   **Option 1: Promote a particle from n=1 to n=3.**\n        *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n        *   Energy = $1 \\times E_1 + 2 \\times E_2 + 1 \\times E_3 = 1(E) + 2(4E) + 1(9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n    *   **Option 2: Promote a particle from n=2 to n=4.**\n        *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=4.\n        *   Energy = $2 \\times E_1 + 1 \\times E_2 + 1 \\times E_4 = 2(E) + 1(4E) + 1(16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n    *   **Option 3: Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3 (a two-particle excitation).**\n        *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=3.\n        *   Energy = $2 \\times E_1 + 2 \\times E_3 = 2(E) + 2(9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n\nComparing the energies of the possible excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...), the second lowest energy after the ground state (10E) is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the second excited state energy is **18E**.\n\n**Summary of Energies:**\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
