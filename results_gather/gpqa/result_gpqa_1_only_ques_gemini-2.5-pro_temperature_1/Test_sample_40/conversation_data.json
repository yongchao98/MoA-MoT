    "This problem requires the use of the relativistic velocity addition formula, as it deals with speeds that can be comparable to the speed of light.\n\nLet's define our frames of reference:\n1.  **S frame:** The laboratory frame, where the observer is at rest.\n2.  **S' frame:** The rest frame of the moving glass. This frame moves with velocity `v` relative to the S frame.\n\nNow let's define the velocities:\n*   **v**: The velocity of the glass (S' frame) relative to the observer (S frame).\n*   **u'**: The velocity of the light beam relative to the glass (S' frame). The speed of light in a medium with refractive index `n` is `c/n`. Since the problem states `c=1`, the speed of light in the glass is `u' = 1/n`. Because the beam propagates in the same direction as the glass is moving, we take this velocity as positive.\n*   **u**: The velocity of the light beam relative to the observer (S frame). This is what we need to calculate.\n\nThe relativistic velocity addition formula for velocities along the same direction is:\n`u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`\n\nNow, we substitute the values we have into this formula:\n*   `u' = 1/n`\n*   `v = v`\n*   `c = 1`\n\n`u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v / 1^2)`\n\nLet's simplify this expression:\n`u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\nTo get rid of the fractions in the numerator and denominator, we can multiply both by `n`:\n`u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n`u = (n*(1/n) + n*v) / (n*1 + n*(v/n))`\n`u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
