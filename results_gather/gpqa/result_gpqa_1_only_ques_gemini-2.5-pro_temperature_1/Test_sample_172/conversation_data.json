    "Here is a step-by-step solution to estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy of the electron.\n\n1.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Speed of the electron, `v = 2 * 10^8 m/s`.\n    *   Uncertainty in the electron's position, `Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 * 10^-9 m = 10^-10 m`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    *   Estimate the minimum uncertainty in the electron's energy, `ΔE`.\n\n3.  **Apply Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:**\n    The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in a particle's position (`Δx`) and its momentum (`Δp_x`). The principle for minimum uncertainty is given by:\n    `Δx * Δp_x = ħ / 2`\n    where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (`ħ = h / 2π ≈ 1.054 * 10^-34 J·s`).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Uncertainty in Momentum (`Δp_x`):**\n    We can rearrange the formula to solve for the minimum uncertainty in momentum:\n    `Δp_x = ħ / (2 * Δx)`\n    `Δp_x = (1.054 * 10^-34 J·s) / (2 * 10^-10 m)`\n    `Δp_x = 0.527 * 10^-24 kg·m/s`\n\n5.  **Relate Uncertainty in Momentum to Uncertainty in Energy:**\n    The relationship between a particle's energy (E) and momentum (p) can be differentiated to find the relationship between their uncertainties. The derivative `dE/dp` gives the particle's group velocity, which is its classical velocity `v`.\n    `dE/dp = v`\n    We can approximate this for small uncertainties:\n    `ΔE / Δp_x ≈ v`\n    `ΔE ≈ v * Δp_x`\n    *(This relationship holds for both non-relativistic kinetic energy, E = p²/2m, and the relativistic energy, E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²).*\n\n6.  **Calculate the Uncertainty in Energy (`ΔE`):**\n    Now, substitute the values of `v` and `Δp_x` into the equation:\n    `ΔE ≈ (2 * 10^8 m/s) * (0.527 * 10^-24 kg·m/s)`\n    `ΔE ≈ 1.054 * 10^-16 J`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated value `ΔE ≈ 1.054 * 10^-16 J` is very close to `10^-16 J`.\n\n    *   A) ~10^(-18) J\n    *   B) ~10^(-19) J\n    *   C) ~10^(-17) J\n    *   D) ~10^(-16) J\n\nThe result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
