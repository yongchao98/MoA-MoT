    "An analysis of each compound is required to determine its chirality, which is the property that gives rise to optical activity. A molecule is optically active if and only if it is chiral (i.e., it is non-superimposable on its mirror image). A common indicator of achirality is the presence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`. The double bond makes the local geometry planar. The entire molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore **achiral**. It is not optically active.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors, `(3aR,7aS)`. This designates a single, specific stereoisomer. When a molecule with stereocenters is designated by its R/S configuration, it refers to a specific enantiomer (or diastereomer), which is chiral by definition (unless it's a meso compound, which would not typically be named this way). This compound is one of a pair of non-superimposable mirror images. Therefore, it is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The `(2R,3S)` designation describes the meso isomer. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   Drawing the molecule, for example in a Fischer projection, reveals a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3.\n        ```\n             COOH\n              |\n        CH3 - C - H   (2R)\n              |\n          H - C - CH3   (3S)\n              |\n             COOH\n        ```\n    *   This compound is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is one of a pair of enantiomers (the other being (2S,3S)). Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The name includes the stereochemical descriptor `(R)`, indicating a specific enantiomer.\n    *   The molecule has a chiral center at C1, which is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, -CH=CH- (part of the ring), and -CH2-CH2- (the other part of the ring). The molecule lacks any plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This notation typically refers to the all-cis isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   This highly symmetric molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through any C-OH bond and the opposite carbon atom (C4) bisects the molecule into two identical halves. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure can be determined from the IUPAC name: `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   To be chiral, a molecule typically needs a chiral center (an atom with four different substituents). Let's check for chiral centers. The only potential candidate is the carbon at position 3 of the butane chain: `CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen, another carbon (`-CH2-CO-cyclopentyl`), and two methyl (`-CH3`) groups. Since two of the attached groups are identical (the two methyl groups), this is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no other elements of chirality. It is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Optically active (chiral) compounds:\n    *   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n    *   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    *   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   Not optically active (achiral) compounds:\n    *   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n    *   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    *   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n    *   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThere are **3** compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<C>>>"
