    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material.**\n\nThe starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down the name to draw its structure:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is the parent structure, a six-membered ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: This is the principal functional group, so its carbon is designated as C1 on the ring. The group is -COOH.\n*   **2-formyl**: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is attached to C2 of the ring.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) is attached to C5 of the ring.\n\nBased on this, we can draw the structure:\n```\n       C1(-COOH)\n      / \\\n  H-C2(-CHO)--C3-H\n   /         ||\nH₂-C6          C4-H\n  \\         /\n  H-C5(-CH=CH₂)\n```\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the starting material.**\n\nThe IHD (also known as the degree of unsaturation) can be calculated by counting the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in the molecule.\n*   **Rings**: There is one six-membered ring. (IHD contribution = 1)\n*   **Pi bonds**:\n    *   One C=C double bond within the cyclohexene ring. (IHD contribution = 1)\n    *   One C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group. (IHD contribution = 1)\n    *   One C=O double bond in the formyl (aldehyde) group. (IHD contribution = 1)\n    *   One C=C double bond in the vinyl group. (IHD contribution = 1)\n\nTotal IHD of the starting material = 1 (ring) + 1 (ring C=C) + 1 (C=O acid) + 1 (C=O aldehyde) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = **5**.\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula and use the IHD formula.\n*   Carbons (C): 6 (in ring) + 1 (in -COOH) + 1 (in -CHO) + 2 (in -CH=CH₂) = 10 carbons.\n*   Hydrogens (H): 1 (at C1) + 1 (at C2) + 1 (at C3) + 1 (at C4) + 1 (at C5) + 2 (at C6) + 1 (in -COOH) + 1 (in -CHO) + 3 (in -CH=CH₂) = 12 hydrogens.\n*   Oxygens (O): 2 (in -COOH) + 1 (in -CHO) = 3 oxygens.\nThe molecular formula is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\nUsing the IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = **5**.\nBoth methods give the same IHD for the starting material.\n\n**Step 3: Understand the reaction and determine the structure of the product.**\n\nThe reagent is **red phosphorus and excess of hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent known for the complete reduction of most oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   All carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) are reduced to single bonds (C-C).\n\nThe reaction will not, however, break the stable cycloalkane ring.\nSo, in the product:\n*   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring (the C=C is reduced).\n*   The -COOH at C1 becomes a -CH₃ group.\n*   The -CHO at C2 becomes a -CH₃ group.\n*   The vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) at C5 becomes an ethyl group (-CH₂-CH₃).\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane: **1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane**. It is a saturated monocyclic alkane.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\n\nWe can calculate the IHD of the product in two ways:\n\n*   **Method 1: Based on structural changes.**\n    The reaction reduces all four pi bonds in the starting material to single bonds. The ring structure remains intact.\n    IHD of product = IHD of starting material - (number of pi bonds reduced)\n    IHD of product = 5 - 4 = **1**.\n    The remaining IHD of 1 is due to the presence of the cyclohexane ring.\n\n*   **Method 2: Based on the product's structure/formula.**\n    The product is 1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane.\n    A molecule's IHD is the sum of its rings and pi bonds.\n    *   Number of rings = 1\n    *   Number of pi bonds = 0 (it is a fully saturated molecule)\n    IHD of product = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n    Alternatively, we can find the molecular formula of the product. The total number of carbons is 10 (6 from the ring + 2 from ethyl + 1 from one methyl + 1 from the other methyl). Since it is a monocyclic alkane, its general formula is CₙH₂ₙ. For n=10, the formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n    Using the IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    IHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = **1**.\n\nAll methods consistently yield an IHD of 1 for the final product.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 5\nC) 1\nD) 3\n\nThe correct answer is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
