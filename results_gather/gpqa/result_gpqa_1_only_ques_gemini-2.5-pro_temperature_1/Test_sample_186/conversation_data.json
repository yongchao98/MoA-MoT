    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine how many of the listed stars are detectable by ESPRESSO.\n\n**Step 1: Define the Detection Criteria**\n\nA star is considered \"detectable\" if it meets two conditions:\n1.  **Brightness Condition:** It must be bright enough to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 in a 1-hour exposure.\n2.  **Visibility Condition:** It must be visible from the Paranal Observatory in Chile.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Limiting Magnitude for ESPRESSO**\n\nWe need to find the faintest apparent V magnitude (m_V) that ESPRESSO can observe to meet the brightness condition. The provided ESO link for the ESPRESSO overview states its performance:\n\"In 1-UT mode, ESPRESSO is expected to provide a S/N of 10 for a V=16.5 mag G2V star in 1 hour in the HR mode.\"\n\nThis means any star with an apparent V magnitude **m_V ≤ 16.5** will be bright enough to be detected.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Visibility from Paranal**\n\nParanal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately 24.6° South. A celestial object's visibility depends on its declination (DEC).\n*   For a star to rise above the horizon at Paranal, its declination must be greater than -90° + 24.6° = -65.4°.\n*   For high-quality observations (avoiding very high airmass), the star should rise reasonably high in the sky. As a general rule, stars with a declination north of about +30° to +40° become very difficult to observe well from Paranal. Crucially, any star with a declination greater than +90° - 24.6° = **+65.4°** will never rise above the horizon.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate Each Star**\n\nWe will now check each star against the brightness (m_V ≤ 16.5) and visibility (observable from Paranal) criteria.\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Brightness:** Canopus has an apparent V magnitude (m_V) of approximately **-0.74**. Since -0.74 is much less than 16.5, it is easily bright enough.\n*   **Visibility:** Canopus has a declination of approximately **-52° 42'**. This is a southern declination, making it perfectly visible and high in the sky from Paranal.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable**.\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Brightness:** Polaris (the North Star) has an apparent V magnitude (m_V) of approximately **+1.98**. Since 1.98 < 16.5, it is bright enough.\n*   **Visibility:** Polaris has a declination of approximately **+89° 16'**. This is far too north to be seen from Paranal's southern latitude (-24.6°). It is permanently below the horizon.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Not Detectable** (because it is not visible).\n\n**c) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, M_V = 15, d = 10 pc**\n*   **Brightness:** We calculate the apparent magnitude (m_V) using the distance modulus formula: m_V - M_V = 5 * log10(d/10), where M_V is the absolute magnitude and d is the distance in parsecs.\n    m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(10 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(1) = 15 + 0 = **15.0**.\n    Since 15.0 ≤ 16.5, it is bright enough.\n*   **Visibility:** The declination is **0°** (the celestial equator), which is easily visible from Paranal.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable**.\n\n**d) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, M_V = 15, d = 200 pc**\n*   **Brightness:** m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(200 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(20) ≈ 15 + 5 * (1.301) ≈ 15 + 6.5 = **21.5**.\n    Since 21.5 > 16.5, it is too faint.\n*   **Visibility:** The declination is 0°, which is visible.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Not Detectable** (too faint).\n\n**e) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, M_V = 15, d = 5 pc**\n*   **Brightness:** m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(5 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(0.5) ≈ 15 + 5 * (-0.301) ≈ 15 - 1.5 = **13.5**.\n    Since 13.5 ≤ 16.5, it is bright enough.\n*   **Visibility:** The declination is 0°, which is visible.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable**.\n\n**f) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, M_V = 15, d = 50 pc**\n*   **Brightness:** m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(50 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(5) ≈ 15 + 5 * (0.699) ≈ 15 + 3.5 = **18.5**.\n    Since 18.5 > 16.5, it is too faint.\n*   **Visibility:** The declination is 0°, which is visible.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Not Detectable** (too faint).\n\n**Step 5: Final Count**\n\nLet's tally the detectable stars:\n1.  Canopus\n2.  Star at 10 pc (c)\n3.  Star at 5 pc (e)\n\nA total of **3** stars are detectable.\n\n<<<A>>>"
