    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System and Radiation Type:**\n    The problem describes an oscillating charge distribution with a spheroidal shape and a symmetry axis along the z-axis. An oscillating charge distribution is a source of electromagnetic radiation. The radiation can be described by a multipole expansion. The lowest order radiating term is typically the electric dipole, followed by the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole, and so on.\n\n    The total radiated power (P) from these multipoles depends on the angular frequency (ω) as:\n    *   Electric Dipole (l=1): P ∝ ω⁴\n    *   Electric Quadrupole (l=2): P ∝ ω⁶\n    *   General Electric Multipole (order l): P ∝ ω²⁽ˡ⁺¹⁾\n\n    In the absence of any special symmetries that would make the electric dipole moment zero, the electric dipole radiation is the dominant term, especially at lower frequencies (longer wavelengths). The problem statement is generic and does not specify any condition that would cancel the dipole moment (like perfect reflection symmetry of the oscillation about the xy-plane). Therefore, the most reasonable model to apply is the electric dipole radiation model.\n\n2.  **Angular Distribution of Electric Dipole Radiation:**\n    For an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, **p**(t) = p₀cos(ωt) **ẑ**, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) in the radiation zone is given by:\n    ```\n    dP/dΩ = (μ₀ p₀² ω⁴) / (32π² c) * sin²(θ)\n    ```\n    where θ is the polar angle measured from the z-axis (the axis of oscillation).\n\n3.  **Wavelength Dependence:**\n    The problem states that the power is a function f of wavelength λ and angle θ. We know the relationship between angular frequency ω and wavelength λ is ω = 2πc/λ.\n    Therefore, the ω⁴ dependence translates to a wavelength dependence of (1/λ)⁴ or λ⁻⁴.\n    So, the functional form of the power is:\n    ```\n    f(λ, θ) = dP/dΩ = K * λ⁻⁴ * sin²(θ)\n    ```\n    where K is a constant that depends on the amplitude of the dipole moment but not on λ or θ.\n    This immediately suggests that the correct form for the wavelength dependence is **λ⁻⁴**. This eliminates options A (λ⁻³) and B (λ⁻⁶). We are left with options C and D.\n\n4.  **Fraction of Maximum Power:**\n    The radiated power depends on the angle as sin²(θ).\n    *   The **maximum power**, A, is radiated when sin²(θ) is maximum. The maximum value of sin²(θ) is 1, which occurs at θ = 90° (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n        `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = K * λ⁻⁴ * sin²(90°) = K * λ⁻⁴`\n    *   We need to find the power radiated at an angle **θ = 30°**.\n        `(dP/dΩ) at 30° = K * λ⁻⁴ * sin²(30°)`\n    *   We know that sin(30°) = 1/2.\n    *   Therefore, sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4.\n    *   The power at 30° is `(dP/dΩ) at 30° = K * λ⁻⁴ * (1/4) = A / 4`.\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power A radiated at θ = 30° is **1/4**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    We have found that:\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power radiated at θ = 30° is 1/4.\n    *   A possible form for the function f (specifically its dependence on wavelength) is λ⁻⁴.\n\n    Matching these two results with the given options:\n    A) 1/4, λ⁻³\n    B) 3/4, λ⁻⁶\n    C) 1/4, λ⁻⁴\n    D) 1/2, λ⁻⁴\n\n    Option C matches our derived results perfectly.\n\n*(Note: Option B, (3/4, λ⁻⁶), would be correct for a specific type of electric quadrupole radiation, which arises under more restrictive symmetry conditions where the electric dipole moment is zero. As the problem doesn't state these conditions, the dominant, lowest-order dipole radiation model is the appropriate choice.)*\n\n<<<C>>>"
