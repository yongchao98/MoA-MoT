    "The Mott-Gurney equation describes an ideal case of space-charge-limited current (SCLC). Let's break down the assumptions required for this equation to be valid and evaluate each option.\n\n**Core Assumptions of the Mott-Gurney Law:**\n\n1.  **Single-Carrier Device:** The model assumes that current is carried by only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes). The contribution of the other carrier type is considered negligible.\n2.  **Trap-Free Material:** The equation in its given form is for an ideal semiconductor or insulator with no trap states within the bandgap. If traps were present, they would capture some of the injected carriers, and the current-voltage relationship would be different.\n3.  **Ohmic Contact (No Injection Barrier):** For SCLC to occur, one of the contacts must be able to inject an unlimited supply of carriers into the device. This is an \"Ohmic contact,\" which by definition has no energy barrier for carrier injection. The current is therefore limited by the bulk properties of the material (the space charge), not by the contact's ability to inject charge.\n4.  **Drift-Dominated Transport (Negligible Diffusion):** The model assumes that the dominant transport mechanism is carrier drift due to the applied electric field. The current arising from carrier concentration gradients (diffusion current) is assumed to be negligible. This is a good approximation when the applied voltage is much larger than the thermal voltage (kT/e).\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n    *   This is incorrect. A Schottky contact is a rectifying contact that typically presents an energy barrier to charge injection. The Mott-Gurney law requires an Ohmic contact that provides a reservoir of charge with no injection barrier.\n\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.**\n    *   This is incorrect. SCLC is fundamentally a **drift** current phenomenon. The current is composed of injected carriers drifting under the influence of the electric field. Neglecting the drift current would mean there is no current, which contradicts the entire concept. The model neglects **diffusion** current, not drift current.\n\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.**\n    *   This statement is correct. It accurately summarizes the key conditions:\n        *   \"trap-free single-carrier device\": Correct.\n        *   \"no carrier injection barrier\": This is the definition of an ideal Ohmic contact, which is required.\n        *   \"negligible diffusion current\": Correct, as the transport is drift-dominated.\n\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n    *   This is incorrect. The standard Mott-Gurney equation provided is a single-carrier model. While SCLC can be analyzed in two-carrier systems, the equations become more complex (involving recombination) and are different from the one given.\n\nTherefore, statement C provides the correct set of conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
