    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Define the Initial State and Operators**\n\n*   The initial state of the system is given by the column vector |ψ⟩:\n    ```\n    |ψ⟩ = \n    [-1]\n    [ 2]\n    [ 1]\n    ```\n*   The operator for observable P is:\n    ```\n    P = \n    [0   1/√2   0  ]\n    [1/√2  0   1/√2]\n    [0   1/√2   0  ]\n    ```\n*   The operator for observable Q is:\n    ```\n    Q = \n    [1   0   0]\n    [0   0   0]\n    [0   0  -1]\n    ```\n\n**2. Normalize the Initial State**\n\nFirst, we need to normalize the state vector |ψ⟩. The squared norm is ⟨ψ|ψ⟩:\n⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)*(-1) + (2)*(2) + (1)*(1) = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6\nThe normalization constant is 1/√6. The normalized state, |ψ_norm⟩, is:\n```\n|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * \n                  [-1]\n                  [ 2]\n                  [ 1]\n```\n\n**3. Find the Eigenvector of P for the Eigenvalue 0**\n\nWe need to find the probability of measuring P and getting the value 0. For this, we first need the eigenvector of P corresponding to the eigenvalue p=0. Let's call this eigenvector |p=0⟩.\nWe solve the equation P|v⟩ = 0|v⟩ = 0:\n```\n[0   1/√2   0  ] [x]   [0]\n[1/√2  0   1/√2] [y] = [0]\n[0   1/√2   0  ] [z]   [0]\n```\nFrom the first row, we get (1/√2)y = 0, which means y = 0.\nFrom the second row, we get (1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0, which means x = -z.\nThe eigenvector is of the form (x, 0, -x). To normalize it, we set its length to 1:\nx² + 0² + (-x)² = 1  =>  2x² = 1  =>  x = 1/√2.\nSo, the normalized eigenvector for p=0 is:\n```\n|p=0⟩ = \n[ 1/√2]\n[  0  ]\n[-1/√2]\n```\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability of Measuring P=0**\n\nThe probability of measuring P=0 is the square of the magnitude of the projection of the initial state |ψ_norm⟩ onto the eigenvector |p=0⟩.\nProb(P=0) = |⟨p=0|ψ_norm⟩|²\nFirst, calculate the inner product ⟨p=0|ψ_norm⟩:\n⟨p=0|ψ_norm⟩ = [1/√2  0  -1/√2] * (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T\n= (1/√12) * ( (1)*(-1) + (0)*(2) + (-1)*(1) )\n= (1/√12) * (-1 - 1) = -2/√12 = -2/(2√3) = -1/√3\nNow, we find the probability:\nProb(P=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3\n\n**5. State Collapse After the First Measurement**\n\nAfter measuring P and obtaining the result 0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding eigenvector |p=0⟩. The new state of the system, |ψ'⟩, is:\n|ψ'⟩ = |p=0⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]^T\n\n**6. Find the Eigenvector of Q for the Eigenvalue -1**\n\nNow, we measure the observable Q on the new state |ψ'⟩. We are interested in the outcome q=-1. The operator Q is diagonal, so its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements (1, 0, -1) and its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\nThe normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue q=-1 is:\n```\n|q=-1⟩ = \n[0]\n[0]\n[1]\n```\n\n**7. Calculate the Probability of Measuring Q=-1**\n\nThe probability of measuring Q=-1 in the state |ψ'⟩ is given by:\nProb(Q=-1 | state is |ψ'⟩) = |⟨q=-1|ψ'⟩|² = |⟨q=-1|p=0⟩|²\nFirst, calculate the inner product ⟨q=-1|p=0⟩:\n⟨q=-1|p=0⟩ = [0  0  1] * [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]^T\n= (0)*(1/√2) + (0)*(0) + (1)*(-1/√2) = -1/√2\nNow, we find the probability:\nProb(Q=-1 | state is |p=0⟩) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2\n\n**8. Calculate the Total Probability**\n\nThe total probability of measuring P=0 and then Q=-1 is the product of the individual probabilities calculated in the steps above.\nProb(P=0 and then Q=-1) = Prob(P=0) × Prob(Q=-1 | state is |p=0⟩)\nProb(Total) = (1/3) × (1/2) = 1/6\n\nThe probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q is 1/6.\n\n<<<A>>>"
