    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Determine Rest Masses and Total Kinetic Energy\n\nFirst, we are given the initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus:\n*   $Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThe nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses $m_1$ and $m_2$. We are given two conditions:\n1.  One fragment is twice as massive as the other: $m_1 = 2m_2$. We will call $m_1$ the \"more massive\" fragment.\n2.  The sum of the fragments' rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$.\n\nFrom these two conditions, we can find the rest masses of the fragments. Substitute the first condition into the second:\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99M \\implies m_2 = 0.33M$.\nThen, $m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33M) = 0.66M$.\n\nNow we can find their rest-mass energies:\n*   $m_1c^2 = 0.66(Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   $m_2c^2 = 0.33(Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThe total rest-mass energy of the fragments is $198 + 99 = 297 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThe difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final rest-mass energy is converted into the total kinetic energy (Q-value) of the fragments:\n*   $T_{total} = T_1 + T_2 = Mc^2 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n*   $T_{total} = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n### 2. Classical (Non-Relativistic) Calculation of T1\n\nIn both classical and relativistic mechanics, since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum of the fragments must be zero. This means they fly apart in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n*   $|\\vec{p_1}| = |\\vec{p_2}| = p$.\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is $T = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$.\n*   For the more massive fragment: $T_{1,class} = \\frac{p^2}{2m_1}$\n*   For the less massive fragment: $T_{2,class} = \\frac{p^2}{2m_2}$\n\nFrom this, we can establish a ratio of their kinetic energies:\n$\\frac{T_{1,class}}{T_{2,class}} = \\frac{p^2/2m_1}{p^2/2m_2} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1}$\n\nSince $m_1 = 2m_2$, the ratio is:\n$\\frac{T_{1,class}}{T_{2,class}} = \\frac{m_2}{2m_2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies T_{2,class} = 2T_{1,class}$.\n\nNow we use the total kinetic energy:\n$T_1 + T_2 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$T_{1,class} + 2T_{1,class} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$3T_{1,class} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$T_{1,class} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nSo, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment calculated classically is **1.000 GeV**.\n\n### 3. Correct (Relativistic) Calculation of T1\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between total energy ($E$), momentum ($p$), and rest mass ($m$) is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$. The total energy is also the sum of kinetic energy and rest-mass energy, $E = T + m_0c^2$.\n\nCombining these, we get:\n$(T + m_0c^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$\n$T^2 + 2Tm_0c^2 + (m_0c^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$\n$(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2Tm_0c^2 = T(T + 2m_0c^2)$\n\nSince the momenta of the two fragments are equal in magnitude ($p_1 = p_2$), their $(pc)^2$ values are also equal:\n$T_1(T_1 + 2m_1c^2) = T_2(T_2 + 2m_2c^2)$\n\nWe know:\n*   $m_1c^2 = 198 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $m_2c^2 = 99 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $T_2 = T_{total} - T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV} - T_1$\n\nSubstitute these values into the equation (let's omit the GeV units for clarity during calculation):\n$T_1(T_1 + 2 \\times 198) = (3 - T_1)((3 - T_1) + 2 \\times 99)$\n$T_1(T_1 + 396) = (3 - T_1)(3 - T_1 + 198)$\n$T_1^2 + 396T_1 = (3 - T_1)(201 - T_1)$\n$T_1^2 + 396T_1 = 603 - 3T_1 - 201T_1 + T_1^2$\n$T_1^2 + 396T_1 = 603 - 204T_1 + T_1^2$\n\nThe $T_1^2$ terms on both sides cancel out:\n$396T_1 = 603 - 204T_1$\n$396T_1 + 204T_1 = 603$\n$600T_1 = 603$\n$T_1 = \\frac{603}{600} = \\frac{201}{200} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nSo, the correct relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is **1.005 GeV**.\n\n### 4. Find the Difference\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation for T1.\n$\\Delta T_1 = T_{1,rel} - T_{1,class}$\n$\\Delta T_1 = 1.005 \\text{ GeV} - 1.000 \\text{ GeV} = 0.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nFinally, we convert this difference to MeV:\n$1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$\n$\\Delta T_1 = 0.005 \\times 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nThe difference is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
