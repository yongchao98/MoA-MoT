    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics**\n\nThe problem asks for the change in the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy levels at two different temperatures. Since the stellar photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), we can use the Boltzmann equation to describe the population of these energy levels.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms (n) in a higher energy level (level 2) to a lower energy level (level 1):\n$n_2 / n_1 = (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))$\nwhere:\n*   $n_2, n_1$ are the number densities of atoms in level 2 and level 1.\n*   $g_2, g_1$ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n*   $ΔE = E_2 - E_1$ is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   $k$ is the Boltzmann constant ($8.617 \\times 10^{-5}$ eV/K).\n*   $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information**\n\n*   Temperature without spots: $T_1 = 6000$ K\n*   Temperature with spots (overall effective temperature): $T_2 = 5500$ K\n*   Wavelength of the transition between the levels: $λ = 1448$ Å\n\nThe stellar radius, mass, and spot coverage percentage are contextual information explaining why the effective temperature changes, but they are not needed for this specific calculation.\n\n**3. Set up the Calculation**\n\nWe need to find the factor by which the ratio changes. This is the ratio of the population ratios at the two different temperatures. Let $R(T) = n_2 / n_1$. We want to calculate the factor $F = R(T_1) / R(T_2)$.\n\n$F = \\frac{R(T_1)}{R(T_2)} = \\frac{(g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))}{(g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))}$\n\nThe term for the statistical weights $(g_2 / g_1)$ cancels out:\n\n$F = \\frac{exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))}{exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))}$\n\nUsing the properties of exponents ($e^a / e^b = e^{a-b}$), we get:\n\n$F = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2)))$\n$F = exp(\\frac{ΔE}{k} * (\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1}))$\n\n**4. Calculate the Energy Difference ($ΔE$)**\n\nThe energy difference corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given wavelength. We can use the formula $ΔE = hc / λ$. A useful shortcut in astrophysics is $hc \\approx 12400$ eV·Å.\n\n$ΔE = \\frac{12400 \\text{ eV·Å}}{1448 \\text{ Å}} \\approx 8.5635$ eV\n\n**5. Perform the Final Calculation**\n\nNow we can plug all the values into our formula for the factor F:\n\n$F = exp(\\frac{8.5635 \\text{ eV}}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/K}} * (\\frac{1}{5500 \\text{ K}} - \\frac{1}{6000 \\text{ K}}))$\n\nFirst, calculate the term in the parentheses:\n$\\frac{1}{5500} - \\frac{1}{6000} = \\frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \\times 6000} = \\frac{500}{33,000,000} = \\frac{1}{66,000} \\text{ K}^{-1}$\n\nNow, calculate the full exponent:\nExponent = $\\frac{8.5635}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5}} * \\frac{1}{66,000} \\approx 99379 * \\frac{1}{66,000} \\approx 1.5057$\n\nFinally, calculate the factor F:\n$F = exp(1.5057) \\approx 4.507$\n\nThis value is approximately 4.5.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThe factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels changes is approximately 4.5. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
