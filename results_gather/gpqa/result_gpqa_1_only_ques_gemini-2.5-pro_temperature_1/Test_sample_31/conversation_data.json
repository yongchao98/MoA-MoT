    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total relativistic energy (E) of the specified nucleus. The formula for total relativistic energy is:\n\n$E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$\n\nwhere:\n*   $\\gamma$ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n*   $m_0$ is the rest mass of the nucleus.\n*   $c$ is the speed of light.\n*   $E_0 = m_0 c^2$ is the rest mass energy.\n\nLet's break down the calculation into steps.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the nucleus and its mass number.**\n*   The element is Lithium (Li), which has an atomic number Z = 3 (3 protons).\n*   The problem specifies it has 3 neutrons (N = 3).\n*   The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons: A = Z + N = 3 + 3 = 6.\n*   Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 ($^6$Li).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\nThe speed of the nucleus is given as v = 0.96c. The Lorentz factor is calculated as:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\nSubstituting v/c = 0.96:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.0784}} = \\frac{1}{0.28}$\n$\\gamma \\approx 3.5714$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the rest mass energy ($E_0$) of the nucleus.**\nA precise calculation using the measured mass of a $^6$Li nucleus (which accounts for binding energy) gives a rest energy of about 5.6015 GeV. This leads to a total energy of ~20.005 GeV, which does not match any of the options.\n\nThis indicates that the problem likely expects an approximation where the mass of the nucleus is its mass number (A) multiplied by the mass of a single nucleon. Let's use the mass of a neutron for this approximation, as it often yields results that match such problems.\n\n*   Rest mass energy of a neutron ($m_n c^2$) ≈ 939.565 MeV\n*   Approximated rest mass energy of $^6$Li nucleus:\n    $E_0 \\approx A \\times m_n c^2 = 6 \\times 939.565 \\text{ MeV} \\approx 5637.39 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   Converting to Giga-electron Volts (GeV):\n    $E_0 \\approx 5.6374 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total relativistic energy (E).**\nNow we can combine the Lorentz factor and the approximated rest energy:\n$E = \\gamma E_0$\n$E \\approx 3.5714 \\times 5.6374 \\text{ GeV}$\n$E \\approx 20.1336 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**Step 5: Compare the result with the given options.**\nThe calculated value of 20.1336 GeV is extremely close to option D. The minor difference is attributable to the precision of the physical constants used.\n\nA) 18.475 GeV\nB) 21.419 GeV\nC) 23.069 GeV\nD) 20.132 GeV\n\nThe result clearly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
