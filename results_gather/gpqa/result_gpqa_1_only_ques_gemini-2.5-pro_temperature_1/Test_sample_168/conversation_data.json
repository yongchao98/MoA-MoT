    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Original Decay and its Spectrum**\n    *   The original decay is `2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V`. Let's treat the initial state `2A` as a single nucleus/system `N_A` and the final heavy nucleons `2B` as a single nucleus/system `N_B`. The decay is effectively `N_A -> N_B + 2E + 2V`.\n    *   This is a multi-body final state (one nucleus `N_B`, two `E` particles, and two `V` particles).\n    *   In any decay with three or more particles in the final state, the available energy is shared among them in a continuous distribution, governed by the conservation of energy and momentum.\n    *   Therefore, the kinetic energy of any of the final particles (or the sum of kinetic energies of a subset of them, like the two `E` particles) will have a continuous spectrum.\n    *   The problem states this explicitly: \"the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous\".\n\n2.  **Analyze the Variant Decay and its Spectrum**\n    *   The variant decay is `2A -> 2B + 2E + M`. Replacing `N_A` and `N_B` as before, this is `N_A -> N_B + 2E + M`.\n    *   This final state also has multiple bodies (one nucleus `N_B`, two `E` particles, and one `M` particle).\n    *   Since there are still more than two particles in the final state, the energy will be shared among them continuously.\n    *   Therefore, the total energy spectrum of the outgoing `E` particles will remain continuous. It will not become discrete.\n    *   This eliminates options A and B.\n\n3.  **Compare the Endpoints of the Spectra**\n    *   The endpoint of the energy spectrum for the `E` particles corresponds to the maximum possible total kinetic energy they can have. This occurs when the *other* light particles (`2V` in the original case, `M` in the variant case) carry away the minimum possible energy.\n    *   Let `Q_nuc` be the total energy released by the nuclear transition, `Q_nuc = (mass(2A) - mass(2B)) * c²`. This energy must account for the rest masses of the new particles created and the kinetic energies of all final particles.\n\n    *   **Original Decay Endpoint (Q):**\n        *   Energy conservation: `mass(2A)c² = mass(2B)c² + E_total(2E) + E_total(2V) + KE(2B)`.\n        *   Where `E_total` is the total energy (rest mass + kinetic energy).\n        *   `Q_nuc = (KE_total(2E) + 2m_E c²) + (KE_total(2V) + 2m_V c²) + KE(2B)`.\n        *   The total kinetic energy of the `E` particles is `KE_total(2E) = Q_nuc - 2m_E c² - 2m_V c² - KE_total(2V) - KE(2B)`.\n        *   The endpoint `Q` is the maximum value of `KE_total(2E)`. This happens when `KE_total(2V)` and `KE(2B)` are minimal (i.e., zero).\n        *   So, `Q = Q_nuc - 2m_E c² - 2m_V c²`.\n\n    *   **Variant Decay Endpoint (Q'):**\n        *   Energy conservation: `mass(2A)c² = mass(2B)c² + E_total(2E) + E(M) + KE(2B)`.\n        *   `Q_nuc = (KE_total(2E) + 2m_E c²) + (KE(M) + m_M c²) + KE(2B)`.\n        *   The problem states `M` is massless, so `m_M = 0`.\n        *   `KE_total(2E) = Q_nuc - 2m_E c² - KE(M) - KE(2B)`.\n        *   The new endpoint `Q'` is the maximum value of `KE_total(2E)`. This happens when `KE(M)` and `KE(2B)` are minimal (zero).\n        *   So, `Q' = Q_nuc - 2m_E c²`.\n\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   `Q = Q_nuc - 2m_E c² - 2m_V c²`\n        *   `Q' = Q_nuc - 2m_E c²`\n        *   The particle `V` is described as \"much lighter\", which implies it has a small but non-zero mass (`m_V > 0`). In contrast, `M` is explicitly \"massless\".\n        *   Since `m_V > 0`, the term `2m_V c²` is positive.\n        *   Therefore, `Q' = Q + 2m_V c²`, which means `Q' > Q`.\n        *   The endpoint of the spectrum for the variant decay is higher than that of the original decay.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe spectrum remains continuous, but its shape is adjusted. The endpoint of the spectrum increases because the total rest mass of the emitted light particles (`2m_E + m_M`) is less than in the original case (`2m_E + 2m_V`), leaving more energy available for kinetic energy. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
