    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n  \n  T_eq = [ L * (1 - A) / (16 * π * σ * d²) ]^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   L = Luminosity of the star\n*   A = Albedo of the planet\n*   d = Orbital distance from the star\n*   σ = Stefan-Boltzmann constant\n*   π = Pi\n\nIn this problem, all three planets orbit the same star, so L is constant. We are also told that the albedo (A) is the same for all three planets (A = 0.3). The other terms (16, π, σ) are also constants. Therefore, we can establish a proportionality:\n\n  T_eq ∝ (1 / d²)^(1/4)\n  T_eq ∝ 1 / d^(1/2)\n\nThis means that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance. We can also write this as:\n\n  d ∝ 1 / T_eq²\n\n**2. Understand the relationship between Orbital Period and Orbital Distance**\n\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (which is the orbital distance 'd' for a circular orbit):\n\n  P² ∝ d³\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\n  P ∝ d^(3/2)\n\n**3. Combine the two relationships**\n\nNow we can combine the two relationships to find a direct link between the orbital period (P) and the equilibrium temperature (T_eq).\n\nWe know P ∝ d^(3/2) and d ∝ 1 / T_eq². Substituting the expression for 'd' into the one for 'P':\n\n  P ∝ (1 / T_eq²)^(3/2)\n  P ∝ 1 / T_eq³\n\nThis tells us that the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature. For any two planets, Planet_i and Planet_j, the ratio of their periods is:\n\n  P_i / P_j = (T_eq_j / T_eq_i)³\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nWe need to find the ratio P3 / P1. Using the formula we just derived:\n\n  P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)³\n\nWe are given the temperature ratios:\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 1.4\n*   T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3\n\nWe can find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq3 by multiplying these two ratios:\n\n  T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) ≈ 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22\n\nNow, we can calculate the ratio of the orbital periods:\n\n  P3 / P1 ≈ (3.22)³\n  P3 / P1 ≈ 33.386888\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4. The information about the planets' masses and the TTV method is not needed to solve this particular problem.\n\nThus, the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
