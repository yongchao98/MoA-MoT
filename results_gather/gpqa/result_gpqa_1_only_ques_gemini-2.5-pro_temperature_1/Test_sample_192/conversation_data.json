    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Define the variables and relationships:**\n    *   Let N be the number of stars.\n    *   Let `plx` be the parallax.\n    *   Let `r` be the distance.\n    *   The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as `1/plx^5`. This is typically interpreted as the cumulative number of stars with a parallax greater than a certain value `plx`. So, `N ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n    *   The relationship between distance (`r`) and parallax (`plx`) is that they are inversely proportional: `r ∝ 1/plx`. This means `plx ∝ 1/r`.\n\n2.  **Express the number of stars as a function of distance:**\n    *   We are given `N ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n    *   We can substitute the relationship `plx ∝ 1/r` into this expression.\n    *   `N ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n    *   `N ∝ 1 / (1/r^5)`\n    *   `N ∝ r^5`\n    *   This means the total (cumulative) number of stars out to a distance `r` is proportional to `r^5`.\n\n3.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of distance:**\n    *   The question asks for how the number of stars changes \"per unit range of distance, r\". This is equivalent to asking for the number density of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance `r`. Mathematically, this is the derivative of the cumulative number of stars `N` with respect to the distance `r`, which is `dN/dr`.\n    *   We have `N ∝ r^5`, which can be written as `N = k * r^5` for some constant `k`.\n    *   Now, we take the derivative with respect to `r`:\n    *   `dN/dr = d(k * r^5)/dr`\n    *   `dN/dr = 5 * k * r^4`\n    *   Therefore, `dN/dr ∝ r^4`.\n\nThe number of stars in that region of the sky per unit range of distance changes in proportion to `r^4`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
