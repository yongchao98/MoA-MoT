    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each reaction:\n\n**Reaction 1: Formation of A**\n\n*   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a base (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure is p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n*   **Reaction:** The malonate enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** CH₂(COOMe)₂ + NaOEt → Na⁺ ⁻CH(COOMe)₂ + EtOH\n    2.  **Michael Addition:** ⁻CH(COOMe)₂ attacks the β-carbon.\n        p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOMe + ⁻CH(COOMe)₂ → p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)₂) -⁻CH(α)-COOMe\n    3.  **Protonation:** The resulting enolate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to yield the final product.\n        p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)₂) -⁻CH(α)-COOMe + EtOH → p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)₂)-CH₂(α)-COOMe + EtO⁻\n*   **Product A:** The structure is (MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOMe.\n    To name this compound, we identify the main chain as propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid. The product is the trimethyl ester of this acid with a p-tolyl group at position 2.\n    Therefore, the IUPAC name for product A is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n**Reaction 2: Formation of B**\n\n*   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine derived from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are excellent nucleophiles for Michael additions, with the β-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring) being the nucleophilic center.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile). The structure is CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN.\n*   **Reaction (Stork Enamine Alkylation):**\n    1.  **Michael Addition:** The enamine's β-carbon attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile, forming a new C-C bond. This results in an iminium ion intermediate.\n    2.  **Hydrolysis:** The subsequent addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a ketone.\n*   **Product B:** The final product has a cyclohexanone ring. The substituent, derived from but-2-enenitrile, is attached at the C2 position (alpha to the carbonyl). The substituent group is -CH(CH₃)CH₂CN.\n    The structure is 2-[-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN]cyclohexan-1-one. Naming this compound with butanenitrile as the parent chain gives the name **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is much more stable than the enol form under these conditions, so the ketone is the major final product.\n\n**Reaction 3: Identification of C**\n\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK). The structure is CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃.\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** This is a Michael addition. The \"3-oxobutyl\" group (-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃) in the product is formed from the Michael acceptor, MVK, after it is attacked by a nucleophile at its β-carbon (the CH₂ group) and subsequently protonated.\n    The product shows that this 3-oxobutyl group is attached to the C2 position of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring. This means the nucleophile must have been the enolate of reactant C, formed by removing a proton from the carbon that becomes C2.\n*   **Reactant C:** The starting material C must be the precursor to this nucleophile. The protons at C2 of a 1,3-dicarbonyl compound are highly acidic. Therefore, reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The base (KOH) deprotonates it at C2 to form the nucleophilic enolate that attacks MVK.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis set of reactants and products corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
