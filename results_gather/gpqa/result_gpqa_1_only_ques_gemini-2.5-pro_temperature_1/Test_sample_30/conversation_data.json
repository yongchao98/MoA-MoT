    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is the electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction known as nitration. Toluene (C₆H₅CH₃) has a methyl group (-CH₃) attached to a benzene ring.\n*   **Directing Effect:** The methyl group is an ortho, para-director and an activating group. Nitration will introduce a nitro group (-NO₂) onto the ring.\n*   **Product 1:** Two main products are formed: ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. Due to steric hindrance from the bulky methyl group, the para-product is the major product. In multi-step syntheses, we typically assume the major product is carried forward.\n*   **Product 1 is p-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).**\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄, forming product 2.**\n\n*   **Reactant:** p-Nitrotoluene.\n*   **Reagents:** Manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) constitute a strong oxidizing agent system.\n*   **Reaction:** This system will oxidize the alkyl side-chain of the aromatic ring. The benzylic methyl group (-CH₃) is oxidized.\n*   **Ambiguity:** Strong oxidation would typically convert the methyl group (-CH₃) all the way to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), yielding p-nitrobenzoic acid. However, looking ahead to step 3, the reagents are acetone and base, which strongly suggests a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. This reaction requires an aldehyde. It is a common feature of such problems that the reactants of a later step clarify the outcome of an earlier one. Therefore, we can infer that the oxidation is controlled to stop at the aldehyde stage. MnO₂ is indeed capable of this transformation under certain conditions.\n*   **Product 2 is p-nitrobenzaldehyde (4-nitrobenzaldehyde).**\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\n\n*   **Reactants:** p-Nitrobenzaldehyde and acetone.\n*   **Reagents:** Aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH) acts as a base.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a base-catalyzed aldol condensation between an aldehyde (with no α-hydrogens) and a ketone. This specific type is called a **Claisen-Schmidt condensation**.\n    1.  The base (OH⁻) removes an acidic α-proton from acetone (CH₃COCH₃) to form an enolate ion (⁻CH₂COCH₃).\n    2.  The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n    3.  This forms an aldol addition product, which then readily undergoes dehydration (loses a molecule of water) to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is **(E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)-3-buten-2-one**, also known as p-nitrobenzalacetone. The E (trans) isomer is favored due to lower steric hindrance.\n\n**Symmetry Analysis of Product 3**\n\n*   **Structure:** The structure of (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)-3-buten-2-one is O₂N-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃.\n*   **Conformation:** The molecule has an extended π-conjugated system involving the benzene ring, the C=C double bond, and the C=O double bond. This favors a planar conformation for the heavy-atom skeleton to maximize orbital overlap.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   Assuming the molecule adopts a planar conformation, the plane of the molecule itself is a **plane of symmetry (σ)**.\n    *   There is no rotational axis (Cₙ for n > 1).\n    *   There is no center of inversion (i).\n    *   There are no improper rotation axes (Sₙ).\n*   **Point Group:** A molecule that has only an identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of product 3 is Cₛ.\n\n<<<B>>>"
