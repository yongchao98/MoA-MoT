    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the given information from the 1H NMR spectrum:**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**2. Analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each of the options:**\n\nLet's predict the number of signals, their multiplicity, and their relative integrations for each compound.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry passes through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The two methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        3.  The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This will result in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The two methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The two methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        This will result in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:6, which simplifies to 1:1.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H, 6H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   The problem states that all signals in the aliphatic region are singlets. 1,4-diethylbenzene has ethyl groups, which will show splitting (a quartet for the -CH2- and a triplet for the -CH3). Therefore, this compound can be eliminated immediately. This rules out option D.\n\n**3. Evaluate the remaining options based on the mixture's spectrum:**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture of two compounds that produces the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **Aromatic Signals:** The mixture shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. Since all three remaining candidate compounds (Durene, Isodurene, Prehnitene) each have one aromatic singlet corresponding to 2H, any 1:1 mixture of two of them will produce two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This condition is met by options A, B, and C.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Signals:** The mixture shows three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of aliphatic protons is 12 (from the first compound) + 12 (from the second compound) = 24H. The 2:1:1 ratio corresponds to integrations of:\n    *   (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n    *   (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    So, we need a combination that gives three signals integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\nLet's test the combinations:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Durene gives one singlet (12H).\n    *   Isodurene gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Combined, this would give four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), unless some signals overlap. This does not match the observed three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio without assuming accidental signal overlap.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Prehnitene gives two singlets (6H, 6H).\n    *   Isodurene gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Combined, this would give up to five signals. To get the desired pattern, multiple accidental overlaps would be required, which is unlikely.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Durene gives **one singlet (12H)**.\n    *   Prehnitene gives **two singlets (6H and 6H)**.\n    *   When combined in a 1:1 mixture, the aliphatic spectrum will show exactly **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n    *   The ratio of these integrations is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   This combination perfectly matches the description of the aliphatic region without requiring any assumptions of accidental signal overlap.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only option that directly accounts for all the features of the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>"
