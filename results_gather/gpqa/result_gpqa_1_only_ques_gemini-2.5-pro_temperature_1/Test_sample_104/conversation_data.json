    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the solution.\n\n**1. Understand the Stellar Variability due to Spots**\n\nThe variation in the star's brightness is caused by the rotation of the star, which brings a spotty hemisphere into and out of view. We need to calculate the amplitude of this brightness variation. The flux (and thus brightness) emitted by a surface is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that flux is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature ($F \\propto T^4$).\n\n*   **Maximum Flux ($F_{max}$):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The entire visible disk has the effective temperature of the star, $T_{eff}$. Let's denote the flux in this state as $F_0$.\n    $F_{max} = F_0 \\propto A_{disk} \\cdot T_{eff}^4$, where $A_{disk}$ is the projected area of the star's disk.\n\n*   **Minimum Flux ($F_{min}$):** This occurs when the hemisphere covered in spots is facing the observer. The spots have a temperature $T_{spot}$ and cover a fraction of the visible disk given by the filling factor, $f_{spot}$. The rest of the disk, a fraction $(1 - f_{spot})$, is at the normal effective temperature, $T_{eff}$.\n    The total flux is the sum of the flux from the hot and cool parts:\n    $F_{min} \\propto [(1 - f_{spot}) \\cdot A_{disk} \\cdot T_{eff}^4] + [f_{spot} \\cdot A_{disk} \\cdot T_{spot}^4]$\n\n*   **Amplitude of Variation:** The amplitude of the signal is the relative change in flux between the maximum and minimum brightness.\n    Amplitude = $\\frac{F_{max} - F_{min}}{F_{max}}$\n    Amplitude = $\\frac{A_{disk} T_{eff}^4 - [(1 - f_{spot}) A_{disk} T_{eff}^4 + f_{spot} A_{disk} T_{spot}^4]}{A_{disk} T_{eff}^4}$\n\n    We can cancel out the common term $A_{disk}$:\n    Amplitude = $\\frac{T_{eff}^4 - (1 - f_{spot}) T_{eff}^4 - f_{spot} T_{spot}^4}{T_{eff}^4}$\n    Amplitude = $\\frac{f_{spot} T_{eff}^4 - f_{spot} T_{spot}^4}{T_{eff}^4}$\n    Amplitude = $f_{spot} \\left(1 - \\frac{T_{spot}^4}{T_{eff}^4}\\right) = f_{spot} \\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}}\\right)^4\\right]$\n\n**2. Calculate the Numerical Value of the Amplitude**\n\nLet's plug in the given values:\n*   Effective temperature, $T_{eff} = 6000$ K\n*   Spot temperature, $T_{spot} = 6000 \\, K - 1000 \\, K = 5000$ K\n*   Spot filling factor, $f_{spot} = 20\\% = 0.20$\n\nAmplitude = $0.20 \\times \\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{5000}{6000}\\right)^4\\right]$\nAmplitude = $0.20 \\times \\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^4\\right]$\nAmplitude = $0.20 \\times \\left[1 - \\frac{625}{1296}\\right]$\nAmplitude = $0.20 \\times \\left[\\frac{1296 - 625}{1296}\\right]$\nAmplitude = $0.20 \\times \\left[\\frac{671}{1296}\\right]$\nAmplitude $\\approx 0.20 \\times 0.51775 = 0.10355$\n\nSo, the star's brightness varies by about 10.4%.\n\n**3. Relate the Amplitude to a Transiting Exoplanet**\n\nThe problem asks for the size of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same signal amplitude. For a transiting exoplanet, the dip in brightness (the transit depth) is caused by the planet blocking a portion of the star's light. Assuming the planet is completely dark, the depth is simply the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n\nTransit Depth = $\\frac{\\text{Area}_{planet}}{\\text{Area}_{star}} = \\frac{\\pi R_{pl}^2}{\\pi R_{star}^2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}\\right)^2$\n\n**4. Solve for the Planet's Relative Radius**\n\nWe need to find the relative radius ($R_{pl}/R_{star}$) that produces a transit depth equal to the amplitude of the spot modulation.\n\nTransit Depth = Amplitude\n$\\left(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}\\right)^2 = 0.10355$\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius by taking the square root:\n$\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}} = \\sqrt{0.10355} \\approx 0.3218$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing our result to the given options:\nA) ~0.07\nB) ~0.39\nC) ~0.11 (This is the value of the amplitude/transit depth, not the relative radius)\nD) ~0.32\n\nThe calculated relative radius of the hypothetical exoplanet is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<D>>>"
