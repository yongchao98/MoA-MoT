    "Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Principle of Radioactive Decay**\n\nThe key concept here is that radioactive decay is a **memoryless process**. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval does not depend on how long it has already existed. The atom does not \"age\" or get \"weaker\". At any given moment, its probability of decaying in the next second, minute, or hour is exactly the same as it was for a brand new atom of the same type.\n\nTherefore, the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay is irrelevant to the future probability. We just need to calculate the probability of the atom decaying in a 150-minute interval.\n\n**2. Calculate the Decay Constant (λ)**\n\nThe probability of decay is described by the exponential decay formula:\nP(decay in time t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\nwhere:\n*   `P` is the probability of decay\n*   `λ` is the decay constant (which we need to find)\n*   `t` is the time interval\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay is 32% (or 0.32) in 100 minutes. We can use this to find λ.\n\n0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)\n\nFirst, solve for e^(-λ * 100):\ne^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32\ne^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\nNow, take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides to solve for λ:\nln(e^(-λ * 100)) = ln(0.68)\n-100λ = ln(0.68)\nλ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\nUsing a calculator, ln(0.68) ≈ -0.3857.\nλ ≈ -(-0.3857) / 100\nλ ≈ 0.003857 min⁻¹\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability for the Next 150 Minutes**\n\nNow we use the decay constant (λ) we just found to calculate the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval.\n\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\nP = 1 - e^(-0.003857 * 150)\nP = 1 - e^(-0.57855)\n\nNow, calculate e^(-0.57855):\ne^(-0.57855) ≈ 0.5607\n\nFinally, calculate the probability:\nP = 1 - 0.5607\nP ≈ 0.4393\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nThe probability is approximately 0.4393, which is 43.93%. This rounds to 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>"
