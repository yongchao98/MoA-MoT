    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify compound D.\n\n**Step 1: Identification of Compound A**\n\n*   The proton NMR spectrum of compound A shows two signals.\n*   A triplet at 0.9 ppm with an integration of 6H indicates two equivalent methyl groups (2 x -CH3), each adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-). The splitting pattern (triplet, n+1=3, so n=2) confirms this.\n*   A quartet at 1.3 ppm with an integration of 4H indicates two equivalent methylene groups (2 x -CH2-), each adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3). The splitting pattern (quartet, n+1=4, so n=3) confirms this.\n*   These signals are characteristic of two equivalent ethyl groups (CH3CH2-). The only symmetrical alkane that consists of two ethyl groups is n-butane.\n*   Therefore, **Compound A is n-butane (CH3CH2CH2CH3)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identification of Compound B**\n\n*   Compound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination to form compound B.\n*   The bromination of an alkane (e.g., with Br2 and light) is a radical substitution reaction that is selective for the most stable radical intermediate. Secondary radicals are more stable than primary radicals.\n*   n-Butane has primary hydrogens (at C1 and C4) and secondary hydrogens (at C2 and C3). Bromination will preferentially occur at a secondary position.\n*   Therefore, the major product is 2-bromobutane.\n*   **Compound B is 2-bromobutane (CH3CH(Br)CH2CH3)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identification of Compound C**\n\n*   Compound B (2-bromobutane) reacts with alcoholic KOH. This is a dehydrohalogenation reaction (E2 elimination).\n*   According to Zaitsev's rule, the major product is the more substituted (more stable) alkene. Elimination can occur by removing a proton from C1 (forming but-1-ene) or C3 (forming but-2-ene).\n*   But-2-ene (CH3-CH=CH-CH3) is a disubstituted alkene, while but-1-ene (CH2=CH-CH2-CH3) is a monosubstituted alkene. Thus, but-2-ene is the major product.\n*   The problem states that compound C has two geometrical isomers. But-2-ene exists as two geometrical isomers: *cis*-but-2-ene and *trans*-but-2-ene.\n*   Therefore, **Compound C is but-2-ene**.\n\n**Step 4: The Diels-Alder Reaction**\n\n*   The problem specifies that the ***cis*-isomer of C (*cis*-but-2-ene)** is used as the dienophile.\n*   The diene is **(1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol**.\n*   This reaction is a [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition, which forms a six-membered ring (a cyclohexene derivative).\n\n**Step 5: Stereochemistry of the Product (Compound D)**\n\nWe need to predict the stereochemistry of the product based on the established rules for the Diels-Alder reaction.\n\n1.  **Reactant Geometry:**\n    *   **Diene:** (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol. For the reaction, it must adopt an s-cis conformation. In this conformation, the substituents at the ends of the diene system (C1 and C4) can be classified as \"outside\" or \"inside\". The -OH group (at C1) and the -CH3 group (at C4) are on the \"outside\" of the C-shaped diene backbone.\n    *   **Dienophile:** *cis*-but-2-ene. The two methyl groups are on the same side of the double bond.\n\n2.  **Stereochemical Rules:**\n    *   **Stereospecificity:** The stereochemistry of the dienophile is retained. Since we start with *cis*-but-2-ene, the two methyl groups will be *cis* to each other in the final product.\n    *   **Endo Rule:** The major product of a Diels-Alder reaction is typically the *endo* product. This means the substituents of the dienophile are oriented *trans* to the \"outside\" substituents of the diene.\n\n3.  **Applying the Rules to the Product:**\n    *   The product is a 4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol. Let's number the ring according to IUPAC rules, with C1 being the carbon attached to the -OH group.\n    *   The two methyl groups from the dienophile are at positions C5 and C6. They must be **cis** to each other.\n    *   The -OH group from the diene is at C1, and the methyl group from the diene is at C4. These were the \"outside\" groups.\n    *   According to the endo rule, the C5-Me and C6-Me groups are **trans** to the C1-OH group and the C4-Me group.\n    *   This means that the {C5-Me, C6-Me} pair is on one face of the ring (e.g., wedge), and the {C1-OH, C4-Me} pair is on the other face (e.g., dash).\n\n4.  **Assigning R/S Configuration:**\n    *   Let's assume the C1-OH and C4-Me are pointing down (dash), and the C5-Me and C6-Me are pointing up (wedge).\n    *   **C1:** With OH (1) dashed and H (4) wedged, the priority path (1->2->3) is clockwise. Because the lowest priority group is wedged, we reverse the result to **S**. -> **(1S)**\n    *   **C4:** With CH3 (3) dashed and H (4) wedged, the priority path (1->2->3) is counter-clockwise. Because the lowest priority group is wedged, we reverse the result to **R**. -> **(4R)**\n    *   **C5:** With CH3 (3) wedged and H (4) dashed, the priority path (1->2->3) is counter-clockwise. The lowest priority group is dashed, so the result is **S**. -> **(5S)**\n    *   **C6:** With CH3 (3) wedged and H (4) dashed, the priority path (1->2->3) is counter-clockwise. The lowest priority group is dashed, so the result is **S**. -> **(6S)**\n\nCombining these assignments, the structure of compound D is **(1S,4R,5S,6S)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
