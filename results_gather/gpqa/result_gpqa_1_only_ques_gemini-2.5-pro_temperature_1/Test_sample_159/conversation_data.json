    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture:** The problem describes an N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a'. When the number of sides, N, becomes infinitely large (N → ∞), the polygon approaches a perfect circle. The apothem 'a' (the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side) becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Diffraction by a Circular Aperture (Airy Pattern):** When monochromatic light passes through a circular aperture, it produces a diffraction pattern known as the Airy pattern. The intensity distribution in the far-field (Fraunhofer diffraction) as a function of the angle θ from the central axis is given by:\n    $I(\\theta) = I_0 \\left[ \\frac{2 J_1(k a \\sin\\theta)}{k a \\sin\\theta} \\right]^2$\n    where:\n    *   $I_0$ is the maximum intensity at the center (θ = 0).\n    *   $J_1(x)$ is the first-order Bessel function of the first kind.\n    *   $k = 2\\pi / \\lambda$ is the wave number.\n    *   'a' is the radius of the aperture.\n    *   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n\n3.  **Finding the Minima:** The intensity minima occur when the numerator, $J_1(k a \\sin\\theta)$, is equal to zero (and the denominator is not). We need to find the roots of the Bessel function $J_1(x) = 0$. The first few non-zero roots are:\n    *   $x_1 \\approx 3.8317$ (This corresponds to the first minimum).\n    *   $x_2 \\approx 7.0156$ (This corresponds to the second minimum).\n    *   $x_3 \\approx 10.1735$ (This corresponds to the third minimum), and so on.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Angular Positions:** Let's define the argument of the Bessel function as $x = k a \\sin\\theta$. Using the small-angle approximation given in the problem ($\\sin\\theta \\approx \\tan\\theta \\approx \\theta$), we have:\n    $x = k a \\theta = \\frac{2\\pi a \\theta}{\\lambda}$\n    We can now find the angular positions of the first two minima, $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$.\n\n    *   **For the first minimum ($\\theta_1$):**\n        $x_1 = \\frac{2\\pi a \\theta_1}{\\lambda} \\approx 3.8317$\n        $\\theta_1 \\approx \\frac{3.8317 \\lambda}{2\\pi a} \\approx 0.6098 \\frac{\\lambda}{a}$\n        This is often rounded to $0.610 \\lambda/a$.\n\n    *   **For the second minimum ($\\theta_2$):**\n        $x_2 = \\frac{2\\pi a \\theta_2}{\\lambda} \\approx 7.0156$\n        $\\theta_2 \\approx \\frac{7.0156 \\lambda}{2\\pi a} \\approx 1.1166 \\frac{\\lambda}{a}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Angular Distance:** The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is $\\Delta\\theta = \\theta_2 - \\theta_1$.\n    $\\Delta\\theta = \\theta_2 - \\theta_1 \\approx (1.1166 - 0.6098) \\frac{\\lambda}{a}$\n    $\\Delta\\theta \\approx 0.5068 \\frac{\\lambda}{a}$\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:** Now, let's compare our calculated value with the given options:\n    A) $0.610 \\lambda / a$ (This is the position of the first minimum, $\\theta_1$)\n    B) $0.500 \\lambda / a$\n    C) $1.220 \\lambda / a$ (This is twice the position of the first minimum, $2\\theta_1$, which is the angular diameter of the central Airy disk)\n    D) $0.506 \\lambda / a$\n\nOur calculated value of $0.5068 \\lambda / a$ is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
