    "This problem requires us to apply the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. To solve it, we need a piece of standard astronomical information: the distance from Earth to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).\n\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Distance:** The Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. Its distance from Earth is approximately 160,000 light-years. We will use this value for our calculation.\n    *   Distance (d) = 160,000 light-years\n\n2.  **Calculate the Travel Time in Earth's Reference Frame (Δt):** First, we calculate how long the journey would take from the perspective of a stationary observer on Earth.\n    *   Speed (v) = 0.99999987 * c\n    *   Time = Distance / Speed\n    *   Δt = d / v = 160,000 light-years / (0.99999987 * c)\n    *   Since 1 light-year = c * 1 year, we can substitute:\n    *   Δt = (160,000 * c * years) / (0.99999987 * c)\n    *   Δt ≈ 160,000.2 years\n\n    From Earth's perspective, the journey takes over 160,000 years.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):** The Lorentz factor is crucial for relating the time experienced by the stationary observer to the time experienced by the moving astronaut.\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n    *   v/c = 0.99999987\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.99999987)²)\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.99999974)\n    *   γ = 1 / √(0.00000026)\n    *   γ = 1 / 0.0005099\n    *   γ ≈ 1961.16\n\n4.  **Calculate the Time Experienced by the Astronaut (Proper Time, Δt₀):** This is the effect of time dilation. The time for the moving astronaut will be shorter than the time measured from Earth.\n    *   The time dilation formula is: Δt = γ * Δt₀\n    *   Rearranging to solve for the astronaut's time: Δt₀ = Δt / γ\n    *   Δt₀ = 160,000.2 years / 1961.16\n    *   Δt₀ ≈ 81.58 years\n\n5.  **Analyze the Result:**\n    *   The journey will take approximately 81.58 years from the astronaut's perspective. This value is extremely close to 81 years.\n    *   We should also check if the astronaut would survive. Their age upon arrival would be their initial age plus the travel time: 22 + 81.58 = 103.58 years. Since their average lifetime is 150 years, the astronaut will survive the journey, ruling out option B.\n    *   Comparing our calculated time of 81.58 years with the given choices, 81 years is the closest match.\n\nTherefore, it will take approximately 81 years for the astronaut to reach Earth.\n\n<<<A>>>"
