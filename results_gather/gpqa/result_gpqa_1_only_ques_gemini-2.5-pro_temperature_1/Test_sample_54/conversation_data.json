    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the given 1H NMR data:**\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents 3 protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** These protons have no adjacent non-equivalent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~2.1 ppm):** This is a characteristic chemical shift for a methyl group (CH₃) attached to a carbonyl group (C=O), as seen in an acetate group (CH₃-C(=O)-O-). All four options are acetates, so this signal is expected in all of them.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This is a methyl group (CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** According to the n+1 rule, this methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton (n=1, so n+1=2 lines, a doublet). This indicates a -CH-CH₃ fragment.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~1.6 ppm):** This shift is in the allylic region, suggesting the methyl group is attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C-CH₃).\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents a single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~5.5 ppm):** This is in the vinylic region, meaning this proton is attached to a double bond carbon (-CH=).\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons. The 'd' (doublet) means it's coupled to one proton. The 'q' (quartet) means it's coupled to three protons (a methyl group). This confirms the presence of a -CH=CH-CH₃ fragment, where this proton is the one in the middle (`=CH-`).\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This is a single vinylic proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~7.0 ppm):** This is very downfield for a vinylic proton, which indicates strong deshielding. This happens when the proton is on a double bond carbon that is also attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen (-O-CH=).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This proton is coupled to one other proton, which must be the vinylic proton at 5.5 ppm.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the key piece of information for determining the stereochemistry. For protons on a double bond:\n        *   A large coupling constant (J ≈ 12-18 Hz) indicates a **trans** configuration.\n        *   A smaller coupling constant (J ≈ 6-12 Hz) indicates a **cis** configuration.\n    Since J = 16.0 Hz, the two protons on the double bond are **trans** to each other.\n\n**2. Assemble the structure:**\n\n*   We have an acetate group: CH₃COO-\n*   We have a prop-1-enyl group: -CH=CH-CH₃\n*   The oxygen of the acetate is attached to the double bond at the CH position, creating the -O-CH= fragment (explaining the 7.0 ppm shift).\n*   The geometry across the double bond is trans (explaining the J = 16.0 Hz).\n\nPutting it all together, the structure is:\n```\n      CH₃\n     /\n  O=C\n    \\\n     O         H\n      \\       /\n       C = C\n      /     \\\n     H       CH₃\n```\nThis compound is named **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n**3. Compare with the options:**\n\n*   **A) Cis-butenyl acetate:** Incorrect. The data indicates a propenyl group (3 carbons in the chain, 8 total protons), not a butenyl group (4 carbons in the chain, 10 total protons). Also, the geometry is trans, not cis.\n*   **B) Trans-propenyl acetate:** Correct. This matches our derived structure perfectly in terms of the carbon skeleton, functional group, and stereochemistry.\n*   **C) Cis-propenyl acetate:** Incorrect. The coupling constant J = 16.0 Hz indicates a trans geometry, not cis.\n*   **D) Trans-butenyl acetate:** Incorrect. The NMR integration (total of 8 protons: 1+1+3+3) and fragmentation pattern point to a propenyl group, not a butenyl group.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
