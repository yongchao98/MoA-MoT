    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the threshold energy for the high-energy gamma-ray.\n\n### 1. The Physical Process\n\nThe reaction is the annihilation of a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) with a low-energy Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon ($\\gamma_{CMB}$) to produce an electron ($e^âˆ’$) and a positron ($e^+$):\n$$ \\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^- + e^+ $$\n\n### 2. Conservation of Four-Momentum\n\nTo find the threshold energy, we use the principle of conservation of energy and momentum, conveniently combined in the Lorentz-invariant quantity, the square of the total four-momentum ($s$). The four-momentum is a vector $P = (E/c, \\vec{p})$, and its square is $P^2 = (E/c)^2 - |\\vec{p}|^2 = (m_0c)^2$, where $m_0$ is the rest mass of the particle. We will use units where the speed of light $c=1$.\n\nThe total four-momentum must be conserved before and after the collision. Therefore, the invariant mass squared, $s$, must be the same for the initial and final states.\n\n$s = (P_{\\gamma} + P_{\\gamma_{CMB}})^2 = (P_{e^-} + P_{e^+})^2$\n\n### 3. Calculating the Invariant Mass\n\n**Initial State (in the Lab Frame):**\n\nLet the high-energy gamma-ray have energy $E_\\gamma$ and momentum $\\vec{p}_\\gamma$, and the CMB photon have energy $E_{CMB}$ and momentum $\\vec{p}_{CMB}$.\nThe four-momenta are $P_{\\gamma} = (E_\\gamma, \\vec{p}_\\gamma)$ and $P_{\\gamma_{CMB}} = (E_{CMB}, \\vec{p}_{CMB})$.\n\nThe invariant mass squared is:\n$s = (P_{\\gamma} + P_{\\gamma_{CMB}})^2 = P_{\\gamma}^2 + P_{\\gamma_{CMB}}^2 + 2 P_{\\gamma} \\cdot P_{\\gamma_{CMB}}$\n\nFor any photon, the rest mass is zero, so $P^2 = m^2 = 0$. This means $P_{\\gamma}^2 = 0$ and $P_{\\gamma_{CMB}}^2 = 0$.\nThe dot product is $P_{\\gamma} \\cdot P_{\\gamma_{CMB}} = E_\\gamma E_{CMB} - \\vec{p}_\\gamma \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB}$. Since for a photon $|\\vec{p}| = E$, we have $\\vec{p}_\\gamma \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB} = |\\vec{p}_\\gamma||\\vec{p}_{CMB}|\\cos\\theta = E_\\gamma E_{CMB} \\cos\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the two incoming photons.\n\nSo, the invariant mass squared becomes:\n$s = 2(E_\\gamma E_{CMB} - E_\\gamma E_{CMB} \\cos\\theta) = 2 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} (1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n\n**Final State (at Threshold):**\n\nThe threshold energy is the minimum energy required for the reaction to occur. This happens when the final products (electron and positron) are created with the minimum possible kinetic energy in the center-of-momentum frame, which means they are created at rest.\n\nIn the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum is zero. The energy of the electron at rest is its rest mass energy, $m_e$, and the same for the positron.\nSo, the total energy of the final state is $E_{final} = m_e + m_e = 2m_e$.\nThe total momentum is $\\vec{p}_{final} = \\vec{0}$.\nThe four-momentum of the final state is $P_{final} = (2m_e, \\vec{0})$.\n\nThe invariant mass squared of the final state is:\n$s = (E_{final})^2 - |\\vec{p}_{final}|^2 = (2m_e)^2 - 0 = 4m_e^2$\n\n### 4. Finding the Threshold Energy\n\nBy equating the invariant mass squared of the initial and final states:\n$$ 2 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} (1 - \\cos\\theta) = 4m_e^2 $$\n\nTo find the minimum (threshold) energy $E_\\gamma$, we need to find the condition that makes the left side of the equation largest for a given $E_\\gamma$. This occurs when the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ is maximized. The maximum value is 2, which happens when $\\cos\\theta = -1$, meaning $\\theta = 180^\\circ$. This corresponds to a head-on collision.\n\nSubstituting $\\cos\\theta = -1$ into the equation:\n$2 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} (1 - (-1)) = 4m_e^2$\n$2 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} (2) = 4m_e^2$\n$4 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} = 4m_e^2$\n$$ E_\\gamma E_{CMB} = m_e^2 $$\n\nNow, we can solve for the threshold energy $E_\\gamma$:\n$$ E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{m_e^2}{E_{CMB}} $$\n\n### 5. Calculation\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   Rest mass energy of an electron, $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n*   Average energy of a CMB photon, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n\nLet's plug these values into our equation for the threshold energy:\n$$ E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} $$\n$$ E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} $$\n$$ E_{\\gamma, th} = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV} $$\n$$ E_{\\gamma, th} = 2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV} $$\n\nThe question asks for the answer in GeV ($1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$). Let's convert our result:\n$$ E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV} $$\n\nThis value is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) 1.8 * 1e5 GeV\nB) 9.5 * 1e4 GeV\nC) 2.6 * 1e5 GeV\nD) 3.9 * 1e5 GeV\n\nOur calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
