    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)\n\nThe formula for relativistic velocity addition/subtraction is used to find the relative speed between the two astronauts. Let $v_1 = 0.6c$ be the speed of the first astronaut (mass 2m) and $v_2 = 0.5c$ be the speed of the second astronaut (mass 3m). The relative speed of astronaut 1 with respect to astronaut 2 is given by:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.1428c$\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Total Energy of the System (E)\n\nThe total energy of a particle with rest mass $m_0$ moving at speed $v$ is given by $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts.\n\n**Energy of the first astronaut ($E_1$):**\n*   Mass ($m_1$) = 2m\n*   Speed ($v_1$) = 0.6c\n*   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_1$):\n    $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6c/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n*   Energy ($E_1$):\n    $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**Energy of the second astronaut ($E_2$):**\n*   Mass ($m_2$) = 3m\n*   Speed ($v_2$) = 0.5c\n*   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_2$):\n    $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5c/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}/2} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 1.155$\n*   Energy ($E_2$):\n    $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = (\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}})(3m)c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2 \\approx 3.464 mc^2$\n\n**Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n$E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n$E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2$\n$E_{total} \\approx 5.964 mc^2$\n\nSo, the total energy is approximately **5.96 mcÂ²**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated relative speed is $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$ and the total energy is $E \\approx 5.96 mc^2$. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
