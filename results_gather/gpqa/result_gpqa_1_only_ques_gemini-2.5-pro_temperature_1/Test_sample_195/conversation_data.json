    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Define the System and Conserved Energy**\n    We have a particle of rest mass $m$ in a 1-dimensional potential well described by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. The potential energy associated with this force is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where we set the potential energy to be zero at the equilibrium position ($x=0$).\n\n    In special relativity, the total energy of a particle is the sum of its kinetic energy and potential energy. The relativistic kinetic energy is given by $T = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n    Since the force is conservative, the total mechanical energy $E_{total}$ of the oscillator is conserved.\n    $E_{total} = T + U(x) = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n2.  **Analyze the State at Maximum Amplitude**\n    The particle reaches its maximum amplitude at $x=A$. At this point, the particle momentarily stops, so its velocity is $v=0$.\n    When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    The kinetic energy at this point is $T = (1 - 1)mc^2 = 0$.\n    The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    Therefore, the total conserved energy of the system is:\n    $E_{total} = 0 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n3.  **Analyze the State at Maximum Speed**\n    The particle achieves its maximum speed, $v_{max}$, when it passes through the equilibrium position, $x=0$.\n    At $x=0$, the potential energy is $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n    The kinetic energy is at its maximum. Let's denote the Lorentz factor at maximum speed as $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    The kinetic energy is $T_{max} = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2 + 0 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\n4.  **Apply the Law of Conservation of Energy**\n    The total energy at the maximum amplitude must be equal to the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n    $E_{total}(x=A) = E_{total}(x=0)$\n    $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Maximum Speed ($v_{max}$)**\n    First, we solve the equation above for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} - 1 = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Now, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to relate $\\gamma_{max}$ to $v_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, let's first square both sides:\n    $\\gamma_{max}^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}$\n    Rearrange the equation to isolate the term with $v_{max}$:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n    $v_{max}^2 = c^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}\\right)$\n\n    Finally, substitute the expression for $\\gamma_{max}$ that we found:\n    $v_{max}^2 = c^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}\\right)$\n    Taking the square root gives the maximum speed:\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n    This result matches option A.\n\n    **Non-relativistic Check:**\n    As a quick check, in the non-relativistic limit ($c \\to \\infty$), the term $\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$ becomes very small. Let $x = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$. Using the binomial approximation $(1+x)^n \\approx 1+nx$ for small $x$:\n    $(1+x)^{-2} \\approx 1-2x$\n    $v_{max} \\approx c \\sqrt{1 - (1 - 2x)} = c \\sqrt{2x} = c \\sqrt{2 \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}} = c \\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{mc^2}} = c \\frac{\\sqrt{kA^2}}{c\\sqrt{m}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$\n    This is the well-known non-relativistic result, which corresponds to option D. This confirms that our relativistic formula has the correct classical limit.\n\nThe correct answer for the relativistic harmonic oscillator is given by the full expression.\n\nComparing our final result with the given options:\nA) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\nB) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$\nC) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$\nD) $v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$\n\nOur derived expression exactly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
