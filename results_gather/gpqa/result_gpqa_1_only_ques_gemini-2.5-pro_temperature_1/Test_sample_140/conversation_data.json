    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n**1. Identify the Reaction**\n\nThe reaction involves an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) and a very strong base (sodium amide, NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). These are the classic conditions for a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a **benzyne intermediate**.\n\n**2. The Elimination Step: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH2⁻) acts as a base and abstracts a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine-bearing carbon. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two different ortho positions:\n*   **C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThe amide base can abstract either the H or the D, leading to two different pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n    2.  This creates a carbanion at C6.\n    3.  The lone pair on the C6 carbanion eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains at C2. Let's call this **Benzyne-I**.\n\n     \n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. (Note: The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, so this pathway is slower due to the kinetic isotope effect, but it is still possible).\n    2.  This creates a carbanion at C2.\n    3.  The lone pair on the C2 carbanion eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom has been removed. This is the standard, non-deuterated benzyne. Let's call this **Benzyne-II**.\n\n     \n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are possible.\n\n**3. The Addition Step: Formation of Final Products**\n\nThe highly reactive benzyne intermediates are then attacked by the nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (NH2⁻). The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3).\n\n*   **Reaction of Benzyne-I (from Pathway A)**\n    Benzyne-I has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium at C2. The NH2⁻ can attack either C1 or C6.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** NH2⁻ adds to C1, forming a carbanion at C6. Protonation by NH3 gives **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** NH2⁻ adds to C6, forming a carbanion at C1. Protonation by NH3 gives **3-deuterioaniline**.\n    These two products are distinct constitutional isomers.\n\n     \n\n*   **Reaction of Benzyne-II (from Pathway B)**\n    Benzyne-II is the normal, non-deuterated benzyne. NH2⁻ can attack either C1 or C2 of the triple bond.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** Leads to the formation of **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n    2.  **Attack at C2:** Also leads to the formation of **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n    Both attacks on this symmetrical intermediate lead to the same single product.\n\n     \n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nBy considering all possible pathways, we can identify three distinct organic products:\n1.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (non-deuterated, from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
