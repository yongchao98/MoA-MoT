    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the structure of Compound X from the given spectral data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum:**\n        *   `3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad)`: This very broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n        *   `1720 cm⁻¹`: This strong absorption is characteristic of the C=O stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   `1610 cm⁻¹` and `1450 cm⁻¹`: These absorptions are typical for C=C stretching in an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n        *   `10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)`: A broad singlet in this region confirms the presence of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-CO**H**).\n        *   `8.0 ppm (d, 2H)` and `7.2 ppm (d, 2H)`: This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is classic for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   Let's analyze the remaining signals to determine the structure of the alkyl group: `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`, `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`, `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`, `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`.\n            *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A triplet for 3 protons indicates a -CH₃ group adjacent to a -CH₂ group (an ethyl fragment).\n            *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: A multiplet for 2 protons. This must be the -CH₂- group adjacent to the -CH₃ from the ethyl fragment. It is a multiplet because it is also coupled to a -CH- group.\n            *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A doublet for 3 protons indicates a -CH₃ group adjacent to a single proton (-CH-).\n            *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: A multiplet for 1 proton. This is the -CH- group. It is bonded to the benzene ring (making it a benzylic proton, hence its downfield shift), a -CH₃ group (from the 1.4 ppm signal), and a -CH₂- group (from the 1.7 ppm signal).\n        *   Assembling the alkyl group: The structure is -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃), which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the information, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option A.\n\n2.  **Determine the reaction product.**\n\n    *   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to the corresponding alkane (-CH₃). It also reduces alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones to alkanes.\n    *   **Applying the reaction to Compound X:** The starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 4 to a methyl group (-CH₃). The sec-butyl group and the benzene ring will remain unchanged under these conditions.\n    *   **Final Product:** The product will be **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n3.  **Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n    *   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material (Compound X).\n    *   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - The alkyl group is incorrect.\n    *   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n    *   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our predicted final product.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>"
