    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let's determine its empirical formula.\n    *   Mass % of H = 14.28%, so Mass % of C = 100% - 14.28% = 85.72%.\n    *   Assuming 100 g of the substance, we have 14.28 g of H and 85.72 g of C.\n    *   Moles of H = 14.28 g / 1.008 g/mol ≈ 14.17 mol.\n    *   Moles of C = 85.72 g / 12.01 g/mol ≈ 7.14 mol.\n    *   The ratio of H atoms to C atoms is approximately 14.17 / 7.14 ≈ 2.\n    *   So, the empirical formula of Z is CH₂.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated compound. A hydrocarbon with the general formula CnH2n that is saturated must be a cycloalkane. The value 14.28% is exactly 1/7 * 100%, which corresponds to the formula CnH2n if we use approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1): %H = (2n * 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7.\n    *   Hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y gives *only* Z. This implies that all components of X and Y have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   Z is also a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Let's assume Z is cyclohexane for now. This would mean n=6.\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of them is Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂). Let's call the other one Y₂.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means Y₂ is saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means hydrogenation of Y₂ must also produce cyclohexane.\n    *   The most logical candidate for Y₂ is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is a liquid, does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions, and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane (C₆H₆ + 3H₂ → C₆H₁₂).\n    *   So, mixture Y consists of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆). This fits the description of an equimolar mixture of two liquids that doesn't decolorize bromine water and hydrogenates to a single product.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction X → Y:**\n    *   An equimolar mixture X is converted to an equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction.\n    *   This means the reaction stoichiometry is 1:1 → 1:1. Let the two components of X be X₁ and X₂.\n    *   The reaction is: X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X is oxidized (loses hydrogen) to form benzene, and the other component is reduced (gains hydrogen) to form cyclohexane.\n    *   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms must be the same on both sides of the equation.\n    *   Total C atoms in products = C from C₆H₁₂ + C from C₆H₆ = 6 + 6 = 12. So, X₁ and X₂ must each have 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   Total H atoms in products = H from C₆H₁₂ + H from C₆H₆ = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X₁ and one molecule of X₂ must be 18.\n\n4.  **Calculate the final answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   Based on our analysis, this sum is exactly the total number of hydrogen atoms in the product molecules, which is 18.\n\n5.  **Verify the properties of Mixture X (optional but good for confirmation):**\n    *   X₁ and X₂ must be C₆ compounds.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.\n    *   Both must decolorize bromine water (i.e., be unsaturated).\n    *   Hydrogenation of both must yield cyclohexane.\n    *   They must not have conjugated double bonds.\n    *   A combination that fits all these criteria is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n        *   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n        *   Both are unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds.\n        *   1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated.\n        *   The reaction C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆ is a balanced hydrogen transfer.\n    *   This confirms our conclusion.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>"
