    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the starting compound from the given data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    *   DBE = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    *   A DBE of 5 typically indicates a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond or ring (e.g., C=O, C=C).\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting indicates that it is coupled to two adjacent protons, meaning it's next to a -CH₂- group. This confirms a **-CH₂-CHO** fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the -CH₂- group protons. The doublet (d) splitting indicates that these two protons are coupled to a single adjacent proton, which is the aldehyde proton. This confirms the **-CH₂-CHO** fragment. The chemical shift is appropriate for a methylene group attached to both a benzene ring and a carbonyl group.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H, is a hallmark of a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**. The chemical shifts are relatively upfield, suggesting the presence of a strong electron-donating group.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2H, which disappears on D₂O exchange (a common characteristic though not explicitly stated), is indicative of an amine group **(-NH₂) **. An amine group is a strong electron-donating group, consistent with the upfield aromatic signals.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The two substituents are an amino group (-NH₂) and a phenylacetaldehyde fragment (-CH₂CHO).\n    *   The starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde (H₂N-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO)\n\n*   **Reagent 1: NaNO₂ + HCl (at 0-5 °C)**\n    *   This is a standard diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) reacts to form a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n    *   **Intermediate 1:** p-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride ([⁺N≡N]-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO Cl⁻)\n\n*   **Reagent 2: H₂O**\n    *   Adding water (often with gentle warming) to the diazonium salt results in hydrolysis, where the diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). Nitrogen gas (N₂) is evolved.\n    *   **Intermediate 2:** 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (HO-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO)\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This is a strong base with heat. The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, possesses both an aldehyde group and acidic alpha-protons (on the -CH₂- group). These are the conditions for an **aldol condensation**.\n    *   First, the phenolic proton will be deprotonated by KOH, but the aldol reaction will proceed on the aldehyde part of the molecule.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The base (OH⁻) removes an alpha-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form an enolate.\n        2.  **Aldol Addition:** The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This forms an aldol addition product, **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This is the structure in option A).\n        3.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** Because the reaction is **heated**, the aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). The proton on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group (C2) is removed, and the hydroxyl group on the beta-carbon (C3) is eliminated, forming a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n    *   **Final Product:** The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal leads to the formation of **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe final product of the reaction sequence is the aldol condensation product, not just the initial addition product, due to the heating condition.\n\n*   Option A, 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal, is the aldol addition product, which is an intermediate.\n*   Option B, **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**, is the final condensation product.\n*   Options C and D are structurally incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>"
