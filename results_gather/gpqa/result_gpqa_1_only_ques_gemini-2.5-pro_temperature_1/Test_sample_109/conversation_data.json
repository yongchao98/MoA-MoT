    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we need to check two conditions for each star:\n\n1.  **Visibility:** The star must be visible from both the Paranal Observatory (Southern Hemisphere, latitude ~24° S) and the Keck Observatory (Northern Hemisphere, latitude ~20° N).\n    *   For a star to be visible from Keck, its declination (DEC) must be greater than approximately -70° (`20° - 90°`).\n    *   For a star to be visible from Paranal, its declination must be less than approximately +66° (`90° - 24°`).\n    *   Therefore, the star's declination must be in the range **-70° < DEC < +66°**.\n\n2.  **Brightness:** The star's apparent V magnitude (V) must be bright enough for both instruments.\n    *   ESPRESSO limit: V < 17 mag\n    *   HIRES limit: V < 16 mag\n    *   To be observed by *both*, the star must satisfy the stricter limit: **V < 16 mag**.\n\nWe will use the distance modulus formula to calculate the apparent magnitude (m or V) when it is not given directly:\n`V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`\nwhere `M_V` is the absolute V magnitude, `d` is the distance in parsecs (pc), and `A_V` is the total absorption in the V band. `A_V` is calculated as `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\nLet's analyze each star:\n\n**Star1**\n*   **Visibility:** DEC = -75°. This is not greater than -70°, so it is not visible from the Keck Observatory.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be detected by both.\n\n**Star2**\n*   **Visibility:** DEC = 55°. This is within the range -70° < DEC < +66°, so it is visible from both observatories.\n*   **Brightness:** The apparent V magnitude is given as V = 16.5 mag. This does not satisfy the HIRES limit of V < 16 mag.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be detected by both.\n\n**Star3**\n*   **Visibility:** DEC = 48°. This is within the range -70° < DEC < +66°, so it is visible from both observatories.\n*   **Brightness:** The apparent V magnitude is given as V = 15.5 mag. This satisfies the HIRES limit (15.5 < 16) and the ESPRESSO limit (15.5 < 17). The other information provided (E(B-V), distance) is not needed to determine the observed brightness.\n*   **Conclusion:** Can be detected by both.\n\n**Star4**\n*   **Visibility:** DEC = -48°. This is within the range -70° < DEC < +66°, so it is visible from both observatories.\n*   **Brightness:** We need to calculate the apparent V magnitude.\n    *   `M_V` = 15.5 mag\n    *   `d` = 10 pc\n    *   `A_V` = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n    *   `V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24`\n    *   `V = 15.5 + 5 * (1) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag`\n    *   This apparent magnitude (16.74) does not satisfy the HIRES limit of V < 16 mag.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be detected by both.\n\n**Star5**\n*   **Visibility:** DEC = 60°. This is within the range -70° < DEC < +66°, so it is visible from both observatories.\n*   **Brightness:** We need to calculate the apparent V magnitude.\n    *   `M_V` = 16.5 mag\n    *   `d` = 5 pc\n    *   `A_V` = 0 (not mentioned)\n    *   `V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 + 0`\n    *   `V = 16.5 + 5 * (0.699) - 5`\n    *   `V = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 14.995 mag`\n    *   This apparent magnitude (~15.0) satisfies the HIRES limit (15.0 < 16) and the ESPRESSO limit (15.0 < 17).\n*   **Conclusion:** Can be detected by both.\n\nBased on the analysis, only **Star3** and **Star5** can be detected by both spectrographs.\n\n<<<A>>>"
