    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown compounds and answer the question.\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 3: C + H₂O → A + F + G**\n    *   This is a hydrolysis reaction where the starting material `A` is reformed. This suggests that `C` is a complex or adduct of `A`, and the ligands/adducts are what react with water.\n    *   The reaction produces a strong acid (`F`) and a weak acid (`G`). This is a very strong clue. A classic example of a single species hydrolyzing to a strong and a weak acid is the disproportionation of halogens.\n    *   Specifically, chlorine gas reacts with water to form hydrochloric acid (a strong acid) and hypochlorous acid (a weak acid):\n        Cl₂ + H₂O ⇌ HCl (F, strong) + HOCl (G, weak)\n    *   This strongly implies that the hydrolysis of `C` involves the release of chlorine (Cl₂), which then reacts with water.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas B**\n    *   From the conclusion above, `C` must be a source of chlorine.\n    *   Reaction 1 states: `A(s) + 8 B(g) → C`.\n    *   If `C` contains chlorine that came from `B`, then gas `B` must be chlorine.\n    *   **B = Cl₂ (Chlorine gas)**\n    *   This means `C` is a complex or adduct formed from solid `A` and 8 equivalents of chlorine gas, which we can represent as `A·(Cl₂)₈`. The \"bright red\" color describes this specific, perhaps obscure, compound.\n\n3.  **Identify Gas D and Solvent H**\n    *   Reaction 4 states: `D(g) + B(g) → H (solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Substituting `B = Cl₂`, we get: `D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H (solvent)`.\n    *   A well-known reaction between chlorine and another common gas is the formation of phosgene:\n        CO(g) + Cl₂(g) → COCl₂(g/l)\n    *   Phosgene (COCl₂) is a liquid below 8.2 °C and can be used as a non-aqueous solvent. It fits the description.\n    *   Therefore, we can identify:\n        *   **D = CO (Carbon monoxide)**\n        *   **H = COCl₂ (Phosgene)**\n\n4.  **Identify Product E**\n    *   Reaction 2 states: `C + 2 D(g) → E (extremely hazardous product)`.\n    *   Substituting our identified compounds: `A·(Cl₂)₈ + 2 CO → E`.\n    *   The most logical reaction is that the carbon monoxide reacts with the chlorine stored in compound `C`. The reaction `CO + Cl₂ → COCl₂` consumes the reactants in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Since 2 equivalents of `CO` (`D`) are used, they will react with 2 equivalents of `Cl₂` from the complex `C`.\n    *   `A·(Cl₂)₈ + 2CO → A·(Cl₂)₆ + 2COCl₂`\n    *   The problem states this reaction \"produces the extremely hazardous product E\". Phosgene is notorious for being extremely hazardous (it's a chemical warfare agent). Thus, `E` is phosgene.\n    *   **E = COCl₂ (Phosgene)**\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E**\n    *   The molecule is phosgene, COCl₂.\n    *   Its structure is planar, with a central carbon double-bonded to an oxygen and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms.\n        O\n       //\n      C\n     /  \\\n    Cl  Cl\n    *   Let's identify the symmetry elements:\n        *   **C₂ axis:** One C₂ rotational axis passes through the C=O double bond.\n        *   **σᵥ mirror plane:** One vertical mirror plane contains all four atoms.\n        *   **σᵥ' mirror plane:** Another vertical mirror plane is perpendicular to the first one, bisecting the Cl-C-Cl angle.\n    *   A molecule with one C₂ axis and two perpendicular vertical mirror planes belongs to the **C2v** point group.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
