    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, we need to calculate its concentration relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**1. Identify all cobalt species:**\nThe cobalt-containing species in the solution are the free ion and the various complexes formed with thiocyanate:\n*   Free ion: `Co²⁺`\n*   Complex 1: `[Co(SCN)]⁺`\n*   Complex 2: `[Co(SCN)₂]` (dithiocyanato cobalt(II))\n*   Complex 3: `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`\n*   Complex 4: `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n**2. Write the mass balance equation for cobalt:**\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n**3. Use the stability constants (β) to express the concentration of each complex:**\nThe overall stability constants are given for the formation of each complex from the free ion `Co²⁺` and the ligand `SCN⁻`:\n*   `[Co(SCN)⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₂] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻ = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n**4. Substitute these expressions into the mass balance equation:**\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nFactor out `[Co²⁺]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**5. Determine the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex:**\nThe fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, `α₂`, is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration:\n`α₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)`\n\nSubstitute the expressions from steps 3 and 4:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` terms cancel out, leaving:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**6. Plug in the given values and calculate:**\n*   Total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` = 10⁻² M = 0.01 M\n*   Thiocyanate concentration `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   Stability constants: `β₁=9`, `β₂=40`, `β₃=63`, `β₄=16`\n\nSince the concentration of the ligand `[SCN⁻]` (0.1 M) is ten times higher than the total metal ion concentration `c(Co)` (0.01 M), we can approximate the free ligand concentration as being equal to its total initial concentration: `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the terms for the denominator:\n*   `1`\n*   `β₁[SCN⁻]` = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   `β₃[SCN⁻]³` = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴` = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNow, calculate the sum for the denominator:\nDenominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nThe numerator is the term corresponding to the dithiocyanato complex:\nNumerator = `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4`\n\nNow calculate the fraction `α₂`:\n`α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n**7. Convert the fraction to a percentage:**\nPercentage = `α₂ * 100% = 0.16916 * 100% = 16.916%`\n\nThis value is closest to 16.9%.\n\n<<<A>>>"
