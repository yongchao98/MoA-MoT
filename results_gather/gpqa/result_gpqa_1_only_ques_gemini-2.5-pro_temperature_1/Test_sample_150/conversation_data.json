    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the principles of quantum mechanics for measurements. The probability of measuring a specific value (an eigenvalue) of an observable is given by the squared magnitude of the projection of the system's state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector of the observable's operator.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n**1. Identify the given information:**\n*   The state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (ket vector) `|ψ⟩`:\n    ```\n    |ψ⟩ =\n    [-1]\n    [ 2]\n    [ 1]\n    ```\n*   The observable is represented by the matrix `P`:\n    ```\n    P =\n    [ 0   1/√2   0  ]\n    [ 1/√2  0   1/√2 ]\n    [ 0   1/√2   0  ]\n    ```\n*   We need to find the probability of measuring the value `0`. This means `0` must be an eigenvalue of the operator `P`.\n\n**2. Find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.**\nLet the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ = 0` be `|v₀⟩`. The eigenvalue equation is `P|v₀⟩ = λ|v₀⟩`. For `λ = 0`, this becomes:\n`P|v₀⟩ = 0`\n\nLet `|v₀⟩` be a column matrix with elements `(x, y, z)`:\n```\n[ 0   1/√2   0  ] [x]   [0]\n[ 1/√2  0   1/√2 ] [y] = [0]\n[ 0   1/√2   0  ] [z]   [0]\n```\nThis gives us a system of linear equations:\n1.  `(1/√2) * y = 0`\n2.  `(1/√2) * x + (1/√2) * z = 0`\n3.  `(1/√2) * y = 0`\n\nFrom equation (1), we get `y = 0`.\nFrom equation (2), we get `x + z = 0`, which means `z = -x`.\n\nSo, any eigenvector for the eigenvalue 0 is of the form `[x, 0, -x]`. We can choose a simple representative vector by setting `x = 1`.\n```\n|v₀⟩ =\n[ 1]\n[ 0]\n[-1]\n```\n\n**3. Calculate the probability.**\nThe probability `Prob(λ)` of measuring an eigenvalue `λ` for a system in state `|ψ⟩` is given by the formula:\n\n`Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\n\nwhere `|v_λ⟩` is the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue `λ`, and `⟨v_λ|` is its conjugate transpose (bra vector).\n\nLet's calculate each part of the formula for `λ = 0`:\n\n*   **Calculate `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` (the squared norm of the state vector):**\n    `⟨ψ|` is the row vector `[-1, 2, 1]`.\n    `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)*(-1) + (2)*(2) + (1)*(1) = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n\n*   **Calculate `⟨v₀|v₀⟩` (the squared norm of the eigenvector):**\n    `⟨v₀|` is the row vector `[1, 0, -1]`.\n    `⟨v₀|v₀⟩ = (1)*(1) + (0)*(0) + (-1)*(-1) = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`\n\n*   **Calculate the inner product `⟨v₀|ψ⟩`:**\n    `⟨v₀|ψ⟩ = [1, 0, -1] * [-1]`\n                           `[ 2]`\n                           `[ 1]`\n    `⟨v₀|ψ⟩ = (1)*(-1) + (0)*(2) + (-1)*(1) = -1 + 0 - 1 = -2`\n\n*   **Calculate the squared magnitude `|⟨v₀|ψ⟩|²`:**\n    `|⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² = |-2|² = 4`\n\n**4. Combine the results to find the probability:**\nNow, plug these values back into the probability formula:\n`Prob(0) = |⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v₀|v₀⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\n`Prob(0) = 4 / (2 * 6)`\n`Prob(0) = 4 / 12`\n`Prob(0) = 1/3`\n\nThe probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 is 1/3. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
