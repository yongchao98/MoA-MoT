    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at the two specified points in the titration.\n\n**Step 1: Dilution of Acetic Acid**\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid (V1) = 20.00 cm³ = 20.00 mL\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M1) = 0.05 M\n*   Final volume (V2) = Initial volume + Volume of water = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 40.00 mL\n\nUsing the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2, we can find the new concentration (M2):\nM2 = (M1 * V1) / V2\nM2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 mL) / 40.00 mL\nM2 = 0.025 M\n\nSo, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Calculating pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (CH₃COOH) has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This means 75% of the original acetic acid remains. The solution at this point is a buffer.\n\nThe reaction is: CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of this buffer solution:\npH = pKa + log([CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH])\n\nFirst, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n*   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n*   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n\nAt 25% titration, the ratio of the conjugate base to the acid is:\n[CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH] = 25% / 75% = 1/3\n\nNow, substitute the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\npH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\npH = 4.73 - log(3)\npH = 4.73 - 0.477\npH ≈ 4.253\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculating pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, and the solution contains only the salt, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water, producing OH⁻ ions.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n\nFirst, we need to find the concentration of the acetate ion at the equivalence point.\n1.  Calculate the initial moles of acetic acid:\n    Moles of CH₃COOH = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.0400 L = 0.00100 mol.\n2.  At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added = moles of CH₃COOH = 0.00100 mol.\n3.  Calculate the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point:\n    Volume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.00100 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0100 L = 10.00 mL.\n4.  Calculate the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point:\n    Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 mL + 10.00 mL = 50.00 mL = 0.0500 L.\n5.  Calculate the concentration of acetate ([CH₃COO⁻]):\n    [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.00100 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.0200 M.\n\nNow, we calculate the concentration of OH⁻ from the hydrolysis reaction. We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\n*   Kb = Kw / Ka (where Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C)\n*   Kb = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\nFor the hydrolysis reaction, Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻].\nLet [OH⁻] = x. Then [CH₃COOH] = x.\n5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.0200 - x)\n\nSince Kb is very small, we can assume x is negligible compared to 0.0200 M.\n5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.0200\nx² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.0200 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\nx = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\nNow, calculate the pOH:\npOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n\nFinally, calculate the pH:\npH = 14.00 - pOH\npH = 14.00 - 5.48\npH = 8.52\n\nSo, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated pH values are:\n*   At 25% titration: pH ≈ 4.26\n*   At the equivalence point: pH ≈ 8.52\n\nComparing this pair (4.26, 8.52) with the given options, it matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
