    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS)**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the compound (using the most common isotopes) is 156 g/mol.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). This M+ / (M+2) ratio of approximately 3:1 is a distinctive isotopic signature for the presence of a single **chlorine** atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic and very strong indicator of the O-H stretching vibration within a **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH). The extreme broadness is caused by hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Combined with the broad O-H peak, it confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (δ > 10 ppm) is characteristic of a highly deshielded proton. This chemical shift, combined with the integration for one proton (1H) and its appearance as a singlet (s), is definitive for the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid** (-COO**H**).\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para-substitution means there are only two types of aromatic protons, and they split each other into doublets. The downfield position of these protons indicates they are attached to a ring with electron-withdrawing groups.\n\n**Putting It All Together**\n\n1.  From the MS, we know the molecule has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom.\n2.  From the IR and ¹H NMR, we know the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n3.  From the ¹H NMR, we know there is a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n\nLet's assemble the pieces: we have a benzene ring with a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group attached at the 1 and 4 positions. This structure is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n**Let's check 4-chlorobenzoic acid (Option D) against the data:**\n\n*   **Formula:** C₇H₅ClO₂\n*   **Molecular Weight:** (7×12) + (5×1) + (1×35.5) + (2×16) = 84 + 5 + 35.5 + 32 = 156.5. This matches the m/z of 156.\n*   **MS:** Contains one Cl atom. Matches.\n*   **IR:** Is an aromatic carboxylic acid. Matches.\n*   **¹H NMR:** Has a carboxylic acid proton and a para-substituted ring. Matches perfectly.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable structural suggestion is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
