    "This problem can be solved by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum from special relativity.\n\nLet's denote the rest mass of both the electron and the positron as $m_e$. The speed of light is $c$.\n\n### 1. Initial State (Before Collision)\n\nWe have an electron (e⁻) and a positron (e⁺) moving towards each other along the horizontal axis (let's call it the x-axis).\n\n*   **Electron (e⁻):**\n    *   Moves from left to right (in the +x direction).\n    *   Lorentz factor, $γ_e = 4$.\n    *   Energy is given by $E = γ m c^2$. So, $E_e = 4 m_e c^2$.\n    *   Momentum is given by $p = \\sqrt{γ^2 - 1} \\cdot m c$. So, the magnitude of the electron's momentum is $p_e = \\sqrt{4^2 - 1} \\cdot m_e c = \\sqrt{15} \\cdot m_e c$. Its direction is along the +x axis.\n\n*   **Positron (e⁺):**\n    *   Moves from right to left (in the -x direction).\n    *   Lorentz factor, $γ_p = 2$.\n    *   Energy: $E_p = 2 m_e c^2$.\n    *   Momentum magnitude: $p_p = \\sqrt{2^2 - 1} \\cdot m_e c = \\sqrt{3} \\cdot m_e c$. Its direction is along the -x axis.\n\n*   **Total Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):**\n    $E_{initial} = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2$.\n\n*   **Total Initial Momentum ($P_{initial}$):**\n    Momentum is a vector. Taking the +x direction as positive:\n    $P_{initial, x} = p_e - p_p = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) \\cdot m_e c$.\n    The initial momentum in the vertical (y) direction is zero: $P_{initial, y} = 0$.\n\n### 2. Final State (After Annihilation)\n\nTwo photons are produced. Let's call them γ₁ and γ₂.\n\n*   Photons are massless, and their energy is related to their momentum by $E = pc$.\n*   We are told the photons have the same energy: $E_{γ1} = E_{γ2} = E_γ$.\n*   This means their momenta also have the same magnitude: $p_{γ1} = p_{γ2} = p_γ = E_γ / c$.\n*   One photon moves \"upper-right\" and the other \"lower-right\". This means they are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. Let the angle of the first photon with the +x axis be $θ$, and the angle of the second photon be $-θ$.\n\n*   **Total Final Energy ($E_{final}$):**\n    $E_{final} = E_{γ1} + E_{γ2} = 2 E_γ$.\n\n*   **Total Final Momentum ($P_{final}$):**\n    *   x-component: $P_{final, x} = p_γ \\cos(θ) + p_γ \\cos(-θ) = 2 p_γ \\cos(θ)$.\n    *   y-component: $P_{final, y} = p_γ \\sin(θ) + p_γ \\sin(-θ) = p_γ \\sin(θ) - p_γ \\sin(θ) = 0$.\n\n### 3. Applying Conservation Laws\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $6 m_e c^2 = 2 E_γ$\n    $E_γ = 3 m_e c^2$\n\n    From this, we can find the magnitude of each photon's momentum:\n    $p_γ = E_γ / c = 3 m_e c$.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    The y-component of momentum is conserved (0 = 0), which is consistent with our symmetric angle setup. Now let's use the x-component:\n    $P_{initial, x} = P_{final, x}$\n    $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) \\cdot m_e c = 2 p_γ \\cos(θ)$\n\n    Now, substitute the value of $p_γ$ we found:\n    $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) \\cdot m_e c = 2 (3 m_e c) \\cos(θ)$\n    $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) \\cdot m_e c = 6 m_e c \\cos(θ)$\n\n    We can cancel $m_e c$ from both sides and solve for $\\cos(θ)$:\n    $\\cos(θ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}$\n\n### 4. Calculation\n\nNow we calculate the value of $θ$:\n*   $\\sqrt{15} \\approx 3.8730$\n*   $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.7321$\n*   $\\cos(θ) \\approx \\frac{3.8730 - 1.7321}{6} = \\frac{2.1409}{6} \\approx 0.3568$\n*   $θ = \\arccos(0.3568) \\approx 69.1^\\circ$\n\nThe question asks for the angle **between** the directions of the two photons. This angle is $θ - (-θ) = 2θ$.\n\n*   Angle between photons = $2θ = 2 \\times 69.1^\\circ = 138.2^\\circ$.\n\nThis value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
