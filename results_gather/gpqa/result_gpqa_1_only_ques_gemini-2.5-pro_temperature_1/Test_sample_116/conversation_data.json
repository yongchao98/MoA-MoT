    "Optical isomerism is a property of chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Chirality often arises from the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or due to restricted rotation in certain molecules (atropisomerism). A molecule that has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral and will not show optical isomerism.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   This is a biphenyl derivative. In biphenyl systems, if there are bulky substituents at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'), the rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is restricted.\n    *   In this molecule, the ortho positions are substituted with large groups: two nitro groups (-NO₂) and two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃). This steric hindrance prevents free rotation, locking the molecule into a specific twisted conformation.\n    *   Furthermore, each ring is asymmetrically substituted (e.g., ring 1 has a -COOCH₃ at C2 and a -NO₂ at C6). This lack of symmetry within the rings, combined with the restricted rotation, makes the molecule chiral. It lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n    *   Molecules that are chiral due to hindered rotation are called atropisomers. Since this molecule is chiral, it will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (methyl lactate)**:\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        3.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism, existing as a pair of enantiomers (R and S forms).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It consists of a central carbonyl carbon double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups.\n    *   The central carbon is sp² hybridized and bonded to only three groups. There are no chiral centers in the molecule.\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   Due to the presence of a plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   This is the *trans* isomer of an alkene, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   There are no chiral centers in the molecule (the double-bonded carbons are sp² hybridized).\n    *   The molecule is planar and possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. It also has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself).\n    *   Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism. It does, however, have a geometric isomer (dimethyl maleate, the *cis* isomer).\n\n**Conclusion**:\nCompounds 1 and 2 are chiral and therefore show optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not.\n\nThe correct option is the one that includes only 1 and 2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
