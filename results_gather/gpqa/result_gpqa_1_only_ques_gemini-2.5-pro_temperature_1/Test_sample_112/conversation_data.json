    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The extreme broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region and is consistent with the C=O bond of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a C=C double bond. The presence of a carboxylic acid means the molecule must have **two oxygen atoms**.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of the alkene group suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. The mass of a carboxyl group (-COOH) is calculated as: 12.01 (C) + 16.00 (O) + 16.00 (O) + 1.01 (H) ≈ 45. This fragment, [COOH]⁺, strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**Synthesizing the Information:**\n\n*   The data from all three techniques points to a molecule that is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. It must contain a -COOH group (which has two oxygens and one C=O double bond) and a C=C double bond.\n*   This means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms** and have at least **two degrees of unsaturation** (one for the C=O bond and one for the C=C bond).\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\nWe can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for each formula using the formula: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2).\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O:** Contains only one oxygen. This is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₀O₂:** Contains two oxygens. DBE = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. This formula has two oxygens and two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly matches our conclusion of having one C=O and one C=C bond.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O₂:** Contains two oxygens. DBE = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. This would be a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which contradicts the evidence for a C=C double bond.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₂O:** Contains only one oxygen. This is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\nThe only formula that fits all the spectral evidence is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<B>>>"
