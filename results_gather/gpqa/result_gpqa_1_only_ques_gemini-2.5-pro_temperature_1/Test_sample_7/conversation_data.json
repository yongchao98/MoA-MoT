  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "This is a classic genetic interaction problem. Let's break down the data step-by-step to determine the relationships between the genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n**1. Analyze the Single-Mutant Phenotypes**\n*   **Control (Wild Type):** 100% resistance (our baseline).\n*   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. This means G1 contributes to the resistance, and its loss causes a partial drop.\n*   **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. The loss of G2 completely eliminates resistance. This indicates G2 is an essential gene for this pathway.\n*   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. G3 is also important for resistance, more so than G1.\n\n**2. Identify the Upstream Transcription Factor (TF)**\n*   The problem states at least one gene is a TF acting upstream of others.\n*   A knockout of an upstream master regulator (like a TF that turns on the whole pathway) would shut down everything downstream, leading to the most severe phenotype.\n*   The `g2` mutant has a 0% resistance phenotype, the most severe possible. This strongly suggests **G2 is the upstream transcription factor** that is required to activate the other resistance genes.\n\n**3. Analyze the Double-Mutant Phenotypes for Epistasis**\n*   **Epistasis** occurs when the effect of one gene masks the effect of another. In a knockout experiment, if the double mutant's phenotype is the same as one of the single mutant's phenotypes, the corresponding gene is epistatic (acting upstream or in an essential parallel pathway).\n*   **g1g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. This is the same phenotype as the `g2` mutant (0%). Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**. This fits our model of G2 being an upstream activator of G1.\n*   **g2g3 mutant:** 0% resistance. This is the same phenotype as the `g2` mutant (0%). Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G3**. This also fits the model of G2 activating G3.\n*   **g1g3 mutant:** 10% resistance. This phenotype is different from both the `g1` mutant (75%) and the `g3` mutant (50%). Therefore, there is **no epistasis** between G1 and G3. They likely act in parallel branches downstream of G2.\n\n**4. Characterize the Interaction Between G1 and G3**\n*   Since G1 and G3 are not epistatic to each other, they have a different kind of interaction.\n*   Let's look at their combined effect. The loss of G1 causes a 25% drop in resistance (100% -> 75%). The loss of G3 causes a 50% drop (100% -> 50%).\n*   If their effects were simply additive, we would expect the double mutant `g1g3` to have a resistance of 100% - 25% - 50% = 25%.\n*   However, the observed resistance is only 10%. Since the effect of knocking out both genes is much greater than the sum of their individual effects, this is a **synergistic interaction**. This often indicates that the two genes have **partially redundant functions**; they perform similar roles, so having one can partially compensate for the loss of the other, but losing both is catastrophic.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Options**\n\nBased on our analysis:\n*   G2 is the transcription factor.\n*   G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.\n*   G1 and G3 have a synergistic/redundant relationship.\n*   There is no epistasis between G1 and G3.\n\nLet's check the choices against these conclusions:\n\n*   **A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** Incorrect. G2 is the TF, not G1.\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This option correctly identifies G2 as the TF. However, \"pleiotropy\" (one gene affecting multiple unrelated traits) is not supported by the data, and \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" is factually incorrect as the g1g3 phenotype (10%) is not the same as the g1 phenotype (75%).\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** This correctly identifies G2 as the TF. \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\" is incorrect.\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This correctly identifies G2 as the TF and correctly uses the term \"gene redundancy\" to describe the synergistic interaction between G1 and G3. However, the claim that \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll the options contain at least one incorrect statement. However, Option D contains two correct conclusions derived directly from the data (G2 is the TF, and G1/G3 show redundancy), whereas the other options contain more incorrect or unsupported statements. The term \"gene redundancy\" in option D is the most accurate description of the interaction between G1 and G3. Despite the flaw in its third clause, it represents the best overall conclusion from the experiment.\n\nHowever, if we must choose the intended answer for a test, and recognizing that such questions can be flawed, sometimes we must identify the core correct concepts. The most certain conclusion is that G2 is the TF. Options B, C, and D all agree on this. The next point is the nature of the G1/G3 interaction. The data shows synergy, which is functional redundancy. Pleiotropy is an incorrect term. Therefore, option D is genetically the most sound interpretation. If we are forced to select an answer with flaws, we choose the one with the most correct information.\n\nLet's reconsider option B. It correctly identifies G2 as the TF. Its other two points (\"pleiotropy\" and \"epistasis of G1 over G3\") are incorrect. Option D correctly identifies G2 as the TF and correctly identifies the G1/G3 interaction as redundancy, making it a stronger choice. There seems to be an error in the question's options, but based on a rigorous scientific interpretation, option D is the most defensible. Yet, in many contexts, the answer might be considered B due to a potential misunderstanding of the terms by the question creator. Given the ambiguity, let's re-examine. Without a clear path to any option being fully correct, we must choose the 'least wrong'. Both B and D correctly identify the TF but misrepresent the G1/G3 interaction details. D's description of \"redundancy\" is better than B's \"pleiotropy\". But both make a false epistasis claim. Let's assume the false epistasis claim is a common error in all plausible options and focus on the G1/G3 interaction description. \"Redundancy\" is the correct term for the observed synergy. \"Pleiotropy\" is not. Therefore D remains the stronger choice. Let's assume there is a reason for B being the answer. The only reason would be a non-standard definition of epistasis and pleiotropy. Without that, B is not a strong candidate.\n\nLet's re-evaluate from the perspective of a common mistake. Perhaps the synergistic effect (10%) is simply interpreted as a novel interaction, and pleiotropy is used as a catch-all term for 'complex interaction'. The epistasis part remains incorrect. This does not make B a good choice. Let's go with the most logically sound choice based on the evidence.\n\nThe single most important finding is that G2 is a master regulator (the TF), and G1 and G3 are downstream targets that work together synergistically (i.e., they are partially redundant). Option D captures the first and third points correctly. Option B only captures the first point correctly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
