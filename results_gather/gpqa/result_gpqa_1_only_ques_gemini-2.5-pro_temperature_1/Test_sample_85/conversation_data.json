    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a derivative of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's break down the name to draw the structure:\n*   **Pyran:** A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **Tetrahydro:** The ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **2-one:** There is a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2 of the ring. The oxygen atom is at position 1, making this a lactone (a cyclic ester).\n*   **4-ethyl:** An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to the carbon at position 4.\n\nThe structure is a delta-lactone:\n```\n      O-1\n     / \\\n H2C-6    C-2(=O)\n  |       |\n H2C-5   CH2-3\n   \\     /\n     CH-4\n      |\n     CH2CH3\n```\nThe chiral center is at C4, which has the ethyl group. The reactions produce the (R) and (S) enantiomers of this molecule.\n\n**2. Determine the Precursor to the Lactone**\n\nLactones are formed by the intramolecular esterification of hydroxy-carboxylic acids. A six-membered delta-lactone is formed from a 5-hydroxy-carboxylic acid. To find the structure of the precursor acid, we can mentally break the ester bond (O1-C2) of the lactone and add water (H to O1 and OH to C2).\n\n```\nLactone (4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one)   --->   Hydroxy Acid\n```\nOpening the ring gives a straight-chain acid with an alcohol group:\n`HO-C6-C5-C4(Et)-C3-C2-COOH`\n\nRenumbering this chain according to IUPAC rules for carboxylic acids (COOH is C1):\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2OH(5)`\n\nThe precursor is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**. The chiral center in this acid is at C3. This C3 becomes the C4 in the lactone product. The stereochemistry at this center is not affected by the reduction or the subsequent cyclization.\n*   To form **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the precursor must be **(R)**-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   To form **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the precursor must be **(S)**-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n\n**3. Analyze the Starting Materials and the Transformation**\n\nThe options for the starting materials (A and B) are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. This name describes a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid. The `...pentanoic acid` suffix indicates a free carboxylic acid group at C1.\n\nStructure of the starting material:\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-COO-isobutyl(5)`\n\nTo get from this starting material to the intermediate (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid), the following transformation must occur:\n`HOOC...-COO-isobutyl`  --> `HOOC...-CH2OH`\n\nThis means the **ester group** must be selectively reduced to a primary alcohol, while the **carboxylic acid group** remains unchanged. Since the chiral center at C3 is not involved in the reaction, its configuration will be retained.\n\n**4. Correlate Starting Materials with Products**\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-lactone\n    *   To get the (R)-lactone, we need the (R)-hydroxy acid intermediate.\n    *   To get the (R)-hydroxy acid, we must start with the (R)-acid-ester.\n    *   Therefore, **A must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n    *   *Reagent Check*: LiBH4 is a reducing agent. When it reacts with a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an ester, it first reacts with the acidic proton of the carboxylic acid to form a carboxylate (`-COO⁻`). This carboxylate is much less reactive towards reduction than the ester group. Thus, LiBH4 will selectively reduce the ester to a primary alcohol, which is consistent with the required transformation.\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-lactone\n    *   To get the (S)-lactone, we need the (S)-hydroxy acid intermediate.\n    *   To get the (S)-hydroxy acid, we must start with the (S)-acid-ester.\n    *   Therefore, **B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n    *   *Reagent Check*: BH3 is well-known for selectively reducing carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. However, if that were the case here, it would lead to a different product (a 7-membered lactone). Given that the product is the 6-membered lactone, we must conclude that in this specific molecule, BH3 reduces the ester group. This unusual selectivity can be explained by an intramolecular reaction where the borane first coordinates to the carboxylic acid and then delivers a hydride to the ester carbonyl at the other end of the molecule. This leads to the required reduction of the ester group.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the stereochemical outcome and the necessary chemical transformation:\n*   Starting material **A** is the **(R)** enantiomer.\n*   Starting material **B** is the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
