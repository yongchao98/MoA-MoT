    "Here is a detailed step-by-step analysis of each option to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**Target Molecule Analysis:**\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\nLet's assign the positions on the benzene ring:\n*   Position 1: -OEt (ethoxy group), a strong activator and ortho, para-director.\n*   Position 2: -tBu (tert-butyl group), a weak activator and ortho, para-director. It is very bulky, strongly favoring para-substitution.\n*   Position 3: -NO2 (nitro group), a strong deactivator and meta-director.\n\nThe substituents are in a 1,2,3-arrangement. This is a sterically crowded pattern that is often difficult to achieve through standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions, which typically favor 1,2,4 or 1,3,5 patterns depending on the directing groups. A successful synthesis will likely require a careful ordering of reactions and possibly the use of blocking groups.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options:**\n\n**Option A:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene. (Friedel-Crafts Alkylation)\nii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky -tBu group is an o,p-director, but strongly favors substitution at the para position due to sterics. The major product is 4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The ortho isomer is a minor product. A \"high-yield\" synthesis would not rely on a minor product. Let's assume we proceed with the major para-isomer.\niii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group. 4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene → 4-tert-butylaniline.\niv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. The amino group is protonated to -NH3+, which is a meta-director. The -NH2 is at C1, -tBu at C4. Both -NH3+ and -tBu direct substitution to the C2 position. Product: 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline.\nv) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group. → 2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenediazonium salt.\nvi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol. → 2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol.\nvii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis. → 1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene.\nThis final product has a 1,2,4 substitution pattern, which is not the desired 1,2,3 target molecule. Therefore, option A is incorrect. The final two steps (viii, ix) are also superfluous.\n\n**Option B:**\ni) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\nii) `Fe/HCl`: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\niii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction fails. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2), forming a complex that deactivates the ring towards electrophilic substitution. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\nThe sequence of reagents is nonsensical. For example, step (iv) is `NaNO2/HCl`, which is used for diazotization of an amine. However, the substrate after step (iii) (5-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid) is not an amine. The reduction step (`Fe/HCl`) appears much later at step (viii). This option is chemically illogical and incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\nThis option employs a blocking group strategy, which is often necessary for synthesizing complex substitution patterns.\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene. (High yield)\nii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky -tBu group directs the incoming -SO3H group to the para position. → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. This step effectively \"blocks\" the para position. (High yield)\niii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. The -tBu group is an o,p-director, and the -SO3H group is a meta-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the positions ortho to the t-butyl group (C2 and C6). → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. (High yield, good regioselectivity)\niv) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group. → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\nv) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group. → 2-diazonium-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid salt.\nUp to this point, the synthesis is logical and proceeds with high yield and selectivity, producing a key intermediate. The remaining steps must transform this intermediate into the final product. The sequence as written has some ambiguities or potential typos (e.g., step vi, `HNO3/H2SO4`, seems out of place). However, let's analyze the necessary transformations and see if the provided reagents can accomplish them in a plausible (even if reordered) sequence.\nWe need to:\n1.  Replace the diazonium group (-N2+) with an ethoxy group (-OEt). This is typically done by converting it to a phenol (`H3O+, H2O/Heat` - step vii) and then performing a Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr` - step ix).\n2.  Introduce a nitro group at the correct position (C3 in the final product). This requires nitration (`HNO3/H2SO4` - step vi).\n3.  Remove the sulfonic acid blocking group (-SO3H). This is done by heating with dilute acid (`dilute H2SO4` - step viii).\n\nA plausible (though not explicitly written in the correct order in the option) continuation would be:\n1.  Start with 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (after step iv).\n2.  Protect the amine (e.g., acetylation, an implied step).\n3.  Nitrate. The directing groups would place the NO2 group at C6 (relative to the amine).\n4.  Deprotect the amine.\n5.  Remove the sulfonic acid group (desulfonation).\n6.  Diazotize the amine, convert to phenol, then etherify.\nThis is getting very complicated. However, compared to the other options, option C presents the most viable synthetic strategy, using a blocking group to control regiochemistry. The flaws in the other options are more fundamental (wrong product, failed reaction, nonsensical order). Therefore, option C is the best choice among the given possibilities, assuming some ambiguity or error in the statement of the later steps. It correctly identifies the key strategic elements for constructing a complex aromatic molecule.\n\nFinal Decision: Options A, B, and D are clearly incorrect due to producing the wrong isomer, a failed reaction, or an illogical sequence. Option C provides the only rational strategic framework (using a blocking group) to potentially access the difficult 1,2,3-substitution pattern, making it the most plausible answer despite the confusing ordering of its final steps.\n\n<<<C>>>"
