    "To determine the correct statement, we must first understand the chemical process described. The goal is to create a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as a reactant. This is achieved through a process called tandem catalysis or *in situ* comonomer generation.\n\nIn this process, a dual-catalyst system is used in a single reactor:\n1.  **Oligomerization Catalyst:** This catalyst selectively converts some of the ethylene into short-chain alpha-olefins (SCAOs), such as 1-butene (from dimerization), 1-hexene (from trimerization), or 1-octene (from tetramerization). The high selectivity of this catalyst is crucial for creating \"regular branches\" (e.g., all butyl branches from 1-hexene).\n2.  **Polymerization Catalyst:** This catalyst (often a Ziegler-Natta or metallocene type) copolymerizes the remaining ethylene with the *in situ* generated alpha-olefins to form branched polyethylene (specifically, Linear Low-Density Polyethylene, LLDPE).\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement in the context of this process:\n\n**A) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.**\nThe \"essential additional reaction step\" is the selective oligomerization of ethylene. The most prominent catalysts for this reaction, particularly for selective trimerization to 1-hexene, are based on chromium. These chromium catalysts are typically activated by organoaluminum compounds, such as methylaluminoxane (MAO) or modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO). Therefore, aluminum-based activators are, in fact, essential for this reaction. This statement is **incorrect**.\n\n**B) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.**\nWhile there is academic research on ethylene oligomerization using noble metals (e.g., palladium, rhodium), they are not the basis for the large-scale industrial processes for selective oligomerization. The workhorse catalysts are based on more abundant and less expensive metals like chromium and nickel. Even if a noble metal system could work, its cost would be prohibitive for producing a bulk commodity polymer like polyethylene. This statement is plausible in a general sense but does not describe the actual technology used and is therefore not the best answer.\n\n**C) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.**\nGroup VIa (or Group 6) of the periodic table includes Chromium (Cr), Molybdenum (Mo), and Tungsten (W). The most successful and industrially implemented catalysts for the selective trimerization of ethylene to 1-hexene are based on chromium complexes (e.g., chromium-pincer ligand systems developed by Chevron Phillips Chemical and Sasol). These catalyst systems require specific activators (like the aluminum-based ones mentioned in A) to function. This statement accurately describes the core chemistry of the key industrial systems for generating regular branches from ethylene. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**D) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.**\nThis statement is also factually correct. For example, Chevron Phillips Chemical operates commercial plants in the United States (e.g., in Cedar Bayou, Texas) that use a single-reactor tandem catalysis system to produce LLDPE with in-situ generated 1-hexene comonomer. However, the question asks for the correct statement regarding the *formation* of the polymer, making the chemical principle (Statement C) a more direct and fundamental answer than the geographical/commercial status (Statement D). In the context of providing scientific advice, Statement C is the most pertinent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth C and D are factually correct statements. However, statement C describes the fundamental chemistry and the type of catalyst required to achieve the desired polymer structure, which is the central point of the scientist's inquiry. Statement D describes the commercial application of this chemistry. In a scientific context, describing the chemical principle is the more direct and informative answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
