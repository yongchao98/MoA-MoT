    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatographic separation.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is symmetrical, with a propyl group on each side of the double bond.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA:** This reagent performs epoxidation. The addition of the oxygen atom is a **syn-addition**, meaning it adds to the same face of the double bond. For a trans-alkene, syn-addition results in a racemic mixture of trans-epoxides. In this case, (E)-oct-4-ene will form a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This causes the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The nucleophile (water) attacks one of the epoxide carbons in an Sₙ2 fashion, leading to **anti-addition** of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond.\n*   **Overall Stereochemistry of Reaction 1:** The two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid hydrolysis) is equivalent to an **anti-dihydroxylation** of the alkene.\n    *   The rule for stereospecific reactions on symmetrical alkenes is: **(E)-alkene + anti-addition → meso compound.**\n    *   Therefore, the product of Reaction 1 is a single, achiral compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. This compound has two chiral centers (C4 and C5) but is achiral due to a center of inversion. Let's call this **Product M**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, also symmetrical.\n*   **Reagents:** The same reagents are used, so the overall reaction is also an **anti-dihydroxylation**.\n*   **Overall Stereochemistry of Reaction 2:**\n    *   The rule for stereospecific reactions on symmetrical alkenes is: **(Z)-alkene + anti-addition → racemic mixture.**\n    *   Therefore, the product of Reaction 2 is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. Let's call these **Product R** and **Product S**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **Product M:** meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **Product R:** (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **Product S:** (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   **Product R** and **Product S** are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   **Product M** is a **diastereomer** of both Product R and Product S (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n#### **Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC**\n*   An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** (like R and S) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated and will elute at the same time, appearing as a **single peak**.\n*   **Diastereomers** (like M versus the R/S pair) have different physical properties and will be separated, appearing as **different peaks**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The standard HPLC will show two peaks:\n    *   Peak 1: Product M (the meso-diol)\n    *   Peak 2: Products R and S (the co-eluting racemic pair)\n*   **Total Peaks in Standard HPLC = 2**\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with different stereoisomers.\n*   It can separate **enantiomers**. Therefore, Product R and Product S will have different retention times and will appear as **two separate peaks**.\n*   It can also separate **diastereomers**. Since Product M is a diastereomer of R and S, it will also have a unique retention time, different from both R and S.\n*   **Conclusion:** The chiral HPLC will separate all three stereoisomers.\n    *   Peak 1: Product M\n    *   Peak 2: Product R\n    *   Peak 3: Product S\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC = 3**\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
