    "This is a common piece of jargon used by synthetic chemists. The phrase \"on top of each other\" almost always refers to the results of a chromatography experiment, most often Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC), which is used to monitor the progress of a reaction and check the purity of the product.\n\nIn chromatography, compounds are separated based on their differential affinity for a stationary phase (like a silica gel plate) and a mobile phase (a solvent). This affinity is primarily determined by the compound's **polarity**.\n\n*   If two compounds have different polarities, they will travel up the TLC plate at different rates, resulting in two distinct spots. This indicates a successful separation.\n*   If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will travel up the plate at nearly the same rate. This results in spots that are very close together or merged into a single, elongated spot. Visually, the spots are \"on top of each other.\" This indicates that separation by standard chromatography will be very difficult, which is a common problem in a synthesis lab.\n\nLet's look at the other options:\n*   A) Similar boiling points would make separation by distillation difficult, but the phrase \"on top of each other\" is much more specific to chromatography.\n*   C) While interactions between molecules determine their physical properties (like polarity), the phrase doesn't directly refer to the interactions themselves, but rather the consequence for separation.\n*   D) Optical rotation is a property measured *after* a compound is purified; it's not a separation technique, and the phrase doesn't fit this context.\n\nTherefore, the chemist is lamenting that their desired product and some impurity (like the starting material) have very similar polarities, making them impossible to separate using their current chromatography conditions.\n\n<<<B>>>"
