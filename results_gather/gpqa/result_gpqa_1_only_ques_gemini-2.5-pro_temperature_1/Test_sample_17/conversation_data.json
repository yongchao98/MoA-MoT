    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. In stellar abundance analysis, this is interpreted as the ratio of the silicon number abundance relative to hydrogen for each star. Let's denote this ratio as R:\n\nR = (n_Si / n_H)_1 / (n_Si / n_H)_2\n\nwhere (n_Si / n_H)_1 is the ratio of the number density of silicon atoms to hydrogen atoms in Star_1, and (n_Si / n_H)_2 is the same for Star_2.\n\n**2. Understand the Notation**\n\nThe standard astronomical abundance notation [X/Y] is defined as:\n\n[X/Y] = log10( (n_X / n_Y)_star ) - log10( (n_X / n_Y)_Sun )\n\nThis logarithmic scale compares the abundance ratio of two elements (X and Y) in a star to the same ratio in the Sun. A value of 0 dex means the star has the same ratio as the Sun.\n\n**3. Relate the Goal to the Given Notation**\n\nWe can express our target ratio R in terms of the [X/Y] notation. Let's take the base-10 logarithm of R:\n\nlog10(R) = log10[ (n_Si / n_H)_1 / (n_Si / n_H)_2 ]\nlog10(R) = log10( (n_Si / n_H)_1 ) - log10( (n_Si / n_H)_2 )\n\nWe can rewrite this by adding and subtracting log10( (n_Si / n_H)_Sun ):\n\nlog10(R) = [ log10( (n_Si / n_H)_1 ) - log10( (n_Si / n_H)_Sun ) ] - [ log10( (n_Si / n_H)_2 ) - log10( (n_Si / n_H)_Sun ) ]\n\nUsing the definition of [X/Y], this simplifies to:\n\nlog10(R) = [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2\n\nTo find the ratio R, we first need to calculate the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance, [Si/H], for each star.\n\n**4. Calculate [Si/H] for Star_1**\n\nWe are given for Star_1:\n*   [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex\n*   [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex\n\nWe can use the following standard identity for abundances:\n[A/C] = [A/B] + [B/C]\n\nApplying this to Star_1 with A=Si, B=Fe, and C=H:\n[Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1\n[Si/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0\n[Si/H]_1 = 0.3\n\n**5. Calculate [Si/H] for Star_2**\n\nWe are given for Star_2:\n*   [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex\n*   [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex\n\nApplying the same identity to Star_2 with A=Mg, B=Si, and C=H:\n[Mg/H]_2 = [Mg/Si]_2 + [Si/H]_2\n0 = 0.3 + [Si/H]_2\n\nSolving for [Si/H]_2:\n[Si/H]_2 = -0.3\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Ratio**\n\nNow we substitute the values of [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2 back into our equation for log10(R):\n\nlog10(R) = [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2\nlog10(R) = 0.3 - (-0.3)\nlog10(R) = 0.6\n\nTo find R, we take 10 to the power of 0.6:\n\nR = 10^0.6 â‰ˆ 3.981\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9.\n\n**7. Conclusion**\n\nThe ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately 3.9. The information about the stellar masses and the absolute solar abundances of Fe and Mg are distractors and not needed for this calculation.\n\nComparing our result to the options:\nA) ~3.9\nB) ~1.2\nC) ~0.8\nD) ~12.6\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
