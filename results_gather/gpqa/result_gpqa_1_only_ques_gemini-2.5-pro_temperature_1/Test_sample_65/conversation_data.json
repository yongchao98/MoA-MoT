    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as an extension of the Standard Model (SM) that preserves its fundamental structure. Let's analyze each symmetry:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a relativistic quantum field theory. All operators are constructed to be Lorentz scalars, meaning they are invariant under rotations and boosts. This is a foundational requirement of the framework.\n\n2.  **Poincare Symmetry**: This is the full symmetry group of special relativity, which includes Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) and spacetime translations. Like Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry is a fundamental assumption in the construction of the SMEFT Lagrangian. Invariance under translations leads to the conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry**: This is the combination of Charge conjugation (C) and Parity (P). The Standard Model itself violates CP symmetry (as observed in the weak interactions). SMEFT is designed to parametrize all possible new physics effects, including potential new sources of CP violation. Therefore, SMEFT operators are *not* required to respect CP symmetry; in fact, many CP-violating operators are included in the SMEFT basis.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry**: This is the combination of Charge conjugation, Parity, and Time reversal (T). The CPT theorem states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be CPT-invariant. Since SMEFT is constructed as a local, Lorentz-invariant QFT, it must respect CPT symmetry.\n\nTherefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n*   1. Lorentz Symmetry - Yes\n*   2. Poincare symmetry - Yes\n*   3. CP symmetry - No\n*   4. CPT symmetry - Yes\n\nThis corresponds to the combination 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
