    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclohexanone (a ketone) and bromine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. In this reaction, a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom. Cyclohexanone is symmetrical, so bromination at either α-carbon (C2 or C6) yields the same product.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n*   **Reactants:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone and a strong base (NaOH) with heat.\n*   **Reaction:** This substrate, an α-halo ketone with an available proton on the other α-carbon (α' position), undergoes a classic reaction called the **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n    1.  The base (OH⁻) removes the acidic proton from the α'-carbon (C6) to form an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate then performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 attack on the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon of this strained intermediate.\n    4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, and the bicyclic ring opens to form a more stable, rearranged carboxylate. The ring contracts from a six-membered ring to a five-membered ring.\n    5.  After an acidic workup (which is implied to isolate the neutral product), the carboxylate is protonated.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid, thionyl chloride, and pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the standard procedure for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl). Pyridine is used as a base to neutralize the HCl gas produced as a byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride and Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LTBA).\n*   **Reaction:** LTBA is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the primary alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. We can do this by examining the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached to one of the carbons.\n    *   The molecule has a total of 10 hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Symmetry:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C-CHO bond, the ring carbon it's attached to (C1), and bisects the opposite C-C bond (the C3-C4 bond).\n\nLet's identify the unique proton environments based on this symmetry:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is unique as it is the only one bonded to a carbonyl carbon. (1 type)\n2.  **The methine proton on C1:** This is the proton on the ring carbon to which the aldehyde group is attached. It is in the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The methylene protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, on each of these carbons, the two protons are diastereotopic (they are in different chemical environments relative to the rest of the molecule). Let's call them H_axial and H_equatorial (in a simplified model). The two axial protons (one on C2, one on C5) are equivalent to each other. The two equatorial protons (one on C2, one on C5) are also equivalent to each other. But the axial and equatorial protons are distinct. This gives two more types of protons. (2 types)\n4.  **The methylene protons on C3 and C4:** The plane of symmetry also makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 protons, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic, and the same is true for C4. Therefore, the protons on C3 and C4 also give rise to two distinct chemical environments. (2 types)\n\n**Counting the distinct types:**\n*   Type 1: Aldehyde H (1 proton)\n*   Type 2: C1-H (1 proton)\n*   Type 3: C2-Hₐ and C5-Hₐ (2 protons)\n*   Type 4: C2-Hₑ and C5-Hₑ (2 protons)\n*   Type 5: C3-Hₐ and C4-Hₐ (2 protons)\n*   Type 6: C3-Hₑ and C4-Hₑ (2 protons)\n\nIn total, there are **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in product 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
