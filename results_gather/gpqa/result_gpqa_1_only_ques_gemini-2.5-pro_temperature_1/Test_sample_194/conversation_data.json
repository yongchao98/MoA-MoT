    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum orbital period of the second planet.\n\n**1. Understand the Geometry of Transits**\n\n*   A planet transits its star when its orbit is viewed nearly edge-on. The orbital inclination, *i*, is the angle between the orbital plane and the plane of the sky (where *i* = 90Â° is perfectly edge-on).\n*   The impact parameter, *b*, is the projected distance between the center of the planet and the center of the star at mid-transit, normalized by the star's radius ($R_s$). It is given by the formula:\n    $b = \\frac{a \\cos i}{R_s}$\n    where *a* is the semi-major axis of the orbit.\n*   For a transit to occur, the planet must pass in front of the stellar disk. In the simplest model (treating the planet as a point), this requires the impact parameter to be $b \\le 1$. The maximum possible impact parameter for a transit is therefore $b_{max} = 1$. The information about the planet and star radii is often provided to confirm the system is physically plausible but is not always necessary for the core calculation if this simplified model is used. The fact that the problem asks about both transits and occultations is redundant for a circular orbit; if one happens, the other will happen half an orbit later.\n\n**2. Use Planet 1 to Determine the Orbital Plane's Inclination**\n\nWe are given the following for Planet 1:\n*   Orbital Period ($P_1$) = 3 days\n*   Impact Parameter ($b_1$) = 0.2\n\nUsing the impact parameter formula for Planet 1:\n$b_1 = \\frac{a_1 \\cos i}{R_s}$\n$0.2 = \\frac{a_1 \\cos i}{R_s}$\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the geometric term `cos(i)/Rs`, which is constant for any object in this specific orbital plane:\n$\\frac{\\cos i}{R_s} = \\frac{0.2}{a_1}$\n\n**3. Find the Condition for the Maximum Orbit of Planet 2**\n\nWe want to find the maximum orbital period for Planet 2 ($P_2$), which corresponds to the maximum possible semi-major axis ($a_2$) that still allows for a transit.\nThis occurs at the maximum possible impact parameter, which we assume is $b_{2,max} = 1$.\n\nUsing the impact parameter formula for Planet 2 at its maximum orbit:\n$b_{2,max} = \\frac{a_{2,max} \\cos i}{R_s}$\n$1 = \\frac{a_{2,max} \\cos i}{R_s}$\n\nWe can rearrange this as well:\n$\\frac{\\cos i}{R_s} = \\frac{1}{a_{2,max}}$\n\n**4. Relate the Orbits of the Two Planets**\n\nSince both planets are in the same orbital plane, the term `cos(i)/Rs` is the same for both. We can set the two expressions equal to each other:\n$\\frac{0.2}{a_1} = \\frac{1}{a_{2,max}}$\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of their semi-major axes:\n$\\frac{a_{2,max}}{a_1} = \\frac{1}{0.2} = 5$\nThis means the second planet's maximum orbit is 5 times larger than the first planet's orbit.\n\n**5. Apply Kepler's Third Law**\n\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis ($P^2 \\propto a^3$). We can write this as a ratio for the two planets:\n$(\\frac{P_2}{P_1})^2 = (\\frac{a_2}{a_1})^3$\n\nNow, we can solve for the maximum period of Planet 2, $P_{2,max}$:\n$P_{2,max} = P_1 \\times (\\frac{a_{2,max}}{a_1})^{3/2}$\n\nSubstitute the known values:\n$P_{2,max} = 3 \\text{ days} \\times (5)^{3/2}$\n$P_{2,max} = 3 \\times \\sqrt{5^3} = 3 \\times \\sqrt{125}$\n$P_{2,max} = 3 \\times 5\\sqrt{5} = 15\\sqrt{5}$\n\nFinally, calculate the numerical value:\n$P_{2,max} \\approx 15 \\times 2.236 \\approx 33.54$ days.\n\nThis value is approximately 33.5 days, which matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
