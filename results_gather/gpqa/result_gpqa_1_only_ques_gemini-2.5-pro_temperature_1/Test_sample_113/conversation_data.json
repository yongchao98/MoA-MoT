    "**Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n\n*   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n*   **Type of Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic addition to a carbonyl group, specifically a cyanohydrin formation.\n*   **Mechanism:** The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate. This intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final product, which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺) to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. An acidic medium, represented by H₃O⁺, provides the necessary protons. NaHSO₃ is used for bisulfite addition, not cyanohydrin formation.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = H₃O⁺. This eliminates options A and D.\n\n**Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n*   **Type of Reaction:** This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-C≡N) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   **Mechanism:** Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either strong acid or strong base. The reaction involves the addition of water across the carbon-nitrogen triple bond.\n*   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as a catalyst for the hydrolysis. Both HCl (a strong acid) and CH₃COOH (a weak acid) are acids, but complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid typically requires harsh conditions, such as a strong acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄) and heat. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is generally not strong enough to effectively drive this reaction to completion.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = HCl. This is the standard reagent for acid-catalyzed nitrile hydrolysis. This conclusion, combined with the conclusion for A, points to option C.\n\n**Final Selection:**\n\n*   A must be H₃O⁺.\n*   B must be HCl.\n*   Therefore, the correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
