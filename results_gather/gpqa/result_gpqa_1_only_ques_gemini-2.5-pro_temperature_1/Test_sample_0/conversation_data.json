    "Here is a step-by-step explanation to find the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Principle:** The problem is based on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time. This principle states that for a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt), there is an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" in its energy (ΔE). The relationship is given by:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. For practical calculations, we can approximate this as ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.\n\n2.  **Condition for Resolution:** For two energy levels, E1 and E2, to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguishable, the difference in their energies, |E2 - E1|, must be greater than the energy uncertainty (width) of the levels. Since both levels have a width, the separation must be greater than the larger of the two widths.\n    Condition: |E2 - E1| > ΔE1 and |E2 - E1| > ΔE2.\n    Essentially, we need the energy difference to be larger than the broadest of the two energy levels.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy Widths (ΔE):** We will use the value of the reduced Planck constant in units of electron-volt-seconds (eV·s) for convenience:\n    ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n    *   **For the first state (E1):**\n        *   Lifetime Δt1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE1 ≈ ħ / Δt1 = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **For the second state (E2):**\n        *   Lifetime Δt2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE2 ≈ ħ / Δt2 = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n4.  **Apply the Resolution Condition:**\n    The two energy widths are ΔE1 ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV and ΔE2 ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁸ eV.\n    The larger of the two widths is ΔE1 ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This is because the state with the shorter lifetime is more uncertain in energy.\n    Therefore, to clearly resolve the two levels, their energy difference must be greater than this value:\n    |E2 - E1| > 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV is less than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV. (Not resolvable)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV is much greater than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV. (Clearly resolvable)\n    *   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV is less than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV. (Not resolvable)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁹ eV is less than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV. (Not resolvable)\n\nThe only energy difference that is large enough to allow the two energy levels to be clearly distinguished is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
