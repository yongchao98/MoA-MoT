    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics of Particle Decay:**\n    The number of particles, N, remaining from an initial sample, N₀, after a time t is described by the radioactive decay law:\n    N(t) = N₀ * e^(-t/τ_lab)\n    where τ_lab is the mean lifetime of the particle as measured in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Incorporate Time Dilation:**\n    The mean lifetime of a moving particle is dilated relative to its proper lifetime (τ), which is its lifetime in its own rest frame. The relationship is given by:\n    τ_lab = γ * τ\n    where γ is the Lorentz factor.\n    So, the decay law becomes:\n    N(t) = N₀ * e^(-t / (γτ))\n\n3.  **Relate Time of Flight to Distance:**\n    The particles are created at the center and travel to the detector wall, a distance R = 30 m. Since they travel at ultra-relativistic velocities, their speed v is very close to the speed of light, c. The time it takes for them to reach the detector (their time of flight) in the lab frame is:\n    t = R / v ≈ R / c\n\n4.  **Combine the Equations:**\n    Substituting the time of flight into the decay equation, we get the fraction of particles that survive the journey to the detector wall:\n    N/N₀ = e^(-(R/c) / (γτ)) = e^(-R / (γcτ))\n\n5.  **Use the Initial Given Information:**\n    We are given that for a Lorentz factor γ₁ = 20, one-third of the particles reach the detector.\n    N/N₀ = 1/3\n    So, for γ₁ = 20:\n    1/3 = e^(-R / (20 * cτ))\n\n    To solve for the unknown constant part (R/(cτ)), we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(1/3) = -R / (20 * cτ)\n    -ln(3) = -R / (20 * cτ)\n    ln(3) = R / (20 * cτ)\n\n6.  **Set up the Equation for the Target Scenario:**\n    We want to find the new Lorentz factor, γ₂, for which two-thirds of the particles reach the detector.\n    N/N₀ = 2/3\n    So, for γ₂:\n    2/3 = e^(-R / (γ₂ * cτ))\n\n    Again, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(2/3) = -R / (γ₂ * cτ)\n    -ln(3/2) = -R / (γ₂ * cτ)\n    ln(3/2) = R / (γ₂ * cτ)\n\n7.  **Solve for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂):**\n    We now have two equations:\n    1) ln(3) = R / (20 * cτ)\n    2) ln(3/2) = R / (γ₂ * cτ)\n\n    We can solve for the term R/(cτ) in the first equation:\n    R/(cτ) = 20 * ln(3)\n\n    Now substitute this into the second equation:\n    ln(3/2) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\n\n    Finally, solve for γ₂:\n    γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))\n\n    Using the approximate values for the natural logarithms:\n    ln(3) ≈ 1.0986\n    ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055\n\n    γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)\n    γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709\n    γ₂ ≈ 54.18\n\nThis calculated value is very close to 54.\n\n<<<D>>>"
