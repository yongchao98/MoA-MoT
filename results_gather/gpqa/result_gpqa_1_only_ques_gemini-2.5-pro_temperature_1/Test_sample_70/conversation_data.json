    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates into space.\n\nThe energy absorbed is proportional to the stellar flux, which is inversely proportional to the square of the planet's distance ($d$) from the star. So, Energy Absorbed $\\propto 1/d^2$.\nThe energy radiated is proportional to the fourth power of the planet's temperature ($T_{eq}^4$), according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n\nAt equilibrium, Energy Absorbed = Energy Radiated.\nTherefore, $T_{eq}^4 \\propto 1/d^2$.\n\nTaking the fourth root of both sides gives us the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance:\n$T_{eq} \\propto (1/d^2)^{1/4}$\n$T_{eq} \\propto d^{-1/2}$\n\nThis means the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance. This relationship holds true because the problem states the planets have the same albedo and orbit the same star.\n\n**Step 2: Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period**\n\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis ($a$).\n$P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\nSince the planets are described as having circular orbits, their semi-major axis ($a$) is equal to their constant orbital distance ($d$).\nSo, $P^2 \\propto d^3$.\n\nWe can rearrange this to express the distance in terms of the period:\n$d^3 \\propto P^2$\n$d \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\n**Step 3: Combine the relationships to find T_eq in terms of P**\n\nNow we can substitute the relationship from Step 2 into the one from Step 1 to find how equilibrium temperature depends on the orbital period.\n\nWe have $T_{eq} \\propto d^{-1/2}$ and $d \\propto P^{2/3}$.\nTherefore:\n$T_{eq} \\propto (P^{2/3})^{-1/2}$\n$T_{eq} \\propto P^{(2/3) \\times (-1/2)}$\n$T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\nThis shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Ratio of Temperatures**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 ($T_{eq\\_4} / T_{eq\\_2}$). Using the relationship from Step 3:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq\\_4}}{T_{eq\\_2}} = \\frac{(P_4)^{-1/3}}{(P_2)^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_4}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n**Step 5: Use the Given Orbital Period Ratios**\n\nThe problem states that the orbital periods are in the ratio $P_1:P_2:P_3:P_4:P_5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5$.\nFrom this, we can find the ratio of the periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \\frac{2}{3.5}$\n\nTo simplify the fraction:\n$\\frac{2}{3.5} = \\frac{2}{7/2} = 2 \\times \\frac{2}{7} = \\frac{4}{7}$\n\n**Step 6: Final Calculation**\n\nSubstitute the period ratio back into the temperature ratio equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq\\_4}}{T_{eq\\_2}} = \\left(\\frac{4}{7}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$\\frac{4}{7} \\approx 0.5714$\n$\\frac{T_{eq\\_4}}{T_{eq\\_2}} \\approx (0.5714)^{1/3}$\n\nLet's test the options provided:\n*   $0.83^3 = 0.83 \\times 0.83 \\times 0.83 \\approx 0.5718$\n\nThis value is extremely close to $4/7$. Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<D>>>"
