    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) in A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 has a fluorine mass fraction (ɷF) of 31.96%. The formula of a binary fluoride can be represented as YFₙ or YₘFₙ. Let's test the simple case first: A2 = YFₙ.\n    The molar mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n    ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n    0.3196 = (n × 19) / (M(Y) + n × 19)\n    0.3196 × M(Y) + 0.3196 × 19n = 19n\n    0.3196 × M(Y) = 19n - 6.0724n\n    0.3196 × M(Y) = 12.9276n\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45n\n    We test integer values for n:\n    *   If n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 (Ca, Ar). Not suitable.\n    *   If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 (Br, Se). Does not form 5 fluorides with the required properties.\n    *   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 (Sb). Antimony's mass is 121.76. This is a good match. However, Sb only forms two well-known fluorides (SbF₃, SbF₅) and the reaction chemistry described does not fit well.\n    *   If n=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 (Pu, Am). Plutonium (M=244) is a good candidate. However, this leads to a molecular weight for A4 that does not match any of the options.\n\n    Let's test the case where A2 = Y₂Fₙ.\n    ɷF = (n × 19) / (2 × M(Y) + n × 19) = 0.3196\n    19n = 0.3196 × (2 × M(Y) + 19n)\n    19n = 0.6392 × M(Y) + 6.0724n\n    12.9276n = 0.6392 × M(Y)\n    M(Y) ≈ 20.22n\n    We test integer values for n:\n    *   If n=5, M(Y) ≈ 20.22 × 5 = 101.1 g/mol. This is an excellent match for **Ruthenium (Ru)**, which has a molar mass of 101.07 g/mol.\n    *   Let's check: If Y=Ru, and A2 = Ru₂F₅, the mass fraction of fluorine is (5 × 19) / (2 × 101.07 + 5 × 19) = 95 / (202.14 + 95) = 95 / 297.14 ≈ 0.3197 or 31.97%. This is a nearly perfect match for the given 31.96%.\n\n2.  **Verify the other clues with Y = Ruthenium (Ru).**\n    *   **Five binary compounds:** Ruthenium is known to form RuF₃, RuF₄, RuF₅, RuF₆, and the mixed-valence compound Ru₂F₅. This fits the clue.\n    *   **A1 decomposition:** A1 decomposes into A2 (Ru₂F₅) and fluorine. This means A1 must have a higher fluorine content than A2. A plausible candidate for A1 is RuF₆, which is known to be unstable at room temperature (293 K). The reaction could be 4RuF₆ → 2Ru₂F₅ + 7F₂.\n    *   **A1 properties:** A1 is \"bright-red\" and oxidizes xenon. RuF₆ is a very strong oxidizing agent and is one of the few substances that can oxidize xenon. Its color is described as dark-brown, which is a discrepancy, but chemical problem color descriptions can be imprecise.\n    *   **A3 properties:** A3 also interacts with xenon and is made by fluorinating Ru. This could be RuF₅ or RuF₆, both of which are strong oxidizing agents.\n\n3.  **Identify A4 and A5.**\n    *   The reaction is: Y + A4 → A5, with a 1:1 molar ratio of Y (Ru) and A4.\n    *   This is a synproportionation reaction. Let A4 = RuFₙ. The general form of the reaction for a 1:1 ratio is Ru + RuFₙ → 2RuFₘ, which requires n=2m for the stoichiometry to balance.\n    *   Let's test possible candidates for A4 from the list of Ru fluorides, where n is an even number:\n        *   If A4 = RuF₆ (n=6), then m=3, and A5 = RuF₃.\n        *   If A4 = RuF₄ (n=4), then m=2, and A5 = RuF₂.\n    *   Now we use the final clue: \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\"\n        *   If A5 = RuF₃, it is largely insoluble and stable in water, though it might hydrolyze. This is a weak fit for \"decomposes\".\n        *   If A5 = RuF₂, Ru(II) is unstable in aqueous solution and would readily disproportionate. A likely reaction is 3RuF₂ → 2RuF₃ + Ru. This produces two distinct substances (ruthenium(III) fluoride and ruthenium metal). This is a perfect fit for the clue.\n\n4.  **Conclusion and Calculation.**\n    The most consistent scenario is:\n    *   Y = Ru\n    *   A4 = RuF₄\n    *   A5 = RuF₂\n    The question asks for the range of the molecular weight of A4.\n    A4 is RuF₄.\n    M(A4) = M(Ru) + 4 × M(F)\n    M(A4) = 101.07 g/mol + 4 × 19.00 g/mol\n    M(A4) = 101.07 + 76.00 = 177.07 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Match with the given options.**\n    The calculated molecular weight of 177.07 g/mol falls within the range:\n    B) 160-180\n\n<<<B>>>"
