    "To determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to find the mutation that will most probably result in a non-functional protein. This is typically achieved through a nonsense mutation (creating a premature stop codon) or a frameshift mutation (insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three). These mutations lead to a truncated or completely scrambled protein, which is almost always non-functional.\n\nLet's analyze the effect of each mutation by translating the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence. The genetic code is read in triplets called codons, starting from the start codon ATG.\n\n**Intact Gene:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT ... -3’\n*   **mRNA:** 5’-AUG UUU CUC GCU GGU ACU UCU ... -3’\n*   **Amino Acids:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr - Ser ...\n\nThis is the functional protein that produces the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nNow let's analyze each mutant:\n\n**Mutant 1:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT ... -3’ (parsed from `ATGTTCTACGCT...`)\n*   **mRNA:** 5’-AUG UUC UAC GCU ... -3’\n*   **Amino Acids:** Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala ...\n*   **Effect:** The third codon, CTC (Leucine), has been changed to TAC (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. While this *could* potentially inactivate the protein if the amino acid is in a critical location, it often results in a protein that is still functional. It is less likely to cause a complete knockout compared to other types of mutations.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT ... -3’ (parsed from `ATGTTCTAAGCT...`)\n*   **mRNA:** 5’-AUG UUC UAA GCU ... -3’\n*   **Amino Acids:** Met - Phe - **STOP**\n*   **Effect:** The third codon, CTC (Leucine), has been changed to TAA, which is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. The synthesis of the protein will terminate prematurely after only two amino acids. The resulting polypeptide will be extremely short and certainly non-functional. This is a very effective way to knock out a gene's function.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT **GTC** ACT TCT ... -3’ (parsed from `ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCT...`)\n*   **Effect:** Comparing this to the intact sequence (`...GCT GGT ACT...`), a new codon, GTC, has been inserted between GGT and ACT. This is an **in-frame insertion** of one codon (GTC codes for Valine). The resulting protein will have one extra amino acid but the rest of the reading frame is intact. This may or may not inactivate the protein, but it's less disruptive than a premature stop codon.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT ... -3’ (parsed from `ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCT...`)\n*   **Effect:** Comparing this to the intact sequence (`...GCT GGT ACT...`), the codon GGT has been removed. This is an **in-frame deletion** of one codon. The resulting protein will be missing one amino acid (Glycine), but the rest of the reading frame will be correct. Similar to Mutant 3, this might not completely inactivate the protein.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mutation in **Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon very early in the gene (the third codon). This will lead to the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein. Therefore, this mutation is the most probable one to successfully eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
