    "Here is a step-by-step determination of the pH of the final solution.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of each species.**\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Moles = Volume × Molarity\n    *   Moles = 0.500 L × 0.1 M = 0.050 mol CH3COOH\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely (HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻).\n    *   Moles = 0.400 L × 0.2 M = 0.080 mol H⁺\n\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n    *   Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, so it dissociates completely (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻). Note that each mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces two moles of OH⁻.\n    *   Moles = 0.300 L × 0.3 M × 2 = 0.180 mol OH⁻\n\n**Step 2: Perform the neutralization reactions.**\n\nAcids will react with bases. It's simplest to react the strong acid and strong base first, and then react any excess with the weak species.\n\n1.  **Reaction between strong acid (H⁺) and strong base (OH⁻):**\n    *   Initial moles H⁺ = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles OH⁻ = 0.180 mol\n    *   The H⁺ is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n2.  **Reaction between remaining strong base (OH⁻) and weak acid (CH3COOH):**\n    *   Now, the remaining 0.100 mol of OH⁻ will react with the 0.050 mol of CH3COOH.\n    *   CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n    *   Initial moles CH₃COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   Initial moles OH⁻ = 0.100 mol\n    *   The CH₃COOH is the limiting reactant in this step.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n    *   All the weak acid is consumed, and 0.050 mol of its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻) is formed.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the composition of the final solution.**\n\nAfter all reactions, the solution contains:\n*   Excess strong base (OH⁻): 0.050 mol\n*   Conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻): 0.050 mol\n*   The pH of the solution will be dominated by the concentration of the strong base (OH⁻), as the contribution from the hydrolysis of the weak conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻) is negligible in comparison.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final concentration and pH.**\n\n*   **Total Volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n\n*   **Concentration of excess OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   pH + pOH = 14\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<B>>>"
