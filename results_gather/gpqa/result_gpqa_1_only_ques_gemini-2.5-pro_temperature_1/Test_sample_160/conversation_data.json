    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n1.  **Define Mean Free Path (MFP):** The mean free path is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{n\\sigma}$, where `n` is the number density of target particles and `σ` is the collision cross-section.\n\n2.  **Analyze λ1 (MFP of gas-gas collisions):**\n    *   This is the mean free path of gas molecules colliding with each other.\n    *   In the kinetic theory of gases, since both the projectile and target molecules are moving, the formula is modified to account for their relative motion.\n    *   The formula is $\\lambda_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}n\\sigma_1}$, where `n` is the number density of the gas molecules and $\\sigma_1$ is the kinetic cross-section for a collision between two gas molecules. This cross-section is related to the physical size of the molecules.\n\n3.  **Analyze λ2 (MFP of electron-gas collisions):**\n    *   This is the mean free path of high-energy electrons from the beam colliding with the residual gas molecules.\n    *   The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, meaning they travel at near-relativistic speeds, much faster than the thermal velocity of the gas molecules. Therefore, we can consider the gas molecules to be stationary targets.\n    *   The formula for the electron's MFP is $\\lambda_2 = \\frac{1}{n\\sigma_2}$, where `n` is the same number density of gas molecules, and $\\sigma_2$ is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron with a gas molecule.\n\n4.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ1 vs. σ2):**\n    *   **σ1 (Gas-Gas):** This represents a \"hard-sphere\" type collision, where the cross-section is determined by the physical radii of the molecules ($\\sigma_1 \\approx \\pi d^2$, where d is the molecular diameter).\n    *   **σ2 (Electron-Gas):** This is not a simple physical collision. It is an electromagnetic interaction (Coulomb scattering). A 1000 kV electron is extremely energetic and highly penetrating. It can pass very close to or even through a gas molecule's electron cloud without being significantly deflected. A \"collision\" in this context means a scattering event of a certain magnitude. The probability of such an event is much lower than the probability of two gas molecules colliding.\n    *   Therefore, the effective scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron is significantly smaller than the kinetic cross-section for two gas molecules: $\\sigma_2 \\ll \\sigma_1$.\n\n5.  **Compare λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   We have $\\lambda_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}n\\sigma_1}$ and $\\lambda_2 = \\frac{1}{n\\sigma_2}$.\n    *   Since the collision cross-section for the electron ($\\sigma_2$) is much smaller than for the gas molecule ($\\sigma_1$), the denominator for $\\lambda_2$ ($n\\sigma_2$) is much smaller than the denominator for $\\lambda_1$ ($\\sqrt{2}n\\sigma_1$).\n    *   A smaller denominator results in a larger value. Therefore, the mean free path for the electron is much longer than the mean free path for the gas molecule.\n    *   Mathematically, let's look at the ratio:\n        $\\frac{\\lambda_2}{\\lambda_1} = \\frac{1/(n\\sigma_2)}{1/(\\sqrt{2}n\\sigma_1)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\sigma_1}{\\sigma_2}$\n    *   Since $\\sigma_1 \\gg \\sigma_2$, the ratio $\\frac{\\sigma_1}{\\sigma_2}$ is a number much greater than 1.\n    *   This means $\\frac{\\lambda_2}{\\lambda_1} \\gg \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414$.\n    *   So, we can definitively conclude that $\\lambda_2$ is significantly larger than $\\lambda_1$.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect.\n    *   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. The ratio $\\lambda_2/\\lambda_1$ should be greater than 1.414.\n    *   C) λ2 = λ1: Incorrect. The collision physics is completely different.\n    *   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: Correct. This aligns with our finding that $\\lambda_2$ is significantly larger than $\\lambda_1$ (specifically, $\\lambda_2 > 1.414 \\lambda_1$).\n\n<<<D>>>"
