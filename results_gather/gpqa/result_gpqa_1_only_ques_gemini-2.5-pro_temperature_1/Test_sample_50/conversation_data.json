    "This problem can be solved using the method of images. The electric field and potential outside the grounded conducting sphere, due to the charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere, are identical to the field and potential produced by the original charge `q` and an \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The grounded sphere itself is removed in this model.\n\n**1. Finding the Image Charge and its Position**\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent image system consists of:\n*   The original charge `q` at distance `d` from the center.\n*   An image charge `q'` located at a distance `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center and `q`.\n\nThe values of `q'` and `b` are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the original sphere (a sphere of radius `R`) is zero. The standard results for this configuration are:\n*   Position of the image charge: `b = R^2 / d`\n*   Magnitude of the image charge: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n\nThe image charge `q'` is located inside the sphere (since `d > R`, then `b < R`), and it has the opposite sign to `q`.\n\n**2. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the sphere. As we bring `q` towards the sphere, the induced charge (and thus the image charge) changes. This can be handled in two main ways:\n\n**Method A: Integrating the Force**\n\nThe force on the charge `q` is due to the attraction from the sphere, which in our image model is the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n*   Force between `q` and `q'`: `F = k * q * q' / (distance)^2`\n*   The distance between `q` (at `d`) and `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n*   `F = k * q * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)^2 = - (k * q^2 * R / d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)^2 = - k * q^2 * R * d / (d^2 - R^2)^2`\nThis is the force at the final position `d`. To find the energy, we must integrate the force `F(x)` as the charge moves from infinity to `d`.\n`U = ∫_∞^d F_ext ⋅ dx = -∫_∞^d F_electric ⋅ dx`\n`U = -∫_∞^d [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx = k * q^2 * R * ∫_∞^d [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\nUsing substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, `du = 2x dx`:\n`U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) ∫_∞^{d^2-R^2} u^{-2} du = (k * q^2 * R / 2) [-u^{-1}]_∞^{d^2-R^2}`\n`U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) [-1/(d^2-R^2) - (-1/∞)] = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Method B: Using the Potential Energy Formula**\n\nA more direct method uses the formula for the energy of assembling a charge distribution: `U = (1/2) ∫ ρV dτ`. For a point charge `q` and a grounded conductor, this simplifies to:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\nwhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n*   This potential `V_induced` is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n*   `V_induced = V_image(at d) = k * q' / (distance from q' to q)`\n*   Distance from `q'` to `q` is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n*   `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d) = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\nNow, substitute this back into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The potential energy is negative, which is expected as the charge `q` is attracted to the grounded sphere.\n\n**3. Comparing with the Options**\n\nThe calculated potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\nLet's check the given options:\nA) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect (has R²)\nB) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect (missing 1/2, has d instead of R)\nC) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) - **Correct**\nD) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) - Incorrect (wrong numerator and denominator sign)\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
