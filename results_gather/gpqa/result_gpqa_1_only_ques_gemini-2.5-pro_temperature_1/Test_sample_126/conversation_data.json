    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the product formed when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:**\n    The starting molecule is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene.\n    *   **Parent chain:** \"nona\" indicates a 9-carbon chain.\n    *   **Functional groups:** \"-diene\" indicates two double bonds, located at positions 2 and 6 (\"-2,6-diene\").\n    *   **Substituent:** A \"butyl\" group is attached at position 5.\n\n    Let's draw the structure of the starting material:\n    ```\n          CH2CH2CH2CH3 (Butyl group)\n          |\n    CH3-CH=CH-CH2-C-CH=CH-CH2-CH3\n    1   2  3   4   5  6   7   8   9\n    ```\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction Type:**\n    The starting material is a 1,5-diene (if you count the atoms from C2 to C7: `C2=C3-C4-C5-C6=C7`). When a 1,5-diene is heated, it undergoes a pericyclic reaction called the **Cope rearrangement**. This is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement.\n\n3.  **Apply the Cope Rearrangement Mechanism:**\n    In a Cope rearrangement of a `C(1)=C(2)-C(3)-C(4)-C(5)=C(6)` system, the following changes occur:\n    *   The sigma bond between C(3) and C(4) breaks.\n    *   A new sigma bond forms between C(1) and C(6).\n    *   The pi bond between C(1) and C(2) moves to C(2) and C(3).\n    *   The pi bond between C(5) and C(6) moves to C(4) and C(5).\n\n    In our molecule, 5-butylnona-2,6-diene, the 1,5-diene system corresponds to the atoms from C2 to C7:\n    `C2=C3-C4-C5-C6=C7`\n\n    Applying the rearrangement rules:\n    *   The sigma bond between **C4 and C5** breaks.\n    *   A new sigma bond forms between **C2 and C7**.\n    *   The double bond `C2=C3` moves to become `C3=C4`.\n    *   The double bond `C6=C7` moves to become `C5=C6`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure of the Product:**\n    Let's trace the connectivity of the atoms in the product.\n    *   A new single bond connects C2 and C7.\n    *   A new double bond is between C3 and C4.\n    *   A new double bond is between C5 and C6.\n    *   The substituents remain on their respective carbons: C1 (methyl) is on C2, the butyl group is on C5, and the C8-C9 chain (ethyl) is on C7.\n\n    We can sketch the resulting molecule's skeleton based on these new connections:\n    ```\n       C1(Me) - C2 - C7 - C8(Et)-C9\n                |    |\n                C3 = C4   C6 = C5 - Butyl\n    ```\n    To name this molecule, we need to draw it out in a more linear fashion and identify the longest carbon chain that contains the maximum number of double bonds.\n    ```\n              CH3\n              |\n    CH2=CH - CH - CH - CH = C - CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3\n    (C4,C3) (C2) (C7) (C6) (C5)  (Butyl group)\n                      |\n                      CH2-CH3\n                      (Ethyl group from C8,C9)\n    ```\n\n5.  **Name the Product using IUPAC Rules:**\n    1.  **Find the longest carbon chain containing both double bonds.**\n        The longest continuous chain starts at C4 (`CH2=`), proceeds through C3, C2, C7, C6, C5, and continues through the four carbons of the butyl group.\n        Chain: `C4-C3-C2-C7-C6-C5-(butyl carbons)`\n        This chain has 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 10 carbons. So, the parent name is **deca-diene**.\n\n    2.  **Number the chain.**\n        We number the chain to give the double bonds the lowest possible locants.\n        *   **Numbering from left to right (starting at C4):**\n            `CH2(1)=CH(2)-CH(3)-CH(4)-CH(5)=C(6)-CH2(7)-CH2(8)-CH2(9)-CH3(10)`\n            The double bonds are at positions 1 and 5. The locant set is (1, 5).\n        *   **Numbering from right to left (starting at the end of the butyl chain):**\n            The double bonds would be at positions 5 and 9. The locant set is (5, 9).\n        Since (1, 5) is lower than (5, 9), we number from left to right. The parent name is **deca-1,5-diene**.\n\n    3.  **Identify and locate the substituents.**\n        Using the left-to-right numbering:\n        *   A **methyl** group (C1 from the original molecule) is on carbon #3 of the new chain (which is C2 of the original molecule).\n        *   An **ethyl** group (C8-C9 from the original molecule) is on carbon #4 of the new chain (which is C7 of the original molecule).\n\n    4.  **Assemble the final name.**\n        Alphabetize the substituents (ethyl before methyl).\n        The full IUPAC name of the product is **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    A) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n    B) 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene\n    C) 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene\n    D) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n\n    Our derived name, 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene, matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
