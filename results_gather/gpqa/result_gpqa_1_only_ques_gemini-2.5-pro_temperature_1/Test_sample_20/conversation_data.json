    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\nTautomerism is a form of isomerism where isomers, called tautomers, can readily interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group) on an sp³-hybridized carbon.\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with two C=C double bonds and two C=O groups at opposite ends.\n    *   Structure:\n        ```\n           O\n          //\n        HC=CH\n       /    \\\n    O=C      C=O\n       \\    /\n        HC=CH\n        ```\n    *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (α-carbons) are part of the C=C double bonds. They are sp²-hybridized and do not have any α-hydrogens.\n    *   While one might consider the formation of hydroquinone (1,4-dihydroxybenzene), this process involves the addition of two hydrogen atoms (a reduction), changing the molecular formula from C₆H₄O₂ to C₆H₆O₂. Since tautomers must be isomers, they must have the same molecular formula. Therefore, this conversion is a redox reaction, not tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups, separated by CH₂ groups.\n    *   Structure (keto form):\n        ```\n             O=C\n              / \\\n            H₂C CH₂\n             |   |\n           O=C   C=O\n              \\ /\n               CH₂\n        ```\n    *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the CH₂ groups) are sp³-hybridized and each has two α-hydrogens.\n    *   These α-hydrogens can migrate to the oxygen of the carbonyl groups, leading to the formation of an enol. This molecule can undergo tautomerization to form 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic and highly stable compound.\n    *   Both the keto form (Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) and the enol form (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene) have the same molecular formula (C₆H₆O₃).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.\n\nFrom this analysis, the compound that does **not** show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of a chiral molecule is a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Methyl lactate):**\n    *   Structure:\n        ```\n              OH\n              |\n        CH₃ - C* - C(=O)OCH₃\n              |\n              H\n        ```\n    *   The central carbon atom (marked with *) is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   Since it has a chiral center and lacks a plane of symmetry, the molecule is chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   This is the trans-isomer of an alkene with ester groups.\n    *   Structure:\n        ```\n          CH₃OOC       H\n                \\     /\n                 C = C\n                /     \\\n               H       COOCH₃\n        ```\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers. It is planar around the C=C double bond and possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) as well as a center of inversion. Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism.\n\nFrom this analysis, the compound that **will** show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
