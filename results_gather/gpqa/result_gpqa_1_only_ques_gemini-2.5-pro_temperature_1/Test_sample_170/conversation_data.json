    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents.**\nFirst, we need to classify each substituent on the benzene ring as either an *ortho,para-director* or a *meta-director*. This classification determines the primary positions where the incoming bromine electrophile will attach.\n\n*   **Ortho,para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They are typically activating groups (electron-donating) or halogens.\n    *   1) -CH3 (methyl): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   5) -C2H5 (ethyl): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   3) -Cl (chloro): Deactivating, but o,p-director.\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They are deactivating groups (electron-withdrawing).\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (ethyl ester): Deactivating, m-director.\n    *   4) -NO2 (nitro): Strongly deactivating, m-director.\n    *   6) -COOH (carboxylic acid): Deactivating, m-director.\n\n**Step 2: Compare the two main groups.**\nSubstances with meta-directing groups will produce the meta-isomer as the major product, with very small amounts of ortho and para isomers. Substances with ortho,para-directing groups will produce ortho and para isomers as the major products.\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be much lower for the meta-directing group than for the ortho,para-directing group.\nThis means substances 2, 4, and 6 will come before substances 1, 3, and 5 in the final ranking.\n\n**Step 3: Order the meta-directors (lowest para yield).**\nWe need to arrange substances 2, 4, and 6 in order of increasing para-isomer yield. The yield of the para-isomer will be lowest for the substituent that is the strongest deactivating/meta-directing group.\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n*   -NO2 (4) is the strongest deactivator, so it will direct most strongly to the meta position, resulting in the lowest yield of the para-isomer.\n*   -COOH (6) is a weaker deactivator than -NO2 but generally considered stronger than an ester group.\n*   -COOC2H5 (2) is the weakest deactivator among these three.\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: 4 < 6 < 2.\n\n**Step 4: Order the ortho,para-directors (highest para yield).**\nWe need to arrange substances 1, 3, and 5 in order of increasing para-isomer yield. For these groups, both ortho and para products are formed. The proportion of the para-isomer depends on steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n*   **-CH3 (1) vs. -C2H5 (5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size hinders the attack at the ortho positions more significantly, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer for ethylbenzene compared to toluene. So, the para yield for 1 is less than for 5 (1 < 5).\n*   **-Cl (3) vs. alkyl groups (1, 5):** The chloro group is a special case. Although it is a deactivating group, it is ortho,para-directing. Its strong inductive electron-withdrawing effect (-I effect) disfavors the adjacent ortho position more than the distant para position. This electronic effect, combined with its own steric bulk, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer is often the overwhelming product in the electrophilic halogenation of halobenzenes. For bromination, the para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (~89%) is significantly higher than for toluene (~62%) or ethylbenzene (~64%).\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: 1 < 5 < 3.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the rankings.**\nCombining the two groups, we get the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete sequence is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nComparing this sequence with the given options:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nC) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nD) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
