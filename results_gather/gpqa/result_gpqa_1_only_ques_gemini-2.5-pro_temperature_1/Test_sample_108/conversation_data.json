    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n**1. Analyze the Initial State**\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n*   The term symbol is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1` => Total initial spin `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L` is `S` => Initial orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J` is `0` => Total initial angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n*   The parity of a two-nucleon system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. So, the initial parity is `P_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n**2. Analyze the Final State**\n\nThe final state consists of a two-nucleon system (NN_f) and an emitted particle X.\n*   **Particle X:**\n    *   Intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n    *   Its orbital angular momentum relative to the NN system is `L_X`. The letter `s, p, d, f` corresponds to `L_X = 0, 1, 2, 3`, respectively.\n    *   The parity contribution from its orbital motion is `(-1)^L_X`.\n    *   We assume particle X has spin `S_X = 0` (like a pion), as is common for such problems unless specified otherwise.\n*   **Final NN state (NN_f):**\n    *   Described by `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`.\n    *   The parity of this state is `P_NN_f = (-1)^L_f`.\n*   **Total Final State:**\n    *   The total parity is `P_f = P_NN_f * P_X * (-1)^L_X = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^L_X = -(-1)^(L_f + L_X)`.\n    *   The total final angular momentum `J_f_total` is the vector sum of the angular momenta of the components: `J_f_total = J_f + L_X` (vector sum, since `S_X=0`).\n\n**3. Apply Conservation Laws and Given Rules**\n\nWe must check each potential reaction against three conditions:\n*   **Condition 1: Parity Conservation:** `P_i = P_f`\n    *   `+1 = -(-1)^(L_f + L_X)`\n    *   This simplifies to `(-1)^(L_f + L_X) = -1`, which means `L_f + L_X` must be an **odd** number.\n*   **Condition 2: Angular Momentum Conservation:** `J_i = J_f_total`\n    *   `0 = J_f + L_X` (vector sum).\n    *   For the vector sum to be zero, the magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = L_X`.\n*   **Condition 3: Pauli Statistics for the final NN state:**\n    *   The problem states `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   We are given that the final state has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n    *   Substituting `T_f = 0`: `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This implies that `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number, which means `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n\nNow we check each option against these three conditions. A reaction is not permitted if it violates any of these conditions.\n\n---\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `L_X=1`.\n*   Condition 1 (Parity): `L_f + L_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Condition 2 (Ang. Mom.): `J_f = 1`, `L_X = 1`. `J_f = L_X`. **OK.**\n*   Condition 3 (Pauli): `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   **Verdict: Permitted.**\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `L_X=1`.\n*   Condition 1 (Parity): `L_f + L_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Condition 2 (Ang. Mom.): `J_f = 1`, `L_X = 1`. `J_f = L_X`. **OK.**\n*   Condition 3 (Pauli): `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n*   **Verdict: Permitted** (based on the given rules, even though S=3 is not possible for two nucleons, we proceed by strictly applying the rules as instructed).\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f` wave): `L_X=3`.\n*   Condition 1 (Parity): `L_f + L_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Condition 2 (Ang. Mom.): `J_f = 3`, `L_X = 3`. `J_f = L_X`. **OK.**\n*   Condition 3 (Pauli): `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n*   **Verdict: Permitted.**\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s` wave): `L_X=0`.\n*   Condition 1 (Parity): `L_f + L_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Condition 2 (Ang. Mom.): `J_f = 0`, `L_X = 0`. `J_f = L_X`. **OK.**\n*   Condition 3 (Pauli): `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the condition that `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n*   **Verdict: Not Permitted.**\n\nThe reaction `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is forbidden because it violates the Pauli statistics condition given for the final T=0 two-nucleon state.\n\n<<<D>>>"
