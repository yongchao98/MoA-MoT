    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Gas W:** The gas W, released during a violent reaction, has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine some simple gas molecules:\n    *   H₂ (Hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (p≠n)\n    *   HD (Hydrogen deuteride): 2 protons, 1 neutron. (p≠n)\n    *   D₂ (Deuterium gas, ²H₂): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (p=n). This is a strong candidate, as deuterium is a \"heavier isotope\".\n    *   CO (Carbon monoxide, with ¹²C and ¹⁶O): 6p+8p = 14 protons; 6n+8n = 14 neutrons. (p=n). This is a possibility.\n    *   N₂ (Nitrogen gas, with ¹⁴N): 7p+7p = 14 protons; 7n+7n = 14 neutrons. (p=n). This is a possibility.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance B:** A precipitate G is formed, which upon heating releases substance B. The melting point of B is ~277 K (3.85 °C). This is the melting point of heavy water, D₂O (3.82 °C). The melting point of normal water, H₂O, is 273.15 K (0 °C). This strongly indicates that B is D₂O.\n\n3.  **Connect the Clues:** Since D₂O (B) is released from G, and D₂ (W) is a likely gas product, it's highly probable that we are dealing with a system involving deuterium. For the reaction to produce D₂ gas (W) and form a product G that contains deuterium (since it releases D₂O), both substance X and liquid Y must be sources of deuterium.\n    *   Let's hypothesize a reaction. A common violent reaction that produces hydrogen gas is the reaction of a metal hydride with water.\n    *   Let's assume X is a deuteride (containing a heavy isotope of hydrogen, D) and Y is heavy water (D₂O).\n    *   Let's test a powerful reducing agent, Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄), as Substance X. Its non-deuterated analog, LiAlH₄, is famous in organic chemistry.\n    *   Reaction: LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n    *   Let's check if this fits the clues:\n        *   **Substance X (LiAlD₄):** Contains a heavier isotope (D). Check.\n        *   **Liquid Y (D₂O):** A liquid. Check.\n        *   **Reaction:** The reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is notoriously violent. The reaction of LiAlD₄ with D₂O would be similarly violent. Check.\n        *   **Gas W (D₂):** As established, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (p=n). Check.\n        *   **Precipitate G (Al(OD)₃):** Aluminium hydroxide is a gelatinous precipitate. Al(OD)₃ would be as well. Check.\n        *   **Heating G:** Heating aluminium hydroxide causes dehydration. Similarly, heating G (Al(OD)₃) would yield aluminium oxide and heavy water: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B). Check.\n        *   **Melting point of B (D₂O):** ~277 K. Check.\n\n4.  **Confirm with the Final Clues:**\n    *   **Reaction with a keto acid:** A keto acid contains a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). LiAlH₄ (and therefore LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent that reduces both functional groups to alcohols (-OH). The resulting molecule would be a diol, which contains two oxygen atoms. This perfectly matches the clue.\n    *   **Reagent in organic chemistry:** LiAlH₄ is a staple reducing agent in organic synthesis. Its deuterated analog, LiAlD₄ (Substance X), is used for isotopic labeling in mechanistic studies. This confirms our identification.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:**\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present in the compound are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminium (atomic number 13).\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the formula. We use the specific isotopic masses.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Al):** There is one atom of Aluminium. The stable isotope is ²⁷Al. Its mass is 27 amu.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (H):** There are four atoms of Hydrogen, all of which are the heavy isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass of one deuterium atom is 2 amu. The total mass is 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative mass:** (Mass from Al) + (Mass from H) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThe calculated cumulative mass is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>"
