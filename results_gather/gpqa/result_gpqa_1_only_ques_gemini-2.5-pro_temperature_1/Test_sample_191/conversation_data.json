    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the electric field at point P.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Charge Distribution:**\n    *   We start with an uncharged (electrically neutral) spherical conductor.\n    *   A positive point charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity.\n    *   This charge $+q$ will attract free electrons within the conductor. These electrons will accumulate on the inner surface of the conductor, which is the wall of the cavity.\n    *   To find the total induced charge on the inner surface, we can apply Gauss's Law. Imagine a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity. The electric field everywhere inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is zero. Therefore, the electric flux through this Gaussian surface is zero.\n    *   According to Gauss's Law, the total charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface must be zero. The enclosed charge is the sum of the point charge $+q$ and the induced charge on the inner surface ($Q_{inner}$).\n    *   $Q_{enclosed} = +q + Q_{inner} = 0$\n    *   This implies that the total induced charge on the inner surface of the cavity is $Q_{inner} = -q$. This charge $-q$ will distribute itself non-uniformly on the cavity wall to cancel the field of the $+q$ charge within the conductor.\n\n2.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:**\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged, so its net charge is zero.\n    *   The total charge of the conductor is the sum of the charge on its inner surface and the charge on its outer surface ($Q_{outer}$).\n    *   Total Charge = $Q_{inner} + Q_{outer} = 0$\n    *   Substituting $Q_{inner} = -q$, we get:\n    *   $-q + Q_{outer} = 0 \\implies Q_{outer} = +q$.\n    *   So, a charge of $+q$ is induced on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage Effect):**\n    *   A key principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges placed inside it.\n    *   The induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface arranges itself in such a way that the combined electric field of the point charge $+q$ and the inner surface charge $-q$ is exactly zero everywhere outside the cavity.\n    *   Therefore, for any point P outside the conductor, the electric field contribution from the charge inside the cavity ($+q$) and the charge on the inner wall ($-q$) is zero.\n\n4.  **Electric Field at Point P:**\n    *   The electric field at point P is the superposition of the fields from all charges. As established above, the net field from the charges inside the conductor (the original $+q$ and the induced $-q$) is zero at point P.\n    *   Thus, the electric field at point P is due solely to the charge $+q$ residing on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n5.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:**\n    *   The charge $+q$ on the outer surface is not influenced by the charges inside the cavity (due to shielding). There are no other external electric fields mentioned in the problem.\n    *   Therefore, the charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the spherical outer surface of radius $R$ to minimize electrostatic repulsion.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field:**\n    *   According to the shell theorem (a consequence of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the electric field of a point charge of the same total charge located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   In our case, we have a total charge of $+q$ uniformly distributed on a sphere of radius $R$ centered at the conductor's center.\n    *   The point P is at a distance $L$ from the center of this sphere.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's Law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{|Q_{outer}|}{L^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion on Variables:**\n    The parameters related to the cavity's geometry ($r, s$) and the relative position of P with respect to the cavity ($l, \\theta$) are irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor due to the shielding effect. They are distractor variables. The only relevant parameters are the total charge enclosed ($q$) and the distance from the center of the conductor ($L$).\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n\nOur derived expression matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
