    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided options to determine the correct sequence of reagents for the synthesis.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material and Target Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This is a cyclohexane ring attached to an acetylene group (-C≡CH). It has an acidic proton on the terminal alkyne carbon.\n     ![Ethynylcyclohexane](https://www.chem.ucla.edu/~harding/IGOC/E/ethynylcyclohexane01.png) \n*   **Target Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n    *   Let's break down the IUPAC name:\n        *   The parent structure is `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`. This is a cyclohexane ring with a -CHO group attached. The ring carbon bearing the -CHO group is numbered C1.\n        *   A substituent is located at position `1-`. This means there is another group on C1.\n        *   The substituent is `(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)`. This is a methyl group (-CH3) where one hydrogen is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH) and another hydrogen is replaced by a cyclohexyl group. The substituent is -CH(OH)(Cyclohexyl).\n    *   Therefore, the structure is a cyclohexane ring where C1 is a quaternary carbon, bonded to:\n        1.  The rest of the cyclohexane ring (C2 and C6).\n        2.  A carbaldehyde group (-CHO).\n        3.  A (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group [-CH(OH)(C6H11)].\n    *   This is an α-hydroxy aldehyde where the α-carbon is part of a cyclohexane ring.\n\nThis target structure is quite complex and involves two cyclohexyl rings. The starting material has only one. This suggests that at some point in the synthesis, a second cyclohexyl unit must be introduced, or a dimerization must occur.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Reaction Sequence**\n\nLet's examine each option to see if it provides a chemically sound pathway from the starting material to a product, and whether that product could be the target.\n\n**A) 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH**\n*   **Step 1:** NaNH2 is a strong base that deprotonates the terminal alkyne. However, methanol (CH3OH) is a protic solvent that would immediately protonate the resulting acetylide anion, regenerating the starting material. This step is ineffective and makes the entire sequence non-viable.\n\n**B) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**\n*   **Step 1:** NaNH2 deprotonates ethynylcyclohexane to form the nucleophilic acetylide. Methyl chloride is an electrophile, leading to 1-cyclohexylpropyne.\n*   **Step 2:** H2/Pd is a catalyst for hydrogenation. It will reduce the alkyne all the way to an alkane, yielding propylcyclohexane.\n*   **Step 4:** The reagents H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O are used for the hydration of alkynes. However, the alkyne was already reduced to an alkane in step 2. These reagents will have no reaction with an alkane. The sequence of reactions is illogical.\n\n**C) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2**\n*   **Step 1:** Ethynylcyclohexane is converted to 1-cyclohexylpropyne (Cy-C≡C-CH3), as in option B.\n*   **Step 2:** H2/Pd-calcium carbonate is Lindlar's catalyst. It reduces the alkyne to a *cis*-alkene, yielding (Z)-1-cyclohexylprop-1-ene (cis-Cy-CH=CH-CH3).\n*   **Step 3:** O3/(CH3)2S performs reductive ozonolysis, cleaving the double bond. This reaction will produce two aldehyde molecules: cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (Cy-CHO) and acetaldehyde (CH3CHO).\n*   **Step 4:** Ba(OH)2 is a base that will catalyze an aldol condensation between the two aldehydes produced. This will result in a mixture of β-hydroxy aldehydes.\n\nThis sequence is chemically sound and logical. Each step effectively transforms the product of the previous step. The final products are hydroxy-aldehydes. Although the specific aldol products do not match the complex structure derived from the IUPAC name (which suggests the question may contain an error in the product name), this is the only option that presents a valid synthetic route to a product of the correct class (a hydroxy-aldehyde). The other options are chemically flawed.\n\n**D) 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ H2O; 4. NH4OH**\n*   **Step 1:** Similar to C, but uses ethyl chloride. Product is 1-cyclohexylbut-1-yne (Cy-C≡C-CH2CH3).\n*   **Step 2:** Li/liq. NH3 reduces the alkyne to a *trans*-alkene, giving (E)-1-cyclohexylbut-1-ene.\n*   **Step 3:** O3/H2O performs oxidative ozonolysis. This cleaves the double bond and oxidizes the resulting aldehyde fragments to carboxylic acids. The products would be cyclohexanecarboxylic acid (Cy-COOH) and propanoic acid (CH3CH2COOH).\n*   **Step 4:** NH4OH is a weak base that would neutralize the carboxylic acids to form their ammonium salts.\nThis sequence is also chemically sound, but it produces carboxylate salts, not a hydroxy-aldehyde as required by the target product's name.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the options:\n*   A and B contain illogical or self-defeating steps.\n*   D is a valid sequence but produces carboxylate salts.\n*   C is a valid sequence that produces hydroxy-aldehydes.\n\nThe target product is a hydroxy-aldehyde. Therefore, sequence C is the only one that leads to the correct class of compound. Despite the likely discrepancy between the exact structure of the aldol product and the provided IUPAC name, Option C represents the correct and intended chemical pathway.\n\n<<<C>>>"
