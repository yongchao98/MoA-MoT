    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n1.  **Luminosity Formula:**\n    The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L = A \\cdot \\sigma \\cdot T^4$\n    Where A is the surface area ($4\\pi R^2$), R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    The formula can be written as:\n    $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n\n2.  **Ratio of Luminosities:**\n    We need to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 ($L_1$) to that of Star_2 ($L_2$):\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4)$\n    Simplifying, we get:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\cdot (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n3.  **Ratio of Radii:**\n    The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 ($R_1 = 1.5 \\cdot R_2$).\n    So, the ratio of the radii squared is:\n    $(R_1/R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$\n\n4.  **Ratio of Temperatures:**\n    To find the temperature ratio, we use the information about the peak emission wavelength. Wien's Displacement Law relates a star's temperature to its *emitted* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{emit}$):\n    $T = b / \\lambda_{emit}$ (where b is Wien's constant)\n    Therefore, the ratio of temperatures is inversely proportional to the ratio of their emitted peak wavelengths:\n    $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{emit,2} / \\lambda_{emit,1}$\n\n5.  **Relating Emitted and Observed Wavelengths:**\n    The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{obs}$) are the same for both stars. The observed wavelength is affected by the Doppler effect due to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$):\n    $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emit} (1 + v_r/c)$\n    where c is the speed of light (~$3 \\times 10^5$ km/s).\n\n    For Star_1: $v_{r1} = 0$ km/s. So, $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{emit,1}(1+0) = \\lambda_{emit,1}$.\n    For Star_2: $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s. So, $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{emit,2}(1 + 700/c)$.\n\n    Since $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we have:\n    $\\lambda_{emit,1} = \\lambda_{emit,2}(1 + 700/c)$\n\n6.  **Calculating the Temperature Ratio:**\n    From the relationship above, we can find the ratio of emitted wavelengths:\n    $\\lambda_{emit,2} / \\lambda_{emit,1} = 1 / (1 + 700/c)$\n    Since $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{emit,2} / \\lambda_{emit,1}$, we have:\n    $T_1/T_2 = 1 / (1 + 700/c)$\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Now we substitute the ratios for radius and temperature back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (2.25) \\cdot [1 / (1 + 700/c)]^4$\n    Let's plug in the value for c ($3 \\times 10^5$ km/s):\n    $v_{r2}/c = 700 / 300000 = 7/3000 \\approx 0.002333$\n    $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / (1 + 7/3000)^4$\n    $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / (1.002333...)^4$\n    $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / 1.009355$\n    $L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.229$\n\n    This value is closest to 2.23. The information about the mass of the stars is not needed for this calculation and is considered extraneous.\n\n<<<A>>>"
