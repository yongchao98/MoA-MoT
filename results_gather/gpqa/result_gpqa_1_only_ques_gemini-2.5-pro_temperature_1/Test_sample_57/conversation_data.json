    "Let's break down the options:\n\n**Regularization at high energies** (also known as Ultraviolet or UV regularization) is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with infinite results that arise from calculations involving interactions at very short distances (or equivalently, very high energies/momenta). These infinities typically come from loop diagrams in Feynman calculus.\n\n*   **A) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the quantum theory of electromagnetism. When calculating physical quantities like the self-energy of an electron, loop diagrams lead to divergent integrals that go to infinity. QED absolutely requires regularization and the subsequent process of renormalization to make finite, physical predictions.\n\n*   **C) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** This is the quantum theory of the strong force. Like QED, it is a quantum field theory and suffers from the same kind of high-energy divergences in its loop calculations. It also requires regularization and renormalization.\n\n*   **D) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory is not quantum. However, it has its own famous infinity problem: the self-energy of a point-like electron. Calculating the energy stored in the electric field of a point charge yields an infinite result. This short-distance problem often requires an ad-hoc fix, which can be considered a form of regularization (for example, by assuming the electron has a small but finite radius). So, even this classical theory has a high-energy/short-distance pathology that requires a fix.\n\n*   **B) Superstring Theory:** A primary motivation for superstring theory is that it is a candidate for a \"UV-complete\" theory of quantum gravity. In string theory, fundamental particles are not point-like but are instead tiny, vibrating strings. This extended nature of strings \"smears out\" interactions at very short distances. This smearing effect naturally tames the high-energy behavior of loop diagrams, preventing the infinities that plague standard quantum field theories. For this reason, superstring theory is believed to be UV-finite and does not require the artificial procedure of regularization.\n\nTherefore, Superstring Theory is the one theory on the list that is thought to be free from high-energy divergences and thus never requires regularization.\n\n<<<B>>>"
