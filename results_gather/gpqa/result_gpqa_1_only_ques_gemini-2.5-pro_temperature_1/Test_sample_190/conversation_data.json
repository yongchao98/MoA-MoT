    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\n*   This is a six-membered ring (cyclohexane) with a ketone (C=O) at position 1.\n*   At position 3, there is a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH).\n*   At position 5, there is an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2).\n\n**Step 1: Reaction with NaH, then Benzyl Bromide**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (PhCH2Br or BnBr).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. NaH is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton. The proton of the hydroxyl group (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20).\n    1.  The NaH deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide: R-CH2OH + NaH → R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  The resulting alkoxide is a good nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This protects the alcohol as a benzyl ether.\n*   **Product 1:** The ketone and the isopropenyl group remain unchanged. The hydroxymethyl group becomes a (benzyloxy)methyl group (-CH2OBn).\n    The structure of Product 1 is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and a catalytic amount of acid (HCl).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the formation of a tosylhydrazone. The ketone carbonyl group reacts with the primary amine of the tosylhydrazide in an acid-catalyzed condensation reaction, eliminating a molecule of water.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group (C=O) at position 1 is converted to a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NHTs).\n    The structure of Product 2 is the **tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) quench.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi).\n    1.  The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the acidic N-H proton of the hydrazone.\n    2.  The second equivalent deprotonates a carbon atom α to the C=N bond.\n    3.  The resulting dianion is unstable and collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group (as p-toluenesulfinate) to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    4.  The aqueous NH4Cl workup protonates the vinyllithium species.\n*   **Overall transformation:** The ketone is replaced by a carbon-carbon double bond. The double bond forms between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and one of the adjacent α-carbons (C2 or C6).\n*   **Product 3:** The resulting molecule is a cyclohexene derivative. It has a double bond in the ring, the (benzyloxy)methyl group, and the isopropenyl group.\n    The structure of Product 3 is **5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene** (or an isomeric cyclohexene, which leads to the same final product).\n\n**Step 4: Reaction with Pd/C and H₂**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This set of reagents is very effective at reducing multiple types of functional groups.\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of alkenes:** Both the C=C double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the C=C double bond in the isopropenyl group will be reduced to single bonds.\n        *   Cyclohexene → Cyclohexane\n        *   Isopropenyl group [-C(CH3)=CH2] → Isopropyl group [-CH(CH3)₂]\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of benzyl ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group will be cleaved by hydrogenolysis. The C-O bond between the oxygen and the benzylic carbon is broken.\n        *   R-O-CH₂Ph + H₂ → R-OH + Ph-CH₃ (Toluene)\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH). The relative positions of these two groups are 1,3 on the ring. The name for this structure is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Matching with Options:**\n\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. Contains a butyl group and the benzyl ether was not cleaved.\n*   B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone moiety would have been eliminated in the Shapiro reaction.\n*   C) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if only the hydrogenation of the alkenes occurred, but not the hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether. Hydrogenolysis is expected under these conditions.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This structure results from the hydrogenation of both double bonds and the hydrogenolysis (deprotection) of the benzyl ether, which is the expected outcome of the reaction sequence.\n\n<<<D>>>"
