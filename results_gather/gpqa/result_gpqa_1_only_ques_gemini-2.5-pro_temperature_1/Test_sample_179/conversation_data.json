    "An isolated system consists of 13 identical particles. The charge on each particle is `q = 2e`, where `e` is the elementary charge (`e ≈ 1.602177 × 10⁻¹⁹ C`). The mass of the particles is negligible, so we only need to consider the electrostatic potential energy.\n\nThe system is configured as follows:\n*   One particle (let's call it `q_P`) is fixed at a point P. We can set P as the origin of our coordinate system.\n*   The other 12 particles (let's call them `q_i` for `i = 1, ..., 12`) are constrained to be on the surface of a sphere of radius `R = 2 m` centered at P.\n\nWe want to find the minimum possible total potential energy of this system.\n\nThe total potential energy (`U_total`) of a system of point charges is the sum of the potential energies for every unique pair of charges:\n`U = Σ (k * q_i * q_j) / r_ij` for all pairs `(i, j)` with `i < j`.\nHere, `k` is Coulomb's constant (`k ≈ 8.98755 × 10⁹ N·m²/C²`).\n\nWe can split the total energy into two parts:\n1.  **`U_P`**: The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge `q_P` and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n2.  **`U_S`**: The potential energy from the interactions among the 12 charges on the sphere.\n\n`U_total = U_P + U_S`\n\n**Step 1: Calculate `U_P`**\nThe distance between the central charge `q_P` and each of the 12 charges `q_i` on the sphere is fixed at `R = 2 m`. The potential energy for each of these 12 pairs is `k * q_P * q_i / R`. Since all charges are identical (`q_P = q_i = q = 2e`), this becomes `k * q² / R`.\n`U_P = 12 * (k * q² / R)`\nThis part of the energy is constant regardless of how the 12 charges are arranged on the sphere.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the minimum `U_S`**\nThe energy `U_S` is the sum of potential energies for all pairs of charges on the sphere's surface. There are `12 * 11 / 2 = 66` such pairs.\n`U_S = Σ (k * q² / r_ij)` for the 66 pairs on the sphere.\n\nTo minimize the total energy `U_total`, we need to minimize `U_S` (since `U_P` is constant). The problem of finding the arrangement of `N` identical charges on the surface of a sphere that minimizes their electrostatic potential energy is known as the **Thomson problem**.\n\nFor `N=12`, the minimum energy configuration is when the charges are located at the vertices of a regular **icosahedron** inscribed in the sphere.\n\nThe energy `U_S` for this configuration can be written as:\n`U_S = (k * q² / R) * E_12`\nwhere `E_12` is the dimensionless energy constant for the icosahedral configuration. This constant is the sum of the inverse distances (in units of R) for all pairs: `E_12 = Σ (R / r_ij)`. The value of `E_12` has been numerically calculated to high precision and is `E_12 ≈ 49.165`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total minimum energy**\nThe total minimum energy of the system is the sum of the two components:\n`U_total_min = U_P + U_S_min`\n`U_total_min = (12 * k * q² / R) + (E_12 * k * q² / R)`\n`U_total_min = (12 + E_12) * (k * q² / R)`\n`U_total_min = (12 + 49.165) * (k * q² / R)`\n`U_total_min = 61.165 * (k * q² / R)`\n\n**Step 4: Substitute the values and calculate**\n*   `k ≈ 8.98755 × 10⁹ N·m²/C²`\n*   `e ≈ 1.602177 × 10⁻¹⁹ C`\n*   `q = 2e = 2 * 1.602177 × 10⁻¹⁹ C = 3.204354 × 10⁻¹⁹ C`\n*   `R = 2 m`\n\nFirst, let's calculate the term `k * q² / R`:\n`q² = (3.204354 × 10⁻¹⁹ C)² ≈ 1.026788 × 10⁻³⁷ C²`\n`k * q² / R = (8.98755 × 10⁹ N·m²/C² * 1.026788 × 10⁻³⁷ C²) / (2 m)`\n`k * q² / R ≈ (9.22855 × 10⁻²⁸ J·m) / (2 m)`\n`k * q² / R ≈ 4.61428 × 10⁻²⁸ J`\n\nNow, multiply by the coefficient `(12 + E_12)`:\n`U_total_min = 61.165 * (4.61428 × 10⁻²⁸ J)`\n`U_total_min ≈ 282.26 × 10⁻²⁸ J`\n`U_total_min ≈ 2.8226 × 10⁻²⁶ J`\n\nThis value, when rounded to three decimal places for the mantissa, is `2.823 × 10⁻²⁶ J`.\n\n**Step 5: Compare with the given options**\nA) 122.330\nB) 5.645 x 10⁻²⁶\nC) 2.822 x 10⁻²⁶\nD) 7.056 x 10⁻²⁷\n\nOur calculated value `2.8226 × 10⁻²⁶ J` is extremely close to option C, `2.822 × 10⁻²⁶ J`. The minor difference (about 0.02%) is likely due to using slightly different values for the physical constants (`k`, `e`) or the dimensionless energy `E_12`. Given the choices, C is clearly the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
