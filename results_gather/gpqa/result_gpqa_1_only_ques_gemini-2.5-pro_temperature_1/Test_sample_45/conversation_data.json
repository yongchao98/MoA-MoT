    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of possible products.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactant and Reaction:**\n    *   The reactant is **3-methylpent-1-ene**. Its structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   The carbon at position 3 is a chiral center, as it is attached to four different groups: a hydrogen (-H), a methyl group (-CH₃), an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃), and a vinyl group (-CH=CH₂).\n    *   The problem states the reactant is **racemic**, which means it is a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers: (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene.\n    *   The reagent is **Grubbs catalyst**, which catalyzes **olefin metathesis**. Since there is only one type of alkene, this will be a **self-metathesis** reaction.\n\n2.  **Determine the Products of Self-Metathesis:**\n    The self-metathesis of a terminal alkene of the form R-CH=CH₂ is:\n    2 R-CH=CH₂  ⇌  R-CH=CH-R + CH₂=CH₂ (ethene)\n    In this case, the 'R' group is the chiral sec-butyl group: -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃.\n    The main product of the reaction (excluding ethene, as specified in the question) is **3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene**.\n    The structure is: CH₃CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CH₃.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The product molecule, 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene, has two chiral centers at C3 and C6.\n    *   It also has a double bond at C4, which can have either E (trans) or Z (cis) geometry.\n    *   Since the starting material is a racemic mixture of (R)- and (S)-alkenes, three types of coupling reactions can occur:\n        a) (R)-alkene + (R)-alkene\n        b) (S)-alkene + (S)-alkene\n        c) (R)-alkene + (S)-alkene\n\n4.  **Enumerate the Stereoisomers from Each Coupling:**\n\n    *   **a) Coupling of (R)-alkene + (R)-alkene:**\n        This reaction produces (3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. Because the newly formed double bond can be E or Z, two products are formed:\n        1.  (E)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral)\n        2.  (Z)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral)\n        These two products are diastereomers of each other.\n\n    *   **b) Coupling of (S)-alkene + (S)-alkene:**\n        This reaction produces (3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. Again, two stereoisomers are possible due to the double bond geometry:\n        3.  (E)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral)\n        4.  (Z)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral)\n        Product 3 is the enantiomer of product 1. Product 4 is the enantiomer of product 2. These are four distinct chemical compounds.\n\n    *   **c) Coupling of (R)-alkene + (S)-alkene (cross-coupling):**\n        This reaction produces (3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. Let's analyze the stereochemistry of these products:\n        *   The molecule has two chiral centers with opposite configurations (R and S). Because the molecule is symmetric about the central double bond, these are **meso compounds**.\n        *   The E and Z isomers are diastereomers of each other.\n        5.  (E)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (meso, achiral) - This molecule has a center of inversion.\n        6.  (Z)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (meso, achiral) - This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n\n5.  **Count the Total Number of Possible Products:**\n    We have identified six distinct stereoisomers that can be formed from the reaction. Let's list them:\n    1.  (E)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n    2.  (Z)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n    3.  (E)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n    4.  (Z)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n    5.  (E)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n    6.  (Z)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n\n    All six of these molecules are stereoisomers and are unique chemical compounds. Since the question asks for the number of \"possible products\", we count every distinct molecule that can be formed. Therefore, there are 6 possible products.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n*   (R)+(R) coupling gives 2 chiral diastereomers (E/Z).\n*   (S)+(S) coupling gives their 2 enantiomers (E/Z).\n*   (R)+(S) coupling gives 2 meso diastereomers (E/Z).\n*   Total products = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\n<<<C>>>"
