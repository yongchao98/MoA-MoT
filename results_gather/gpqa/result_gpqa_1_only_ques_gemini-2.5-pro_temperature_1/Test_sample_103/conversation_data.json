    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method**\n\nThe RV method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The star wobbles around the common center of mass (barycenter) of the star-planet system. This wobble causes a periodic shift in the star's spectral lines.\n\nThe magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is related to the star's radial velocity (v_r) by the Doppler formula:\nΔλ / λ = v_r / c\nwhere λ is the rest wavelength and c is the speed of light.\n\nThe amplitude of the periodic wavelength shift (Δλ_max), which is what is given in the problem, corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity curve (K, also known as the RV semi-amplitude).\nΔλ_max / λ = K / c\nSince λ and c are constants, the RV amplitude is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift:\nK ∝ Δλ_max\n\n**2. Relate RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P)**\n\nThe formula for the RV semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is:\nK = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin(i)) / (M_s + M_p)^(2/3)\nwhere:\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n*   M_p is the mass of the planet.\n*   M_s is the mass of the star.\n*   i is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n**3. Apply the Given Information**\n\nWe are given that for the two systems:\n*   The star masses are the same: M_s1 = M_s2 = M_s.\n*   The planet masses are the same: M_p1 = M_p2 = M_p.\n*   The problem does not specify the inclinations. For the problem to be solvable, we must assume the inclinations are the same (i₁ = i₂), which is a common assumption in such problems unless stated otherwise.\n\nWith M_s, M_p, and sin(i) being the same for both systems, all terms in the formula for K are constant except for the period, P. Therefore, we can establish a simple proportionality:\nK ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\nThis means that a larger RV amplitude (a faster wobble) corresponds to a shorter orbital period.\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of the Periods**\n\nLet K₁ and P₁ be the RV amplitude and period for planet #1, and K₂ and P₂ be for planet #2. From the proportionality K ∝ P^(-1/3), we can write:\nK₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n\nWe need to solve for the ratio P₂ / P₁. Let's cube both sides of the equation:\n(K₁ / K₂)^3 = P₂ / P₁\n\nNow, we can substitute the values for K, using the fact that K ∝ Δλ_max:\n*   K₁ ∝ Δλ_max_1 = 5 miliangstrom\n*   K₂ ∝ Δλ_max_2 = 7 miliangstrom\n\nSo, the ratio K₁ / K₂ is 5 / 7.\nP₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)^3\nP₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\nP₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.36. This means the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1 (i.e., it is shorter).\n\nComparing our result with the options provided:\nA) ~ 1.40\nB) ~ 0.85\nC) ~ 1.96\nD) ~ 0.36\n\nOur calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
