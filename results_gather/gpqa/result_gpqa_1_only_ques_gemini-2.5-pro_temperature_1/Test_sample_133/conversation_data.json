    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to find the enthalpy of neutralization.\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction**\nThe primary reaction is the neutralization of an acid (H+) with a base (OH-) to form water.\nH+(aq) + OH-(aq) → H2O(l)\n\nThe standard enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and a strong base is approximately **-13.7 kcal/mol** or **-57.1 kJ/mol**. This is the amount of heat released for every mole of water formed.\n\n**2. Calculate the Moles of H+ Ions (from the acids)**\n\n*   **From HCl:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.10 mol\n    *   Since HCl is a strong monoprotic acid (provides 1 H+), moles of H+ from HCl = **0.10 mol**.\n\n*   **From H2SO4:**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of H2SO4 = Molarity × Volume = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.09 mol\n    *   Since H2SO4 is a strong diprotic acid (provides 2 H+), moles of H+ from H2SO4 = 2 × 0.09 mol = **0.18 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles of H+:**\n    *   Total H+ = 0.10 mol + 0.18 mol = **0.28 mol**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Moles of OH- Ions (from the base)**\n\n*   **From Ba(OH)2:**\n    *   Volume = 200 mL = 0.200 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.5 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = Molarity × Volume = 0.5 mol/L × 0.200 L = 0.10 mol\n    *   Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that provides two OH- ions, moles of OH- = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n**4. Identify the Limiting Reactant**\nTo find out how much water is formed, we compare the moles of H+ and OH-. The reactant with the smaller number of moles will be completely consumed and is the limiting reactant.\n\n*   Moles of H+ = 0.28 mol\n*   Moles of OH- = 0.20 mol\n\nSince 0.20 < 0.28, **OH- is the limiting reactant**. This means only 0.20 moles of OH- will react with 0.20 moles of H+, forming **0.20 moles of water**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Enthalpy of Neutralization**\nThe total heat released is the number of moles of water formed multiplied by the standard molar enthalpy of neutralization. We will use the value in kcal/mol to match the options. A commonly used value is -13.6 kcal/mol.\n\n*   Enthalpy of Neutralization (ΔH) = Moles of H2O formed × Molar Enthalpy\n*   ΔH = 0.20 mol × (-13.6 kcal/mol)\n*   ΔH = **-2.72 kcal**\n\n*Note: The reaction between Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4 also forms a precipitate, BaSO4, which releases additional heat. However, given the options, it's clear the question is only asking for the enthalpy change due to the neutralization reaction (H+ + OH- → H2O). The calculated value of -2.72 kcal perfectly matches option B.*\n\nThe correct answer is -2.72 kcal.\n\n<<<B>>>"
