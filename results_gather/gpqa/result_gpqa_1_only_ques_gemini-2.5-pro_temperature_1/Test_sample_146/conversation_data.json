    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State and Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe problem describes the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The antiproton is said to be \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can assume the proton is a stationary target. Therefore, the total initial momentum of the system is effectively zero, and the total initial energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n\nThe rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\nSince a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass, $m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = m_p c^2$.\n\nThe total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is:\n$E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n$E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.3 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.6 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\nAccording to the law of conservation of energy, this total initial energy must be equal to the total final energy ($E_{final}$) of the products.\n$E_{final} = 1876.6 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n**2. Analyze the Final State**\n\nThe annihilation produces four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. All these particles have the same rest mass, $m_A$, with a rest mass energy of $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n\nThe total final energy is the sum of the energies of these four particles:\n$E_{final} = E_{A^+_1} + E_{A^+_2} + E_{A^-_1} + E_{A^-_2}$\n\n**3. Distribute the Energy Among the Products**\n\nThe initial total momentum was zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the final total momentum must also be zero. Since the four resulting particles have identical masses, for the total momentum to be zero, the total energy must be distributed equally among them.\n\nTherefore, the energy of a single particle A ($E_A$) is one-fourth of the total final energy:\n$E_A = \\frac{E_{final}}{4} = \\frac{1876.6 \\, \\text{MeV}}{4} = 469.15 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n**4. Calculate the Velocity of Particle A**\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the equation:\n$E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\nWe can now solve for $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.15 \\, \\text{MeV}}{300 \\, \\text{MeV}} \\approx 1.5638$\n\nFinally, we can find the velocity ($v$) from the Lorentz factor. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nPlugging in the value of $\\gamma$:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n$\\beta \\approx 0.7688$\n\nThus, the velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
