    "This is a classic analytical chemistry puzzle that points towards a specific type of isomerism common in peptides. Let's break down the evidence:\n\n1.  **¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   The fact that a single proton (the alpha-proton) gives rise to two distinct peaks means this proton exists in two different chemical environments.\n    *   The peaks have similar chemical shifts, suggesting the two environments are structurally similar.\n    *   The integrals are roughly equal and sum to one proton, confirming that we are observing a mixture of two species in a roughly 1:1 ratio, and both species contain this proton.\n    *   Spin-spin coupling is ruled out, confirming these are two distinct signals, not a single signal split by a neighbor.\n\n2.  **LC-MS Data:**\n    *   The presence of two peaks in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace confirms that the crude product is a mixture of two distinct chemical compounds that have different physical properties (allowing them to be separated on the column).\n    *   The fact that both peaks have the *same mass spectrum* is a critical piece of information. It means the two compounds are isomers—they have the same molecular formula and thus the same mass.\n    *   The mass being consistent with the *expected molecule* rules out impurities of a different structure, like precursors or byproducts from \"double coupling\".\n    *   The analysis at \"elevated temperature\" and observation of \"clearly defined peaks\" often points to a dynamic equilibrium between two conformers (rotamers). At room temperature, the peaks might be broad due to interconversion on the timescale of the LC separation, but elevated temperature can either \"freeze out\" the conformers or speed up the analysis enough to resolve them cleanly.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would result in a molecule with a higher mass (an extra amino acid residue). The MS data contradicts this, as the mass is correct for the expected molecule.\n*   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular mass. The MS data contradicts this.\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be distinguished by standard ¹H NMR (they would give one set of peaks) and cannot be separated by standard LC (they would elute as a single peak). The data clearly shows two distinct species in both NMR and LC, ruling this out.\n*   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n    *   They give different NMR spectra, so seeing two sets of peaks is expected.\n    *   They can be separated by standard chromatography, so seeing two LC peaks is expected.\n    *   They have the same molecular formula, so they will have the same mass.\n    This option is perfectly consistent with all the observations. The specific type of diastereomers is most likely *rotamers* resulting from restricted rotation around an amide bond (a phenomenon particularly common for X-Proline bonds in peptides, leading to *cis* and *trans* isomers). However, diastereomers could also arise from epimerization at a chiral center during synthesis. In either case, the mixture consists of diastereoisomers.\n\nTherefore, the most likely explanation is that the crude compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<B>>>"
