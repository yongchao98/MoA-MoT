    "In our universe, Maxwell's equations are a set of four fundamental equations that describe the behavior of electric and magnetic fields. Let's look at them and see how the existence of magnetic monopoles would affect them.\n\nThe four equations are (in differential form):\n1.  **Gauss's Law for Electricity:** ∇ ⋅ **E** = ρ / ε₀ (The divergence of the electric field depends on electric charge density.)\n2.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** ∇ ⋅ **B** = 0 (The divergence of the magnetic field is always zero.)\n3.  **Faraday's Law of Induction:** ∇ × **E** = -∂**B**/∂t (A changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field.)\n4.  **Ampère-Maxwell Law:** ∇ × **B** = μ₀(**J** + ε₀ ∂**E**/∂t) (An electric current or a changing electric field creates a circulating magnetic field.)\n\nNow, let's consider the hypothetical existence of magnetic monopoles (isolated North or South poles).\n\n*   A magnetic monopole would be a \"magnetic charge,\" a source from which magnetic field lines could originate (a North pole) or terminate (a South pole).\n*   This directly contradicts **Gauss's Law for Magnetism (∇ ⋅ B = 0)**, which mathematically states that there are no magnetic monopoles and that magnetic field lines always form closed loops. If monopoles existed, this equation would have to be modified to include a magnetic charge density term, similar to Gauss's Law for Electricity. So, the equation for the **divergence of the magnetic field** would change.\n\n*   Furthermore, if magnetic charges exist, their movement would constitute a \"magnetic current.\" Looking at the beautiful symmetry of electromagnetism, a moving magnetic charge (a magnetic current) should create a circulating electric field, just as a moving electric charge (an electric current) creates a circulating magnetic field in the Ampère-Maxwell Law.\n*   This means **Faraday's Law of Induction (∇ × E = -∂B/∂t)** would need to be modified to include a magnetic current term. This is the equation that describes the **circulation (or curl) of the electric field**.\n\nTherefore, the two equations that would change are the one related to the **divergence of the magnetic field** (Gauss's Law for Magnetism) and the one related to the **circulation of the electric field** (Faraday's Law).\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
