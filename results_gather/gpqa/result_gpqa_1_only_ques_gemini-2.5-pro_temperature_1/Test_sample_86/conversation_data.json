    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound and its corresponding 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Structure Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us we have a benzene ring (C6) with two substituents. The general formula for the ring portion is C6H4.\n    *   **8 carbon atoms in total:** A benzene ring has 6 carbons. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **FTIR - Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents must contain a carbonyl group.\n    *   **FTIR - Aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X):** One substituent is a halogen atom (like -Cl, -Br, -I) attached directly to the aromatic ring. A halogen atom has 0 carbons.\n\n2.  **Deduce the Substituents and the Molecular Structure:**\n    *   We have two substituents on the C6H4 ring.\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X). This accounts for 0 of the 2 carbons needed for the substituents.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining carbons and the carbonyl group.\n    *   The simplest and most common 2-carbon group containing a carbonyl is the acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is a **haloacetophenone**. The two substituents are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Possible Isomers and their Expected 1H NMR Spectra:**\n    The molecule is a di-substituted benzene ring, so it can exist as ortho, meta, or para isomers. Let's consider the expected 1H NMR patterns for the aromatic protons (the 4 protons on the C6H4 ring):\n    *   **Ortho-isomer:** The 4 aromatic protons would be non-equivalent and would show a complex multiplet pattern.\n    *   **Meta-isomer:** The 4 aromatic protons would also show a complex pattern, although sometimes one proton might appear as a broad singlet.\n    *   **Para-isomer:** This isomer is highly symmetrical. The 4 aromatic protons are divided into two sets of two equivalent protons. This results in a very characteristic pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given 1H NMR Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        This spectrum lacks any signals in the typical aromatic region (usually 6.5-8.5 ppm). This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        This spectrum shows only one aromatic proton (1H at 6.9 ppm), which contradicts a di-substituted ring (which should have 4 aromatic protons). This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic Region:** It shows two doublets at 7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm, each integrating to 2H. This is the classic signature of a **para-disubstituted** benzene ring.\n        *   **Alkyl Region:** It shows a singlet at 2.3 ppm integrating to 3H. This is the expected signal for the methyl (-CH3) protons of an acetyl group (-COCH3), which are a singlet because there are no protons on the adjacent carbonyl carbon. The chemical shift is also appropriate.\n        *   This data perfectly matches the structure of **4-haloacetophenone**.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). This molecule contains an aldehyde, not a ketone as deduced. If the molecule were 4-(halomethyl)benzaldehyde (C8H7XO), it would fit some of the data, but critically, the halogen would be on a methyl group (Ar-CH2-X), not directly on the ring. The problem explicitly states an **aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X)** was detected by FTIR. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound is 4-haloacetophenone. Its 1H NMR spectrum consists of two doublets in the aromatic region for the para-substituted ring and a singlet for the methyl group of the acetyl substituent. Option C is the only one that correctly represents this structure.\n\n<<<C>>>"
