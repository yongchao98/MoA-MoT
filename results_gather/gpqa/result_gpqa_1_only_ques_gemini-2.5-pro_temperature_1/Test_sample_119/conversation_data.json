    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the relationship.\n\n1.  **Define the basic quantities:**\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is inversely proportional to distance (d). Specifically, `plx = 1/d` (where d is in parsecs and plx is in arcseconds).\n    *   **Uniform distribution:** This means the number density of stars (ρ), which is the number of stars per unit volume, is constant everywhere.\n\n2.  **Consider a thin shell of space:**\n    *   Let's find the number of stars, `dN`, located in a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` from Earth, with a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell, `dV`, is its surface area multiplied by its thickness:\n        `dV = (Surface Area of a sphere) × (thickness) = (4πd²) × dd`\n    *   The number of stars `dN` in this volume is the density `ρ` times the volume `dV`:\n        `dN = ρ × dV = ρ × 4πd² × dd`\n\n3.  **Express everything in terms of parallax (plx):**\n    *   We need to find how `dN` changes with `d(plx)`, not `dd`. So we need to relate `dd` to `d(plx)`.\n    *   We start with the relation `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   We can find the relationship between their differentials by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx²`\n    *   This gives us `dd = - (1/plx²) d(plx)`. The negative sign just indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. For counting the number of stars, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can write `dd = (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n\n4.  **Substitute back into the equation for dN:**\n    *   Now we replace `d` with `1/plx` and `dd` with `(1/plx²) d(plx)` in our equation for `dN`:\n        `dN = ρ × 4π × (1/plx)² × (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n    *   Simplifying this expression:\n        `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\n5.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:**\n    *   The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax\", which is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   From the equation above, we can rearrange to get:\n        `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are constants, we can see the proportionality:\n        `dN/d(plx) ~ 1/plx⁴`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as `1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
