    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the mass dimension of $\\kappa$ and determine the renormalizability of the theory.\n\n**1. Mass Dimension of the Lagrangian Density**\n\nIn natural units, where $\\hbar = c = 1$, the action $S$ is a dimensionless quantity. The action is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ over four-dimensional spacetime:\n$S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L}$\nThe dimension of the four-volume element $d^4x$ is $[d^4x] = [dx^0 dx^1 dx^2 dx^3]$. Since position and time have dimensions of inverse mass ($[x^\\mu] = M^{-1}$), the dimension of the volume element is $[d^4x] = (M^{-1})^4 = M^{-4}$.\nFor the action $S$ to be dimensionless ($[S]=M^0$), the Lagrangian density must have a mass dimension of 4:\n$[\\mathcal{L}] = M^4$.\n\n**2. Mass Dimensions of the Fields**\n\nThe total Lagrangian consists of kinetic terms and interaction terms. Every term in the Lagrangian must have the same mass dimension, $M^4$. We can use the standard kinetic terms to find the mass dimensions of the fields.\n\n*   **Fermion field $\\psi$**: The kinetic term for a Dirac fermion is $\\mathcal{L}_{fermion, kin} = \\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\psi$.\n    *   The dimension of the derivative operator is $[\\partial_\\mu] = M^1$.\n    *   The gamma matrices $\\gamma^\\mu$ are dimensionless.\n    *   We must have $[\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\psi] = M^4$.\n    *   This implies $[\\bar{\\psi}][\\psi][\\partial_\\mu] = M^4$.\n    *   Since $[\\bar{\\psi}] = [\\psi]$, we have $[\\psi]^2 M^1 = M^4$, which gives $[\\psi]^2 = M^3$.\n    *   Therefore, the mass dimension of the fermion field is $[\\psi] = M^{3/2}$.\n\n*   **Gauge field strength tensor $F^{\\mu\\nu}$**: The kinetic term for a gauge field (like the electromagnetic field) is $\\mathcal{L}_{gauge, kin} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n    *   We must have $[F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^4$.\n    *   This implies $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]^2 = M^4$.\n    *   Therefore, the mass dimension of the field strength tensor is $[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^2$.\n\n**3. Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant $\\kappa$**\n\nNow we analyze the given interaction term:\n$\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$\nThe dimension of this term must also be $M^4$:\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa][\\bar{\\psi}][\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}][\\psi][F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^4$.\n\nLet's find the dimension of each part:\n*   $[\\kappa]$ is what we want to find.\n*   $[\\bar{\\psi}] = M^{3/2}$.\n*   $[\\psi] = M^{3/2}$.\n*   $[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^2$.\n*   $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_\\mu, \\gamma_\\nu]$. Since the gamma matrices are dimensionless, their commutator $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ is also dimensionless, i.e., $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] = M^0$.\n\nSubstituting these dimensions into the equation for $[\\mathcal{L}_{int}]$:\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot M^{3/2} \\cdot M^0 \\cdot M^{3/2} \\cdot M^2 = M^4$\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot M^{3/2 + 3/2 + 2} = M^4$\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot M^{3 + 2} = M^4$\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot M^5 = M^4$\n$[\\kappa] = \\frac{M^4}{M^5} = M^{-1}$.\n\nSo, the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ is -1.\n\n**4. Renormalizability of the Theory**\n\nThe renormalizability of a quantum field theory can be determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constants. This is known as power-counting renormalizability. Let $g$ be a coupling constant.\n\n*   If $[g] > 0$, the interaction is called **super-renormalizable**.\n*   If $[g] = 0$, the interaction is called **renormalizable**.\n*   If $[g] < 0$, the interaction is called **non-renormalizable**.\n\nIn our case, the coupling constant is $\\kappa$, and we found its mass dimension to be $[\\kappa] = -1$. Since the mass dimension is negative, the theory described by this interaction is **not renormalizable**.\n\nA negative mass dimension for a coupling constant implies that the interaction becomes stronger at higher energies (in the ultraviolet regime). In perturbation theory, this leads to loop diagrams with divergences that become progressively worse at higher orders, requiring an infinite number of counter-terms to absorb them. This is the definition of a non-renormalizable theory.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   The mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is $[\\kappa]_{M}=-1$.\n*   The theory is not renormalizable.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
