    "The scenario describes an active immune response in a secondary lymphoid organ (Peyer's patch) following an oral antigen challenge. Let's break down the key observations:\n\n1.  **Location:** Peyer's patches are key sites for initiating immune responses to intestinal antigens.\n2.  **Cells:** A \"proliferating cell population\" indicates that lymphocytes (likely B cells) have been activated by the antigen and are undergoing clonal expansion.\n3.  **Genetic finding:** Sequencing reveals \"high variability\" specifically in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of these proliferating cells.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options based on these findings:\n\n*   **A) VDJ recombination:** This process creates the initial B cell receptor diversity. It occurs in developing B cells within the primary lymphoid organs (bone marrow), *before* they encounter an antigen. The variability observed here is in a population of cells *after* antigen exposure, not during initial development.\n*   **B) Class switching recombination:** This process changes the constant region of the heavy chain (e.g., from IgM to IgA), which alters the antibody's effector function. It does *not* affect the variable region, which determines antigen specificity. The question specifies variability in the *variable* heavy chain gene.\n*   **C) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a process that occurs in activated, proliferating B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). SHM deliberately introduces point mutations into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes. This creates a population of B cells with slightly different receptors, and those with higher affinity for the antigen are selectively expanded (a process called affinity maturation). This perfectly matches the observation of \"high variability\" in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of a \"proliferating cell population\" in a Peyer's patch.\n*   **D) Complement activation:** This is a system of plasma proteins that is part of the humoral immune response, but it does not involve any genetic changes to B cells.\n\nTherefore, the process responsible for the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain gene is somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
