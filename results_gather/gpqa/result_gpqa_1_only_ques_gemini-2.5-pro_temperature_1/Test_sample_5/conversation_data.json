    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the energy spectrum.\n\n**1. Analyze the Potential**\n\nThe given potential is in polar coordinates (r, θ):\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n\nTo solve the Schrödinger equation, it's often best to work in a coordinate system where the potential function separates into independent terms for each coordinate. Let's convert the potential to Cartesian coordinates (x, y) using the standard transformations:\nx = r cos(θ)\ny = r sin(θ)\nr^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\nSubstitute these into the potential expression:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k(r cos(θ))^2\nSince x = r cos(θ), we have x^2 = r^2 cos^2(θ).\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 kx^2\n\nNow, group the terms with x and y:\nV(x, y) = (1/2 kx^2 + 3/2 kx^2) + 1/2 ky^2\nV(x, y) = (4/2)kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\nV(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\n**2. Separate the Schrödinger Equation**\n\nThe potential is now in a separable form, V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y), where:\n*   V_x(x) = 2kx^2\n*   V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2\n\nThis means the two-dimensional Schrödinger equation can be separated into two independent one-dimensional equations. The total energy E will be the sum of the energies from the x and y motions, E = E_x + E_y.\n\nBoth V_x(x) and V_y(y) are potentials for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO). The general form of the QHO potential is V(q) = 1/2 mω^2 q^2, and its energy eigenvalues are E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω.\n\n**3. Solve for the x-direction Energy (E_x)**\n\nFor the motion in the x-direction, the potential is V_x(x) = 2kx^2. We compare this to the general QHO potential form:\n1/2 mω_x^2 x^2 = 2kx^2\nmω_x^2 = 4k\nω_x^2 = 4k/m\nω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for the x-oscillator are given by:\nE_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x\nE_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k/m))\nwhere n_x = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\n**4. Solve for the y-direction Energy (E_y)**\n\nFor the motion in the y-direction, the potential is V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2. We compare this to the general QHO potential form:\n1/2 mω_y^2 y^2 = 1/2 ky^2\nmω_y^2 = k\nω_y^2 = k/m\nω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for the y-oscillator are given by:\nE_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y\nE_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nwhere n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\n**5. Find the Total Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of E_{n_x} and E_{n_y}:\nE = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}\nE = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k/m)) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression by factoring out ħ * sqrt(k/m):\nE = [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n**6. Compare with the Options**\n\nComparing our result with the given choices:\nA) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nB) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nC) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nD) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n\nOur derived energy spectrum matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
