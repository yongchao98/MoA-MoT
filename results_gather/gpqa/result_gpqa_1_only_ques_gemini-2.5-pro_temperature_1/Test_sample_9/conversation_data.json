    "Here is a breakdown of the options to determine which planet has the highest density:\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is essentially Earth, which serves as our baseline. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3:** The density is given as ~5.5 g/cm³, which is the same as Earth's.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** A planet with the same composition but less mass will have weaker gravity. Weaker gravity means the material is not compressed as much. Therefore, its density will be *lower* than Earth's.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This is the key. A planet with the same basic materials as Earth but significantly more mass will have much stronger gravity. This immense gravitational force compresses the planet's material much more tightly, leading to a significantly higher average density.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the options:\n*   Density (a) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n*   Density (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n*   Density (d) < 5.5 g/cm³\n*   Density (c) > 5.5 g/cm³\n\nThe planet that is 5 times more massive than Earth will be the densest due to gravitational compression.\n\n<<<D>>>"
