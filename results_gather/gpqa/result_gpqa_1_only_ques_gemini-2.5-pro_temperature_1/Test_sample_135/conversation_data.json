    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are asked to compute the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f`.\n*   **Vector Field (f):** The field has a magnitude that falls off as `1/r^2` and points in the radial direction (`r_hat`). Therefore, the vector field can be written as:\n    `f = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\n    where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction in spherical coordinates.\n\n*   **Volume of Integration (V):** The integration is to be performed over the volume of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n*   **Integral to Evaluate:** We need to find the value of `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n**2. Choose a Method**\n\nThis problem is a classic application of the **Divergence Theorem** (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux of that field through the closed surface that bounds the volume.\n\nThe Divergence Theorem states:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nHere:\n*   `V` is the volume of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `S` is the closed surface that bounds the volume `V`, which is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `dS` is the differential surface area vector, which points outwards from the surface.\n\n**Why use the Divergence Theorem?**\nIf we were to calculate the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` directly, we find that `∇ ⋅ f = 0` for all `r ≠ 0`. However, the field `f` is singular at the origin (`r = 0`), and the divergence is actually a Dirac delta function at that point. Using the Divergence Theorem allows us to bypass the complexity of dealing with this singularity by evaluating a simpler surface integral on the boundary of the sphere, where the field is well-behaved.\n\n**3. Apply the Divergence Theorem**\n\nWe need to evaluate the surface integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n\n*   **Field on the Surface (S):** On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is:\n    `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`\n\n*   **Differential Surface Vector (dS):** For a sphere of radius `R`, the differential surface area element in spherical coordinates is:\n    `dS = R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ * r_hat`\n    The direction `r_hat` is the outward-pointing normal, as required by the theorem.\n\n*   **Calculate the Dot Product (f ⋅ dS):**\n    `f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) * r_hat ] ⋅ [ R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ * r_hat ]`\n    Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, the dot product simplifies:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n*   **Evaluate the Surface Integral:** Now we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for `θ` are from `0` to `π`, and for `φ` are from `0` to `2π`.\n\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_(φ=0)^(2π) ∫_(θ=0)^π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n    We can separate the integrals:\n    `= ( ∫_0^(2π) dφ ) * ( ∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ )`\n\n    Evaluate each integral:\n    `∫_0^(2π) dφ = [φ]_0^(2π) = 2π`\n    `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n    Multiply the results:\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = 4π`\n\nThe result is `4π`. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 4/3 π R\nB) 0\nC) 1\nD) 4 π\n\nThe most appropriate answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
