    "To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to calculate the ratio of their total masses (M_total_1 / M_total_2).\n\n### 1. Key Concepts and Formula\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M_total = M₁ + M₂) can be determined from the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves of the two stars (K₁ and K₂). The formula is:\n\nM₁ + M₂ = (P / (2πG)) * ( (K₁ + K₂)^3 / sin³(i) )\n\nwhere:\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `K₁` and `K₂` are the radial velocity semi-amplitudes.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n\nThe problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This means they are eclipsing binaries, which implies that the orbital inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°. For i ≈ 90°, sin(i) ≈ 1, and therefore sin³(i) ≈ 1. We can assume this for both systems.\n\n### 2. Setting up the Ratio\nWe want to find the ratio M_total_1 / M_total_2. Using the formula above, the constant term (1 / 2πG) will cancel out. Assuming sin³(i) is the same for both systems (≈ 1), this term also cancels.\n\nThis leaves us with the following proportionality:\nM_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)^3\n\nSo, the ratio of the masses is:\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = [ P₁ * (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ)³ ] / [ P₂ * (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ)³ ]\n\n### 3. Plugging in the Values\nLet's gather the data for each system:\n\n**System 1:**\n*   Period (P₁): 2 years\n*   RV Amplitudes (K₁ₐ, K₁ₑ): 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n*   Sum of amplitudes (K_sum_1): 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**System 2:**\n*   Period (P₂): 1 year\n*   RV Amplitudes (K₂ₐ, K₂ₑ): 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n*   Sum of amplitudes (K_sum_2): 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, substitute these values into the ratio formula. We can use the periods in years and velocities in km/s, as the units will cancel out in the ratio.\n\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = [ 2 * (15)³ ] / [ 1 * (25)³ ]\n\n### 4. Calculation\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 2 * (15 / 25)³\nFirst, simplify the fraction inside the parenthesis:\n15 / 25 = 3 / 5\n\nNow, substitute this back:\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 2 * (3 / 5)³\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 54 / 125\n\nFinally, convert the fraction to a decimal:\n54 / 125 = 0.432\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nThe calculated factor is approximately 0.432. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.6\nB) ~ 1.2\nC) ~ 0.4\nD) ~ 0.7\n\nThe value 0.432 is closest to 0.4. Therefore, system_1 is about 0.4 times as massive as system_2 (meaning it is less massive).\n\n<<<C>>>"
