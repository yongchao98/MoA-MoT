    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the spectroscopic data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the functional groups and basic structure:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two substituents, which has the formula C6H4. This structure accounts for 4 aromatic protons. The 1H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H,\" which is consistent with the 4 protons of a di-substituted ring (for example, a para-substituted ring often shows two doublets).\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** An ester group has the structure -COO-. This accounts for the two oxygen atoms (O2) in the molecular formula.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information that helps eliminate certain structural possibilities.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR signals in detail:**\n    *   **Two –CH3 signals:** Since there is an ester group and no –CH2 groups, one of the methyl groups must be part of a methyl ester (–COOCH3). An ethyl ester (–COOCH2CH3) is ruled out because it contains a –CH2 group. The other –CH3 group must be part of the second substituent on the aromatic ring.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** Vinyl protons are hydrogens attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C-H). The splitting pattern of a doublet (d) and a doublet of quartets (dq) is characteristic of a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3).\n        *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by both the other vinyl proton (making it a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (making it a quartet). Hence, a doublet of quartets.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is split only by its neighboring vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet.\n        *   This confirms the presence of a –CH=CH–CH3 group. This group also accounts for the second –CH3 signal, which would be a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent vinyl proton.\n\n3.  **Assemble the structural fragments and determine the molecular formula:**\n    *   Aromatic ring: C6H4\n    *   Methyl ester group: –COOCH3\n    *   Propenyl group: –CH=CH–CH3\n\n    Now, let's sum the atoms from these fragments:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 1 (from C=O) + 1 (from O–CH3) + 3 (from –CH=CH–CH3) = **11 Carbons**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 3 (from O–CH3) + 5 (from –CH=CH–CH3) = **12 Hydrogens**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from –COO–) = **2 Oxygens**\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    A) C11H12O2\n    B) C12H12O2\n    C) C11H14O2\n    D) C12H14O2\n\nThe derived formula C11H12O2 matches option A. All the spectroscopic data are consistent with a structure like methyl propenylbenzoate, which has this formula.\n\n<<<A>>>"
