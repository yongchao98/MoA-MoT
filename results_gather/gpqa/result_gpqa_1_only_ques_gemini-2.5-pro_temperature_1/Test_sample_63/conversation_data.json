    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gas Separation Process**\n\nThe mixture of gases produced from heating the salts is passed through a series of tubes. We can determine the composition of the gas mixture from the changes in weight of these tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The weight increase is 3.60 g, which is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, NO₂.\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change (Δm = 0).\n    *   This means no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The problem states CuO is formed, confirming this reaction: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through all three tubes, a gas C remains.\n    *   Volume at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP) = 2.24 L.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Identify Gas C and Verify Mass Conservation**\n\nThe total mass of the initial salts was 7.20 g. By the law of conservation of mass, this must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\nTotal mass of gases = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C)\n7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C)\n7.20 g = 4.40 g + Mass(Gas C)\nMass(Gas C) = 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g.\n\nNow we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\nMolar Mass(Gas C) = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n\nGas C is inert to the reagents in the tubes and has a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol. The most common gas fitting this description is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**3. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Salts**\n\nThe elements in the gaseous products (N, H, O) must have originated from the initial salts A and B. Let's calculate the total moles of each element.\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** From 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles H = 2 × Moles H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** From 0.20 mol of H₂O and 0.025 mol of O₂.\n    *   Moles O = (1 × Moles H₂O) + (2 × Moles O₂) = (1 × 0.20) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** From 0.10 mol of N₂.\n    *   Moles N = 2 × Moles N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n\nSo, the total elemental mole ratio in the 7.20 g mixture is N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\nTo get a simpler integer ratio, we can multiply by 20: N:H:O = 4 : 8 : 5.\nThe combined empirical formula of the salt mixture is N₄H₈O₅.\n\n**4. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe have an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. This means the total number of moles of A is equal to the total number of moles of B. Let this be 'n' moles for each. The combined formula (A+B) is N₄H₈O₅.\n\nThe salts contain N, H, and O. A very common cation containing N and H is the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). The 8 hydrogen atoms in the combined formula can be accounted for by two NH₄⁺ ions (one for each salt).\n*   Salt A = NH₄⁺ + Anion A⁻\n*   Salt B = NH₄⁺ + Anion B⁻\n\nThe remaining atoms to form the two anions are N₂O₅ (from N₄H₈O₅ - 2×NH₄). We need to split N₂O₅ into two anions, each with a -1 charge. The most common and chemically sensible anions from these atoms are:\n*   Nitrite ion: NO₂⁻\n*   Nitrate ion: NO₃⁻\nAdding these together gives N₂O₅²⁻, which balances the two NH₄⁺ cations.\n\nSo, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\nLet's check if the decomposition of an equimolar mixture of these salts matches the observed products.\n*   NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   A known decomposition for NH₄NO₃ at ~200°C is: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + 4H₂O + O₂ (or NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + 2H₂O + ½ O₂)\n\nLet's assume the mixture contained 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂ and 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃.\n*   Products from NH₄NO₂: n mol N₂, 2n mol H₂O\n*   Products from NH₄NO₃: n mol N₂, 2n mol H₂O, 0.5n mol O₂\n*   Total products:\n    *   N₂: n + n = 2n\n    *   H₂O: 2n + 2n = 4n\n    *   O₂: 0.5n\n\nFrom our initial analysis, we found: Moles N₂ = 0.10, Moles H₂O = 0.20, Moles O₂ = 0.025.\n*   2n = 0.10 mol  => n = 0.05 mol\n*   4n = 0.20 mol  => n = 0.05 mol\n*   0.5n = 0.025 mol => n = 0.05 mol\n\nThe results are consistent, confirming our hypothesis. The mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃. The total mass is (0.05 mol * 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80 g/mol) = 3.2 g + 4.0 g = 7.2 g, which matches the given information.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Atoms = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Atoms = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
