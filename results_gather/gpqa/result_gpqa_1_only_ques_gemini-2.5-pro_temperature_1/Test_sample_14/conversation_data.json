    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine which planet has a higher transit probability.\n\n1.  **Understand Transit Probability**\n    The geometric probability of a planet transiting its star is, for a circular orbit, the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`).\n    `Probability (P_transit) = R_s / a`\n\n2.  **Set up the Ratio of Probabilities**\n    We want to compare the transit probability of Planet_1 (`P_1`) with that of Planet_2 (`P_2`). Let's calculate the ratio `P_1 / P_2`.\n    `P_1 / P_2 = (R_s1 / a_1) / (R_s2 / a_2)`\n    This can be rearranged to:\n    `P_1 / P_2 = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (a_2 / a_1)`\n\n3.  **Incorporate Known Information about the Stars**\n    We are given that both host stars have the same radii, so `R_s1 = R_s2`. This means the term `(R_s1 / R_s2)` is equal to 1.\n    The ratio simplifies to:\n    `P_1 / P_2 = a_2 / a_1`\n    This shows that the planet with the smaller semi-major axis (a shorter orbital distance) will have the higher transit probability.\n\n4.  **Use Kepler's Third Law to find the Semi-major Axis Ratio**\n    Kepler's Third Law relates a planet's orbital period (`P`) to its semi-major axis (`a`) and the mass of its host star (`M_s`). Assuming the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's mass, the law is:\n    `P^2 ∝ a^3 / M_s`\n    We can rearrange this to solve for `a`:\n    `a^3 ∝ M_s * P^2`\n    `a ∝ (M_s * P^2)^(1/3)`\n    Now we can find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * P_2^2) / (M_s1 * P_1^2) ]^(1/3)`\n\n5.  **Substitute the Given Planetary and Stellar Relationships**\n    We are given:\n    *   The mass of Star 1 is twice the mass of Star 2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`\n    *   The period of Planet 2 is three times the period of Planet 1: `P_2 = 3 * P_1`\n    Substitute these into the equation for `a_2 / a_1`:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * (3 * P_1)^2) / ((2 * M_s2) * P_1^2) ]^(1/3)`\n\n6.  **Simplify and Calculate the Ratio**\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * 9 * P_1^2) / (2 * M_s2 * P_1^2) ]^(1/3)`\n    The terms `M_s2` and `P_1^2` cancel out:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n    Calculating the cube root of 4.5 gives:\n    `a_2 / a_1 ≈ 1.65`\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion**\n    Since we established that `P_1 / P_2 = a_2 / a_1`, we have:\n    `P_1 / P_2 ≈ 1.65`\n    This means the probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than the probability of Planet_2 transiting. Therefore, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
