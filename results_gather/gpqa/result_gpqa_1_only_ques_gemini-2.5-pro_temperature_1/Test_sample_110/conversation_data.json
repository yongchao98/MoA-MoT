    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### **Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. We have a ketone (enolate precursor), a strong bulky base (t-BuOK), and a Michael acceptor (ethyl acrylate, an α,β-unsaturated ester).\n2.  **Form the nucleophile (enolate):** The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form an enolate. The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2:** This carbon is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**. Therefore, deprotonation cannot occur at C2.\n    *   **C6:** This carbon is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. It is a tertiary carbon and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Since C6 is the only position with an α-proton, the base will abstract this proton to form the corresponding enolate. This enolate will act as the nucleophile.\n3.  **Identify the electrophile:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) is the Michael acceptor. The enolate will attack the electrophilic β-carbon (the CH₂ group).\n4.  **Perform the Michael addition:** The carbanion at C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. The π bond of the acrylate shifts, and after protonation (during workup), the final product is formed.\n5.  **Determine the product structure (A):**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The resulting structure is a cyclohexanone ring where C6 is bonded to both its original methyl group and a new `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` chain.\n    *   The full structure has: C1=O, a geminal ethyl and methyl group at C2, a methyl group at C6, and the `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` group also at C6.\n6.  **Name the product (A):** The options name the product as a substituted ethyl propanoate. Let's adopt this naming convention.\n    *   The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate`.\n    *   The substituent is the cyclohexyl ring, attached at its C6 position to the C3 of the propanoate.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we number the ring starting from the point of attachment (old C6 is new C1').\n    *   New C1' (old C6) has a methyl group.\n    *   New C2' (old C1) has the oxo (=O) group.\n    *   New C3' (old C2) has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   So, the substituent is `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   The full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is also a Michael addition. We have a compound with acidic α-protons (1-nitropropane), a strong base (KOH), and a Michael acceptor ((E)-but-2-enenitrile).\n2.  **Form the nucleophile (carbanion):** The protons on the carbon adjacent (α) to the electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (`CH₃CH₂CH₂-NO₂`) to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion): `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`. This is the nucleophile.\n3.  **Identify the electrophile:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`, also known as crotononitrile) is the Michael acceptor. The nucleophile will attack the electrophilic β-carbon (the `CH` group bonded to the methyl group).\n4.  **Perform the Michael addition:** The carbanion of the nitronate attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. The π bond shifts, and the resulting intermediate is protonated by water.\n5.  **Determine the product structure (B):**\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   The resulting structure is `NC-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(NO₂)-CH₂CH₃`.\n6.  **Name the product (B):** We use IUPAC nomenclature for nitriles.\n    *   The parent chain is the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon (`-CN`). This is a 6-carbon chain, so it is a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1: `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.\n*   **Product B** is 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile.\n\nMatching these products with the given options:\n\n*   A) A is incorrect.\n*   B) B is incorrect.\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile. **This option matches both of our derived products.**\n*   D) A and B are both incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
