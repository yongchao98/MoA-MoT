    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify Compound X:\n\n**1. Determine the Structure of the Product from the NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's analyze the provided NMR spectra to determine the structure of the reaction product. The starting material, Compound X, has the formula C11H12O. The reaction involves a catalyst (DABCO) and heat, suggesting an isomerization or rearrangement. Therefore, the product should also have the molecular formula C11H12O.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The total integration is 3+3+1+2+1+2 = 12 protons, which matches the molecular formula C11H12O.\n    *   **δ 2.28 (3H, s)** and **δ 2.31 (3H, s):** These are two distinct singlet signals, each integrating to 3 protons. This indicates two methyl (CH₃) groups that are not adjacent to any protons (i.e., they are attached to quaternary carbons, carbonyl groups, or an aromatic ring).\n    *   **δ 7.08 (2H, d)** and **δ 7.71 (2H, d):** These two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) aromatic ring.\n    *   **δ 6.75 (1H, d)** and **δ 7.68 (1H, d):** These two doublets, each integrating to 1 proton, are indicative of two coupled protons on a carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-). The chemical shifts suggest they are part of a conjugated system.\n\n*   **¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The total number of signals corresponds to 11 carbons, matching the formula C11H12O.\n    *   **δ 197.7 (1C, s):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a ketone carbonyl carbon (C=O).\n    *   **δ 21.3 (1C, s)** and **δ 28.4 (1C, s):** These are the two methyl carbons.\n    *   **δ 126.9 (2C), 127.1 (1C), 129.1 (2C), 130.3 (1C), 141.5 (1C), 144.1 (1C):** These eight signals are in the sp² region (alkene/aromatic). This corresponds to the 6 carbons of the benzene ring and the 2 carbons of the C=C double bond.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    *   We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   One of the methyl groups (e.g., δ 2.31 in ¹H, δ 21.3 in ¹³C) must be one of the substituents on the ring, forming a para-tolyl group.\n    *   The other major component is a ketone. The second methyl group (e.g., δ 2.28 in ¹H, δ 28.4 in ¹³C) is a singlet, suggesting it's part of an acetyl group (-C(=O)CH₃).\n    *   The remaining pieces are the -CH=CH- group and the rest of the aromatic ring system.\n    *   Combining these fragments gives the structure of an α,β-unsaturated ketone: **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one** (also known as p-methylbenzalacetone).\n\n     \n\n    This structure is consistent with all the NMR data:\n    *   It has a p-tolyl group (one Me singlet, two 2H aromatic doublets).\n    *   It has an acetyl group (one Me singlet).\n    *   It has a conjugated -CH=CH- group (two 1H vinyl doublets).\n    *   It is a ketone (¹³C signal at 197.7 ppm).\n    *   The molecular formula is C11H12O.\n\n**2. Identify Compound X from the Options**\n\nNow we need to find which of the given options for Compound X (all of which are isomers) could rearrange to form 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n*   **A) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** This compound contains a phenyl group (C₆H₅-), not a p-tolyl group. The product clearly has a p-tolyl group, as evidenced by the two distinct methyl singlets. Thus, A is incorrect.\n*   **B) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** This compound also contains a phenyl group (as part of the styryl group), not a p-tolyl group. Thus, B is incorrect.\n*   **C) 2-styrylepoxide:** The molecular formula for this compound is C₁₀H₁₀O (C₆H₅-CH=CH-C₂H₃O), which does not match the required C₁₁H₁₂O. Thus, C is incorrect.\n*   **D) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** Let's check this structure.\n    *   It contains a 4-methylstyryl group (p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-), which has the required p-tolyl moiety.\n    *   The full structure is (p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-)-[CH-O-CH₂].\n    *   The molecular formula is C₁₁H₁₂O (C₈H₉ from 4-methylstyryl + C₂H₃O from the oxiranyl group C₂H₃ attached to it). This matches the formula of Compound X and the product.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reaction Plausibility**\n\nThe reaction is the isomerization of compound D, a vinyloxirane, into the α,β-unsaturated ketone product. This type of rearrangement is known to occur under basic and/or thermal conditions. A plausible mechanism involves nucleophilic attack by DABCO on the terminal carbon of the epoxide, followed by an internal proton transfer and elimination of DABCO to yield a conjugated enol, which then tautomerizes to the stable ketone product.\n\nGiven that options A, B, and C can be eliminated based on structural or formula mismatches with the product, Compound D is the only viable starting material.\n\nTherefore, Compound X is **2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
