    "The problem describes a particle of mass $m$ in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. We need to find the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state.\n\n**1. Finding the Energy Eigenvalues**\n\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system is:\n$H\\Psi = E\\Psi$\nwhere the Hamiltonian $H$ is given by:\n$H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$\n\nThe easiest way to solve this is by separating the variables in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$. In these coordinates, $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$, and the Hamiltonian becomes:\n$H = \\left( -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x^2 \\right) + \\left( -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 y^2 \\right) + \\left( -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 z^2 \\right)$\nThis is the sum of three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians, $H = H_x + H_y + H_z$.\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator are given by $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number.\n\nFor the three-dimensional isotropic case, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the three independent oscillators:\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nLet's define a principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $N=0, 1, 2, ...$. The energy levels are then given by:\n$E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nNow, let's identify the energy levels for the different states:\n*   **Ground State (lowest energy):** $N = 0$. Energy $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First Excited State:** $N = 1$. Energy $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Second Excited State:** $N = 2$. Energy $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Third Excited State:** $N = 3$. Energy $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n**2. Finding the Degeneracy**\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_N$ is the number of distinct sets of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that give the same value of $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy is equal to its degeneracy.\n\nFor the third excited state, we have $N = 3$. We need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is 3.\nThe possible combinations $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ are:\n*   One number is 3, others are 0:\n    (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) — 3 states\n*   One number is 2, one is 1, one is 0:\n    (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) — 6 states\n*   All numbers are 1:\n    (1, 1, 1) — 1 state\n\nThe total number of states is the sum of these possibilities:\nDegeneracy $g_3 = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\nAlternatively, the degeneracy of the N-th level for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by the formula:\n$g_N = \\frac{(N+1)(N+2)}{2}$\nFor the third excited state, $N=3$:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\nThus, the third excited state has an energy of $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$ and a degeneracy of 10. This means there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to this energy.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nComparing our results with the given options:\nA) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3\nB) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3\nC) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10\nD) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10\n\nThe correct option is D, as it matches both the calculated energy and the degeneracy.\n\n<<<D>>>"
