    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n**1. Normalize the initial state |α>**\n\nThe given state is proportional to (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>. Let's call this unnormalized state |ψ>:\n|ψ> = (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>\n\nTo normalize it, we need to find the normalization constant C such that |α> = C |ψ> and <α|α> = 1.\n<ψ|ψ> = <((1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>)|((1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>)>\n<ψ|ψ> = (1-i)(1+i) <up|up> + (2+i)(2-i) <down|down> (since <up|down> = <down|up> = 0)\n<ψ|ψ> = (1² - i²) + (2² - i²)\n<ψ|ψ> = (1 - (-1)) + (4 - (-1)) = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nSo, the squared norm is 7. The normalization constant C is 1/√7.\nThe normalized state is:\n|α> = (1/√7) * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]\n\nIn vector notation, using the basis {|up>, |down>}, this is:\n|α> = (1/√7) * [ (1+i), (2-i) ]ᵀ\n\n**2. Find the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of the Operator A**\n\nThe operator A is given by its matrix elements: Aij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. In the {|up>, |down>} basis, this is a 2x2 matrix:\nA = | 0      ħ/2 |\n    | ħ/2    0   |\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0:\ndet | -λ    ħ/2 | = 0\n    | ħ/2  -λ   |\n(-λ)(-λ) - (ħ/2)(ħ/2) = 0\nλ² - (ħ/2)² = 0\nλ = ± ħ/2\n\nSo, the two possible results of a measurement are the eigenvalues:\nλ₁ = +ħ/2\nλ₂ = -ħ/2\n\nNow, let's find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors.\nFor λ₁ = +ħ/2:\n(A - λ₁I) |a₁> = 0\n| -ħ/2   ħ/2 | |x| = |0|\n|  ħ/2  -ħ/2 | |y|   |0|\nThis gives the equation -x + y = 0, or x = y. The unnormalized eigenvector is [1, 1]ᵀ.\nNormalizing it gives the eigenvector |a₁>:\n|a₁> = (1/√2) * (|up> + |down>)\n\nFor λ₂ = -ħ/2:\n(A - λ₂I) |a₂> = 0\n| ħ/2   ħ/2 | |x| = |0|\n| ħ/2   ħ/2 | |y|   |0|\nThis gives the equation x + y = 0, or x = -y. The unnormalized eigenvector is [1, -1]ᵀ.\nNormalizing it gives the eigenvector |a₂>:\n|a₂> = (1/√2) * (|up> - |down>)\n\n**3. Calculate the Probabilities**\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue λᵢ is given by P(λᵢ) = |<aᵢ|α>|².\n\nProbability of measuring λ₁ = +ħ/2:\nP(+ħ/2) = |<a₁|α>|²\n<a₁|α> = [ (1/√2) * (<up| + <down|) ] ⋅ [ (1/√7) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>) ]\n<a₁|α> = (1/√14) * [ (1)(1+i) + (1)(2-i) ]\n<a₁|α> = (1/√14) * [ 1 + i + 2 - i ] = 3/√14\nP(+ħ/2) = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.643\n\nProbability of measuring λ₂ = -ħ/2:\nP(-ħ/2) = |<a₂|α>|²\n<a₂|α> = [ (1/√2) * (<up| - <down|) ] ⋅ [ (1/√7) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>) ]\n<a₂|α> = (1/√14) * [ (1)(1+i) - (1)(2-i) ]\n<a₂|α> = (1/√14) * [ 1 + i - 2 + i ] = (-1 + 2i)/√14\nP(-ħ/2) = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. (Check: 9/14 + 5/14 = 14/14 = 1).\n\n**4. Find the Average (Expectation) Value of A**\n\nThe average value <A> can be calculated using the formula <A> = Σ λᵢ P(λᵢ).\n<A> = (λ₁) * P(λ₁) + (λ₂) * P(λ₂)\n<A> = (+ħ/2) * (9/14) + (-ħ/2) * (5/14)\n<A> = (ħ/2) * (9/14 - 5/14)\n<A> = (ħ/2) * (4/14)\n<A> = (ħ/2) * (2/7) = ħ/7\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of A are 9/14 ≈ 0.64 and 5/14 ≈ 0.36. The average value of the operator is ħ/7. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
