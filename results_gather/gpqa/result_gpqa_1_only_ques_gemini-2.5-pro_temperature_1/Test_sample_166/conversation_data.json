    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to find the amount of non-Gaussianity (nG).\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Schrödinger Cat State (`rho`):** The state is given by `|psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N`. The density matrix is `rho = |psi><psi|`. Since this is a pure state, its von Neumann entropy `S(rho) = -trace(rho * ln(rho))` is zero.\n*   **Reference Gaussian State (`tau`):** This is a Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments (mean displacement and covariance matrix) as the state `rho`.\n*   **Non-Gaussianity (nG):** The measure is the relative entropy `del_b = S(rho || tau) = S(tau) - S(rho)`. The user's formula is `del_b = [trace(rho* ln(rho))-trace(tau* ln(tau))] = S(tau) - S(rho)`.\n\nGiven that `S(rho) = 0` for our pure state, the non-Gaussianity simplifies to the entropy of the reference Gaussian state:\n`nG = S(tau)`\n\n**2. Calculate the Entropy of the Reference Gaussian State `S(tau)`**\n\nThe entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state is given by the formula:\n`S(tau) = (nu + 1/2) * ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2) * ln(nu - 1/2)`\nHere, `nu` is the symplectic eigenvalue of the state's covariance matrix `V`. For a single mode, `nu = sqrt(det(V))`.\n\nThe covariance matrix `V` has elements defined by the quadrature operators `x = (a + a†)/sqrt(2)` and `p = i(a† - a)/sqrt(2)`:\n*   `V_11 = <x²> - <x>²`\n*   `V_22 = <p²> - <p>²`\n*   `V_12 = V_21 = (1/2)<xp + px> - <x><p>`\n\nTo find `V`, we need to calculate the first and second moments of the state `rho`.\n\n**3. Calculate Moments of the State `rho`**\n\nGiven parameters: `phi = -pi/4` and `alpha = 0.5`.\n\n*   **First Moment (`<a>`):** For the specific case `phi = -pi/4`, the state `|psi>` is an \"odd\" cat state, which is symmetric around the origin in phase space. Thus, the first moment (average displacement) is zero.\n    `<a> = <psi|a|psi> = 0`\n    This implies `<x> = 0` and `<p> = 0`.\n\n*   **Second Moments (`<a²>` and `<a†a>`):**\n    *   Any superposition of `|alpha>` and `|-alpha>` is an eigenstate of the operator `a²` with eigenvalue `alpha²`. Therefore:\n        `<a²> = <psi|a²|psi> = alpha² = 0.5² = 0.25`\n        And `<a†²> = <a²>* = 0.25` (since alpha is real).\n    *   The mean photon number `<n> = <a†a>` for an odd cat state is given by the formula `<n> = |alpha|² * coth(|alpha|²)`.\n        `<n> = <a†a> = 0.5² * coth(0.5²) = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`\n        `coth(0.25) = (e^(2*0.25) + 1) / (e^(2*0.25) - 1) = (e^0.5 + 1) / (e^0.5 - 1) ≈ (1.6487 + 1) / (1.6487 - 1) ≈ 4.083`\n        `<n> = 0.25 * 4.083 ≈ 1.0208`\n\n**4. Calculate the Covariance Matrix `V`**\n\nNow we can find the elements of `V`:\n*   `V_11 = <x²> = (1/2) * [<a²> + <a†²> + 2<a†a> + 1] = (1/2) * [0.25 + 0.25 + 2*(1.0208) + 1] = (1/2) * [0.5 + 2.0416 + 1] = 0.5 * 3.5416 = 1.7708`\n*   `V_22 = <p²> = (1/2) * [-<a²> - <a†²> + 2<a†a> + 1] = (1/2) * [-0.25 - 0.25 + 2*(1.0208) + 1] = (1/2) * [-0.5 + 2.0416 + 1] = 0.5 * 2.5416 = 1.2708`\n*   Since the moments `<a²>` and `<a†²>` are real, the off-diagonal terms are zero (`V_12 = 0`).\n\n**5. Calculate `nu` and `S(tau)`**\n\n*   Calculate the determinant of the covariance matrix:\n    `det(V) = V_11 * V_22 = 1.7708 * 1.2708 ≈ 2.25`\n    (The exact calculation yields `det(V) = 2.25`).\n\n*   Calculate the symplectic eigenvalue `nu`:\n    `nu = sqrt(det(V)) = sqrt(2.25) = 1.5`\n\n*   Finally, calculate the entropy `S(tau)`:\n    `S(tau) = (1.5 + 0.5) * ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5) * ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n    `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2) - 1 * ln(1)`\n    `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2) - 0`\n    `S(tau) ≈ 2 * 0.6931 = 1.3862`\n\nThe non-Gaussianity `nG` is equal to `S(tau)`, which is approximately 1.38.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.25\nB) 1.38\nC) 2.48\nD) 0\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
