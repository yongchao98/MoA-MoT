    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the oscillation frequency.\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State\n\nThe particle is spin 1/2 and is initially \"aligned\" with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in the lowest energy state. The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu}$ in a magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is $H = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}$.\nGiven $\\vec{\\mu} = \\gamma \\vec{S}$, where $\\vec{S}$ is the spin operator and $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\nThe z-component of spin is $S_z$. For a spin 1/2 particle, the eigenvalues of $S_z$ are $+\\hbar/2$ and $-\\hbar/2$, corresponding to the eigenstates $|+z\\rangle$ (spin up) and $|-z\\rangle$ (spin down).\n\nThe initial Hamiltonian is $H_i = -\\gamma S_z B$. The energy eigenvalues are $E = -\\gamma B m_s \\hbar$, where $m_s = \\pm 1/2$.\n*   For spin up ($|+z\\rangle$), $E_{\\uparrow} = -\\gamma B (\\hbar/2)$.\n*   For spin down ($|-z\\rangle$), $E_{\\downarrow} = +\\gamma B (\\hbar/2)$.\n\nAssuming $\\gamma B > 0$, the lowest energy state is the spin-up state. Therefore, the initial state of the particle at time $t=0$ is:\n$|\\psi(0)\\rangle = |+z\\rangle$.\n\n### 2. Define the New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution\n\nAt $t=0$, the magnetic field is switched to $\\vec{B}' = B\\hat{j}$ (pointing in the +Y direction). The new Hamiltonian for $t>0$ is:\n$H_f = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}' = -\\gamma (\\vec{S} \\cdot B\\hat{j}) = -\\gamma B S_y$.\n\nThe time evolution of the state is governed by the Schrödinger equation with this new Hamiltonian:\n$|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{-iH_f t / \\hbar} |\\psi(0)\\rangle = e^{-i(-\\gamma B S_y)t / \\hbar} |+z\\rangle = e^{i \\gamma B t S_y / \\hbar} |+z\\rangle$.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Expectation Value\n\nWe need to find the expectation value (average) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle$.\n$\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle \\psi(t) | S_z | \\psi(t) \\rangle$.\n\nWe can solve this using two common methods.\n\n#### Method 1: Larmor Precession (Ehrenfest's Theorem)\n\nThe time evolution of the expectation value of the spin operator is given by:\n$\\frac{d}{dt}\\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{i\\hbar}\\langle[\\vec{S}, H_f]\\rangle$\n\nSubstituting $H_f = -\\gamma B S_y$:\n$\\frac{d}{dt}\\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{1}{i\\hbar}\\langle[S_z, -\\gamma B S_y]\\rangle = \\frac{-\\gamma B}{i\\hbar}\\langle[S_z, S_y]\\rangle$\n\nUsing the spin commutation relation $[S_z, S_y] = -i\\hbar S_x$:\n$\\frac{d}{dt}\\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{-\\gamma B}{i\\hbar}(-i\\hbar \\langle S_x \\rangle) = \\gamma B \\langle S_x \\rangle$  (Eq. 1)\n\nSimilarly, for $\\langle S_x \\rangle$:\n$\\frac{d}{dt}\\langle S_x \\rangle = \\frac{1}{i\\hbar}\\langle[S_x, -\\gamma B S_y]\\rangle = \\frac{-\\gamma B}{i\\hbar}\\langle[S_x, S_y]\\rangle$\n\nUsing the commutation relation $[S_x, S_y] = i\\hbar S_z$:\n$\\frac{d}{dt}\\langle S_x \\rangle = \\frac{-\\gamma B}{i\\hbar}(i\\hbar \\langle S_z \\rangle) = -\\gamma B \\langle S_z \\rangle$ (Eq. 2)\n\nNow we have a system of two coupled differential equations. We can solve them by differentiating Eq. 1 with respect to time:\n$\\frac{d^2}{dt^2}\\langle S_z \\rangle = \\gamma B \\frac{d}{dt}\\langle S_x \\rangle$\n\nSubstitute Eq. 2 into this:\n$\\frac{d^2}{dt^2}\\langle S_z \\rangle = \\gamma B (-\\gamma B \\langle S_z \\rangle) = -(\\gamma B)^2 \\langle S_z \\rangle$\n\nThis is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, $\\ddot{x} = -\\omega^2 x$. By comparison, the angular frequency of oscillation is:\n$\\omega = \\gamma B$\n\n#### Method 2: Energy Eigenstate Decomposition\n\nThe oscillation frequency of the expectation value of an observable in a two-level system is given by the energy difference between the levels, $\\omega = \\Delta E / \\hbar$.\n\n1.  Find the eigenvalues of the new Hamiltonian $H_f = -\\gamma B S_y$. The eigenvalues of $S_y$ are $\\pm \\hbar/2$.\n2.  The energy eigenvalues are therefore:\n    *   $E_1 = -\\gamma B (+\\hbar/2) = -\\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2}$\n    *   $E_2 = -\\gamma B (-\\hbar/2) = +\\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2}$\n3.  The energy difference between these two states is:\n    $\\Delta E = E_2 - E_1 = \\left(\\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2}\\right) = \\gamma B \\hbar$.\n4.  The oscillation frequency is given by the Bohr frequency condition:\n    $\\omega = \\frac{\\Delta E}{\\hbar} = \\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{\\hbar} = \\gamma B$.\n\nThis method works because the initial state $|+z\\rangle$ is a superposition of the energy eigenstates of $H_f$ (which are the eigenstates of $S_y$), and the observable $S_z$ has non-zero off-diagonal matrix elements in the $S_y$ basis. Both conditions are met.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The average z-component of the particle's moment, $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle$, oscillates with an angular frequency of $\\omega = \\gamma B$. This is the well-known Larmor frequency.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nD) gamma*B\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
