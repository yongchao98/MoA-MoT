    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound.\n\n### 1. Analyze the FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules. This peak typically spans from about 2500 to 3300 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. For a carboxylic acid, this peak usually appears between 1700 and 1725 cm⁻¹.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the choices.\n\n### 2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Data\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated alkanoic acids, which is consistent with this observation.\n*   **A signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This is a complex splitting pattern. For a proton to show this pattern, it must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1), giving a doublet (n+1=2).\n    *   Two adjacent protons (n=2), giving a triplet (n+1=3).\n    *   Three adjacent protons (n=3), giving a quartet (n+1=4).\n    The set of neighboring protons is {1H, 2H, 3H}.\n*   **A different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** For a proton to show this pattern, it must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1), giving a doublet (n+1=2).\n    *   Two adjacent protons (n=2), giving a triplet (n+1=3).\n    *   Another group of two adjacent protons (n=2), giving another triplet (n+1=3).\n    The set of neighboring protons is {1H, 2H, 2H}.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Candidate Structure\n\nWe need to find the structure that has one proton with {1H, 2H, 3H} neighbors AND another proton with {1H, 2H, 2H} neighbors. Let's analyze the protons on the carbon backbone for each option, as these are the most likely to have such complex splitting.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`HOOC-CH(b)(Et)-CH(c)(Et)-CH₂(f)-CH₃(g)`\n*   Proton **H(c)** is coupled to H(b) (1H), the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H), and the CH₂(f) of the pentanoic chain (2H). Neighbors = {1H, 2H, 2H}. This gives a **dtt** signal.\n*   No proton in this molecule has a {1H, 2H, 3H} neighbor set. For example, H(b) has neighbors {1H, 2H}. Thus, there is no `dtq` signal.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`HOOC-CH₂(b)-CH(c)(Me)-CH(d)(Me)-CH₃(e)`\n*   Proton **H(c)** is coupled to CH₂(b) (2H), H(d) (1H), and the methyl group CH₃ (3H). Neighbors = {1H, 2H, 3H}. This gives a **dtq** (or tdq) signal.\n*   No proton in this molecule has a {1H, 2H, 2H} neighbor set. For example, H(d) has neighbors {1H, 3H, 3H}. Thus, there is no `dtt` signal.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid**\n`HOOC-CH₂(b)-CH(c)(Me)-CH(d)(Me)-CH₂(e)-CH₃(f)`\n*   Proton **H(d)** is coupled to H(c) (1H), CH₂(e) (2H), and its methyl group (3H). Neighbors = {1H, 2H, 3H}. This gives a **dtq** signal.\n*   Proton **H(c)** is also coupled to H(d) (1H), CH₂(b) (2H), and its methyl group (3H). Neighbors = {1H, 2H, 3H}. This gives another **dtq** signal.\n*   There is no proton with a {1H, 2H, 2H} neighbor set. Thus, there is no `dtt` signal.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\nStructure:\n```\n           Et(f)          Et(h)\n           |              |\n(a)CH₃ -- CH(b) -- CH(c) -- CH₂(d) -- COOH\n```\n*   Let's analyze proton **H(b)** (on C4):\n    *   It is adjacent to **CH₃(a)** (3 protons) → gives a quartet.\n    *   It is adjacent to **H(c)** (1 proton) → gives a doublet.\n    *   It is adjacent to the **CH₂** of its ethyl group **Et(h)** (2 protons) → gives a triplet.\n    *   The neighbors of H(b) are {1H, 2H, 3H}. This proton will show a **dtq** (doublet of triplets of quartets) signal. This matches the data.\n\n*   Now let's analyze proton **H(c)** (on C3):\n    *   It is adjacent to **H(b)** (1 proton) → gives a doublet.\n    *   It is adjacent to the **CH₂(d)** group (2 protons) → gives a triplet.\n    *   It is adjacent to the **CH₂** of its ethyl group **Et(f)** (2 protons) → gives another triplet.\n    *   The neighbors of H(c) are {1H, 2H, 2H}. This proton will show a **dtt** (doublet of triplets of triplets) signal. This also matches the data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMolecule D, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, is the only structure that contains a proton (H_b) that would produce a `dtq` signal and a different proton (H_c) that would produce a `dtt` signal. Therefore, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
