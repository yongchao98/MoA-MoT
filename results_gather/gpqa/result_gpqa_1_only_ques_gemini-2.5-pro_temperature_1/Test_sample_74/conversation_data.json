    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the provided DNA sequence of the construct and determine why it fails to produce the expected full-length GADD45G fusion protein.\n\nThe sequence is the plus strand (coding strand), which has the same sequence as the mRNA (with T instead of U). Translation starts at the first ATG codon. Let's break down the sequence into codons from the start:\n\n1.  **Start Codon:** The sequence begins with `ATG`. This is the start codon, coding for Methionine (M).\n2.  **HA Tag:** The problem states an N-terminal HA tag was added. The amino acid sequence for the HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. Let's see if the DNA sequence codes for this.\n    *   `ATG` (M - initiator methionine)\n    *   `TAC` (Y - Tyrosine)\n    *   `CCA` (P - Proline)\n    *   `TAC` (Y - Tyrosine)\n    *   `GAT` (D - Aspartic Acid)\n    *   `GTT` (V - Valine)\n    *   `CCA` (P - Proline)\n    *   `GAT` (D - Aspartic Acid)\n    *   `TAC` (Y - Tyrosine)\n    *   `GCC` (A - Alanine)\n    The sequence `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC` correctly codes for the HA tag `YPYDVPDYA`. So far, the construct seems correct.\n\n3.  **Sequence after the HA Tag:** Let's look at the codons immediately following the HA tag sequence. The sequence continues:\n    *   `...GCC` `AAA` `TGA` `CTC TGG...`\n    *   The codon after `GCC` (Alanine) is `AAA`, which codes for Lysine (K).\n    *   The codon immediately after `AAA` is `TGA`.\n\n4.  **Identify the Problem:** `TGA` is one of the three stop codons in the standard genetic code (along with `TAA` and `TAG`). When the ribosome encounters a stop codon in the mRNA sequence, it terminates translation.\n\nTherefore, the ribosome will translate the initiator methionine, the 9-amino-acid HA tag, and one additional lysine, and then it will stop. The rest of the sequence, which corresponds to the GADD45G protein, will not be translated. This results in the production of a tiny, 11-amino-acid peptide instead of the desired full-length fusion protein, explaining the observed failure of overexpression.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** This is precisely what we found. The presence of a premature `TGA` stop codon causes early termination. This is the correct explanation.\n*   **B) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This is incorrect for two reasons. First, the stop codon in the sequence is `TGA`, not `TAA`. Second, stop codons are not recognized by tRNAs; they are recognized by protein release factors that terminate translation. The lack of a tRNA for a stop codon is the *mechanism* of termination, not a defect.\n*   **C) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** We checked the sequence for the HA tag, and it is correct. It does not have a missense mutation.\n*   **D) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** While linkers can be important, their absence does not automatically trigger proteolysis. More importantly, the primary issue is that the full-length protein is never synthesized in the first place due to the premature stop codon.\n\nThe most direct and accurate reason for the failure is the premature stop codon.\n\n<<<A>>>"
