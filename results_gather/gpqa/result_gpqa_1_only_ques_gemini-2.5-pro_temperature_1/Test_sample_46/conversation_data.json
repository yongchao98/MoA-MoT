    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\n*   The formula for DBE is: C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DBE of 5 typically indicates the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O) or another ring.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature for a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This value is characteristic of an ester, which is often found between 1715-1750 cm⁻¹. The position at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests it might be conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring. An amide C=O stretch is usually found at a lower frequency (1630-1690 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, and its triplet (t) multiplicity means it's adjacent to a group with 2 protons (a -CH₂- group). This is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃) in an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons, and its quartet (q) multiplicity means it's adjacent to a group with 3 protons (a -CH₃ group). This is the corresponding methylene group (-CH₂-) of the ethyl group. The downfield chemical shift of 4.5 ppm indicates that this -CH₂- group is attached to an electronegative atom, most likely an oxygen atom in an ester (-COO-CH₂-) or ether (Ar-O-CH₂-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2 protons. This signal, combined with the IR data, is definitively the two protons of the primary amine (-NH₂). The broadness is due to quadrupolar relaxation and/or chemical exchange with trace amounts of acid or water.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to 2 protons, is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The large difference in chemical shift between the two doublets indicates that one substituent is a strong electron-donating group (EDG), which shields the adjacent protons (shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm), and the other is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), which deshields its adjacent protons (shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure**\n\n*   From the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n    *   A primary amine group (-NH₂)\n    *   An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)\n    *   A para-disubstituted benzene ring\n    *   An ester carbonyl group (C=O)\n*   The -NH₂ group is an EDG, and an ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) is an EWG. Placing these two groups in a para (1,4) position on the benzene ring satisfies all the NMR and IR data.\n*   The proposed structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Verify the Proposed Structure with the Options**\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** The structure is H₂N-C₆H₄-COOCH₂CH₃.\n    *   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂. Correct.\n    *   **IR:** Contains -NH₂ and a conjugated ester C=O. Correct.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Contains an ethyl group, a para-disubstituted ring with an EDG and EWG, and an -NH₂ group. All chemical shifts and multiplicities match the data. **This is a perfect match.**\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The structure is CH₃CH₂COO-C₆H₄-NH₂. The CH₂ group would be a quartet around 2.6 ppm (next to C=O), not 4.5 ppm. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted compound, which would give a more complex aromatic splitting pattern, not two doublets. Also, it is a primary amide, which has a C=O stretch at a lower frequency (~1660 cm⁻¹) than the observed 1720 cm⁻¹. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide. It would show only one N-H stretch in the IR and a 1H signal for the N-H proton in the NMR. It would also have a formyl proton (CHO) signal around 8-8.5 ppm. This is incorrect.\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
