    "Here is a step-by-step solution to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n**1. Understand the Formula for Equilibrium Temperature**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet depends on the star's temperature ($T_*$), the star's radius ($R_*$), the planet's semi-major axis ($a$), and the planet's albedo ($A$). The formula is:\n\n$T_{eq} = T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A)^{1/4}$\n\n**2. Set up the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n\nWe need to find the ratio $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$. Let's write the expression for the ratio using the formula above:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A_1)^{1/4}}{T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nSeveral terms are common to both planets or given as equal:\n*   The star's temperature ($T_*$) and radius ($R_*$) are the same for both planets.\n*   The problem states that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$).\n\nCanceling these common terms, the equation simplifies to:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we first need to find the ratio of their semi-major axes ($a_2 / a_1$).\n\n**3. Relate Semi-major Axis to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K_*$) of a star, induced by a planet in a circular orbit, can be expressed as:\n\n$K_* \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{GM_*}{a}}$\n\n(This assumes the planet's mass $M_p$ is much smaller than the star's mass $M_*$, and the inclination is close to 90°, which is a reasonable assumption since the planets were also detected via transit).\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n\n$a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K_*^2}$\n\n**4. Determine the Ratio of the Semi-major Axes**\n\nNow we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$ using the formula for $a$:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_{*,2}^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_{*,1}^2)}$\n\nThe gravitational constant ($G$) and the star's mass ($M_*$) cancel out, leaving:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left( \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{K_{*,1}}{K_{*,2}} \\right)^2$\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratios of Mass and Radial Velocity Amplitude**\n\nFirst, the ratio of the planet masses:\n$M_{p1} = 7 M_{Earth}$\n$M_{p2} = 5 M_{Earth}$\n$\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\nNext, the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes ($K_*$). The RV amplitude is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$).\n$K_* = c \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$\nTherefore, the ratio of the RV amplitudes is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n$\\frac{K_{*,1}}{K_{*,2}} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1}{\\Delta \\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n**6. Calculate the Numerical Value of the Semi-major Axis Ratio**\n\nSubstitute the mass and RV amplitude ratios into the equation for $a_2 / a_1$:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n**7. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio**\n\nFinally, substitute the value of $a_2/a_1$ back into the simplified temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
