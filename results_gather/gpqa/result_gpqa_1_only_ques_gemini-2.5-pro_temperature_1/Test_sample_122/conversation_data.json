    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Frames of Reference and Given Information**\n\n*   **Galaxy Frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame of reference. We want to find the distance traveled in this frame.\n*   **Ejecta Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame of reference. It is moving at a high velocity relative to the Galaxy frame.\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** The ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at `v = 60,000 km/s`. This is the relative velocity between the two frames.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt'):** The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's clock) is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is called the proper time because it's measured by a clock that is at rest in its own frame.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** The speed of light is approximately `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Physics Principle**\n\nThis is a problem in special relativity. Because the ejecta is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, we must account for the effects of time dilation. Time dilation means that time passes at different rates for observers in different inertial frames of reference. A clock moving relative to an observer will be measured to tick slower than a clock that is stationary relative to the observer.\n\nThe formula for time dilation is:\n`Δt = γ * Δt'`\n\nWhere:\n*   `Δt` is the time elapsed in the stationary frame (the Galaxy).\n*   `Δt'` is the proper time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta).\n*   `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n\nThe Lorentz factor depends on the relative velocity `v` and the speed of light `c`.\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nFirst, let's find the ratio `v/c`:\n`v/c = (60,000 km/s) / (300,000 km/s) = 0.2`\n\nNow, square this value:\n`(v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n\nNow, plug this into the Lorentz factor formula:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\nCalculating the value:\n`sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`\n`γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\n**4. Calculate the Time Elapsed in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt)**\n\nUsing the time dilation formula:\n`Δt = γ * Δt'`\n`Δt = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n`Δt ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n\nSo, while 50 seconds pass on the ejecta's clock, an observer in the Galaxy's reference frame would measure about 51.03 seconds passing.\n\n**5. Calculate the Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame**\n\nThe distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's frame is its velocity (in that frame) multiplied by the time elapsed (in that frame).\n`Distance = v * Δt`\n\nUsing the precise form for `Δt` for better accuracy:\n`Distance = v * (γ * Δt')`\n`Distance = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n`Distance = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n`Distance = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n`Distance ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 km`\n`Distance ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**6. Compare with the Options**\n\n*   A) 3,060,000 km\n*   B) 2,880,000 km\n*   C) 3,000,000 km (This is the non-relativistic answer: 60,000 km/s * 50 s)\n*   D) 2,940,000 km (This results from incorrectly multiplying by the `sqrt(1-v²/c²)` factor instead of dividing)\n\nOur calculated value of `3,061,862 km` is extremely close to option A. The small difference is due to rounding in the options.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
