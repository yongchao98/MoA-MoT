    "Here's a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct combination.\n\n**Part 1: Thermodynamics of Oxygen as an Oxidant**\n\nThe strength of an oxidizing agent is determined by its standard reduction potential (E°). A more positive E° indicates a stronger oxidant. We need to compare the reduction potential of oxygen in basic and acidic solutions.\n\n*   **In acidic solution:** The half-reaction is:\n    O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l)\n    The standard reduction potential is **E° = +1.23 V**.\n\n*   **In basic solution:** The half-reaction is:\n    O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq)\n    The standard reduction potential is **E° = +0.40 V**.\n\nComparing the two potentials, +0.40 V is significantly less positive than +1.23 V. This means that oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions compared to acidic solutions.\n\nSo, the first part of the statement should be:\n\"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\"\n\nThis eliminates options B and D. We are left with A and C.\n\n**Part 2: Kinetics of Oxygen Reaction**\n\nThe second part of the statement is:\n\"Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.\"\n\nThis statement highlights a classic concept in chemistry: the difference between thermodynamics (what is favorable) and kinetics (how fast it happens).\n\nIn acidic solution, oxygen is thermodynamically a very strong oxidant (E° = +1.23 V). Based on this high potential, one might expect it to react very quickly. However, the reduction of oxygen is known to be a kinetically slow process. This is because the reaction has a high activation energy, partly due to the strength of the O=O double bond which must be broken. In electrochemistry, this is described as a high \"overpotential\" for oxygen reduction.\n\nTherefore, despite being a thermodynamically strong oxidant in acidic solution, oxygen reacts **slower** than one would expect. The term \"slower\" in this context means \"slowly\" or \"sluggishly\" and contrasts the kinetic reality with the thermodynamic potential. It is a defining kinetic feature of oxygen.\n\nLet's assemble the full statement using this logic:\n\"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\"\n\nThis combination corresponds to option C.\n\n*   **weaker**: Correctly identifies that O₂ has a lower reduction potential in basic solution compared to acidic solution.\n*   **slower**: Correctly identifies the key kinetic property of oxygen reduction – that it is sluggish and slow, especially when contrasted with its high thermodynamic driving force in acidic solution.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination is weaker – slower.\n\n<<<C>>>"
