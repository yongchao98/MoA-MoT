    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$. In a detector like a bubble chamber, \"observing a decay\" means being able to see the track of the parent particle $X^0$ as distinct from its creation point before it decays into $Y^+$ and $Z^-$. If the particle travels a distance `L` before decaying, the detector's resolution `d` must be smaller than or equal to `L` (`d ≤ L`) to resolve the track.\n\nThe condition \"observe at least 30% of the decays\" means that for 30% of the particles, the distance they travel before decaying (`L`) must be greater than the detector's resolution (`d`). We are looking for the threshold value of this resolution.\n\n**2. Relativistic Calculations**\n\nThe particle $X^0$ is moving at a relativistic speed. We need to account for time dilation and length contraction effects using the principles of special relativity.\n\n*   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**: The total energy `E` of a particle is related to its rest mass `m₀` by the equation $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$. In particle physics units, this is often simplified to $E = \\gamma m_0$.\n    Given:\n    $E = 27 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $m_0 = 3.41 \\text{ GeV/c²}$\n\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0 c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.9179$\n\n*   **Mean Lifetime in the Lab Frame ($\\tau$)**: The particle's proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) is its average lifetime in its own rest frame. In the lab frame (the bubble chamber), this lifetime is dilated by the factor $\\gamma$.\n    $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n    Given $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}$,\n    $\\tau = 7.9179 \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) = 6.334 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ s}$\n\n*   **Mean Decay Length in the Lab Frame ($L_{mean}$)**: This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It is given by $L_{mean} = v \\times \\tau$, where `v` is the particle's velocity.\n    We can calculate `v` from $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1-(v/c)^2}$, but a more direct way to calculate the mean decay length is:\n    $L_{mean} = v \\gamma \\tau_0 = (\\beta c) \\gamma \\tau_0 = (\\beta \\gamma) c \\tau_0$\n    where $\\beta = v/c$. We know that $\\beta\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n    $L_{mean} = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n    $L_{mean} = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\times \\sqrt{(7.9179)^2 - 1}$\n    $L_{mean} = (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\times \\sqrt{62.69 - 1}$\n    $L_{mean} = (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\times \\sqrt{61.69}$\n    $L_{mean} = (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\times 7.854$\n    $L_{mean} \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**3. Applying the Decay Law**\n\nThe decay of unstable particles follows an exponential law. The probability that a single particle travels a distance `L` greater than some value `d` before decaying is given by:\n$P(L > d) = e^{-d/L_{mean}}$\n\nWe require that at least 30% of the decays are observed, which means we need the resolution `d` to be such that $P(L > d) \\ge 0.30$.\n$e^{-d/L_{mean}} \\ge 0.30$\n\nTo find the minimum required resolution (which corresponds to the maximum possible value for `d`), we set the equation at the threshold:\n$e^{-d/L_{mean}} = 0.30$\n\nNow, we solve for `d`:\n$-d/L_{mean} = \\ln(0.30)$\n$d = -L_{mean} \\times \\ln(0.30)$\n$d = L_{mean} \\times \\ln(1/0.30)$\n$d = L_{mean} \\times \\ln(10/3)$\n\nUsing $\\ln(10/3) \\approx 1.204$:\n$d = (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.204$\n$d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nOur calculated value is $d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. We now compare this result to the given options:\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n\nThe value $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is closest to option B, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The small discrepancy (around 9%) is likely due to a minor inconsistency in the numbers provided in the problem statement (e.g., a typo in the mass or proper lifetime). Given the choices, option B is the only physically plausible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
