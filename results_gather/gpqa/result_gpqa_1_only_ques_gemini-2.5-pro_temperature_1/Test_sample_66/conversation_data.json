    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state and the measurement:**\n    *   The initial state of the two-electron system is given in the coupled angular momentum basis as $|\\psi> = |l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   In this state, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$, and the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum is $m=-1$. The eigenvalue of the total z-component of angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the state corresponding to the measurement outcome:**\n    *   A measurement is made on the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   The question asks for the joint probability of getting the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ and $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$.\n    *   The eigenstate corresponding to an $L_{1z}$ eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ has the magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenstate corresponding to an $L_{2z}$ eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ has the magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   The state representing this specific measurement outcome is described in the uncoupled basis as $|\\phi> = |l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the probability:**\n    *   The probability of obtaining a specific measurement outcome is given by the square of the magnitude of the projection of the initial state onto the outcome state.\n    *   Probability $P = |<\\phi|\\psi>|^2 = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$.\n    *   The term $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\n4.  **Apply the selection rule for angular momentum addition:**\n    *   A fundamental principle (selection rule) in the addition of angular momenta is that the total magnetic quantum number $m$ must be equal to the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers, i.e., $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    *   If $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$, the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n    *   In our initial state, we have $m = -1$.\n    *   For our desired measurement outcome, we have $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. The sum is $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Since $m = -1$ and $m_1 + m_2 = -2$, we have $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Because the selection rule is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero: $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, the probability of this measurement outcome is $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nAlternatively, one can reason using the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. The measurement outcome state $|1, -1; 1, -1>$ is also an eigenstate of $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ with eigenvalue $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = (-1-1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Since these two states are eigenstates of the same Hermitian operator ($L_z$) with different eigenvalues ($-\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$), they must be orthogonal. The probability of measuring the system in a state orthogonal to its initial state is zero.\n\n<<<B>>>"
