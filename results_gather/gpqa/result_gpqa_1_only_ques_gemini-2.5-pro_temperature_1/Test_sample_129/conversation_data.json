    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the lower limit on the redshift.\n\n1.  **Identify the Rest Wavelength:** The problem states that the absorption occurs at the Lyman-alpha wavelength, which is the transition of an electron in a hydrogen atom from the n=1 to n=2 energy level. The rest wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$) for this transition is approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å). This wavelength is in the far-ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n2.  **Define the Observation Constraint:** The question specifies that the objects are detected with \"optical ground-based telescopes.\" The Earth's atmosphere is opaque to most UV radiation, primarily due to the ozone layer. The atmosphere only becomes transparent to light at wavelengths longer than a certain cutoff. This \"atmospheric cutoff\" marks the beginning of the optical window for ground-based astronomy. While some photons can get through down to about 3200 Å, practical astronomical observations, especially spectroscopy which requires a good signal, are typically limited to wavelengths of about 3500-3600 Å or longer. This is the shortest wavelength that can be reliably observed from the ground.\n\n3.  **Apply the Redshift Formula:** The expansion of the universe causes the wavelength of light from distant objects to be stretched. This phenomenon is called redshift ($z$). The observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) is related to the rest wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$) by the formula:\n    $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest} \\times (1 + z)$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Minimum Redshift:** To find the *lower limit* on the redshift, we need to find the smallest `z` that shifts the Lyman-alpha line just into the observable window. This means the observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) must be equal to the shortest wavelength that a ground-based optical telescope can detect ($\\lambda_{cutoff}$).\n\n    Let's set $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{cutoff} \\approx 3500$ Å, a reasonable value for the practical limit of ground-based optical astronomy.\n\n    Now, we can solve for `z`:\n    $z = \\frac{\\lambda_{obs}}{\\lambda_{rest}} - 1$\n    $z = \\frac{3500 \\text{ Å}}{1216 \\text{ Å}} - 1$\n    $z \\approx 2.878 - 1$\n    $z \\approx 1.878$\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated redshift of approximately 1.88 is very close to option D.\n\n    Let's check what observed wavelength corresponds to the redshift in option D:\n    For $z = 1.9$:\n    $\\lambda_{obs} = 1216 \\text{ Å} \\times (1 + 1.9) = 1216 \\text{ Å} \\times 2.9 = 3526.4$ Å.\n    This wavelength (352.6 nm) is right at the blue/UV edge of the optical window (often called the U-band), which is a very sensible value for the limit of detectability.\n\n    Let's check the other options for completeness:\n    *   A) z = 1.2 -> $\\lambda_{obs} = 2675$ Å (Still in the UV, blocked by the atmosphere).\n    *   B) z = 2.4 -> $\\lambda_{obs} = 4134$ Å (Well within the observable optical range, but not the *lower limit*).\n    *   C) z = 3.0 -> $\\lambda_{obs} = 4864$ Å (Well within the observable optical range, but not the *lower limit*).\n\nTherefore, the most accurate estimate for the lower limit on the redshift is 1.9.\n\n<<<D>>>"
