    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify Neutrino Sources by Energy:**\n    First, we need to understand which solar fusion reactions produce neutrinos in the specified energy bands. The main neutrino-producing reactions and their energies are:\n    *   **pp neutrinos:** Continuous spectrum up to 420 keV.\n    *   **pep neutrinos:** Monoenergetic line at 1.44 MeV (1440 keV).\n    *   **7Be neutrinos:** Monoenergetic lines, mainly at 861 keV (from the pp-II branch).\n    *   **8B neutrinos:** Continuous spectrum up to ~15 MeV (from the pp-III branch).\n    *   **CNO neutrinos:** Continuous spectra from 13N, 15O, and 17F, extending up to ~1.7 MeV.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hypothetical Scenario:**\n    The problem states that the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Since neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, and the Sun-Earth distance is about 8.5 light-minutes, we are observing the effects of this stoppage *right now*.\n    *   The pp-III branch is the source of **8B neutrinos**. Therefore, the flux of 8B neutrinos reaching Earth is now zero.\n    *   All other reaction branches (pp-I, pp-II, CNO cycle) are stated to remain as they were.\n\n3.  **Determine the Flux in Each Band:**\n    Now let's see which neutrinos contribute to the flux in each energy band under this new condition.\n    *   **Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n        *   pp neutrinos are below this range.\n        *   7Be neutrinos (861 keV line) are above this range.\n        *   8B neutrinos are absent due to the pp-III branch stopping.\n        *   Therefore, the only remaining source of neutrinos in this band is from the **CNO cycle**.\n        *   Flux(Band 1) = Flux from CNO in the 700-800 keV range.\n\n    *   **Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n        *   The strong monoenergetic line from **7Be neutrinos at 861 keV** falls squarely within this band. This reaction occurs in the pp-II branch, which is unaffected.\n        *   The continuous spectrum of **CNO neutrinos** also contributes a small amount in this range.\n        *   8B neutrinos are absent.\n        *   Flux(Band 2) = Flux from 7Be + Flux from CNO in the 800-900 keV range.\n\n4.  **Compare the Fluxes and Find the Ratio:**\n    The ratio we need to find is Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2).\n\n    A literal calculation would compare the flux of CNO neutrinos integrated over a 100 keV window with the total flux of the 7Be line (which is vastly larger). This calculation results in a ratio of approximately 10⁻³ to 10⁻⁴, which doesn't match any of the provided options. This suggests that the question is not about a precise calculation but is a conceptual one about the relative strengths of the underlying neutrino sources.\n\n    Let's re-frame the question based on this insight:\n    *   The 700-800 keV band serves as a clean window to measure **CNO neutrinos**.\n    *   The 800-900 keV band is overwhelmingly dominated by **7Be neutrinos**. The CNO contribution here is very small in comparison.\n    *   The question is likely, therefore, asking for the approximate ratio of the total flux of CNO neutrinos to the total flux of 7Be neutrinos.\n\n5.  **Use Standard Solar Model Fluxes:**\n    Let's compare the total fluxes for these two sources as predicted by the Standard Solar Model:\n    *   Total Flux of all CNO neutrinos (13N + 15O + 17F): Φ(CNO) ≈ 5 x 10⁸ neutrinos / (cm²·s).\n    *   Total Flux of 7Be neutrinos (at 861 keV): Φ(7Be) ≈ 5 x 10⁹ neutrinos / (cm²·s).\n\n    Now, let's calculate the ratio of these total fluxes:\n    Ratio ≈ Φ(CNO) / Φ(7Be) ≈ (5 x 10⁸) / (5 x 10⁹) = 5/50 = 0.1.\n\n    This value matches one of the options perfectly. The information about stopping the pp-III branch serves to simplify the problem by removing the 8B neutrinos, making the comparison a clean one between CNO and 7Be sources.\n\nTherefore, the approximate ratio of the fluxes is 0.1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
