    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (Reactant A)\n    *   2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene (Reactant B)\n    *   Sodium iodide (NaI) at elevated temperature.\n\n*   **Analysis:** The reaction of 1,2-bis(dihalomethyl) compounds with reagents like NaI or zinc is a known method for generating highly reactive o-quinodimethane-type intermediates. In this case, reactant B, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, is treated with NaI to generate the reactive diene, 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene (let's call it DMDCH), in situ.\n\n    DMDCH (C8H8) is a highly reactive species. It possesses several diene systems that can participate in Diels-Alder reactions. Reactant A, 7-(tert-butoxy)norbornadiene, is an excellent dienophile due to its strained double bonds. The problem states that 2 equivalents of reactant B are used, corresponding to the two double bonds in reactant A.\n\n*   **Reaction:** A double Diels-Alder reaction occurs. Each of the two double bonds of the norbornadiene acts as a dienophile and reacts with one molecule of the generated DMDCH (which acts as the diene, likely via its endocyclic C1-C4 diene system).\n\n*   **Product 1:** The result is a large, symmetrical molecule. It consists of a central 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane core, with two identical, complex polycyclic cage structures fused to it at the former double bond positions (C2-C3 and C5-C6). Product 1 possesses a C2 axis of symmetry.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Aqueous sulfuric acid (H2SO4, H2O).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard acidic deprotection of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (-OtBu) at the C7 position is cleaved to form a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Product 2:** The structure is identical to Product 1, but with a 7-hydroxy group instead of the 7-tert-butoxy group. The C2 symmetry of the molecule is maintained.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reagents:** SO3 and pyridine in DMSO (Parikh-Doering oxidation).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a mild oxidation that converts the secondary alcohol at C7 into a ketone (C=O).\n*   **Product 3:** The product is the corresponding 7-keto derivative (a norbornan-7-one derivative). The molecule now possesses a plane of symmetry (Cs) that passes through the C1, C4, and C7(C=O) atoms.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n\n*   **Conditions:** Heating at 150 °C.\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is a complex molecule formed from two Diels-Alder reactions. Heating such adducts, especially those derived from strained dienophiles like norbornadiene, often leads to a retro-Diels-Alder reaction. The thermal reaction will reverse the cycloadditions.\n    *   Product 3 → 7-oxobicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene + 2 DMDCH\n*   The intermediate, 7-oxobicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (7-norbornadienone), is known to be thermally unstable. It readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination (a type of pericyclic reaction) to extrude a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) and form benzene (C6H6).\n    *   7-oxobicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene → Benzene + CO\n*   **Final Products:** The final mixture of stable organic products contains Benzene and DMDCH. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on \"final product 4\". This phrasing is ambiguous, as there are multiple products. In such problems, it's common to ask about one of the major, characterizable organic products. Let's analyze the number of distinct hydrogens for both benzene and DMDCH.\n    *   **Benzene (C6H6):** Due to its high D6h symmetry, all six hydrogen atoms are chemically equivalent. It has **1** distinct type of hydrogen. This is not among the options.\n    *   **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene (DMDCH, C8H8):** Let's analyze its symmetry to determine the number of distinct hydrogen atoms. The molecule has a C2 axis of symmetry.\n        1.  The hydrogens on the ring at positions C1 and C4 are equivalent. (Set 1)\n        2.  The hydrogens on the ring at positions C2 and C3 are equivalent. (Set 2)\n        3.  The two exocyclic methylene groups (=CH2) at C5 and C6 are equivalent by the C2 axis.\n        4.  Within a single methylene group (e.g., at C5), the two protons are attached to a prochiral sp2 carbon in a chiral molecule. Therefore, they are diastereotopic and not equivalent. Let's call them Ha and Hb.\n        5.  The C2 symmetry makes Ha at C5 equivalent to Ha at C6 (Set 3), and Hb at C5 equivalent to Hb at C6 (Set 4).\n\n    Therefore, DMDCH has **4** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\nThis value (4) matches one of the given options. The other options (7, 8, 10) are not readily explained by a plausible reaction pathway. The most straightforward chemical interpretation of the problem leads to DMDCH as a key product, which has 4 distinct hydrogen environments.\n\n<<<C>>>"
