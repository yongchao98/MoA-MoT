    "The correct answer is C. Here is a breakdown of why each statement is correct or incorrect:\n\n*   **A) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates.** This statement is **correct**. Studies using optical tweezers have shown that the frameshifting efficiency of a pseudoknot is related to its mechanical properties and the conformational states it can adopt under tension. The SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshift signals exhibit similar dynamic behaviors, which correlates with their similar frameshifting efficiencies.\n\n*   **B) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.** This statement is **correct**. Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is a crucial mechanism that occurs between ORF1a and ORF1b. It allows the ribosome to shift back one nucleotide at a \"slippery sequence\" (UUUAAAC), facilitated by a downstream RNA pseudoknot. This results in the production of two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. The frameshifting signal elements are highly conserved between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, leading to very similar structures and functions.\n\n*   **C) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA.** This statement is **incorrect**. While it is true that nsp10 and nsp14 form an active heterodimeric exonuclease (ExoN) complex that functions as a proofreading and mismatch repair enzyme, its function is not to *prevent* the breakdown of dsRNA. In fact, its proofreading mechanism involves the *exonucleolytic cleavage* (i.e., breakdown) of incorrectly incorporated nucleotides from the 3' end of the newly synthesized RNA strand. By removing mismatches, it ensures high-fidelity replication, but it does so by actively degrading the erroneous part of the RNA strand, not by preventing breakdown.\n\n*   **D) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.** This statement is **correct**. Research has shown that the ORF3a protein is a potent inducer of apoptosis. It activates caspase-8, a key initiator of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, while not significantly altering the levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, which is a central regulator of the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway. This evidence strongly supports the conclusion that ORF3a triggers apoptosis primarily through the extrinsic pathway.\n\n<<<C>>>"
