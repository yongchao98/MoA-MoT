    "Here is a step-by-step calculation of the enthalpy of formation.\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Structure**\n\nThe chemical formula given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nLet's break it down to find the molecular formula and count the types of bonds.\n\n*   **Atom Count:**\n    *   Carbon (C): There are two `(CH3)` groups, a `C=`, a `=CH-`, a `-CH2-`, a `-CH(CH3)-`, another `-CH2-`, a `-CH=`, and a `=C(CH3)2`.\n        *   From (CH3)2C=: 1 C + 2 C = 3 C\n        *   From =CH-: 1 C\n        *   From -CH2-: 1 C\n        *   From -CH(CH3)-: 1 C + 1 C = 2 C\n        *   From -CH2-: 1 C\n        *   From -CH=: 1 C\n        *   From =C(CH3)2: 1 C + 2 C = 3 C\n        *   Total Carbon = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = **12 C atoms**\n    *   Hydrogen (H):\n        *   From (CH3)2C=: 2 * 3 = 6 H\n        *   From =CH-: 1 H\n        *   From -CH2-: 2 H\n        *   From -CH(CH3)-: 1 H + 3 H = 4 H\n        *   From -CH2-: 2 H\n        *   From -CH=: 1 H\n        *   From =C(CH3)2: 2 * 3 = 6 H\n        *   Total Hydrogen = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = **22 H atoms**\n*   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n*   **Bond Count:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** There are two double bonds indicated by `=`. One in `(CH3)2C=CH-` and one in `-CH=C(CH3)2`. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds (single):**\n        *   In (CH3)2C= : 2 C-C bonds connecting the methyl groups.\n        *   Between =CH-CH2- : 1 C-C bond.\n        *   Between -CH2-CH(CH3)- : 1 C-C bond.\n        *   In -CH(CH3)- : 1 C-C bond connecting the methyl group.\n        *   Between -CH(CH3)-CH2- : 1 C-C bond.\n        *   Between -CH2-CH= : 1 C-C bond.\n        *   In =C(CH3)2 : 2 C-C bonds connecting the methyl groups.\n        *   Total C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**2. Write the Formation Reaction**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) is the enthalpy change for the reaction where one mole of the compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states.\nThe reaction is:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy Change**\n\nWe can calculate the enthalpy of formation using the given enthalpies of atomization and bond energies. The formula is:\nΔHf = [Σ(Enthalpies of atomization of reactants)] - [Σ(Bond energies of the product)]\n\n*   **Energy Input (Atomization of Reactants):**\n    This is the energy required to break all the bonds in the reactants to form gaseous atoms.\n    *   Atomization of 12 moles of Carbon: 12 mol × ΔH_atom(C) = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n    *   Atomization of 11 moles of H2 gas (breaking 11 moles of H-H bonds): 11 mol × BE(H-H) = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n    *   Total energy input = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n*   **Energy Output (Bond Formation in Product):**\n    This is the energy released when forming all the bonds in one mole of the product from gaseous atoms. It is the sum of all bond energies in the molecule.\n    *   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: 22 mol × BE(C-H) = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n    *   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: 9 mol × BE(C-C) = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n    *   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: 2 mol × BE(C=C) = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n    *   Total energy output = 8800 kJ + 1800 kJ + 600 kJ = **11200 kJ**\n\n*   **Calculate Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf):**\n    ΔHf = (Total energy input) - (Total energy output)\n    ΔHf = 13100 kJ - 11200 kJ\n    ΔHf = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**4. Check the Units of the Options**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. The options are given in kJ/mol and kJ/g. We need to check if our result matches any of the options, possibly after a unit conversion.\n\n*   Option A: 11200 kJ/mol (This is the total bond energy of the product, not the enthalpy of formation)\n*   Option B: 1900 kJ/g (The numerical value matches, but the unit is incorrect)\n*   Option C: 67.4 kJ/mol (Does not match)\n*   Option D: 11.44 kJ/g\n\nLet's convert our result from kJ/mol to kJ/g. To do this, we need the molar mass of C12H22.\n*   Molar Mass (M) = (12 × Atomic Mass of C) + (22 × Atomic Mass of H)\n*   M ≈ (12 × 12 g/mol) + (22 × 1 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol\n\nNow, convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g:\n*   ΔHf (kJ/g) = ΔHf (kJ/mol) / M (g/mol)\n*   ΔHf (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**\n\nThis value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
