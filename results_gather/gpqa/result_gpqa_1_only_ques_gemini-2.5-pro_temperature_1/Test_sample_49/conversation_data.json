    "This is a great puzzle that can be solved by understanding the standard structure of calculations in quantum field theory. Let's break down the expression to find the number of loops.\n\nThe expression is: `alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\nThe key to determining the number of loops lies in the factor of `1/(4π)`. In quantum field theory, calculations of loop diagrams involve integrating over the momenta of virtual particles circulating in the loops. In four-dimensional spacetime, each loop integral contributes a characteristic factor of `1/(16π^2)`, which can be written as **`1/(4π)^2`**.\n\nLet `L` be the number of loops in the Feynman diagram. The total factor from all the loop integrations will be:\n\n`(1/(4π)^2)^L = 1/(4π)^(2L)`\n\nIn your colleague's note, the corresponding factor is `1/(4π)^6`.\n\nBy comparing the two expressions, we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\n`2L = 6`\n\nSolving for `L`, we get:\n\n`L = 3`\n\nTherefore, the Feynman diagram contained 3 loops.\n\nLet's briefly look at the other terms to see if they are consistent with this conclusion:\n*   `alpha^3 * g^2`: These are coupling constants. Their powers indicate the number and type of vertices in the diagram. A high-order combination like this is perfectly consistent with a complex 3-loop diagram.\n*   `sqrt(2) * 8`: These are numerical factors that typically arise from symmetry, traces over matrices (like Dirac gamma matrices), and specific details of the integration. They don't tell us the number of loops.\n*   `(Q/M)^2`: This is a ratio of energy scales. Such terms are the typical result of evaluating the loop integrals, often appearing inside logarithms like `log(Q^2/M^2)`. This is also consistent with a loop calculation.\n\nThe most direct and unambiguous evidence is the `1/(4π)^6` factor, which points directly to a 3-loop calculation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
