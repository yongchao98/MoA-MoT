    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with one stereocenter at C5, and it is a pure enantiomer.\n    ```\n          O\n         //\n    CH3-CH-CH2-C-CH2-CH3\n        |\n        OCH3\n    (Stereocenter at C5)\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+). LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Reaction Outcome:** The reduction of the planar ketone group (C=O) at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride ion (H‚Åª) can attack from either face of the carbonyl group.\n    *   Attack from one face will produce the (3S) alcohol.\n    *   Attack from the other face will produce the (3R) alcohol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the starting material already has a stereocenter at C5, the two products formed will have the configurations (3S, 5S) and (3R, 5S). These two molecules are **diastereomers** because they have different configurations at one stereocenter (C3) but the same configuration at another (C5). They are not mirror images of each other.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two products are formed: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n      O       O\n     //      //\n    CH3-C-CH2-C-CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, producing pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Reaction Outcome:** The reduction of the two ketone groups creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the starting material and the reagent are achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R):** Let's examine the structure of pentane-2,4-diol. It has a potential plane of symmetry passing through the central CH2 group. The (2R, 4S) isomer has such a plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) isomer is the same meso compound (just flipped over). So, these configurations result in only one product.\n    *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These two isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts from achiral materials, they will be produced in equal amounts, forming a **racemic mixture**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: one meso compound (meso-pentane-2,4-diol) and a racemic pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined products on a Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase. It can separate compounds with different structures and it can separate diastereomers (which have different physical properties). However, it cannot separate enantiomers (which have identical physical properties in an achiral environment).\n*   **Mixture Composition:** The total mixture contains 5 stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n    2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n    4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n    5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   Compounds 1 and 2 are diastereomers. They will be separated. **(2 peaks)**\n    *   Compound 3 (meso) is a diastereomer of compounds 4 and 5. It will be separated from them. **(1 peak)**\n    *   Compounds 4 and 5 are enantiomers. They will not be separated and will elute together. **(1 peak)**\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols) and will have different retention times.\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase):** 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (meso from Rxn II) + 1 (racemate from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the combined products on a Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows for the separation of enantiomers because they interact differently with the chiral phase. It can also separate diastereomers and structurally different compounds. Essentially, it can separate all unique stereoisomers.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   Compound 1, (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, is a single chiral compound. **(1 peak)**\n    *   Compound 2, (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, is its diastereomer and will have a different retention time. **(1 peak)**\n    *   Compound 3, meso-pentane-2,4-diol, is achiral but is diastereomeric to the other diols and will have its own retention time. **(1 peak)**\n    *   Compounds 4 and 5, the (2R, 4R)/(2S, 4S) enantiomeric pair, will be separated by the chiral column. **(2 peaks)**\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral):** 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
