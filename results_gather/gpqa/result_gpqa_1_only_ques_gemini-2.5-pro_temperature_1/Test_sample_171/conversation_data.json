    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the correct equation.\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical principle.**\n    The problem states that the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This means the population of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann distribution.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann equation.**\n    The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited energy level (`N_e`) to the number of atoms in the ground state (`N_g`) is given by:\n    `N_e / N_g = (g_e / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    where:\n    *   `g_e` and `g_g` are the statistical weights of the excited and ground states.\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the two levels.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `T` is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Translate the problem statement into equations.**\n    The problem defines the \"excitation\" as the ratio of atoms in the specific energy level. We can represent this excitation for each star as `R`.\n    For star_1 with temperature `T_1`:\n    `R_1 = (N_e / N_g)_1 = (g_e / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))`\n    For star_2 with temperature `T_2`:\n    `R_2 = (N_e / N_g)_2 = (g_e / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n    The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2:\n    `R_1 = 2 * R_2`\n\n4.  **Combine the equations and simplify.**\n    Substitute the Boltzmann expressions into the relationship `R_1 = 2 * R_2`:\n    `(g_e / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_e / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]`\n\n    The statistical weight term `(g_e / g_g)` is a property of the iron atom and is the same for both stars, so it cancels out:\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n5.  **Solve for the relationship between T_1 and T_2.**\n    To solve this, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    `ln(exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))) = ln(2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)))`\n\n    Using the properties of logarithms (`ln(e^x) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`):\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)))`\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)`\n\n    Now, rearrange the equation to isolate `ln(2)`:\n    `ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)`\n\n    Factor out the common term `(ΔE / k)`:\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)`\n\n    Find a common denominator for the terms in the parenthesis:\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n6.  **Use the given numerical values.**\n    The problem gives the energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`.\n    The Boltzmann constant `k` is approximately `1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`.\n    Therefore, the ratio `(ΔE / k)` is:\n    `(ΔE / k) ≈ (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) = 1 K`\n\n    The problem is set up so that this constant factor has a numerical value of 1. Substituting this into our equation:\n    `ln(2) = (1 K) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n    This simplifies to:\n    `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n7.  **Compare with the options.**\n    This derived equation matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
