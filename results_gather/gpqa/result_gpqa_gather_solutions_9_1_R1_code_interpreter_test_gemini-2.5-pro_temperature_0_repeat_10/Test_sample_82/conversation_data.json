We can use the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2.\n\n*   Initial concentration (M1) = 0.05 M\n*   Initial volume (V1) = 20.00 cm³\n*   Final volume (V2) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   Final concentration (M2) = ?\n\nM2 = (M1 * V1) / V2\nM2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³\nM2 = 0.025 M\n\nSo, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, the moles of acid equal the moles of base (n_acid = n_base).\n\n*   Moles of acetic acid (n_acid) = Concentration * Volume = 0.025 mol/L * 0.04000 L = 0.00100 mol\n*   Concentration of NaOH (C_base) = 0.1 M\n*   Volume of NaOH at equivalence point (V_base_eq) = n_acid / C_base\n*   V_base_eq = 0.00100 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0100 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n25% titration means we have added 25% of the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point.\n\n*   Volume of NaOH added = 0.25 * 10.00 cm³ = 2.50 cm³\n*   Moles of NaOH added = 0.1 M * 0.00250 L = 0.00025 mol\n\nThe reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COO⁻Na⁺ + H₂O\n*   Initial moles of CH₃COOH = 0.00100 mol\n*   Moles of CH₃COOH reacted = 0.00025 mol\n*   Moles of CH₃COO⁻ (acetate) formed = 0.00025 mol\n*   Moles of CH₃COOH remaining = 0.00100 mol - 0.00025 mol = 0.00075 mol\n\nAt this point, the solution contains a mixture of a weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻), which forms a buffer. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\npH = pKa + log ([conjugate base] / [acid])\n\nFirst, calculate pKa:\npKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n\nNow, calculate the pH. Since the acid and its conjugate base are in the same volume, we can use the ratio of their moles.\npH = 4.733 + log (moles of CH₃COO⁻ / moles of CH₃COOH)\npH = 4.733 + log (0.00025 / 0.00075)\npH = 4.733 + log (1/3)\npH = 4.733 - 0.477\npH ≈ 4.256\n\nSo, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid (0.00100 mol) has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n\n*   Total volume of the solution = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n*   Concentration of acetate ([CH₃COO⁻]) = Moles / Total Volume = 0.00100 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.020 M\n\nThe acetate ion hydrolyzes in water, producing OH⁻ ions, making the solution basic:\nCH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n\nWe need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\nKb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\nNow we set up an ICE table to find the [OH⁻]:\nKb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.020 - x)\n\nSince Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.020 - x ≈ 0.020.\n5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.020\nx² = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.020 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\nx = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\nNow, calculate pOH and then pH:\npOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\npH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n\nSo, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at both points in the titration.\n\n### 1. Dilution of Acetic Acid\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n\n*   **Initial Concentration (M₁):** 0.05 M\n*   **Initial Volume (V₁):** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Final Volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   **Final Concentration (M₂):** Using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, the new concentration is:\n    M₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n\nSo, the concentration of the acetic acid to be titrated is **0.025 M**.\n\n### 2. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (CH₃COOH) has been neutralized by the NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This creates a buffer solution.\n\n*   **pKa Calculation:** The pKa is calculated from the given Ka value.\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:** To find the pH of this buffer, we use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n    pH = pKa + log(\\[CH₃COO⁻] / \\[CH₃COOH])\n*   **Ratio of Base to Acid:** At 25% titration, 25% of the acid is converted to the conjugate base, and 75% of the acid remains. The ratio is therefore 25/75 or 1/3.\n*   **pH Calculation:**\n    pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.73 - 0.48\n    pH ≈ 4.25\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n### 3. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution's pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion, which is a weak base.\n\n*   **Volume of NaOH Added:** First, we find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to neutralize the 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n    Moles of acid = 0.025 M × 0.040 L = 0.001 mol\n    Volume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   **Total Volume:** The total volume of the solution at the equivalence point is:\n    40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n*   **Concentration of Acetate:** The concentration of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) is:\n    \\[CH₃COO⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n*   **Hydrolysis of Acetate:** The acetate ion reacts with water, producing hydroxide ions (OH⁻).\n    CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   **Kb Calculation:** We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate, which can be found using the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) and the Ka of acetic acid.\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   **[OH⁻] Calculation:** We can now calculate the hydroxide ion concentration.\n    Kb = \\[CH₃COOH]\\[OH⁻] / \\[CH₃COO⁻]\n    5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02)\n    x² = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = \\[OH⁻] ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   **pOH and pH Calculation:**\n    pOH = -log(\\[OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nBased on these calculations, the pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Dilution Calculation**: First, we calculate the new concentration of acetic acid after it's diluted with water. The number of moles of acetic acid remains the same, but the total volume increases.\n    *   Initial moles of acetic acid = Initial Volume × Initial Concentration.\n    *   New concentration = Initial moles / New Total Volume.\n\n2.  **pH at 25% Titration**: This point is in the buffer region of the titration curve, where both the weak acid (CH3COOH) and its conjugate base (CH3COO⁻) are present. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n    *   pKa is calculated as -log10(Ka).\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, and 75% remains as the acid. So, the ratio [A⁻]/[HA] is 25/75 or 1/3.\n\n3.  **pH at the Equivalence Point**: At this point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH to form its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH3COONa). The solution's pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion (CH3COO⁻), which is a weak base.\n    *   First, calculate the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point (moles of acid = moles of base).\n    *   Then, calculate the total volume of the solution and the concentration of the acetate ion.\n    *   Calculate Kb for the acetate ion using the relationship Ka × Kb = Kw (where Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C).\n    *   Set up an equilibrium calculation for the hydrolysis reaction (CH3COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH⁻) to find the concentration of OH⁻.\n    *   Calculate pOH from the [OH⁻] concentration.\n    *   Finally, calculate the pH using the formula pH = 14 - pOH.\n\n4.  **Final Comparison**: Compare the calculated pH values with the given options to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Constants ---\nvol_acid_initial_cm3 = 20.00\nconc_acid_initial = 0.05  # M\nvol_water_cm3 = 20.00\nconc_naoh = 0.1  # M\nKa_acid = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Step 1: Dilution of Acetic Acid ---\n# Convert volumes from cm3 to L\nvol_acid_initial_L = vol_acid_initial_cm3 / 1000\nvol_water_L = vol_water_cm3 / 1000\n\n# Calculate initial moles of acetic acid\nmoles_acid = conc_acid_initial * vol_acid_initial_L\n\n# Calculate the new volume and concentration after dilution\nvol_acid_diluted_L = vol_acid_initial_L + vol_water_L\nconc_acid_diluted = moles_acid / vol_acid_diluted_L\n\n# --- Step 2: pH at 25% Titration (Buffer Region) ---\n# Calculate pKa\npKa = -math.log10(Ka_acid)\n\n# At 25% titration, the ratio of [A-]/[HA] is 0.25 / 0.75\nratio_A_HA = 0.25 / 0.75\n\n# Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(ratio_A_HA)\n\n# --- Step 3: pH at the Equivalence Point ---\n# Calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point\n# Moles of NaOH needed = moles of acid\nvol_naoh_eq_L = moles_acid / conc_naoh\n\n# Calculate the total volume at the equivalence point\ntotal_vol_eq_L = vol_acid_diluted_L + vol_naoh_eq_L\n\n# Calculate the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) at the equivalence point\nconc_acetate = moles_acid / total_vol_eq_L\n\n# Calculate Kb for the conjugate base\nKb_acetate = Kw / Ka_acid\n\n# Calculate the hydroxide ion concentration [OH-] from hydrolysis\n# Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO-] => Kb = x^2 / (conc_acetate - x)\n# We can approximate that conc_acetate - x ≈ conc_acetate\n# So, [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * conc_acetate)\nconc_OH = math.sqrt(Kb_acetate * conc_acetate)\n\n# Calculate pOH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(conc_OH)\n\n# Calculate pH from pOH\npH_at_equivalence = 14.0 - pOH_eq\n\n# --- Step 4: Print the results ---\nprint(f\"The pH at 25% titration is: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"The pH at the equivalence point is: {pH_at_equivalence:.2f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nprint(\"A) 4.57; 6.92\")\nprint(\"B) 4.73; 7.00\")\nprint(\"C) 3.17; 6.73\")\nprint(\"D) 4.26; 8.52\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated values match option D.\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The pH at 25% titration is: 4.26\nThe pH at the equivalence point is: 8.52\n\nComparing with the options:\nA) 4.57; 6.92\nB) 4.73; 7.00\nC) 3.17; 6.73\nD) 4.26; 8.52\n\nThe calculated values match option D.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Dilution of Acetic Acid**\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.

We can use the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2.\n\n*   Initial concentration (M1) = 0.05 M\n*   Initial volume (V1) = 20.00 cm³\n*   Final volume (V2) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   Final concentration (M2) = ?\n\nM2 = (M1 * V1) / V2\nM2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³\nM2 = 0.025 M\n\nSo, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, the moles of acid equal the moles of base (n_acid = n_base).\n\n*   Moles of acetic acid (n_acid) = Concentration * Volume = 0.025 mol/L * 0.04000 L = 0.00100 mol\n*   Concentration of NaOH (C_base) = 0.1 M\n*   Volume of NaOH at equivalence point (V_base_eq) = n_acid / C_base\n*   V_base_eq = 0.00100 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0100 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n25% titration means we have added 25% of the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point.\n\n*   Volume of NaOH added = 0.25 * 10.00 cm³ = 2.50 cm³\n*   Moles of NaOH added = 0.1 M * 0.00250 L = 0.00025 mol\n\nThe reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COO⁻Na⁺ + H₂O\n*   Initial moles of CH₃COOH = 0.00100 mol\n*   Moles of CH₃COOH reacted = 0.00025 mol\n*   Moles of CH₃COO⁻ (acetate) formed = 0.00025 mol\n*   Moles of CH₃COOH remaining = 0.00100 mol - 0.00025 mol = 0.00075 mol\n\nAt this point, the solution contains a mixture of a weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻), which forms a buffer. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\npH = pKa + log ([conjugate base] / [acid])\n\nFirst, calculate pKa:\npKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n\nNow, calculate the pH. Since the acid and its conjugate base are in the same volume, we can use the ratio of their moles.\npH = 4.733 + log (moles of CH₃COO⁻ / moles of CH₃COOH)\npH = 4.733 + log (0.00025 / 0.00075)\npH = 4.733 + log (1/3)\npH = 4.733 - 0.477\npH ≈ 4.256\n\nSo, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid (0.00100 mol) has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n\n*   Total volume of the solution = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n*   Concentration of acetate ([CH₃COO⁻]) = Moles / Total Volume = 0.00100 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.020 M\n\nThe acetate ion hydrolyzes in water, producing OH⁻ ions, making the solution basic:\nCH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n\nWe need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\nKb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\nNow we set up an ICE table to find the [OH⁻]:\nKb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.020 - x)\n\nSince Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.020 - x ≈ 0.020.\n5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.020\nx² = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.020 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\nx = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\nNow, calculate pOH and then pH:\npOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\npH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n\nSo, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at both points in the titration.\n\n### 1. Dilution of Acetic Acid\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n\n*   **Initial Concentration (M₁):** 0.05 M\n*   **Initial Volume (V₁):** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Final Volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   **Final Concentration (M₂):** Using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, the new concentration is:\n    M₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n\nSo, the concentration of the acetic acid to be titrated is **0.025 M**.\n\n### 2. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (CH₃COOH) has been neutralized by the NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This creates a buffer solution.\n\n*   **pKa Calculation:** The pKa is calculated from the given Ka value.\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:** To find the pH of this buffer, we use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n    pH = pKa + log(\\[CH₃COO⁻] / \\[CH₃COOH])\n*   **Ratio of Base to Acid:** At 25% titration, 25% of the acid is converted to the conjugate base, and 75% of the acid remains. The ratio is therefore 25/75 or 1/3.\n*   **pH Calculation:**\n    pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.73 - 0.48\n    pH ≈ 4.25\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n### 3. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution's pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion, which is a weak base.\n\n*   **Volume of NaOH Added:** First, we find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to neutralize the 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n    Moles of acid = 0.025 M × 0.040 L = 0.001 mol\n    Volume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   **Total Volume:** The total volume of the solution at the equivalence point is:\n    40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n*   **Concentration of Acetate:** The concentration of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) is:\n    \\[CH₃COO⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n*   **Hydrolysis of Acetate:** The acetate ion reacts with water, producing hydroxide ions (OH⁻).\n    CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   **Kb Calculation:** We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate, which can be found using the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) and the Ka of acetic acid.\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   **[OH⁻] Calculation:** We can now calculate the hydroxide ion concentration.\n    Kb = \\[CH₃COOH]\\[OH⁻] / \\[CH₃COO⁻]\n    5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02)\n    x² = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = \\[OH⁻] ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   **pOH and pH Calculation:**\n    pOH = -log(\\[OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nBased on these calculations, the pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Dilution Calculation**: First, we calculate the new concentration of acetic acid after it's diluted with water. The number of moles of acetic acid remains the same, but the total volume increases.\n    *   Initial moles of acetic acid = Initial Volume × Initial Concentration.\n    *   New concentration = Initial moles / New Total Volume.\n\n2.  **pH at 25% Titration**: This point is in the buffer region of the titration curve, where both the weak acid (CH3COOH) and its conjugate base (CH3COO⁻) are present. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n    *   pKa is calculated as -log10(Ka).\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, and 75% remains as the acid. So, the ratio [A⁻]/[HA] is 25/75 or 1/3.\n\n3.  **pH at the Equivalence Point**: At this point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH to form its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH3COONa). The solution's pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion (CH3COO⁻), which is a weak base.\n    *   First, calculate the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point (moles of acid = moles of base).\n    *   Then, calculate the total volume of the solution and the concentration of the acetate ion.\n    *   Calculate Kb for the acetate ion using the relationship Ka × Kb = Kw (where Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C).\n    *   Set up an equilibrium calculation for the hydrolysis reaction (CH3COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH⁻) to find the concentration of OH⁻.\n    *   Calculate pOH from the [OH⁻] concentration.\n    *   Finally, calculate the pH using the formula pH = 14 - pOH.\n\n4.  **Final Comparison**: Compare the calculated pH values with the given options to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Constants ---\nvol_acid_initial_cm3 = 20.00\nconc_acid_initial = 0.05  # M\nvol_water_cm3 = 20.00\nconc_naoh = 0.1  # M\nKa_acid = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Step 1: Dilution of Acetic Acid ---\n# Convert volumes from cm3 to L\nvol_acid_initial_L = vol_acid_initial_cm3 / 1000\nvol_water_L = vol_water_cm3 / 1000\n\n# Calculate initial moles of acetic acid\nmoles_acid = conc_acid_initial * vol_acid_initial_L\n\n# Calculate the new volume and concentration after dilution\nvol_acid_diluted_L = vol_acid_initial_L + vol_water_L\nconc_acid_diluted = moles_acid / vol_acid_diluted_L\n\n# --- Step 2: pH at 25% Titration (Buffer Region) ---\n# Calculate pKa\npKa = -math.log10(Ka_acid)\n\n# At 25% titration, the ratio of [A-]/[HA] is 0.25 / 0.75\nratio_A_HA = 0.25 / 0.75\n\n# Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(ratio_A_HA)\n\n# --- Step 3: pH at the Equivalence Point ---\n# Calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point\n# Moles of NaOH needed = moles of acid\nvol_naoh_eq_L = moles_acid / conc_naoh\n\n# Calculate the total volume at the equivalence point\ntotal_vol_eq_L = vol_acid_diluted_L + vol_naoh_eq_L\n\n# Calculate the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) at the equivalence point\nconc_acetate = moles_acid / total_vol_eq_L\n\n# Calculate Kb for the conjugate base\nKb_acetate = Kw / Ka_acid\n\n# Calculate the hydroxide ion concentration [OH-] from hydrolysis\n# Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO-] => Kb = x^2 / (conc_acetate - x)\n# We can approximate that conc_acetate - x ≈ conc_acetate\n# So, [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * conc_acetate)\nconc_OH = math.sqrt(Kb_acetate * conc_acetate)\n\n# Calculate pOH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(conc_OH)\n\n# Calculate pH from pOH\npH_at_equivalence = 14.0 - pOH_eq\n\n# --- Step 4: Print the results ---\nprint(f\"The pH at 25% titration is: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"The pH at the equivalence point is: {pH_at_equivalence:.2f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nprint(\"A) 4.57; 6.92\")\nprint(\"B) 4.73; 7.00\")\nprint(\"C) 3.17; 6.73\")\nprint(\"D) 4.26; 8.52\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated values match option D.\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The pH at 25% titration is: 4.26\nThe pH at the equivalence point is: 8.52\n\nComparing with the options:\nA) 4.57; 6.92\nB) 4.73; 7.00\nC) 3.17; 6.73\nD) 4.26; 8.52\n\nThe calculated values match option D.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Dilution of Acetic Acid**\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.
