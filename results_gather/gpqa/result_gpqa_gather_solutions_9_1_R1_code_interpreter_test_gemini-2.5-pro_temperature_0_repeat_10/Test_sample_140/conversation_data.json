Let's break down the reaction step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate(s)**\n\nThe reactant is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH₂), a very strong base. The amide ion (:NH₂⁻) will abstract a proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho to the bromine leaving group.\n\nIn 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n1.  **C6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n2.  **C2**, which has a deuterium atom (d).\n\nThe C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the kinetic isotope effect (KIE), the abstraction of the proton (H⁺) from C6 is faster than the abstraction of the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. However, since the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider both pathways.\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction from C6):**\n    *   The amide ion removes the proton from C6.\n    *   A carbanion is formed at C6, which then eliminates the bromide ion from C1.\n    *   This forms a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched.\n    *   The intermediate formed is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n       (Conceptual diagram)\n    Start: 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene -> Intermediate 1: 3-deuterobenzyne\n\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction from C2):**\n    *   The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This pathway is slower but still possible.\n    *   A carbanion is formed at C2, which then eliminates the bromide ion from C1.\n    *   This forms a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed from the molecule.\n    *   The intermediate formed is **benzyne** (non-deuterated).\n\n      (Conceptual diagram)\n    Start: 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene -> Intermediate 2: Benzyne\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are possible.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe nucleophile, which is the amide ion (:NH₂⁻), will now attack the triple bond of each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, liquid ammonia (NH₃).\n\n*   **Addition to Intermediate 1 (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n    *   This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2.\n    *   The amide ion can attack either carbon of the triple bond:\n        1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C1, and a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of this carbanion by NH₃ yields a product with the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C6, and a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation of this carbanion by NH₃ yields a product with the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH₂ group the lowest number (C1), the deuterium is at C3. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n    So, Pathway A leads to two distinct products: 2-deuteroaniline and 3-deuteroaniline.\n\n*   **Addition to Intermediate 2 (Benzyne):**\n    *   This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium.\n    *   The amide ion attacks one of the carbons of the triple bond (e.g., C1), forming a carbanion at the other (C2).\n    *   Protonation of the carbanion by NH₃ gives the final product.\n    *   Since there is no deuterium in this intermediate and the proton source is NH₃, the product is simply **aniline**.\n\n    So, Pathway B leads to one product: aniline.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the products from both possible pathways, we get three unique organic products:\n1.  Aniline (C₆H₅NH₂)\n2.  2-deuteroaniline (o-deuteroaniline)\n3.  3-deuteroaniline (m-deuteroaniline)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate. The strong base, amide (NH2-), abstracts a proton from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the bromine.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the possible reaction pathways:\n\n1.  **Reactant and Potential Abstraction Sites:** The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. The bromine is at the C1 position, and a deuterium atom is at the C2 position. The positions ortho to the bromine are C2 (which has a deuterium, D) and C6 (which has a hydrogen, H).\n\n2.  **Kinetic Isotope Effect:** The carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond is weaker than the carbon-deuterium (C-D) bond. Consequently, the amide base will abstract the proton from the C6 position more readily than the deuteron from the C2 position. This phenomenon is known as a primary kinetic isotope effect. However, both abstractions are possible.\n\n3.  **Pathway 1: Abstraction of Hydrogen (Major Pathway):**\n    *   The amide ion removes the hydrogen from C6.\n    *   This creates a carbanion at C6, which then eliminates the bromide ion from C1 to form a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6.\n    *   The deuterium at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   The nucleophilic amide ion (NH2-) can then attack either carbon of the benzyne triple bond:\n        *   **Attack at C1:** This leads to the formation of **3-deuterioaniline** (m-deuterioaniline) after protonation by the ammonia solvent.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** This leads to the formation of **2-deuterioaniline** (o-deuterioaniline) after protonation.\n\n4.  **Pathway 2: Abstraction of Deuterium (Minor Pathway):**\n    *   The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This pathway is slower due to the kinetic isotope effect but still occurs.\n    *   This creates a carbanion at C2, which eliminates the bromide ion from C1 to form a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n    *   In this process, the deuterium is removed. The intermediate is a non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n    *   The nucleophilic amide ion attacks this benzyne, which, after protonation, yields a single product: **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\nSince both pathways are possible, three distinct organic products can be formed from the reaction.\n\nThe possible products are:\n*   2-deuterioaniline\n*   3-deuterioaniline\n*   Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to determine the number of possible organic products:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction:** The reaction is between 1-bromobenzene-2-d and sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia. This is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Benzyne Formation):** The strong base, amide ion (NH2-), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho to the bromine atom.\n    *   The starting material has two different ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1: C6 (with a hydrogen, H) and C2 (with a deuterium, D).\n    *   **Pathway A:** The base abstracts the proton from C6. This is generally faster because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. This elimination forms a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains at C2.\n    *   **Pathway B:** The base abstracts the deuteron from C2. This elimination forms a different benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed in this process.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack):** The nucleophile, amide ion (NH2-), attacks the benzyne intermediates.\n    *   **Products from Pathway A's Intermediate (Benzyne C1-C6, D at C2):**\n        *   Attack at C1: The NH2 group adds to C1. Subsequent protonation by ammonia adds an H to C6. The final product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   Attack at C6: The NH2 group adds to C6. Subsequent protonation adds an H to C1. The final product, when numbered with the NH2 group at position 1, is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   This pathway yields **two** distinct products.\n    *   **Products from Pathway B's Intermediate (Benzyne C1-C2, no D):**\n        *   Attack at C1 or C2: The NH2 group adds to either carbon of the triple bond. In both cases, after protonation, the final product is simply **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n        *   This pathway yields **one** distinct product.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** By considering both possible elimination pathways and the subsequent addition products, we find a total of three unique organic products: 2-deuterioaniline, 3-deuterioaniline, and aniline.\n\n```python\n# This problem involves an elimination-addition reaction via a benzyne intermediate.\n\n# Step 1: Identify the possible benzyne intermediates.\n# The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d.

This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2. The positions ortho to the bromine are C2 (bearing a D) and C6 (bearing an H).\n*   **Reagent/Solvent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like NaNH2 proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n**Step 2: The Elimination Step - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH2⁻) acts as a base and abstracts an acidic proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom ortho to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions: C2 and C6.\n\n*   **Path A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the proton (H⁺) from C6. This is generally faster than removing a deuteron due to the **kinetic isotope effect** (C-H bonds are weaker and break more easily than C-D bonds).\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C6 expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains at position C2. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Path B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  Although slower, the amide ion can also remove the deuteron (D⁺) from C2.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C2 expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring. This intermediate is simply **benzyne**.\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed.\n\n**Step 3: The Addition Step - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH2⁻) now acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3).\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Path A):**\n    This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The NH2⁻ can attack either C1 or C6.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** If NH2⁻ attacks C1, a carbanion is formed at C6. Protonation of C6 by NH3 yields **2-deuteroaniline**. (The NH2 group is at C1, and the D is at C2).\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** If NH2⁻ attacks C6, a carbanion is formed at C1. Protonation of C1 by NH3 yields **3-deuteroaniline**. (The NH2 group is at C6, and the D is at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the NH2 group position 1, the D is at position 3).\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Path B):**\n    This intermediate is symmetrical. Attack by NH2⁻ at C1 or C2 leads to the same result after protonation.\n    1.  **Attack at C1 (or C2):** The NH2⁻ attacks one carbon of the triple bond, and the other carbon becomes a carbanion, which is then protonated by NH3. The resulting product has no deuterium and is simply **aniline**.\n\n**Step 4: List All Possible Products**\nBased on the analysis of the two reaction pathways, we can identify three distinct organic products:\n1.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from Path A)\n2.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from Path A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Path B)\n\nThese three molecules are isotopomers and are chemically distinct. Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The kinetic isotope effect (KIE) means that Path A (H-abstraction) is faster than Path B (D-abstraction). This affects the relative amounts of the products, but the question asks for the *number* of possible products, so we must consider all possible, even minor, pathways.\n*   The nucleophilic addition to the unsymmetrical 3-deuterobenzyne occurs at both possible sites (C1 and C6), leading to two different products.\n*   The final protonation step uses a proton (H) from the solvent (NH3), not a deuteron.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reaction produces three different organic molecules: aniline, 2-deuteroaniline, and 3-deuteroaniline.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n*   **Step 1: Identify the Reaction Type**\n    The reaction involves an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) and a very strong base (sodium amide, NaNH2) in a suitable solvent (liquid ammonia). These are the classic conditions for an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.\n\n*   **Step 2: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates (Elimination)**\n    The amide ion (NH2⁻) is a strong base that abstracts a proton from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, the bromine is at position C1. The ortho positions are C2 and C6.\n\n    *   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n\n    The base can abstract a proton from either of these positions, leading to two different pathways and two different benzyne intermediates:\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6:** The NH2⁻ base removes the proton (H⁺) from C6. Simultaneously, the bromide ion (Br⁻) leaves from C1. This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected in this step. This intermediate is called 3-deuterobenzyne.\n        (Note: Abstraction of H is kinetically faster than abstraction of D due to the kinetic isotope effect, so this is the major pathway, but the question asks for all *possible* products).\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2:** The NH2⁻ base removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2, and the bromide ion (Br⁻) leaves from C1. This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. This benzyne intermediate has no deuterium atoms; it is the standard, non-deuterated benzyne.\n\n*   **Step 3: Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne Intermediates (Addition)**\n    The nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (NH2⁻), attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3).\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway A (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n        The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium is at C2.\n        1.  **Attack at C1:** If NH2⁻ attacks C1, a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of C6 yields a product where the -NH2 group is at C1 and the deuterium is at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        2.  **Attack at C6:** If NH2⁻ attacks C6, a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation of C1 yields a product where the -NH2 group is at C6 and the deuterium is at C2. The relative positions of -NH2 and -D are meta (1,3). This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway B (non-deuterated benzyne):**\n        The triple bond is between C1 and C2. There is no deuterium.\n        3.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** Whether the NH2⁻ attacks C1 or C2, the subsequent protonation leads to the same single product: **aniline** (C6H5NH2), which contains no deuterium.\n\n*   **Step 4: Count the Distinct Products**\n    By considering all possible pathways, we have identified three unique organic products:\n    1.  2-deuterioaniline\n    2.  3-deuterioaniline\n    3.  Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe reaction of 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. The number of possible organic products can be determined by analyzing the steps of the mechanism.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe strong base, amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the carbon bearing the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n*   **C6**, which has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n*   **C2**, which has a deuterium (D) atom.\n\nDue to the kinetic isotope effect, a C-H bond is broken more easily and quickly than a C-D bond. However, both abstractions are possible, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n1.  **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains, resulting in **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n2.  **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. In this case, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule, resulting in **benzyne** (non-deuterated).\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide anion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking either carbon of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    *   Attack at C1 leads to the formation of **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   Attack at C6 leads to the formation of **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    *   Attack at either C1 or C2 of the symmetrical benzyne intermediate leads to the formation of a single product: **aniline**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the possible products from both pathways, we find three distinct organic molecules:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuteroaniline\n3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, there are three possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe reaction of 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate. The number of possible organic products can be determined by analyzing the formation of the intermediate and the subsequent nucleophilic attack.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction pathways:\n\n1.  **Formation of Benzyne Intermediates:** The strong base, amide ion (NH2-), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n    *   **Path A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion can abstract a hydrogen atom from the C6 position. This is the kinetically favored pathway because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (a phenomenon known as the kinetic isotope effect). This elimination of HBr results in the formation of **3-deuterobenzyne**, an intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6, and the deuterium atom remaining at C2.\n    *   **Path B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion can also abstract the deuterium atom from the C2 position. This pathway is slower but still possible. The elimination of DBr results in the formation of a non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate, with the triple bond between C1 and C2.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates:** The amide ion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the highly reactive benzyne intermediates.\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Path A):** The nucleophile (NH2-) can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n        *   Attack at C1 leads to the formation of **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   Attack at C6 leads to the formation of **3-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Product from benzyne (from Path B):** The nucleophile attacks the non-deuterated benzyne intermediate. Since this intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium, the attack results in a single product: **aniline**.\n\nTherefore, three distinct organic products are possible from this reaction: aniline, 2-deuterioaniline, and 3-deuterioaniline.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe reaction of 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe strong base, amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine leaving group. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two different ortho positions:\n*   **Position 6:** Contains a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position 2:** Contains a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThis leads to two possible elimination pathways, forming two distinct benzyne intermediates:\n\n1.  **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the hydrogen from C-6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C-1 creates a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium remains at C-2.\n2.  **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuterium from C-2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C-1 creates a different benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-2.\n\nIt is worth noting that due to the kinetic isotope effect, the C-H bond is broken more easily than the C-D bond, so Pathway A is faster. However, both pathways are possible and lead to two different, isomeric benzyne intermediates.\n\n### Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe nucleophile, which is the amide anion (NH₂⁻), then attacks the highly reactive benzyne intermediates. The attack can occur at either carbon of the strained triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, liquid ammonia.\n\n**Analysis of Products from Benzyne A (triple bond C1-C6):**\n*   **Attack at C-1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C-1. The resulting anion at C-6 is protonated by ammonia. The final product is aniline with the deuterium at C-2, which is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n*   **Attack at C-6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C-6. The resulting anion at C-1 is protonated. The final product is again **2-deuterioaniline**.\n\nTherefore, Benzyne A leads to only one product: 2-deuterioaniline.\n\n**Analysis of Products from Benzyne B (triple bond C1-C2):**\n*   **Attack at C-1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C-1. The anion forms at C-2 (the carbon with the deuterium). Protonation by ammonia yields aniline with the amino group at C-1 and the deuterium at C-2. This product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n*   **Attack at C-2:** The -NH₂ group adds to C-2. The anion forms at C-1. Protonation by ammonia yields aniline with the amino group at C-2 and the deuterium still at C-2. This product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the attack on Benzyne B.\n*   Attack at C-1 gives aniline with NH₂ at C-1 and D at C-2. This is 2-deuterioaniline.\n*   Attack at C-2 gives aniline with NH₂ at C-2 and an anion at C-1. Protonation of C-1 gives aniline with NH₂ at C-2 and D at C-3 (relative to the new amino group). This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\nLet's trace the positions carefully for the second case (attack at C-2 of Benzyne B):\n1.  Start: 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene.\n2.  Benzyne B formation: Remove D from C-2 and Br from C-1. The triple bond is between C-1 and C-2. The other ring positions (C-3, C-4, C-5, C-6) have hydrogens.\n3.  Nucleophilic attack: NH₂⁻ attacks C-2. An anion forms at C-1.\n4.  Protonation: The anion at C-1 is protonated by NH₃.\n5.  Final Product: The -NH₂ group is on C-2. The original C-3 is now meta to the amino group. The original C-1 is now ortho to the amino group. Since no deuterium was on C-3, this product is **3-aminobenzene-d1**, which is **m-deuterioaniline** or **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\nTherefore, the possible products are:\n*   From Benzyne A: 2-deuterioaniline\n*   From Benzyne B: 2-deuterioaniline and 3-deuterioaniline\n\nCombining these, there are two unique possible organic products: **2-deuterioaniline** and **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\nThe correct count of possible organic products is 2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2.\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is a very strong base, and this combination of reagents is characteristic of an elimination-addition reaction involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates (Elimination)**\n    The reaction is initiated by the amide ion (NH₂⁻), which acts as a strong base to abstract a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the bromine leaving group.\n\n    In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n    *   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n\n    Because there are two different atoms (H and D) at the ortho positions, two different elimination pathways are possible, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        *   The amide ion removes the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n        *   Simultaneously or subsequently, the bromide ion (Br⁻) leaves from C1.\n        *   A triple bond forms between C1 and C6.\n        *   The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched.\n        *   This forms **2-deuterobenzyne** as an intermediate.\n        *   (Note: This pathway is kinetically favored due to the kinetic isotope effect, as the C-H bond is weaker and breaks more easily than the C-D bond).\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        *   The amide ion removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2.\n        *   The bromide ion (Br⁻) leaves from C1.\n        *   A triple bond forms between C1 and C2.\n        *   The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n         \n\n3.  **Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n    The nucleophile, another amide ion (NH₂⁻), attacks one of the two carbons of the strained triple bond in each benzyne intermediate.

A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated.\n            *   The final product has the NH₂ group at C1 and the D atom at C2.\n            *   Product 2: **2-deuterioaniline**.\n\n        *   **Attack at C6:**\n            *   The NH₂ group adds to C6.

One intermediate (benzyne) yields one product (aniline). The other, unsymmetrical intermediate (2-deuterobenzyne) yields two different constitutional isomers (2-deuterioaniline and 3-deuterioaniline).\n\n    Therefore, the total number of possible organic products is three:\n    1.

Let's analyze the reaction step-by-step to determine all possible products.\n\n**Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe reagent, sodium amide (NaNH₂), is a very strong base. The amide ion (NH₂⁻) will abstract a proton from a carbon atom that is *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine leaving group.\n\nIn the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two distinct ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n1.  **Position C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom (H).\n2.  **Position C2:** This carbon is bonded to a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThe C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the **Kinetic Isotope Effect (KIE)**, the abstraction of the proton (H⁺) from C6 is faster and represents the major pathway. However, the abstraction of the deuteron (D⁺) from C2 is also possible and occurs as a minor pathway. This leads to the formation of two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A (Major):** The base (NH₂⁻) removes the proton from C6. The resulting carbanion then expels the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains in place. This intermediate is **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B (Minor):** The base (NH₂⁻) removes the deuteron from C2. The resulting carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium is removed. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuteriobenzyne):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) can attack either of these carbons, leading to two different products:\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated. The final product has the amino group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the amino group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from Intermediate B (Benzyne):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C2, and there is no deuterium. Due to the symmetry of this intermediate, attack at either C1 or C2 leads to the same single product after protonation.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The addition of the -NH₂ group followed by protonation results in **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy considering both possible elimination pathways and the subsequent addition steps, we can identify three distinct organic products:\n1.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n2.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n3.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction:** The reaction involves an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) with a very strong base (sodium amide, NaNH2) in a suitable solvent (liquid ammonia, NH3). This is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The amide ion (NH2⁻) is a strong base that abstracts a proton from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such positions:\n    *   **Position 6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Position 2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D).\n\n    Due to the kinetic isotope effect (KIE), the C-H bond is broken more easily and faster than the C-D bond. However, both reactions are possible and will occur. This leads to two different pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton (H⁺) from C-6. The resulting carbanion then loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1. This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-6. Crucially, the deuterium atom at C-2 remains on the ring. This intermediate is **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C-2. The resulting carbanion then loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1. This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n          -> This link is a placeholder, the description is what matters. Let's describe it:\n        1-bromobenzene-2-d reacts with NH2-. The base abstracts D from C2, forming a carbanion at C2. Then Br- leaves from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. The resulting benzyne has no deuterium.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The nucleophile, which is the amide ion (NH2⁻), now attacks the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3) to yield the final aniline products.\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway A (from 3-deuteriobenzyne):**\n        The nucleophile (NH2⁻) can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C-1 or C-6).\n        1.  **Attack at C-1:** The -NH2 group attaches to C-1. A carbanion forms at C-6, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH2 group at C-1 and the deuterium at C-2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        2.  **Attack at C-6:** The -NH2 group attaches to C-6. A carbanion forms at C-1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH2 group at C-6 and the deuterium at C-2. If we renumber the ring to prioritize the -NH2 group at position 1, the deuterium is now at position 3. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n        So, Pathway A produces two distinct products: 2-deuterioaniline and 3-deuterioaniline.\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway B (from non-deuterated benzyne):**\n        The nucleophile (NH2⁻) attacks the non-deuterated benzyne (triple bond between C-1 and C-2).\n        1.  **Attack at C-1 or C-2:** Due to the symmetry of this intermediate, attack at either C-1 or C-2, followed by protonation, leads to the same single product: **aniline** (C6H5NH2), which has no deuterium.\n        So, Pathway B produces one product: aniline.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    By considering both possible elimination pathways, we find a total of three unique organic products that can be formed:\n    1.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n    2.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n    3.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.

This is the kinetically favored step due to the primary kinetic isotope effect (a C-H bond is broken more easily than a C-D bond). This elimination leads to the formation of a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium atom remains at the C2 position.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion can also remove the deuterium atom from the C2 position. This process is slower but still occurs. This elimination results in a different benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. In this case, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates:** The amide ion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the highly reactive benzyne intermediates.\n    *   **Reaction of Intermediate from Pathway A:** The benzyne with the triple bond between C1 and C6 (and deuterium at C2) is attacked by an amide ion.\n        *   Attack at C1 leads to the formation of aniline-2-d after protonation by the ammonia solvent.\n        *   Attack at C6 leads to the formation of aniline-6-d, which is the same molecule as aniline-2-d.\n        *   Therefore, Pathway A yields only one product: **aniline-2-d**.\n    *   **Reaction of Intermediate from Pathway B:** The non-deuterated benzyne (triple bond between C1 and C2) is attacked by an amide ion.\n        *   Attack at either C1 or C2 results in the formation of a carbanion, which is then protonated by the ammonia solvent to yield **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n        *   Therefore, Pathway B yields only one product: **aniline**.\n\nSince two distinct benzyne intermediates are formed, two different organic products are possible.\n\nThe two possible organic products are:\n*   Aniline-2-d\n*   Aniline\n\nThus, there are a total of two possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate.

Identify the Reaction Type**\nThe reaction of an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) with a very strong base (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction. This reaction proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate called a benzyne.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) from NaNH₂ acts as a base. It abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the bromine atom. The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has two different ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6:** This has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nSince the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider both abstraction pathways, even though H-abstraction is faster than D-abstraction due to the kinetic isotope effect (KIE).\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The base removes H⁺ from C6. The resulting carbanion eliminates Br⁻ from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is unaffected. This creates the first intermediate: **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The base removes D⁺ from C2. The resulting carbanion eliminates Br⁻ from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium is removed in this process. This creates the second intermediate: **benzyne** (non-deuterated).\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n    This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the C1-C6 triple bond.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is protonated by NH₃. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6.

Let's break down the reaction step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate(s)**\n\nThe reactant is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH₂), a very strong base. The amide ion (:NH₂⁻) will abstract a proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho to the bromine leaving group.\n\nIn 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n1.  **C6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n2.  **C2**, which has a deuterium atom (d).\n\nThe C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the kinetic isotope effect (KIE), the abstraction of the proton (H⁺) from C6 is faster than the abstraction of the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. However, since the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider both pathways.\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction from C6):**\n    *   The amide ion removes the proton from C6.\n    *   A carbanion is formed at C6, which then eliminates the bromide ion from C1.\n    *   This forms a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched.\n    *   The intermediate formed is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n       (Conceptual diagram)\n    Start: 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene -> Intermediate 1: 3-deuterobenzyne\n\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction from C2):**\n    *   The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This pathway is slower but still possible.\n    *   A carbanion is formed at C2, which then eliminates the bromide ion from C1.\n    *   This forms a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed from the molecule.\n    *   The intermediate formed is **benzyne** (non-deuterated).\n\n      (Conceptual diagram)\n    Start: 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene -> Intermediate 2: Benzyne\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are possible.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe nucleophile, which is the amide ion (:NH₂⁻), will now attack the triple bond of each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, liquid ammonia (NH₃).\n\n*   **Addition to Intermediate 1 (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n    *   This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2.\n    *   The amide ion can attack either carbon of the triple bond:\n        1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C1, and a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of this carbanion by NH₃ yields a product with the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C6, and a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation of this carbanion by NH₃ yields a product with the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH₂ group the lowest number (C1), the deuterium is at C3. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n    So, Pathway A leads to two distinct products: 2-deuteroaniline and 3-deuteroaniline.\n\n*   **Addition to Intermediate 2 (Benzyne):**\n    *   This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium.\n    *   The amide ion attacks one of the carbons of the triple bond (e.g., C1), forming a carbanion at the other (C2).\n    *   Protonation of the carbanion by NH₃ gives the final product.\n    *   Since there is no deuterium in this intermediate and the proton source is NH₃, the product is simply **aniline**.\n\n    So, Pathway B leads to one product: aniline.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the products from both possible pathways, we get three unique organic products:\n1.  Aniline (C₆H₅NH₂)\n2.  2-deuteroaniline (o-deuteroaniline)\n3.  3-deuteroaniline (m-deuteroaniline)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate. The strong base, amide (NH2-), abstracts a proton from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the bromine.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the possible reaction pathways:\n\n1.  **Reactant and Potential Abstraction Sites:** The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. The bromine is at the C1 position, and a deuterium atom is at the C2 position. The positions ortho to the bromine are C2 (which has a deuterium, D) and C6 (which has a hydrogen, H).\n\n2.  **Kinetic Isotope Effect:** The carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond is weaker than the carbon-deuterium (C-D) bond. Consequently, the amide base will abstract the proton from the C6 position more readily than the deuteron from the C2 position. This phenomenon is known as a primary kinetic isotope effect. However, both abstractions are possible.\n\n3.  **Pathway 1: Abstraction of Hydrogen (Major Pathway):**\n    *   The amide ion removes the hydrogen from C6.\n    *   This creates a carbanion at C6, which then eliminates the bromide ion from C1 to form a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6.\n    *   The deuterium at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   The nucleophilic amide ion (NH2-) can then attack either carbon of the benzyne triple bond:\n        *   **Attack at C1:** This leads to the formation of **3-deuterioaniline** (m-deuterioaniline) after protonation by the ammonia solvent.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** This leads to the formation of **2-deuterioaniline** (o-deuterioaniline) after protonation.\n\n4.  **Pathway 2: Abstraction of Deuterium (Minor Pathway):**\n    *   The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This pathway is slower due to the kinetic isotope effect but still occurs.\n    *   This creates a carbanion at C2, which eliminates the bromide ion from C1 to form a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n    *   In this process, the deuterium is removed. The intermediate is a non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n    *   The nucleophilic amide ion attacks this benzyne, which, after protonation, yields a single product: **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\nSince both pathways are possible, three distinct organic products can be formed from the reaction.\n\nThe possible products are:\n*   2-deuterioaniline\n*   3-deuterioaniline\n*   Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to determine the number of possible organic products:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction:** The reaction is between 1-bromobenzene-2-d and sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia. This is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Benzyne Formation):** The strong base, amide ion (NH2-), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho to the bromine atom.\n    *   The starting material has two different ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1: C6 (with a hydrogen, H) and C2 (with a deuterium, D).\n    *   **Pathway A:** The base abstracts the proton from C6. This is generally faster because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. This elimination forms a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains at C2.\n    *   **Pathway B:** The base abstracts the deuteron from C2. This elimination forms a different benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed in this process.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack):** The nucleophile, amide ion (NH2-), attacks the benzyne intermediates.\n    *   **Products from Pathway A's Intermediate (Benzyne C1-C6, D at C2):**\n        *   Attack at C1: The NH2 group adds to C1. Subsequent protonation by ammonia adds an H to C6. The final product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   Attack at C6: The NH2 group adds to C6. Subsequent protonation adds an H to C1. The final product, when numbered with the NH2 group at position 1, is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   This pathway yields **two** distinct products.\n    *   **Products from Pathway B's Intermediate (Benzyne C1-C2, no D):**\n        *   Attack at C1 or C2: The NH2 group adds to either carbon of the triple bond. In both cases, after protonation, the final product is simply **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n        *   This pathway yields **one** distinct product.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** By considering both possible elimination pathways and the subsequent addition products, we find a total of three unique organic products: 2-deuterioaniline, 3-deuterioaniline, and aniline.\n\n```python\n# This problem involves an elimination-addition reaction via a benzyne intermediate.\n\n# Step 1: Identify the possible benzyne intermediates.\n# The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d.

This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2. The positions ortho to the bromine are C2 (bearing a D) and C6 (bearing an H).\n*   **Reagent/Solvent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like NaNH2 proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n**Step 2: The Elimination Step - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH2⁻) acts as a base and abstracts an acidic proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom ortho to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions: C2 and C6.\n\n*   **Path A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the proton (H⁺) from C6. This is generally faster than removing a deuteron due to the **kinetic isotope effect** (C-H bonds are weaker and break more easily than C-D bonds).\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C6 expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains at position C2. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Path B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  Although slower, the amide ion can also remove the deuteron (D⁺) from C2.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C2 expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring. This intermediate is simply **benzyne**.\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed.\n\n**Step 3: The Addition Step - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH2⁻) now acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3).\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Path A):**\n    This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The NH2⁻ can attack either C1 or C6.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** If NH2⁻ attacks C1, a carbanion is formed at C6. Protonation of C6 by NH3 yields **2-deuteroaniline**. (The NH2 group is at C1, and the D is at C2).\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** If NH2⁻ attacks C6, a carbanion is formed at C1. Protonation of C1 by NH3 yields **3-deuteroaniline**. (The NH2 group is at C6, and the D is at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the NH2 group position 1, the D is at position 3).\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Path B):**\n    This intermediate is symmetrical. Attack by NH2⁻ at C1 or C2 leads to the same result after protonation.\n    1.  **Attack at C1 (or C2):** The NH2⁻ attacks one carbon of the triple bond, and the other carbon becomes a carbanion, which is then protonated by NH3. The resulting product has no deuterium and is simply **aniline**.\n\n**Step 4: List All Possible Products**\nBased on the analysis of the two reaction pathways, we can identify three distinct organic products:\n1.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from Path A)\n2.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from Path A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Path B)\n\nThese three molecules are isotopomers and are chemically distinct. Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The kinetic isotope effect (KIE) means that Path A (H-abstraction) is faster than Path B (D-abstraction). This affects the relative amounts of the products, but the question asks for the *number* of possible products, so we must consider all possible, even minor, pathways.\n*   The nucleophilic addition to the unsymmetrical 3-deuterobenzyne occurs at both possible sites (C1 and C6), leading to two different products.\n*   The final protonation step uses a proton (H) from the solvent (NH3), not a deuteron.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reaction produces three different organic molecules: aniline, 2-deuteroaniline, and 3-deuteroaniline.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n*   **Step 1: Identify the Reaction Type**\n    The reaction involves an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) and a very strong base (sodium amide, NaNH2) in a suitable solvent (liquid ammonia). These are the classic conditions for an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.\n\n*   **Step 2: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates (Elimination)**\n    The amide ion (NH2⁻) is a strong base that abstracts a proton from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, the bromine is at position C1. The ortho positions are C2 and C6.\n\n    *   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n\n    The base can abstract a proton from either of these positions, leading to two different pathways and two different benzyne intermediates:\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6:** The NH2⁻ base removes the proton (H⁺) from C6. Simultaneously, the bromide ion (Br⁻) leaves from C1. This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected in this step. This intermediate is called 3-deuterobenzyne.\n        (Note: Abstraction of H is kinetically faster than abstraction of D due to the kinetic isotope effect, so this is the major pathway, but the question asks for all *possible* products).\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2:** The NH2⁻ base removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2, and the bromide ion (Br⁻) leaves from C1. This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. This benzyne intermediate has no deuterium atoms; it is the standard, non-deuterated benzyne.\n\n*   **Step 3: Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne Intermediates (Addition)**\n    The nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (NH2⁻), attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3).\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway A (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n        The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium is at C2.\n        1.  **Attack at C1:** If NH2⁻ attacks C1, a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of C6 yields a product where the -NH2 group is at C1 and the deuterium is at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        2.  **Attack at C6:** If NH2⁻ attacks C6, a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation of C1 yields a product where the -NH2 group is at C6 and the deuterium is at C2. The relative positions of -NH2 and -D are meta (1,3). This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway B (non-deuterated benzyne):**\n        The triple bond is between C1 and C2. There is no deuterium.\n        3.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** Whether the NH2⁻ attacks C1 or C2, the subsequent protonation leads to the same single product: **aniline** (C6H5NH2), which contains no deuterium.\n\n*   **Step 4: Count the Distinct Products**\n    By considering all possible pathways, we have identified three unique organic products:\n    1.  2-deuterioaniline\n    2.  3-deuterioaniline\n    3.

In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n*   **C6**, which has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n*   **C2**, which has a deuterium (D) atom.\n\nDue to the kinetic isotope effect, a C-H bond is broken more easily and quickly than a C-D bond. However, both abstractions are possible, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n1.  **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains, resulting in **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n2.  **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. In this case, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule, resulting in **benzyne** (non-deuterated).\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide anion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking either carbon of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    *   Attack at C1 leads to the formation of **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   Attack at C6 leads to the formation of **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    *   Attack at either C1 or C2 of the symmetrical benzyne intermediate leads to the formation of a single product: **aniline**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the possible products from both pathways, we find three distinct organic molecules:\n1.

The number of possible organic products can be determined by analyzing the formation of the intermediate and the subsequent nucleophilic attack.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction pathways:\n\n1.  **Formation of Benzyne Intermediates:** The strong base, amide ion (NH2-), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n    *   **Path A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion can abstract a hydrogen atom from the C6 position. This is the kinetically favored pathway because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (a phenomenon known as the kinetic isotope effect). This elimination of HBr results in the formation of **3-deuterobenzyne**, an intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6, and the deuterium atom remaining at C2.\n    *   **Path B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion can also abstract the deuterium atom from the C2 position. This pathway is slower but still possible. The elimination of DBr results in the formation of a non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate, with the triple bond between C1 and C2.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates:** The amide ion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the highly reactive benzyne intermediates.\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Path A):** The nucleophile (NH2-) can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n        *   Attack at C1 leads to the formation of **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   Attack at C6 leads to the formation of **3-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Product from benzyne (from Path B):** The nucleophile attacks the non-deuterated benzyne intermediate. Since this intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium, the attack results in a single product: **aniline**.\n\nTherefore, three distinct organic products are possible from this reaction: aniline, 2-deuterioaniline, and 3-deuterioaniline.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe reaction of 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe strong base, amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine leaving group. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two different ortho positions:\n*   **Position 6:** Contains a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position 2:** Contains a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThis leads to two possible elimination pathways, forming two distinct benzyne intermediates:\n\n1.  **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the hydrogen from C-6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C-1 creates a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium remains at C-2.\n2.  **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuterium from C-2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C-1 creates a different benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-2.\n\nIt is worth noting that due to the kinetic isotope effect, the C-H bond is broken more easily than the C-D bond, so Pathway A is faster. However, both pathways are possible and lead to two different, isomeric benzyne intermediates.\n\n### Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe nucleophile, which is the amide anion (NH₂⁻), then attacks the highly reactive benzyne intermediates. The attack can occur at either carbon of the strained triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, liquid ammonia.\n\n**Analysis of Products from Benzyne A (triple bond C1-C6):**\n*   **Attack at C-1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C-1. The resulting anion at C-6 is protonated by ammonia. The final product is aniline with the deuterium at C-2, which is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n*   **Attack at C-6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C-6. The resulting anion at C-1 is protonated. The final product is again **2-deuterioaniline**.\n\nTherefore, Benzyne A leads to only one product: 2-deuterioaniline.\n\n**Analysis of Products from Benzyne B (triple bond C1-C2):**\n*   **Attack at C-1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C-1. The anion forms at C-2 (the carbon with the deuterium). Protonation by ammonia yields aniline with the amino group at C-1 and the deuterium at C-2. This product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n*   **Attack at C-2:** The -NH₂ group adds to C-2. The anion forms at C-1. Protonation by ammonia yields aniline with the amino group at C-2 and the deuterium still at C-2. This product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the attack on Benzyne B.\n*   Attack at C-1 gives aniline with NH₂ at C-1 and D at C-2. This is 2-deuterioaniline.\n*   Attack at C-2 gives aniline with NH₂ at C-2 and an anion at C-1. Protonation of C-1 gives aniline with NH₂ at C-2 and D at C-3 (relative to the new amino group). This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\nLet's trace the positions carefully for the second case (attack at C-2 of Benzyne B):\n1.  Start: 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene.\n2.  Benzyne B formation: Remove D from C-2 and Br from C-1. The triple bond is between C-1 and C-2. The other ring positions (C-3, C-4, C-5, C-6) have hydrogens.\n3.  Nucleophilic attack: NH₂⁻ attacks C-2. An anion forms at C-1.\n4.  Protonation: The anion at C-1 is protonated by NH₃.\n5.  Final Product: The -NH₂ group is on C-2. The original C-3 is now meta to the amino group. The original C-1 is now ortho to the amino group. Since no deuterium was on C-3, this product is **3-aminobenzene-d1**, which is **m-deuterioaniline** or **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\nTherefore, the possible products are:\n*   From Benzyne A: 2-deuterioaniline\n*   From Benzyne B: 2-deuterioaniline and 3-deuterioaniline\n\nCombining these, there are two unique possible organic products: **2-deuterioaniline** and **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\nThe correct count of possible organic products is 2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2.\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is a very strong base, and this combination of reagents is characteristic of an elimination-addition reaction involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates (Elimination)**\n    The reaction is initiated by the amide ion (NH₂⁻), which acts as a strong base to abstract a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the bromine leaving group.\n\n    In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n    *   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n\n    Because there are two different atoms (H and D) at the ortho positions, two different elimination pathways are possible, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        *   The amide ion removes the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n        *   Simultaneously or subsequently, the bromide ion (Br⁻) leaves from C1.\n        *   A triple bond forms between C1 and C6.\n        *   The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched.\n        *   This forms **2-deuterobenzyne** as an intermediate.\n        *   (Note: This pathway is kinetically favored due to the kinetic isotope effect, as the C-H bond is weaker and breaks more easily than the C-D bond).\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        *   The amide ion removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2.\n        *   The bromide ion (Br⁻) leaves from C1.\n        *   A triple bond forms between C1 and C2.\n        *   The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n         \n\n3.  **Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n    The nucleophile, another amide ion (NH₂⁻), attacks one of the two carbons of the strained triple bond in each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH₃).\n\n    *   **Addition to Intermediate from Pathway B (Benzyne)**\n        *   The intermediate is symmetric benzyne, with the triple bond between C1 and C2.\n        *   Attack of NH₂⁻ at C1 or C2, followed by protonation, leads to the same product.\n        *   Product 1: **Aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂).\n\n         \n\n    *   **Addition to Intermediate from Pathway A (2-deuterobenzyne)**\n        *   The intermediate is 2-deuterobenzyne, with the triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium at C2.

A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated.\n            *   The final product has the NH₂ group at C1 and the D atom at C2.\n            *   Product 2: **2-deuterioaniline**.\n\n        *   **Attack at C6:**\n            *   The NH₂ group adds to C6.

Therefore, the original C6 is now C1. The original C2 (with the deuterium) is now at position C3 relative to the new C1.\n            *   Product 3: **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n         \n\n4.  **Conclusion**\n    The reaction proceeds through two different benzyne intermediates. One intermediate (benzyne) yields one product (aniline). The other, unsymmetrical intermediate (2-deuterobenzyne) yields two different constitutional isomers (2-deuterioaniline and 3-deuterioaniline).\n\n    Therefore, the total number of possible organic products is three:\n    1.

These are the classic conditions for an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The amide ion (NH2⁻) acts as a base and abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom ortho to the bromine atom. In the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions:\n    *   **Position 6:** Contains a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Position 2:** Contains a deuterium atom (D).\n\n    The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the kinetic isotope effect, the abstraction of the proton (H⁺) from C-6 is faster than the abstraction of the deuteron (D⁺) from C-2. However, both reactions are possible and will occur, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Path A: Abstraction of H from C-6**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the proton from C-6, forming a carbanion at this position.\n        2.  The carbanion expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n        3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom remains at C-2.

The amide ion removes the deuteron from C-2, forming a carbanion at this position.\n        2.  The carbanion expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n        3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-2. The deuterium atom has been removed. This is the standard, non-deuterated benzyne. Let's call this **Benzyne B**.\n\n         \n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzynes)**\n    The amide ion (NH2⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond.

A carbanion forms at C-6, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH2 group at C-1 and the deuterium at C-2. This is **aniline-2-d** (or o-deuterioaniline).\n        2.  **Attack at C-6:** The NH2 group adds to C-6. A carbanion forms at C-1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH2 group at C-6 and the deuterium at C-2. The relative positions of the -NH2 and -D groups are 1,3 (meta). This is **aniline-3-d** (or m-deuterioaniline).\n        Thus, Benzyne A leads to two distinct products.\n\n    *   **Addition to Benzyne B (C1-C2 triple bond, no D):**\n        The nucleophile NH2⁻ can attack either C-1 or C-2.\n        1.  **Attack at C-1:** The NH2 group adds to C-1.

Let's analyze the reaction step-by-step to determine all possible products.\n\n**Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe reagent, sodium amide (NaNH₂), is a very strong base. The amide ion (NH₂⁻) will abstract a proton from a carbon atom that is *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine leaving group.\n\nIn the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two distinct ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n1.  **Position C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom (H).\n2.  **Position C2:** This carbon is bonded to a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThe C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the **Kinetic Isotope Effect (KIE)**, the abstraction of the proton (H⁺) from C6 is faster and represents the major pathway. However, the abstraction of the deuteron (D⁺) from C2 is also possible and occurs as a minor pathway. This leads to the formation of two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A (Major):** The base (NH₂⁻) removes the proton from C6. The resulting carbanion then expels the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains in place. This intermediate is **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B (Minor):** The base (NH₂⁻) removes the deuteron from C2. The resulting carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium is removed. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuteriobenzyne):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) can attack either of these carbons, leading to two different products:\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated. The final product has the amino group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the amino group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from Intermediate B (Benzyne):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C2, and there is no deuterium. Due to the symmetry of this intermediate, attack at either C1 or C2 leads to the same single product after protonation.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The addition of the -NH₂ group followed by protonation results in **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy considering both possible elimination pathways and the subsequent addition steps, we can identify three distinct organic products:\n1.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n2.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n3.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction:** The reaction involves an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) with a very strong base (sodium amide, NaNH2) in a suitable solvent (liquid ammonia, NH3). This is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The amide ion (NH2⁻) is a strong base that abstracts a proton from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such positions:\n    *   **Position 6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Position 2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D).\n\n    Due to the kinetic isotope effect (KIE), the C-H bond is broken more easily and faster than the C-D bond. However, both reactions are possible and will occur. This leads to two different pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton (H⁺) from C-6. The resulting carbanion then loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1. This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-6. Crucially, the deuterium atom at C-2 remains on the ring. This intermediate is **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C-2. The resulting carbanion then loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1. This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n          -> This link is a placeholder, the description is what matters. Let's describe it:\n        1-bromobenzene-2-d reacts with NH2-. The base abstracts D from C2, forming a carbanion at C2. Then Br- leaves from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. The resulting benzyne has no deuterium.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The nucleophile, which is the amide ion (NH2⁻), now attacks the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3) to yield the final aniline products.\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway A (from 3-deuteriobenzyne):**\n        The nucleophile (NH2⁻) can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C-1 or C-6).\n        1.  **Attack at C-1:** The -NH2 group attaches to C-1. A carbanion forms at C-6, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH2 group at C-1 and the deuterium at C-2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        2.  **Attack at C-6:** The -NH2 group attaches to C-6. A carbanion forms at C-1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH2 group at C-6 and the deuterium at C-2. If we renumber the ring to prioritize the -NH2 group at position 1, the deuterium is now at position 3. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n        So, Pathway A produces two distinct products: 2-deuterioaniline and 3-deuterioaniline.\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway B (from non-deuterated benzyne):**\n        The nucleophile (NH2⁻) attacks the non-deuterated benzyne (triple bond between C-1 and C-2).\n        1.  **Attack at C-1 or C-2:** Due to the symmetry of this intermediate, attack at either C-1 or C-2, followed by protonation, leads to the same single product: **aniline** (C6H5NH2), which has no deuterium.\n        So, Pathway B produces one product: aniline.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    By considering both possible elimination pathways, we find a total of three unique organic products that can be formed:\n    1.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n    2.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n    3.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.

This elimination leads to the formation of a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium atom remains at the C2 position.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion can also remove the deuterium atom from the C2 position. This process is slower but still occurs. This elimination results in a different benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. In this case, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates:** The amide ion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the highly reactive benzyne intermediates.\n    *   **Reaction of Intermediate from Pathway A:** The benzyne with the triple bond between C1 and C6 (and deuterium at C2) is attacked by an amide ion.\n        *   Attack at C1 leads to the formation of aniline-2-d after protonation by the ammonia solvent.\n        *   Attack at C6 leads to the formation of aniline-6-d, which is the same molecule as aniline-2-d.\n        *   Therefore, Pathway A yields only one product: **aniline-2-d**.\n    *   **Reaction of Intermediate from Pathway B:** The non-deuterated benzyne (triple bond between C1 and C2) is attacked by an amide ion.\n        *   Attack at either C1 or C2 results in the formation of a carbanion, which is then protonated by the ammonia solvent to yield **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n        *   Therefore, Pathway B yields only one product: **aniline**.\n\nSince two distinct benzyne intermediates are formed, two different organic products are possible.\n\nThe two possible organic products are:\n*   Aniline-2-d\n*   Aniline\n\nThus, there are a total of two possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate.

There are two acidic hydrogens ortho to the bromine: a deuterium (D) at the C2 position and a hydrogen (H) at the C6 position. The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, meaning the hydrogen at C6 is more readily abstracted by the base. This difference in bond strength is known as the kinetic isotope effect. However, both abstractions are possible, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A (Major):** The amide anion abstracts the proton (H) from the C6 position.
