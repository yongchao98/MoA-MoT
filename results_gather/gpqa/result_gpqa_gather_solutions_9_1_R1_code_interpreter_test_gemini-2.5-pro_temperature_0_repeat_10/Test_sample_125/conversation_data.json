The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone at C3 with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone carbonyl group (C=O) to a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-).\n    *   This reaction creates a new chiral center at the C3 position.\n    *   The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n    *   The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack the planar carbonyl group from either the top face or the bottom face. This leads to the formation of two possible configurations at the new chiral center (C3): (R) and (S).\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    *   Since the starting material is (S) at C5, the two products will be:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products are stereoisomers. They have the same connectivity but differ in the spatial arrangement of atoms. They are not mirror images of each other (one center is the same, the other is different), so they are **diastereomers**.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction I produces **two diastereomeric products**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral (it has a plane of symmetry).\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of both ketone groups with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄).\n    *   NaBH₄ reduces both ketones to secondary alcohols.\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    *   The product molecule has two chiral centers, at C2 and C4.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's analyze these stereoisomers:\n        *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material is achiral, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n        *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has an internal plane of symmetry. A molecule with chiral centers that is achiral overall is called a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration represents the same meso compound.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces **three stereoisomers**: a pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Products with HPLC**\n\nThe combined product mixture contains a total of 2 + 3 = 5 different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Constitutional isomers** (like the products from Reaction I vs. Reaction II) have different structures and polarities and will be separated.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will **not** be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   The two products from Reaction I (compounds 1 and 2) are diastereomers. They will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   The three products from Reaction II:\n    *   Compounds 3 and 4 are enantiomers. They will co-elute as **one peak**.\n    *   Compound 5 (the meso compound) is a diastereomer of compounds 3 and 4. It will be separated from them, giving a **second peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II, so their peaks will not overlap.\n*   Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase)**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with enantiomers.\n*   It can separate all types of isomers that are not identical: constitutional isomers, diastereomers, and enantiomers.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   All five compounds in the mixture are chemically distinct stereoisomers.\n    *   Compound 1 and 2 are diastereomers.\n    *   Compound 3 and 4 are enantiomers.\n    *   Compound 5 is a diastereomer of 3 and 4.\n    *   Compounds 1 & 2 are constitutional isomers of 3, 4, & 5.\n*   A chiral column is designed to resolve all these different species.\n*   Therefore, each of the 5 stereoisomers will produce its own peak.\n*   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of peaks in each chromatogram.\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter at carbon 5 has the (S) configuration.\n2.  **Reaction:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at carbon 3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at carbon 3.\n3.  **Products:** Since the original molecule is chiral, the hydride attack on the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, leading to the formation of two different stereoisomers. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S). This results in two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n2.  **Reaction:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n3.  **Products:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at carbons 2 and 4. For a molecule with two stereocenters, there are up to 2² = 4 possible stereoisomers. However, due to the symmetry of pentane-2,4-diol, the possibilities are:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). The (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) forms are identical and represent a single achiral *meso* compound, which has an internal plane of symmetry. Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, the reaction produces a racemic mixture of the enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) along with the meso compound. Therefore, three distinct stereoisomers are formed.\n\n### **Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso compound from Reaction II)\n\n### **HPLC Analysis**\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\nThis technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers**, like (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore will not be separated, eluting as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and are separable by normal-phase HPLC.\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n    *   In the products from Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, the racemic pair will elute as one peak, and the meso compound will elute as a separate peak, resulting in **two peaks** from Reaction II's products.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C6 ether-alcohols) are structurally distinct and have different polarities compared to the products from Reaction II (C5 diols), so they will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks:** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 2 peaks (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase):**\nThis technique uses a chiral stationary phase to create a chiral environment, which allows for the separation of all stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n*   The column will separate the two diastereomers from Reaction I, resulting in **two peaks**.\n*   The column will separate the three stereoisomers from Reaction II. The enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will be resolved into two separate peaks, and the meso compound will give a third distinct peak. This results in **three peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks:** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 3 peaks (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nOf course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this organic chemistry problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction I:** I will determine the structure of the starting material, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, and predict the products formed when it is reduced with LAH. This involves identifying any new chiral centers created and determining the stereochemical relationship between the products (e.g., enantiomers, diastereomers).\n2.  **Analyze Reaction II:** I will analyze the reduction of pentane-2,4-dione with excess NaBH4. I will determine the stereoisomers of the product, pentane-2,4-diol, identifying any enantiomeric pairs or meso compounds.\n3.  **Count the Products:** I will count the total number of unique stereoisomers produced from both reactions combined.\n4.  **Predict Normal-Phase HPLC Results:** I will determine the number of peaks expected on a normal-phase (achiral) HPLC column. This type of chromatography separates constitutional isomers and diastereomers but does not resolve enantiomers.\n5.  **Predict Chiral HPLC Results:** I will determine the number of peaks expected on a chiral HPLC column. This technique can separate all different stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n6.  **Select the Answer:** Finally, I will match the predicted number of peaks for both HPLC methods to the given options.\n\nHere is the Python code that executes this plan and provides the solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_hplc_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides a step-by-step analysis of two chemical reactions\n    and predicts the number of peaks observed in normal-phase and chiral HPLC.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Here is the step-by-step analysis of the problem:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze Reaction I\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I.\")\n    print(\"Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.\")\n    print(\"The starting material is a ketone with an existing chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), which has an (S) configuration.\")\n    print(\"LAH reduces the ketone at C3 to an alcohol, creating a new chiral center at C3.\")\n    print(\"Because a new chiral center is formed in a molecule that is already chiral, the two products are diastereomers.\")\n    print(\"The products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\")\n    print(\"Result of Reaction I: 2 products (a pair of diastereomers).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze Reaction II\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II.\")\n    print(\"Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.\")\n    print(\"The starting material, pentane-2,4-dione, is an achiral molecule.\")\n    print(\"NaBH4 reduces both ketone groups to alcohols, creating the product pentane-2,4-diol, which has two new chiral centers (C2 and C4).\")\n    print(\"The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S).\")\n    print(\"- (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are a pair of enantiomers.\")\n    print(\"- (2R, 4S) is a meso compound because it has an internal plane of symmetry and is achiral.\")\n    print(\"Result of Reaction II: 3 products (one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Combine products\n    print(\"Step 3: Combine the products from both reactions.\")\n    print(\"The final mixture contains a total of 2 + 3 = 5 unique stereoisomers.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Predict Normal-Phase HPLC results\n    print(\"Step 4: Predict the number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\")\n    print(\"Normal-phase (achiral) HPLC separates compounds with different physical properties (like polarity).

This is a chiral molecule with one stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5).\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(S)(OCH3)-CH3`\n*   **Reagents:** LAH (Lithium aluminum hydride) followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to an alcohol.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material already has a stereocenter at C5, the attack of the hydride ion (from LAH) on the two faces of the carbonyl group is not equally probable. This leads to the formation of two products.\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same configuration at C5 but different configurations at C3. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule. It has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`\n*   **Reagents:** Excess NaBH4 (Sodium borohydride) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to alcohols.\n*   **Product Formation:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol. This molecule has two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts with an achiral reactant and uses an achiral reagent, these enantiomers will be formed in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n    *   The (2R, 4S) form has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: (2S, 4R) is the same meso compound).\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase. It separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   **Key Point:** It can separate diastereomers because they have different physical properties (including polarity). It cannot separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:**\n    1.  The two diastereomers from Reaction I ((3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) have different polarities and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    2.  From Reaction II, we have a racemic mixture of enantiomers ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound. The enantiomers will not be separated and will elute together as **1 peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will have a different polarity and elute separately, giving another **1 peak**. This results in a total of **2 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The products from Reaction I are structurally distinct from the products of Reaction II (different molecular weight, different functional groups), so their peaks will not overlap.\n    *   Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase.\n*   **Key Point:** It can separate all stereoisomers that are not identical, including both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:** The combined product mixture contains a total of five unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Total Peaks:** Since a chiral column can resolve all of these distinct stereoisomers, each one will produce a separate peak.\n    *   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: **4 peaks**\n*   Chiral HPLC: **5 peaks**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is `CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule has one chiral center at carbon C5, and its configuration is specified as (S). Since it's a single stereoisomer, it is enantiomerically pure.\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH reduces the ketone group (`C=O`) at C3 to a secondary alcohol (`-CH(OH)-`).\n*   **Product Analysis:** The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new chiral center. The carbon at C3 is prochiral. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations at C3: (R) or (S).\n    *   The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n    *   Therefore, the reaction produces a mixture of two products:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in the configuration at one of their two chiral centers. This makes them **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry passing through the central `CH2` group.\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), a reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. Since NaBH₄ is in excess, both ketone groups will be reduced to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Product Analysis:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: `CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3`.\n    *   This product has two chiral centers, at C2 and C4.\n    *   Since the starting material and the reagent (NaBH₄) are both achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. Let's analyze them:\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. They will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry (it is superimposable on its mirror image, which is the (2S, 4R) isomer). Therefore, it is a **meso compound**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. However, it can separate diastereomers, as they have different physical properties.\n*   **Analysis of the Mixture:** The combined mixture contains 5 total stereoisomers.\n    *   **From Reaction I:** Two diastereomers. Since they have different physical properties, they will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** A pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n        *   The two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and will have different physical properties, so it will be separated from the enantiomeric pair. This gives another peak.\n        *   In total, the products from Reaction II give **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) and will have different retention times. Therefore, there will be no overlap between the peaks from the two reactions.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows for the separation of enantiomers because they form transient diastereomeric complexes with the stationary phase, which have different stabilities and thus different retention times. Chiral HPLC can also separate diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis of the Mixture:**\n    *   **From Reaction I:** Two diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** A pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n        *   The chiral column will separate the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers. This gives **2 peaks**.\n        *   The meso compound is achiral but is a diastereomer of the other two products. It will be separated from them. This gives **1 peak**.\n        *   In total, the products from Reaction II give **3 peaks**.\n    *   Again, there will be no overlap between the peaks from Reaction I and Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   The analysis predicts **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n*   The analysis predicts **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a detailed analysis of the stereochemical outcomes of the two reactions and the resulting HPLC chromatograms.\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter is at the C5 position.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the ketone at the C3 position creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material is a single enantiomer ((S)-configuration at C5), the hydride can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces. This non-selective attack results in the formation of two products with either an (R) or (S) configuration at the newly formed C3 alcohol center.\n*   **Products:** The two products are (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are diastereomers because they have one stereocenter that is the same (C5) and one that is different (C3).\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is a reducing agent that converts ketones to alcohols. Since it is in excess, it will reduce both ketone groups.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the two ketone groups at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters. This leads to the formation of three possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:**\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other and are therefore a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol). It is therefore an achiral meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n### **HPLC Analysis**\n\n**1. Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Diastereomers:** Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by achiral chromatography.\n*   **Enantiomers:** Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n\nApplying this to the product mixture:\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will co-elute as **one peak**.\n*   The meso compound, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated as a distinct **one peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C₇ alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C₅ diols) and will have different retention times.\n\nTherefore, the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram will show a total of **4 peaks**.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC**\n\nA chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that can differentiate between enantiomers.\n*   Chiral HPLC can separate both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n\nApplying this to the product mixture:\n*   All five unique stereoisomers in the mixture will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 1)\n*   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 2)\n*   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3)\n*   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4)\n*   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 5)\n\nTherefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will resolve all five compounds, resulting in **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC and 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### **Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter is at the C5 position.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at the C3 position to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the ketone creates a new stereocenter at C3. Since the starting material is enantiomerically pure (only the S-isomer), the hydride can attack the carbonyl group from two different faces, leading to the formation of two products: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two products are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. This results in the formation of three stereoisomers:\n    *   A pair of enantiomers: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. Since the starting material is achiral, these are formed as a racemic mixture.\n    *   A meso compound: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n\n### **Combined Products**\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the mixture contains a total of five different compounds:\n1.

It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, are physically identical in an achiral environment and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n*   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have different properties, thus eluting as a **separate, second peak** from the Reaction II products.\n*   The products of Reaction I (methoxy-alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (diols) and will not overlap.\n*   Therefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase chromatogram is 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral Stationary Phase HPLC**\n\n*   A chiral stationary phase is designed to interact differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It will also separate diastereomers.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated, resulting in **two peaks**.\n*   The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will be resolved by the chiral column into **two separate peaks**.\n*   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is achiral and does not have an enantiomer, so it will appear as a **single peak**.\n*   The total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram is 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter is at the C5 position.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at the C3 position to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the carbonyl group creates a new stereocenter at C3. Since the original molecule has a stereocenter at C5, the reduction can form two different stereoisomers depending on the direction of the hydride attack. These two products, (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers of each other. Diastereomers have different physical properties.\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the two ketones at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters.

(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n### **Chromatogram Analysis**\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak.\n\nLet's analyze the peaks:\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two products, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The products are a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, so it will be separated from them. The enantiomers themselves will not be separated and will elute as one peak. This results in **two peaks** from Reaction II.\n\nSince the products of Reaction I (methoxy-alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (diols), it is highly unlikely they will have the same retention times. Therefore, the total number of peaks will be the sum of the peaks from each reaction.\nTotal peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\nA chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that can differentiate between stereoisomers, including both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   Each of the five stereoisomers produced in the reactions is chemically unique and will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   Therefore, all five compounds will be resolved into separate peaks.\n\nTotal peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I and its products.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH₂(C=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃.\n    *   It has one chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S).\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new chiral center. The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction. The hydride ion can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations (R or S) at the new chiral center (C3).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** Since one chiral center is the same (5S) and the other is different (3R vs. 3S), these two products are **diastereomers**.

This molecule has two chiral centers, at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereoisomers:** Because the molecule is symmetric, we need to consider the possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. The reduction of an achiral starting material with an achiral reagent produces a racemic mixture (equal amounts) of this enantiomeric pair.\n    *   (2R, 4S) has an internal plane of symmetry (passing through the CH₂ group), making it a **meso compound**. It is achiral. The (2S, 4R) configuration is identical to the (2R, 4S) configuration (it is the same meso compound).\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n*   Therefore, Reaction II produces three stereoisomers: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the separation on a normal-phase HPLC column.**\n\n*   A normal-phase HPLC column is **achiral**. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot be separated** on a normal-phase column.

They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** We have a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound. The enantiomeric pair will co-elute as one peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, so it will be separated and give a second peak. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally very different and will have different retention times. Thus, there will be no accidental overlap of peaks.\n*   **Total peaks on normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = 4 peaks.**\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the separation on a chiral HPLC column.**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a **chiral stationary phase**.

The ketone group at C3 will be reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new chiral center. Since the starting material already has a chiral center at C5, the attack of the hydride ion on the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, leading to two different stereochemical outcomes at C3.\n    *   The original chiral center at C5, (S)-5-methoxy, is not affected by the reaction.\n    *   The new chiral center at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   This results in the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are diastereomers because they have two chiral centers, with one being the same (5S) and the other being different (3R vs. 3S).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral (it has a plane of symmetry).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Products:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule has two chiral centers, at C2 and C4.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and a meso compound (2R, 4S), which is identical to (2S, 4R).\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are a pair of enantiomers.

(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers. It cannot separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties, including polarity.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will not be separated and will elute as a single peak. The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer to this pair and will have a different polarity, so it will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are constitutional isomers with different molecular formulas and functional groups. They will have significantly different polarities and will be separated from each other.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of peaks is the sum of the peaks from each group of products: 2 (from I) + 2 (from II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Predict the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows for the separation of enantiomers, in addition to diastereomers and constitutional isomers. Essentially, it can separate all molecules that are not identical.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   The mixture contains five unique stereoisomers.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the diastereomers from Reaction I: (3R, 5S)- vs. (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the enantiomers from Reaction II: (2R, 4R)- vs. (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The chiral column will also separate the meso compound from its diastereomers.\n    *   Since all five compounds in the mixture are structurally distinct stereoisomers, and a chiral column is designed to resolve such differences, each compound will produce a separate peak.\n    *   Total number of peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in the HPLC chromatograms.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule has one chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S). The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at carbon 3 (C3) is reduced to a secondary alcohol using Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent. This reaction creates a new chiral center at C3. The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, leading to the formation of two possible configurations, (R) and (S), at the new chiral center (C3).\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same configuration at one chiral center (C5) but opposite configurations at the other (C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃. This molecule is achiral because it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using sodium borohydride (NaBH₄). The product is pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We need to consider all possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol. The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S)/(2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts with achiral materials, they are produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S):** This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry. A molecule with chiral centers and an internal plane of symmetry is a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration represents the same meso compound.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol } A pair of enantiomers\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol }\n    3.  (meso)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of both the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Predict the number of peaks on a Normal-Phase HPLC Column**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC is an achiral separation technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n*   **Rule:** Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated.\n*   **Analysis of the combined mixture:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers, so they will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound.\n        *   The enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will not be separated and will elute as a single peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will have different properties and will be separated from them.

This gives **1 peak**.\n*   **Total Peaks on Chiral HPLC:**\n    Total Peaks = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + (2 + 1) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the combined product mixture will exhibit:\n*   **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n*   **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone with one stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5), which has the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH reduces the carbonyl group (C=O) at carbon 3 (C3) to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The carbonyl carbon at C3 is prochiral. The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack from either the front face or the back face of the planar carbonyl group. This creates a new stereocenter at C3. The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Products:** The reduction results in the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** Since one stereocenter is the same (5S) and the other is different (3R vs. 3S), these two products are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone). This molecule is achiral as it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** The dione is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), a reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The starting material is achiral, and the molecule is symmetric about C3. This leads to the formation of a meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n*   **Products:**\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (which is (2R, 4S) or (2S, 4R) - they are the same achiral compound).\n*   **Relationship:** (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are **enantiomers**. The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed (one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase. It can separate compounds with different physical properties, such as polarity. Therefore, it can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)-ol and (3S, 5S)-ol, are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)-diol and (2S, 4S)-diol) and a meso compound.\n        *   The enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and will be separated from the enantiomeric pair's peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (C6 ether-alcohols) are constitutional isomers of the products of Reaction II (C5 diols), so they are structurally very different and will be well-separated from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 1 peak (from Reaction II enantiomers) + 1 peak (from Reaction II meso compound) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows for differential interaction with chiral molecules. It can separate enantiomers in addition to diastereomers and constitutional isomers. Essentially, it can separate all non-identical stereoisomers.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   The mixture contains a total of 5 unique stereoisomers:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Since all five of these compounds are structurally distinct (either as diastereomers or enantiomers), a chiral column is capable of separating all of them. The meso compound is achiral but is a unique stereoisomer that will have its own retention time, distinct from the chiral isomers.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Each of the 5 unique stereoisomers will produce its own peak. Therefore, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the products formed in each reaction and how they would be observed in the different types of HPLC.\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter is at the C5 position.\n2.  **Reaction:** It is treated with Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, which reduces the ketone at C3 to a hydroxyl group.\n3.  **Product Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride ion can attack from either face of the carbonyl, leading to the formation of two possible stereoisomers at C3 (R or S). Since the stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged (S), the products are:\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n4.  **Relationship:** These two products are diastereomers because they have two stereocenters, with one being the same (S at C5) and the other being different (R/S at C3).\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is a symmetric and achiral diketone.\n2.  **Reaction:** It is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), which reduces both ketone groups at C2 and C4 to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n3.  **Product Stereochemistry:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The possible combinations of these stereocenters lead to three stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  **Relationship:**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, making them a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral meso compound. The (2S, 4R) isomer is identical to the (2R, 4S) isomer.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture by HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n\n*   **Products from Reaction I:** The two products, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and are separable by normal-phase HPLC. This will result in **2 peaks**.\n*   **Products from Reaction II:**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are enantiomers. They have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated, eluting together as a single peak.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) meso compound is a diastereomer of the other two products. It has different physical properties and will be separated from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Therefore, the products from Reaction II will show **2 peaks** (one for the enantiomeric pair, one for the meso compound).\n\nAssuming the products of Reaction I do not co-elute with the products of Reaction II (which is a reasonable assumption for different molecular structures), the total number of peaks in the normal-phase chromatogram will be 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\nHPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers.\n\n*   **Products from Reaction I:** The two diastereomers, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **Products from Reaction II:**\n    *   The enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will be separated by the chiral column. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated, giving **1 peak**.\n    *   Therefore, the products from Reaction II will show a total of **3 peaks**.\n\nThe total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram will be the sum of all separable compounds, which is 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n*   **5 peaks in chiral HPLC**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a detailed analysis of the reactions and the subsequent chromatographic separation:\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter is at the C5 position.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material is enantiomerically pure (S configuration at C5), the hydride attack on the two faces of the carbonyl group is not equally probable. This leads to the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two products are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. This results in the formation of three stereoisomers:\n    *   A pair of enantiomers: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   A meso compound: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso, from Reaction II)\n\n### **Chromatographic Separation**\n\n**1. Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers**, having identical physical properties in an achiral environment, cannot be separated and will elute as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers**, having different physical properties, can be separated.\n\nLet's analyze the peaks:\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) will co-elute as **one peak**.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated, resulting in another, separate **peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C7 mono-ethers) and Reaction II (C5 diols) are structurally different molecules with different polarities, so they will be separated from each other.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC will be 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC**\n\nA chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers. Each unique stereoisomer will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will, therefore, be separated.\n\nLet's analyze the peaks:\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated, giving **two peaks**.\n*   The three stereoisomers from Reaction II will all be separated: the (2R, 4R) enantiomer, the (2S, 4S) enantiomer, and the meso compound. This results in **three peaks**.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC will be 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the resulting chromatograms.\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The chirality is at the C5 carbon, which has an (S) configuration.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Process:** The reduction of the ketone at the C3 position creates a new stereocenter. The hydride ion can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces. This non-selective attack results in the formation of two products with either an (R) or (S) configuration at the new C3 stereocenter. The original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are diastereomers because they have different configurations at one stereocenter (C3) but the same configuration at another (C5).\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Process:** The reduction of the two ketone groups at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters. Since the starting material and reagent are both achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, making them enantiomers. They are formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral meso compound.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with a single, defined stereocenter at carbon C5.\n2.  **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced by Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH) to a secondary alcohol. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected.

This leads to the formation of two possible configurations at the new chiral center (C3): (R) and (S).\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    *   Since the starting material is (S) at C5, the two products will be:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products are stereoisomers. They have the same connectivity but differ in the spatial arrangement of atoms. They are not mirror images of each other (one center is the same, the other is different), so they are **diastereomers**.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction I produces **two diastereomeric products**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral (it has a plane of symmetry).\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of both ketone groups with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄).\n    *   NaBH₄ reduces both ketones to secondary alcohols.\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    *   The product molecule has two chiral centers, at C2 and C4.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's analyze these stereoisomers:\n        *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material is achiral, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n        *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has an internal plane of symmetry. A molecule with chiral centers that is achiral overall is called a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration represents the same meso compound.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces **three stereoisomers**: a pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Products with HPLC**\n\nThe combined product mixture contains a total of 2 + 3 = 5 different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Constitutional isomers** (like the products from Reaction I vs. Reaction II) have different structures and polarities and will be separated.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will **not** be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   The two products from Reaction I (compounds 1 and 2) are diastereomers. They will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   The three products from Reaction II:\n    *   Compounds 3 and 4 are enantiomers. They will co-elute as **one peak**.\n    *   Compound 5 (the meso compound) is a diastereomer of compounds 3 and 4. It will be separated from them, giving a **second peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II, so their peaks will not overlap.\n*   Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase)**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with enantiomers.\n*   It can separate all types of isomers that are not identical: constitutional isomers, diastereomers, and enantiomers.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   All five compounds in the mixture are chemically distinct stereoisomers.\n    *   Compound 1 and 2 are diastereomers.\n    *   Compound 3 and 4 are enantiomers.\n    *   Compound 5 is a diastereomer of 3 and 4.\n    *   Compounds 1 & 2 are constitutional isomers of 3, 4, & 5.\n*   A chiral column is designed to resolve all these different species.\n*   Therefore, each of the 5 stereoisomers will produce its own peak.\n*   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of peaks in each chromatogram.\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter at carbon 5 has the (S) configuration.\n2.  **Reaction:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at carbon 3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at carbon 3.\n3.  **Products:** Since the original molecule is chiral, the hydride attack on the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, leading to the formation of two different stereoisomers. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S). This results in two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n2.  **Reaction:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n3.  **Products:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at carbons 2 and 4. For a molecule with two stereocenters, there are up to 2² = 4 possible stereoisomers. However, due to the symmetry of pentane-2,4-diol, the possibilities are:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). The (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) forms are identical and represent a single achiral *meso* compound, which has an internal plane of symmetry. Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, the reaction produces a racemic mixture of the enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) along with the meso compound. Therefore, three distinct stereoisomers are formed.\n\n### **Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso compound from Reaction II)\n\n### **HPLC Analysis**\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\nThis technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers**, like (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore will not be separated, eluting as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and are separable by normal-phase HPLC.\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n    *   In the products from Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, the racemic pair will elute as one peak, and the meso compound will elute as a separate peak, resulting in **two peaks** from Reaction II's products.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C6 ether-alcohols) are structurally distinct and have different polarities compared to the products from Reaction II (C5 diols), so they will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks:** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 2 peaks (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase):**\nThis technique uses a chiral stationary phase to create a chiral environment, which allows for the separation of all stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n*   The column will separate the two diastereomers from Reaction I, resulting in **two peaks**.\n*   The column will separate the three stereoisomers from Reaction II. The enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will be resolved into two separate peaks, and the meso compound will give a third distinct peak. This results in **three peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks:** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 3 peaks (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nOf course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this organic chemistry problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction I:** I will determine the structure of the starting material, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, and predict the products formed when it is reduced with LAH. This involves identifying any new chiral centers created and determining the stereochemical relationship between the products (e.g., enantiomers, diastereomers).\n2.  **Analyze Reaction II:** I will analyze the reduction of pentane-2,4-dione with excess NaBH4. I will determine the stereoisomers of the product, pentane-2,4-diol, identifying any enantiomeric pairs or meso compounds.\n3.  **Count the Products:** I will count the total number of unique stereoisomers produced from both reactions combined.\n4.  **Predict Normal-Phase HPLC Results:** I will determine the number of peaks expected on a normal-phase (achiral) HPLC column. This type of chromatography separates constitutional isomers and diastereomers but does not resolve enantiomers.\n5.  **Predict Chiral HPLC Results:** I will determine the number of peaks expected on a chiral HPLC column. This technique can separate all different stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n6.  **Select the Answer:** Finally, I will match the predicted number of peaks for both HPLC methods to the given options.\n\nHere is the Python code that executes this plan and provides the solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_hplc_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides a step-by-step analysis of two chemical reactions\n    and predicts the number of peaks observed in normal-phase and chiral HPLC.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Here is the step-by-step analysis of the problem:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze Reaction I\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I.\")\n    print(\"Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.\")\n    print(\"The starting material is a ketone with an existing chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), which has an (S) configuration.\")\n    print(\"LAH reduces the ketone at C3 to an alcohol, creating a new chiral center at C3.\")\n    print(\"Because a new chiral center is formed in a molecule that is already chiral, the two products are diastereomers.\")\n    print(\"The products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\")\n    print(\"Result of Reaction I: 2 products (a pair of diastereomers).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze Reaction II\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II.\")\n    print(\"Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.\")\n    print(\"The starting material, pentane-2,4-dione, is an achiral molecule.\")\n    print(\"NaBH4 reduces both ketone groups to alcohols, creating the product pentane-2,4-diol, which has two new chiral centers (C2 and C4).\")\n    print(\"The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S).\")\n    print(\"- (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are a pair of enantiomers.\")\n    print(\"- (2R, 4S) is a meso compound because it has an internal plane of symmetry and is achiral.\")\n    print(\"Result of Reaction II: 3 products (one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Combine products\n    print(\"Step 3: Combine the products from both reactions.\")\n    print(\"The final mixture contains a total of 2 + 3 = 5 unique stereoisomers.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Predict Normal-Phase HPLC results\n    print(\"Step 4: Predict the number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\")\n    print(\"Normal-phase (achiral) HPLC separates compounds with different physical properties (like polarity).

This is a chiral molecule with one stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5).\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(S)(OCH3)-CH3`\n*   **Reagents:** LAH (Lithium aluminum hydride) followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to an alcohol.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material already has a stereocenter at C5, the attack of the hydride ion (from LAH) on the two faces of the carbonyl group is not equally probable. This leads to the formation of two products.\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same configuration at C5 but different configurations at C3. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule. It has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`\n*   **Reagents:** Excess NaBH4 (Sodium borohydride) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to alcohols.\n*   **Product Formation:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol. This molecule has two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts with an achiral reactant and uses an achiral reagent, these enantiomers will be formed in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n    *   The (2R, 4S) form has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: (2S, 4R) is the same meso compound).\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase. It separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   **Key Point:** It can separate diastereomers because they have different physical properties (including polarity). It cannot separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:**\n    1.  The two diastereomers from Reaction I ((3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) have different polarities and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    2.  From Reaction II, we have a racemic mixture of enantiomers ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound. The enantiomers will not be separated and will elute together as **1 peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will have a different polarity and elute separately, giving another **1 peak**. This results in a total of **2 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The products from Reaction I are structurally distinct from the products of Reaction II (different molecular weight, different functional groups), so their peaks will not overlap.\n    *   Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase.\n*   **Key Point:** It can separate all stereoisomers that are not identical, including both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:** The combined product mixture contains a total of five unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Total Peaks:** Since a chiral column can resolve all of these distinct stereoisomers, each one will produce a separate peak.\n    *   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: **4 peaks**\n*   Chiral HPLC: **5 peaks**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is `CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule has one chiral center at carbon C5, and its configuration is specified as (S). Since it's a single stereoisomer, it is enantiomerically pure.\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH reduces the ketone group (`C=O`) at C3 to a secondary alcohol (`-CH(OH)-`).\n*   **Product Analysis:** The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new chiral center. The carbon at C3 is prochiral. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations at C3: (R) or (S).\n    *   The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n    *   Therefore, the reaction produces a mixture of two products:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in the configuration at one of their two chiral centers. This makes them **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry passing through the central `CH2` group.\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), a reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. Since NaBH₄ is in excess, both ketone groups will be reduced to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Product Analysis:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: `CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3`.\n    *   This product has two chiral centers, at C2 and C4.\n    *   Since the starting material and the reagent (NaBH₄) are both achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. Let's analyze them:\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. They will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry (it is superimposable on its mirror image, which is the (2S, 4R) isomer). Therefore, it is a **meso compound**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. However, it can separate diastereomers, as they have different physical properties.\n*   **Analysis of the Mixture:** The combined mixture contains 5 total stereoisomers.\n    *   **From Reaction I:** Two diastereomers. Since they have different physical properties, they will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** A pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n        *   The two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and will have different physical properties, so it will be separated from the enantiomeric pair. This gives another peak.\n        *   In total, the products from Reaction II give **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) and will have different retention times. Therefore, there will be no overlap between the peaks from the two reactions.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows for the separation of enantiomers because they form transient diastereomeric complexes with the stationary phase, which have different stabilities and thus different retention times. Chiral HPLC can also separate diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis of the Mixture:**\n    *   **From Reaction I:** Two diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** A pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n        *   The chiral column will separate the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers. This gives **2 peaks**.\n        *   The meso compound is achiral but is a diastereomer of the other two products. It will be separated from them. This gives **1 peak**.\n        *   In total, the products from Reaction II give **3 peaks**.\n    *   Again, there will be no overlap between the peaks from Reaction I and Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   The analysis predicts **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n*   The analysis predicts **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a detailed analysis of the stereochemical outcomes of the two reactions and the resulting HPLC chromatograms.\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter is at the C5 position.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the ketone at the C3 position creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material is a single enantiomer ((S)-configuration at C5), the hydride can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces. This non-selective attack results in the formation of two products with either an (R) or (S) configuration at the newly formed C3 alcohol center.\n*   **Products:** The two products are (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are diastereomers because they have one stereocenter that is the same (C5) and one that is different (C3).\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is a reducing agent that converts ketones to alcohols. Since it is in excess, it will reduce both ketone groups.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the two ketone groups at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters. This leads to the formation of three possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:**\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other and are therefore a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol). It is therefore an achiral meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n### **HPLC Analysis**\n\n**1. Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Diastereomers:** Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by achiral chromatography.\n*   **Enantiomers:** Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n\nApplying this to the product mixture:\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will co-elute as **one peak**.\n*   The meso compound, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated as a distinct **one peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C₇ alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C₅ diols) and will have different retention times.\n\nTherefore, the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram will show a total of **4 peaks**.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC**\n\nA chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that can differentiate between enantiomers.\n*   Chiral HPLC can separate both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n\nApplying this to the product mixture:\n*   All five unique stereoisomers in the mixture will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 1)\n*   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 2)\n*   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3)\n*   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4)\n*   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 5)\n\nTherefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will resolve all five compounds, resulting in **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC and 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### **Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter is at the C5 position.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at the C3 position to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the ketone creates a new stereocenter at C3. Since the starting material is enantiomerically pure (only the S-isomer), the hydride can attack the carbonyl group from two different faces, leading to the formation of two products: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two products are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. This results in the formation of three stereoisomers:\n    *   A pair of enantiomers: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. Since the starting material is achiral, these are formed as a racemic mixture.\n    *   A meso compound: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n\n### **Combined Products**\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the mixture contains a total of five different compounds:\n1.

It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, are physically identical in an achiral environment and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n*   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have different properties, thus eluting as a **separate, second peak** from the Reaction II products.\n*   The products of Reaction I (methoxy-alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (diols) and will not overlap.\n*   Therefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase chromatogram is 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral Stationary Phase HPLC**\n\n*   A chiral stationary phase is designed to interact differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It will also separate diastereomers.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated, resulting in **two peaks**.\n*   The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will be resolved by the chiral column into **two separate peaks**.\n*   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is achiral and does not have an enantiomer, so it will appear as a **single peak**.\n*   The total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram is 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter is at the C5 position.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at the C3 position to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the carbonyl group creates a new stereocenter at C3. Since the original molecule has a stereocenter at C5, the reduction can form two different stereoisomers depending on the direction of the hydride attack. These two products, (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers of each other. Diastereomers have different physical properties.\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the two ketones at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters. This results in three possible stereoisomers.\n    *   A pair of enantiomers: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   A meso compound: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Products**\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n### **Chromatogram Analysis**\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak.\n\nLet's analyze the peaks:\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two products, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The products are a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, so it will be separated from them. The enantiomers themselves will not be separated and will elute as one peak. This results in **two peaks** from Reaction II.\n\nSince the products of Reaction I (methoxy-alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (diols), it is highly unlikely they will have the same retention times. Therefore, the total number of peaks will be the sum of the peaks from each reaction.\nTotal peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\nA chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that can differentiate between stereoisomers, including both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   Each of the five stereoisomers produced in the reactions is chemically unique and will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   Therefore, all five compounds will be resolved into separate peaks.\n\nTotal peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I and its products.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH₂(C=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃.\n    *   It has one chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S).\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new chiral center. The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction. The hydride ion can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations (R or S) at the new chiral center (C3).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** Since one chiral center is the same (5S) and the other is different (3R vs. 3S), these two products are **diastereomers**.

This molecule has two chiral centers, at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereoisomers:** Because the molecule is symmetric, we need to consider the possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. The reduction of an achiral starting material with an achiral reagent produces a racemic mixture (equal amounts) of this enantiomeric pair.\n    *   (2R, 4S) has an internal plane of symmetry (passing through the CH₂ group), making it a **meso compound**. It is achiral. The (2S, 4R) configuration is identical to the (2R, 4S) configuration (it is the same meso compound).\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n*   Therefore, Reaction II produces three stereoisomers: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the separation on a normal-phase HPLC column.**\n\n*   A normal-phase HPLC column is **achiral**. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot be separated** on a normal-phase column.

They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** We have a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound. The enantiomeric pair will co-elute as one peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, so it will be separated and give a second peak. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally very different and will have different retention times. Thus, there will be no accidental overlap of peaks.\n*   **Total peaks on normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = 4 peaks.**\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the separation on a chiral HPLC column.**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a **chiral stationary phase**.

The ketone group at C3 will be reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new chiral center. Since the starting material already has a chiral center at C5, the attack of the hydride ion on the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, leading to two different stereochemical outcomes at C3.\n    *   The original chiral center at C5, (S)-5-methoxy, is not affected by the reaction.\n    *   The new chiral center at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   This results in the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are diastereomers because they have two chiral centers, with one being the same (5S) and the other being different (3R vs. 3S).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral (it has a plane of symmetry).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Products:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule has two chiral centers, at C2 and C4.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and a meso compound (2R, 4S), which is identical to (2S, 4R).\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are a pair of enantiomers.

(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers. It cannot separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties, including polarity.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will not be separated and will elute as a single peak. The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer to this pair and will have a different polarity, so it will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are constitutional isomers with different molecular formulas and functional groups. They will have significantly different polarities and will be separated from each other.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of peaks is the sum of the peaks from each group of products: 2 (from I) + 2 (from II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Predict the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows for the separation of enantiomers, in addition to diastereomers and constitutional isomers. Essentially, it can separate all molecules that are not identical.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   The mixture contains five unique stereoisomers.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the diastereomers from Reaction I: (3R, 5S)- vs. (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the enantiomers from Reaction II: (2R, 4R)- vs. (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The chiral column will also separate the meso compound from its diastereomers.\n    *   Since all five compounds in the mixture are structurally distinct stereoisomers, and a chiral column is designed to resolve such differences, each compound will produce a separate peak.\n    *   Total number of peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in the HPLC chromatograms.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule has one chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S). The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at carbon 3 (C3) is reduced to a secondary alcohol using Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent. This reaction creates a new chiral center at C3. The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, leading to the formation of two possible configurations, (R) and (S), at the new chiral center (C3).\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same configuration at one chiral center (C5) but opposite configurations at the other (C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃. This molecule is achiral because it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using sodium borohydride (NaBH₄). The product is pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We need to consider all possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol. The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S)/(2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts with achiral materials, they are produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S):** This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry. A molecule with chiral centers and an internal plane of symmetry is a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration represents the same meso compound.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    1.

(meso)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of both the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Predict the number of peaks on a Normal-Phase HPLC Column**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC is an achiral separation technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n*   **Rule:** Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated.\n*   **Analysis of the combined mixture:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers, so they will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound.\n        *   The enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will not be separated and will elute as a single peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will have different properties and will be separated from them. This gives **1 peak**.\n*   **Total Peaks on Normal-Phase HPLC:** The products from Reaction I are structurally different from the products of Reaction II, so they will all be separated from each other.\n    Total Peaks = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + (1 + 1) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the number of peaks on a Chiral HPLC Column**\n\nA chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with enantiomers.\n*   **Rule:** Chiral HPLC can separate diastereomers and also resolve enantiomers into separate peaks.\n*   **Analysis of the combined mixture:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II will be fully separated.\n        *   The enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will be resolved by the chiral column. This gives **2 peaks**.\n        *   The meso compound is achiral but is a diastereomer of the other products, so it will elute as a distinct, single peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n*   **Total Peaks on Chiral HPLC:**\n    Total Peaks = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + (2 + 1) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the combined product mixture will exhibit:\n*   **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n*   **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone with one stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5), which has the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH reduces the carbonyl group (C=O) at carbon 3 (C3) to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The carbonyl carbon at C3 is prochiral. The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack from either the front face or the back face of the planar carbonyl group. This creates a new stereocenter at C3. The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Products:** The reduction results in the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** Since one stereocenter is the same (5S) and the other is different (3R vs. 3S), these two products are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone). This molecule is achiral as it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** The dione is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), a reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The starting material is achiral, and the molecule is symmetric about C3. This leads to the formation of a meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n*   **Products:**\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (which is (2R, 4S) or (2S, 4R) - they are the same achiral compound).\n*   **Relationship:** (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are **enantiomers**. The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed (one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase. It can separate compounds with different physical properties, such as polarity. Therefore, it can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)-ol and (3S, 5S)-ol, are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)-diol and (2S, 4S)-diol) and a meso compound.\n        *   The enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and will be separated from the enantiomeric pair's peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (C6 ether-alcohols) are constitutional isomers of the products of Reaction II (C5 diols), so they are structurally very different and will be well-separated from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 1 peak (from Reaction II enantiomers) + 1 peak (from Reaction II meso compound) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows for differential interaction with chiral molecules. It can separate enantiomers in addition to diastereomers and constitutional isomers. Essentially, it can separate all non-identical stereoisomers.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   The mixture contains a total of 5 unique stereoisomers:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Since all five of these compounds are structurally distinct (either as diastereomers or enantiomers), a chiral column is capable of separating all of them. The meso compound is achiral but is a unique stereoisomer that will have its own retention time, distinct from the chiral isomers.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Each of the 5 unique stereoisomers will produce its own peak. Therefore, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the products formed in each reaction and how they would be observed in the different types of HPLC.\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter is at the C5 position.\n2.  **Reaction:** It is treated with Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, which reduces the ketone at C3 to a hydroxyl group.\n3.  **Product Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride ion can attack from either face of the carbonyl, leading to the formation of two possible stereoisomers at C3 (R or S). Since the stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged (S), the products are:\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n4.  **Relationship:** These two products are diastereomers because they have two stereocenters, with one being the same (S at C5) and the other being different (R/S at C3).\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is a symmetric and achiral diketone.\n2.  **Reaction:** It is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), which reduces both ketone groups at C2 and C4 to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n3.  **Product Stereochemistry:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The possible combinations of these stereocenters lead to three stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  **Relationship:**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, making them a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral meso compound. The (2S, 4R) isomer is identical to the (2R, 4S) isomer.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture by HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n\n*   **Products from Reaction I:** The two products, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and are separable by normal-phase HPLC. This will result in **2 peaks**.\n*   **Products from Reaction II:**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are enantiomers. They have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated, eluting together as a single peak.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) meso compound is a diastereomer of the other two products. It has different physical properties and will be separated from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Therefore, the products from Reaction II will show **2 peaks** (one for the enantiomeric pair, one for the meso compound).\n\nAssuming the products of Reaction I do not co-elute with the products of Reaction II (which is a reasonable assumption for different molecular structures), the total number of peaks in the normal-phase chromatogram will be 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\nHPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers.\n\n*   **Products from Reaction I:** The two diastereomers, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **Products from Reaction II:**\n    *   The enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will be separated by the chiral column. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated, giving **1 peak**.\n    *   Therefore, the products from Reaction II will show a total of **3 peaks**.\n\nThe total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram will be the sum of all separable compounds, which is 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n*   **5 peaks in chiral HPLC**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a detailed analysis of the reactions and the subsequent chromatographic separation:\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter is at the C5 position.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material is enantiomerically pure (S configuration at C5), the hydride attack on the two faces of the carbonyl group is not equally probable. This leads to the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two products are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. This results in the formation of three stereoisomers:\n    *   A pair of enantiomers: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   A meso compound: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso, from Reaction II)\n\n### **Chromatographic Separation**\n\n**1. Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers**, having identical physical properties in an achiral environment, cannot be separated and will elute as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers**, having different physical properties, can be separated.\n\nLet's analyze the peaks:\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) will co-elute as **one peak**.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated, resulting in another, separate **peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C7 mono-ethers) and Reaction II (C5 diols) are structurally different molecules with different polarities, so they will be separated from each other.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC will be 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC**\n\nA chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers. Each unique stereoisomer will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will, therefore, be separated.\n\nLet's analyze the peaks:\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated, giving **two peaks**.\n*   The three stereoisomers from Reaction II will all be separated: the (2R, 4R) enantiomer, the (2S, 4S) enantiomer, and the meso compound. This results in **three peaks**.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC will be 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the resulting chromatograms.\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The chirality is at the C5 carbon, which has an (S) configuration.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Process:** The reduction of the ketone at the C3 position creates a new stereocenter. The hydride ion can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces. This non-selective attack results in the formation of two products with either an (R) or (S) configuration at the new C3 stereocenter. The original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are diastereomers because they have different configurations at one stereocenter (C3) but the same configuration at another (C5).\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Process:** The reduction of the two ketone groups at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters. Since the starting material and reagent are both achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, making them enantiomers. They are formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral meso compound. The (2S, 4R) configuration represents the same meso compound.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n### **Chromatographic Separation**\n\nThe combined mixture is analyzed using two types of HPLC.\n\n#### **1. Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers. However, it cannot distinguish between enantiomers, which have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n\n*   **Products from Reaction I:** The two products, (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   **Products from Reaction II:**\n    *   The enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will not be separated and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n    *   The meso compound, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have different properties, thus eluting as a **separate peak**.\n    *   This results in **two peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n*   **Overall:** The products of Reaction I (methoxy-alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (diols) and will have different retention times. Therefore, the total number of peaks will be the sum of the peaks from each reaction's products.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **2. Chiral HPLC**\n\nChiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP) that interacts differently with each stereoisomer, including enantiomers. This allows for the separation of all different stereoisomers in a mixture.\n\n*   **Analysis:** The final mixture contains five unique stereoisomers.\n*   **Separation:** A chiral column is designed to resolve all of these distinct molecules.\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 1)\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 2)\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3)\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4)\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 5)\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Since all five stereoisomers can be separated, the chromatogram will show **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
