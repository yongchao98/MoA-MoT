    "Radioactive decay is a stochastic process, meaning it is governed by probability. A key principle of this process is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is constant and is not affected by how long the atom has already existed.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation to determine the decay probability:\n\n1.  **Understand the decay formula:** The probability (P) of an atom decaying within a certain time (t) is given by the formula P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). In this formula, λ is the decay constant, which is a unique value for each type of radioactive atom. The term e represents the mathematical constant that is the base of the natural logarithm, approximately 2.718. The probability of an atom *not* decaying (surviving) is e^(-λt).\n\n2.  **Calculate the decay constant (λ):** We are given that the probability of the atom decaying within 100 minutes is 32%, or 0.32. We can use this information to find the decay constant λ.\n    *   P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)\n    *   e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\n3.  **Apply the memoryless principle:** The problem states that 50 minutes have passed without decay. Because radioactive decay is a memoryless process, this information is irrelevant to the future probability of decay. The atom does not \"age\"; its probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as it was for the first 150 minutes of its existence.\n\n4.  **Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes:** We need to find the probability of the atom decaying in a 150-minute interval, which is P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).\n    *   We can rewrite this as: P(150) = 1 - (e^(-100λ))^(150/100) = 1 - (e^(-100λ))^1.5\n    *   From step 2, we know that e^(-100λ) = 0.68.\n    *   Substituting this value: P(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   P(150) = 1 - 0.5607\n    *   P(150) ≈ 0.4393\n\nConverting this to a percentage gives approximately 43.93%, which rounds to 44%.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>"
