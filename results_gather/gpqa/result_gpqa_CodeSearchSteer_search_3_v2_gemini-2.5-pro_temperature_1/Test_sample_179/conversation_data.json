    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the minimum energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Understand the System and Energy Calculation\n\nThe total potential energy of a system of point charges is the sum of the potential energies for every unique pair of charges. The potential energy `U` between two point charges `q1` and `q2` separated by a distance `r` is given by:\n\n`U = k * (q1 * q2) / r`\n\nwhere `k` is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.98755 × 10⁹ N·m²/C².\n\nThe system consists of 13 identical particles. Let `q` be the charge of each particle, which is `2e`. The elementary charge `e` is exactly 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ C.\n\nThe total energy `U_total` can be split into two components:\n*   **`U_central`**: The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge (`q_13`) and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n*   **`U_sphere`**: The potential energy from the mutual interaction of the 12 charges on the sphere.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Energy of the Central Charge (`U_central`)\n\nThe 13th charge is at point P, and the other 12 charges are at a fixed distance `r = 2 m` from P. The potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12 charges is `k * q² / r`. Since there are 12 such charges, the total energy for this part is:\n\n`U_central = 12 * (k * q² / r)`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Minimum Energy of the Sphere Charges (`U_sphere`)\n\nTo achieve the minimum energy for the entire system, the 12 charges on the surface of the sphere must arrange themselves to minimize their own mutual potential energy. This is a classic problem known as the Thomson problem. For N=12 particles, the configuration that minimizes the energy is a regular icosahedron.\n\nThe energy `U_sphere` is the sum of the potential energies of all pairs among these 12 charges. This can be expressed as:\n\n`U_sphere = C_12 * (k * q² / r)`\n\nwhere `C_12` is a dimensionless constant representing the sum of inverse distances for an icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius `r`. This constant is derived from the geometry of the icosahedron and its value is approximately 49.16525.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Total Minimum Energy\n\nThe total minimum energy of the system is the sum of these two components:\n\n`U_total = U_central + U_sphere`\n`U_total = (12 * k * q² / r) + (C_12 * k * q² / r)`\n`U_total = (12 + C_12) * (k * q² / r)`\n`U_total = (12 + 49.16525) * (k * q² / r)`\n`U_total = 61.16525 * (k * q² / r)`\n\n### 5. Numerical Calculation\n\nNow, we substitute the values of the constants:\n*   `e = 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ C`\n*   `q = 2e = 3.204353268 × 10⁻¹⁹ C`\n*   `k = 8.9875517923 × 10⁹ N·m²/C²`\n*   `r = 2 m`\n\nFirst, calculate the term `(k * q² / r)`:\n`q² = (3.204353268 × 10⁻¹⁹)² ≈ 1.0267876 × 10⁻³⁷ C²`\n`(k * q² / r) = (8.9875517923 × 10⁹ * 1.0267876 × 10⁻³⁷) / 2`\n`(k * q² / r) ≈ 4.61445 × 10⁻²⁸ J`\n\nFinally, calculate the total energy:\n`U_total = 61.16525 * (4.61445 × 10⁻²⁸ J)`\n`U_total ≈ 2.8226 × 10⁻²⁶ J`\n\nThis value, when rounded to three decimal places as presented in the options, is `2.822 × 10⁻²⁶ J`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
