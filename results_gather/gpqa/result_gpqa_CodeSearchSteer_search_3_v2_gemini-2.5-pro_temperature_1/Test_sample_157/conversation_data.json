    "A dominant-negative mutation produces a mutant protein that interferes with the function of the wild-type protein produced from the normal allele. In this scenario, the transcription factor must form a dimer to function. The mutation (Y) is in the dimerization domain. In a heterozygous individual, both wild-type and mutant (Y) protein subunits are produced.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the likely mechanism and why the other options are incorrect:\n*   **Formation of non-functional dimers:** The mutant Y subunit can still dimerize with a wild-type subunit. However, this resulting heterodimer (Wild-type + Mutant Y) is non-functional. This \"poisons\" the wild-type protein by sequestering it into an inactive complex.\n*   **Interference with the wild-type allele:** This mechanism is the essence of a dominant-negative effect; the mutant protein product antagonizes the wild-type protein product. This interference can lead to several downstream consequences.\n*   **Protein Degradation:** Often, when a cell forms an aberrant or misfolded protein complex, such as a non-functional heterodimer, the cell's quality control machinery recognizes it as faulty. This recognition can target the entire complex, including the wild-type subunit, for degradation via pathways like the ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) or the proteasome system. This degradation effectively leads to a loss of the wild-type protein, causing a loss-of-function phenotype even though a functional allele is present.\n\nConsidering the options:\n*   A) A dominant-negative mutation causes a loss-of-function, not a gain-of-function.\n*   B) A simple loss of dimerization for the mutant protein would likely result in a recessive mutation, not a dominant-negative one, as the wild-type subunits could still form functional homodimers. A dominant-negative effect implies interaction and interference, not a lack of interaction.\n*   C) While protein aggregation can be a consequence of some mutations and lead to a dominant-negative phenotype, it is a very specific mechanism. Targeted degradation of the non-functional complex is a more general and common mechanism for dealing with improperly formed multimeric proteins.\n*   D) This option accurately describes a common and direct mechanism for a dominant-negative effect in a dimeric protein. The mutant subunit binds to the wild-type subunit, the resulting complex is aberrant and non-functional, and the cell degrades it, thereby causing a loss-of-function of the wild-type allele.\n\nTherefore, the most likely molecular phenotype is the degradation of the protein, which leads to the loss of function of the wild-type allele.\n\n<<<D>>>"
