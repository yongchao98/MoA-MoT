    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Equilibrium Temperature\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is the theoretical temperature it would have if it were a perfect black body, heated only by its parent star. The formula is derived from the balance between the energy absorbed from the star and the energy radiated by the planet. The equilibrium temperature is proportional to the inverse square root of the planet's distance from its star.\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-major axis (a) is its orbital distance. The relationship is:\n\nT_eq ∝ (1/a)¹ᐟ²\n\n### 2. Kepler's Third Law\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a).\n\nP² ∝ a³\n\nThis can be rearranged to express the semi-major axis in terms of the orbital period:\n\na ∝ P²ᐟ³\n\n### 3. Combining the Formulas\nBy substituting the relationship from Kepler's Third Law into the equilibrium temperature relation, we can find how the equilibrium temperature depends on the orbital period:\n\nT_eq ∝ (1 / P²ᐟ³)¹ᐟ²\nT_eq ∝ 1 / P¹ᐟ³\nT_eq ∝ P⁻¹ᐟ³\n\n### 4. Calculating the Ratio\nNow, we can set up the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet_4 (T_eq4) and Planet_2 (T_eq2):\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4 / P2)⁻¹ᐟ³ = (P2 / P4)¹ᐟ³\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods for Planet_1 through Planet_5 as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. From this, we can identify the period values for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n*   P2 = 2 (in relative units)\n*   P4 = 3.5 (in relative units)\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the temperature ratio equation:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)¹ᐟ³\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\nTo find the numerical value:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)¹ᐟ³ = (4 / 7)¹ᐟ³ ≈ (0.5714)¹ᐟ³ ≈ 0.8298\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<A>>>"
