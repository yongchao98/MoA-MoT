    "To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph on a VLT 8m telescope, we must consider two main factors: the star's visibility from the Paranal Observatory and whether its brightness allows for a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 in a one-hour exposure.\n\n### 1. Limiting Magnitude of ESPRESSO\n\nThe European Southern Observatory (ESO) specifies the performance of its instruments. For ESPRESSO, when coupled with a single 8.2m Unit Telescope (UT), it can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 10 for an object with a V-band magnitude of about 17 in a one-hour exposure in its High Resolution (HR) mode. Therefore, any star with an apparent V magnitude brighter than (i.e., less than) 17 will be considered detectable, provided it is visible in the sky from the observatory's location.\n\n### 2. Visibility from Paranal Observatory\n\nThe Paranal Observatory is located in the Atacama Desert in Chile, at a latitude of approximately -24.6 degrees. This southern latitude restricts the visibility of stars in the far northern sky. A star's declination (celestial latitude) determines its visibility. Polaris, the North Star, is located at a declination of almost +90 degrees. From a latitude of -24.6 degrees, Polaris is permanently below the horizon and thus cannot be observed.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Each Star\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:** Canopus is the second brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent visual magnitude of about -0.74.\n*   **Visibility:** It has a declination of about -52° 42', making it easily visible from the Paranal Observatory.\n*   **Detectability:** Since its magnitude of -0.74 is significantly brighter than the limiting magnitude of 17, Canopus is **detectable**.\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:** Polaris has an apparent magnitude that varies around 1.98.\n*   **Visibility:** As a northern circumpolar star with a declination near +90°, it is not visible from the southern latitude of the Paranal Observatory.\n*   **Detectability:** Despite being bright enough, Polaris is **not detectable** because it is never visible in the sky above Paranal.\n\n**c) Star with Absolute V magnitude (M) of 15 at 10 pc**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m):** We use the distance modulus formula: m = M + 5 * log₁₀(d/10).\n    m = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(10/10) = 15 + 5 * 0 = 15.\n*   **Visibility:** The star is at a declination of 0 degrees, on the celestial equator, making it visible from all latitudes, including Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** With an apparent magnitude of 15, which is brighter than 17, this star is **detectable**.\n\n**d) Star with Absolute V magnitude (M) of 15 at 200 pc**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m):** m = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(200/10) = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(20) ≈ 15 + 5 * 1.301 = 21.5.\n*   **Visibility:** The declination of 0 degrees makes it visible from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** Its apparent magnitude of 21.5 is much fainter than the limiting magnitude of 17. Therefore, this star is **not detectable**.\n\n**e) Star with Absolute V magnitude (M) of 15 at 5 pc**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m):** m = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(5/10) = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(0.5) ≈ 15 + 5 * (-0.301) = 13.495.\n*   **Visibility:** The declination of 0 degrees makes it visible from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** With an apparent magnitude of approximately 13.5, this star is brighter than the limit of 17 and is therefore **detectable**.\n\n**f) Star with Absolute V magnitude (M) of 15 at 50 pc**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m):** m = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(50/10) = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(5) ≈ 15 + 5 * 0.699 = 18.495.\n*   **Visibility:** The declination of 0 degrees makes it visible from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** Its apparent magnitude of approximately 18.5 is fainter than the limiting magnitude of 17. Thus, this star is **not detectable**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTallying the results, the following stars would be detectable:\n1.  Canopus\n2.  Star with M=15 at 10 pc\n3.  Star with M=15 at 5 pc\n\nA total of **3** stars are detectable.\n\n<<<A>>>"
