    "To eliminate an anti-nutritional compound synthesized by a specific gene, the most effective strategy is to introduce a mutation that completely destroys the function of the protein encoded by that gene. This is known as a \"knock-out\" mutation. Let's analyze the provided mutations to determine which is most likely to achieve this.\n\nThe original gene sequence begins: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`. This translates to the amino acid sequence: `Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly...`\n\nNow, let's examine each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** The sequence is `5’-ATG TTC TAC...-3’`.\n    *   This translates to `Met-Phe-Tyr...`\n    *   Compared to the original (`Met-Phe-Leu...`), a single amino acid has been changed from Leucine (Leu) to Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a **missense mutation**. While a missense mutation *can* sometimes inactivate a protein, it often results in a protein that is still functional, especially if the changed amino acid is not in a critical part of the protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** The sequence is `5’-ATG TTC TAA...-3’`.\n    *   This translates to `Met-Phe-STOP`.\n    *   The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This type of mutation, which introduces a premature stop signal, is called a **nonsense mutation**. The synthesis of the protein will halt at this point, resulting in a severely shortened, truncated protein that is almost certainly non-functional. Introducing a premature stop codon is a very effective way to cause a loss of function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** The sequence appears to have multiple changes or a frameshift. If we assume it is a **frameshift mutation** (caused by an insertion or deletion of nucleotides not in a multiple of three), it would alter the entire downstream amino acid sequence. This is also very likely to result in a non-functional protein. However, the most unambiguous and definitively disruptive mutation presented in the options is the nonsense mutation.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** The sequence `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’` translates to `Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Thr...`\n    *   This represents at least two **missense mutations** (Leu to Tyr and Gly to Thr). Similar to Mutant 1, this changes amino acids but does not guarantee a complete loss of function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the options, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most probable one to completely eliminate the protein's function and, therefore, the anti-nutritional compound. It results in a protein that is truncated after only two amino acids, which cannot perform the complex function of synthesizing a compound. The missense mutations in the other mutants are far less certain to have such a drastic effect.\n\n<<<D>>>"
