    "An oscillating charge distribution, particularly one with a defined axis of symmetry like a spheroid, can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole. The behavior of the radiation from such a source follows well-established principles of electromagnetism.\n\n### Angular Distribution of Radiated Power\n\nFor an oscillating electric dipole with its axis along the z-axis, the power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) is not uniform in all directions. It is dependent on the angle θ relative to the axis of oscillation. The relationship is given by:\n\ndP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)\n\nThe maximum power, A, is radiated at the angle where sin²(θ) is at its maximum value of 1. This occurs at θ = 90°, which is perpendicular to the axis of oscillation.\n\nTo find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at an angle of θ = 30°, we can calculate sin²(30°):\n\n*   sin(30°) = 1/2\n*   sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4\n\nTherefore, the power radiated at 30° is 1/4 of the maximum power A.\n\n### Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nThe phenomenon of radiation from an oscillating charge distribution that is much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation is described by Rayleigh scattering. According to the theory of Rayleigh scattering, the amount of scattered or radiated power is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength (λ).\n\nThis can be expressed as:\n\nPower ∝ 1/λ⁴ or λ⁻⁴\n\nThis strong dependence on wavelength is the reason why the sky appears blue, as shorter (blue) wavelengths are scattered much more effectively by air molecules than longer (red) wavelengths.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining these two findings:\n*   The fraction of the maximum power A radiated at θ = 30° is **1/4**.\n*   The functional form of the radiated power's dependence on wavelength is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
