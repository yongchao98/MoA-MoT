    "To identify the unknown compound, a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data is necessary.\n\n### **Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of an O-H bond involved in hydrogen bonding, which is characteristic of the hydroxyl group in a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, which is also a key feature of a carboxylic acid.\n\nConclusion from FTIR: The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid group, so this data confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n\n### **Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe crucial information for distinguishing between the isomers lies in the complex splitting patterns described. The `n+1 rule` states that a signal is split into `n+1` peaks by `n` neighboring, non-equivalent protons. When a proton is coupled to multiple, different sets of neighboring protons, complex patterns like \"doublet of triplets\" emerge.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This confirms the absence of C=C double bonds, which is consistent with all four proposed saturated structures.\n*   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This indicates a proton is coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons: one proton (giving the doublet), two protons (giving the triplet), and three protons (giving the quartet).\n*   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This implies a proton is coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons: one proton (giving the doublet), a set of two protons (giving a triplet), and another set of two protons (giving another triplet).\n\nLet's analyze the expected splitting for the methine (CH) protons in each structure, as these are most likely to show such complex splitting.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 is adjacent to a CH at C2 (1H), a CH₃ group (3H), and a CH₂ group (2H). This would result in a **doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**, which matches the \"dtq\" description.\n    *   However, no other proton in this molecule is adjacent to three distinct groups of protons that would create a \"dtt\" pattern.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 is adjacent to a CH at C2 (1H), a CH₂ group from the ethyl at C3 (2H), and a CH₂ group at C4 (2H). This would give a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   No other proton would produce a \"dtq\" signal.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 is adjacent to a CH at C4 (1H), a CH₃ group (3H), and a CH₂ group at C2 (2H). This would create a **doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**, matching the \"dtq\" signal.\n    *   This structure lacks a proton that would give a \"dtt\" signal.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid):**\n    Let's first clarify the structure from the condensed formula. The longest carbon chain containing the COOH group has six carbons, with an ethyl group at C3 and a methyl group at C4. The IUPAC name is 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid.\n    *   **Proton at C3:** This proton is coupled to the proton at C4 (1H, a doublet), the protons at C2 (2H, a triplet), and the protons of the ethyl group's CH₂ at C3 (2H, a triplet). This results in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   **Proton at C4:** This proton is coupled to the proton at C3 (1H, a doublet), the protons at C5 (2H, a triplet), and the protons of the methyl group at C4 (3H, a quartet). This results in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nStructure D is the only compound that has two different protons whose predicted splitting patterns perfectly match both the \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" and the \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" signals described in the ¹H NMR data.\n\n<<<D>>>"
