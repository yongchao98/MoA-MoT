    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Framework:** The compound is described as a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by two substituent groups. The core formula for this part of the molecule is C6H4.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Functional Groups:**\n    *   The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an **ester group** (-COO-). This group contains one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum shows signals for vinyl protons, which indicates the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) outside the aromatic ring.\n\n3.  **Interpret the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (2 signals):** This is consistent with a di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4).\n    *   **Vinyl Protons (2 signals):** The presence of two signals for vinyl hydrogens (protons on a C=C double bond) that are coupled to each other is indicated.\n        *   One signal is a **doublet**, which means it is split by only one neighboring proton.\n        *   The other is a **doublet of quartets**. This complex splitting pattern is very informative. The \"doublet\" part arises from coupling to the other vinyl proton. The \"quartet\" part arises from coupling to a group of three equivalent protons (n+1=4, so n=3), which must be a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   **Putting it together:** The vinyl proton splitting pattern (a doublet and a doublet of quartets) strongly indicates a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)** is one of the substituents. This fragment contains one of the two methyl groups.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (2 signals):** The compound has two distinct methyl (-CH3) groups. One is part of the propenyl group just identified. The other must be part of the second substituent.\n    *   **No Methylene Protons (no -CH2- signals):** This is a crucial piece of information that helps eliminate other possibilities.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure and Determine the Formula:**\n    *   We have a C6H4 aromatic ring.\n    *   Substituent 1 is a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3), which has the formula C3H5.\n    *   Substituent 2 must contain the ester group (-COO-) and the second methyl group (-CH3), with no methylene (-CH2-) groups. The most logical structure for this is a methyl ester group (-COOCH3). This group has the formula C2H3O2.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Chemical Formula:**\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from the ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from methyl ester) = **11 carbons**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from the ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl ester) = **12 hydrogens**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from the ester) = **2 oxygens**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**. This molecular formula is consistent with all the provided spectral data. For instance, a compound like methyl 4-propenylbenzoate would fit this description.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) C12H12O2\nB) C11H12O2\nC) C11H14O2\nD) C12H14O2\n\nThe correct formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
