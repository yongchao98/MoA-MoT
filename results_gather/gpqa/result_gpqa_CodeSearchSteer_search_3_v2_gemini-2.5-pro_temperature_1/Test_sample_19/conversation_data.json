    "The impulse approximation in many-body nuclear calculations is a simplifying assumption that treats the interaction of a probe (like a lepton in an electroweak interaction) with a nucleus as a collection of independent interactions with individual nucleons. This approximation hinges on several key assumptions that collectively allow the complex many-body problem to be reduced to a more manageable single-body problem.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the provided assumptions and their relevance to the impulse approximation:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.** This is a fundamental tenet of the impulse approximation, often referred to as the one-body current assumption. It posits that the incoming probe interacts with a single nucleon, while the other nucleons in the nucleus act as spectators.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.** This assumption relates to what happens *after* the initial interaction. It implies that the struck nucleon exits the nucleus without any further interactions with the remaining (A-1) nucleons. This is known as the neglect of final-state interactions (FSI) and is a crucial part of the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA), a common form of this approximation.\n\n3.  **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.** The impulse approximation primarily deals with interactions at the nucleon level. It treats nucleons as the fundamental interacting particles, essentially as \"black boxes.\" While the internal quark and gluon structure of the nucleon is a deeper level of physics, the impulse approximation itself does not typically make assumptions about the relativistic nature of the quarks inside the nucleon. Therefore, this assumption is not a core requirement for the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.** This is a critical element of the approximation. It assumes that the interaction with the probe happens so quickly that the binding potential holding the nucleon within the nucleus is negligible *during the collision*. In this \"frozen\" approximation, the nucleon is treated as a free particle at the moment of interaction, possessing only the momentum it had within the nucleus.\n\nBased on this analysis, the three assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4. These assumptions paint a picture where a probe interacts with a single, quasi-free nucleon, which then escapes the nucleus without any further disturbance.\n\n<<<D>>>"
