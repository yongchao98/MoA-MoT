    "To identify the compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2, we must analyze the provided spectroscopic data and compare it with the proposed structures.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):** The first step is to calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is ((2 * 9 + 2) - 11 + 1) / 2 = 5. The presence of a benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation, and a carbonyl group (C=O) accounts for the fifth. This suggests the presence of a substituted benzene ring containing a carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The two medium to strong bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration, likely from an ester group, which typically appears in the 1750-1700 cm⁻¹ range.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons suggests a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is a classic sign of an ethyl group.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is a very common signal for the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The broadness is due to quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom and chemical exchange.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons, coupled with the triplet at 1.20 ppm, confirms the presence of an ethyl group. The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm indicates that the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester linkage (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split into two equivalent sets. The difference in chemical shifts suggests one substituent is electron-donating (shifting ortho protons upfield to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (shifting its ortho protons downfield to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n### Evaluating the Options:\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an ester, but the ethyl group is part of the propionate, not the alcohol portion. Its -CH₂- signal in the NMR would be around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This structure has a meta-substituted ring, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum, not two clean doublets. Also, the carbonyl stretch for an amide is typically at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm⁻¹) than the observed 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is consistent with all the data.\n    *   **Formula:** C9H11NO2.\n    *   **IR:** It has a primary amine (-NH₂) for the 3420/3325 cm⁻¹ bands and an ester carbonyl for the 1720 cm⁻¹ band.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** It contains an ethyl ester group, which accounts for the triplet at ~1.3 ppm and the quartet at ~4.3 ppm. It has a primary amine (-NH₂) that would show as a broad singlet around 4.0-4.2 ppm. The para-substituted ring with an electron-donating amine and an electron-withdrawing ester group explains the two doublets in the aromatic region. The reference spectra for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate confirm these assignments.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide. The IR spectrum would show only one N-H stretch, not two. The NMR would show a signal for the formyl proton (-CHO) at around 8.0-8.5 ppm.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe combination of a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring perfectly matches the provided spectral data. Therefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
