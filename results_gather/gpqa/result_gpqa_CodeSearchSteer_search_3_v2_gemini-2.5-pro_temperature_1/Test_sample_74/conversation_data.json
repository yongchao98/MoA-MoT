  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "To determine why the protein is not being overexpressed, the provided DNA sequence must be analyzed.\n\nThe construct is designed to have an N-terminal influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag. The amino acid sequence for this tag is YPYDVPDYA. A common DNA sequence that codes for this tag is 5'-TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC-3'.\n\nLet's analyze the provided DNA sequence by breaking it into three-nucleotide codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon:\n1.  **5' ATG** - This is the start codon, coding for Methionine (M).\n2.  **TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC** - This sequence translates to Tyrosine-Proline-Tyrosine-Aspartic Acid-Valine-Proline-Aspartic Acid-Tyrosine-Alanine (Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A), which is the correct sequence for the HA tag.\n3.  **AAA** - The codon immediately following the HA tag sequence is `AAA`, which codes for Lysine (K).\n4.  **TGA** - The next codon is `TGA`. In the standard genetic code, `TGA` is a stop codon (also known as an opal or umber codon).\n\nThe presence of a stop codon immediately after the tag sequence will signal for the ribosome to terminate translation. This is known as a nonsense mutation or the introduction of a premature termination codon (PTC). The result is the production of a very short, truncated peptide (M-YPYDVPDYA-K) instead of the full-length GADD45G fusion protein. This premature termination is the direct cause of the failure to detect the overexpressed protein.\n\nEvaluating the other options:\n*   **B) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** The analysis shows the HA tag sequence is correct and does not contain a missense mutation.\n*   **C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** While linkers can be important, the primary issue is that the full-length protein is not being synthesized in the first place due to the stop codon.\n*   **D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This statement is incorrect for two reasons. First, the stop codon present is `TGA`, not `UAA`. Second, stop codons are not recognized by tRNAs but by protein release factors that terminate translation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
