    "To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of the electron, we can use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n**1. Identify Given Information:**\n*   Uncertainty in the electron's position (Δx) = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   Velocity of the electron (v) = 2 x 10⁸ m/s\n\n**2. Select the Appropriate Physical Principles:**\nThe problem requires relating the uncertainty in position (Δx) to the uncertainty in energy (ΔE).\n\n*   First, we use the position-momentum form of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle to find the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp). The formula is:\n    Δx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, approximately 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n\n*   Next, we need a relation between energy (E) and momentum (p) to find the link between their uncertainties. Since the electron's speed (2 x 10⁸ m/s) is a significant fraction of the speed of light (c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s), we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n    E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²\n    where m₀ is the rest mass of the electron.\n\n*   By differentiating the energy-momentum equation, we can find the relationship between a change in energy (dE) and a change in momentum (dp). This relationship can be approximated for small uncertainties (ΔE and Δp):\n    ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp\n    where v is the velocity of the particle.\n\n**3. Calculation Steps:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp).**\n    Using the uncertainty principle:\n    Δp = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n    Δp = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 ⋅ 10⁻¹⁰ m)\n    Δp = 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE).**\n    Using the derived relation ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp:\n    ΔE = (2 x 10⁸ m/s) ⋅ (5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s)\n    ΔE = 10.54 x 10⁻¹⁷ J\n    ΔE ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\nThe calculated minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J. Comparing this result to the given options:\n\n*   A) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\n*   B) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\n*   C) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\n*   D) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n<<<D>>>"
