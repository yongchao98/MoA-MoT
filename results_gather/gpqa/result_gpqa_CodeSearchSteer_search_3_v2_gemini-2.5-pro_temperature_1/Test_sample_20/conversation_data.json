    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the correct option:\n\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\nTautomers are isomers that readily interconvert, often through the migration of a proton. Keto-enol tautomerism is a common type where a compound containing a carbonyl group (a keto form) is in equilibrium with its enol form (an alcohol adjacent to a double bond). A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen—a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons, and they each have hydrogen atoms. Due to the presence of these alpha-hydrogens, this molecule can undergo tautomerism. Its enol form is phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is particularly stable due to its aromaticity. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n*   **Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):** In this molecule, the carbons adjacent to the two carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds (they are sp2 hybridized). While these carbons do have hydrogen atoms, removing one to form an enol is very difficult. For keto-enol tautomerism to occur effectively, the alpha-hydrogen is typically on a saturated (sp3 hybridized) carbon. Thus, benzoquinone does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** Benzoquinone is the compound that does not show tautomerism.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center— a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical structure is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n    2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n    4.  a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since it has a chiral center, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and will exhibit optical isomerism (it has D and L isomers).\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule's structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the ester groups are in a *trans* position across the carbon-carbon double bond. This molecule does not contain any carbon atom bonded to four different groups, so it has no chiral center. The molecule itself is planar and has a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Achiral molecules do not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the compound that will show optical isomerism.\n\nCombining these findings, compound A is benzoquinone, and compound B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
