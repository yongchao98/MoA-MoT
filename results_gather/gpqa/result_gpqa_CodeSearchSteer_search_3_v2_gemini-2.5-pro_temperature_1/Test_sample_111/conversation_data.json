    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Normalize the State `|alpha>`\n\nThe given state of the electron is proportional to `(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`. First, we must normalize this state. A quantum state `|ψ>` must satisfy the condition `<ψ|ψ> = 1`.\n\nLet the unnormalized state be `|α'> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`.\nThe inner product `<α'|α'>` is:\n`<α'|α'> = <((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)|((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)>`\n`<α'|α'> = (1-i)(1+i)<up|up> + (2+i)(2-i)<down|down>`\nSince `<up|up> = 1` and `<down|down> = 1`, and the cross terms are zero, we have:\n`<α'|α'> = (1² + 1²) + (2² + (-1)²) = 2 + 5 = 7`\n\nThe normalization constant is `C = 1/sqrt(7)`.\nThe normalized state `|alpha>` is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n\nIn vector notation, where `|up>` is `[1, 0]^T` and `|down>` is `[0, 1]^T`, the state is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [ (1+i), (2-i) ]^T`\n\n### 2. Determine the Eigenstates and Eigenvalues of the Operator A\n\nThe operator `A` has matrix elements `Aij = hbar/2` for `i ≠ j` and `0` otherwise. This gives the matrix:\n`A = (hbar/2) * [ 0  1 ]`\n`              [ 1  0 ]`\nThis operator is proportional to the Pauli-X matrix, `σ_x`.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det( [ -λ      hbar/2 ] ) = 0`\n`    ( [ hbar/2   -λ    ] )`\n`(-λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)(hbar/2) = 0`\n`λ² - (hbar/2)² = 0`\n`λ = ± hbar/2`\n\nThe eigenvalues are `λ₁ = +hbar/2` and `λ₂ = -hbar/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors:\n*   **For λ₁ = +hbar/2:**\n    `A|v₁> = (hbar/2)|v₁>`\n    `(hbar/2) * [ 0  1 ] [a] = (hbar/2) [a]`\n    `          [ 1  0 ] [b]          [b]`\n    This leads to `b = a`. The eigenvector is proportional to `[1, 1]^T`.\n    Normalizing it gives the eigenvector `|v₁> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1]^T = (1/sqrt(2))(|up> + |down>)`.\n\n*   **For λ₂ = -hbar/2:**\n    `A|v₂> = (-hbar/2)|v₂>`\n    `(hbar/2) * [ 0  1 ] [a] = (-hbar/2) [a]`\n    `          [ 1  0 ] [b]           [b]`\n    This leads to `b = -a`. The eigenvector is proportional to `[1, -1]^T`.\n    Normalizing it gives the eigenvector `|v₂> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1]^T = (1/sqrt(2))(|up> - |down>)`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue is the square of the magnitude of the projection of the state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector `P(λ_n) = |<v_n|alpha>|²`.\n\n*   **Probability of measuring λ₁ = +hbar/2:**\n    `P(λ₁) = |<v₁|alpha>|²`\n    `<v₁|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [<up| + <down|] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n    `<v₁|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [(1+i)<up|up> + (2-i)<down|down>]`\n    `<v₁|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1 + i + 2 - i) = 3/sqrt(14)`\n    `P(λ₁) = |3/sqrt(14)|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.6428`\n\n*   **Probability of measuring λ₂ = -hbar/2:**\n    `P(λ₂) = |<v₂|alpha>|²`\n    `<v₂|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [<up| - <down|] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n    `<v₂|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [(1+i)<up|up> - (2-i)<down|down>]`\n    `<v₂|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1 + i - 2 + i) = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)`\n    `P(λ₂) = |(-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1 + 4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571`\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Average (Expectation) Value\n\nThe expectation value of an operator `A` can be calculated in two ways:\n1.  `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha>`\n2.  `<A> = Σ P(λ_n) * λ_n`\n\nUsing the second, simpler method:\n`<A> = P(λ₁)λ₁ + P(λ₂)λ₂`\n`<A> = (9/14)(+hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2)`\n`<A> = (hbar/2) * (9/14 - 5/14)`\n`<A> = (hbar/2) * (4/14)`\n`<A> = (hbar/2) * (2/7)`\n`<A> = hbar/7`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of the operator is `hbar/7`. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
