    "To determine the correct option, we need to find the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ and then determine if the theory is renormalizable.\n\n### 1. Determining Mass Dimensions of Fields and Operators\n\nIn natural units (where ħ = c = 1), the action $S = \\int d^4x \\mathcal{L}$ is dimensionless. Since the spacetime integral $d^4x$ has a mass dimension of [M]⁻⁴, the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension of [M]⁴ to compensate.\n\nLet's find the mass dimensions of the components in the interaction Lagrangian, $\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$:\n\n*   **Fermion Field ($\\psi$):** The kinetic term for a fermion is $\\mathcal{L}_{kinetic} = \\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu - m)\\psi$. For this term to have a mass dimension of [M]⁴, and knowing that the derivative operator $\\partial_\\mu$ has a mass dimension of [M]¹, we can deduce the dimension of $\\psi$.\n    *   $[\\bar{\\psi}][\\psi][\\partial_\\mu] = [M]^4$\n    *   Since $[\\bar{\\psi}] = [\\psi]$, we have $[\\psi]^2[M]^1 = [M]^4$, which gives $[\\psi]^2 = [M]^3$.\n    *   Therefore, the mass dimension of the fermion field is $[\\psi] = [M]^{3/2}$.\n\n*   **Electromagnetic Field Strength Tensor ($F^{\\mu\\nu}$):** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is $\\mathcal{L}_{EM} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$. For this to have a mass dimension of [M]⁴, we get:\n    *   $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]^2 = [M]^4$\n    *   Therefore, the mass dimension of the field strength tensor is $[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = [M]^2$.\n\n*   **Sigma Tensor ($\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$):** This is defined as $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}=\\frac{i}{2}\\left[\\gamma_{\\mu},\\gamma_{\\nu}\\right]$. The gamma matrices, $\\gamma_\\mu$, are dimensionless matrices. Consequently, their commutator, and thus $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$, is also dimensionless, having a mass dimension of [M]⁰.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Mass Dimension of κ\n\nNow, we use the fact that the interaction term in the Lagrangian, $\\mathcal{L}_{int}$, must also have a mass dimension of [M]⁴:\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa][\\bar{\\psi}][\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}][\\psi][F^{\\mu\\nu}] = [M]^4$\n\nSubstituting the dimensions we found:\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot [M]^{3/2} \\cdot [M]^0 \\cdot [M]^{3/2} \\cdot [M]^2 = [M]^4$\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot [M]^{3/2 + 3/2 + 2} = [M]^4$\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot [M]^{3 + 2} = [M]^4$\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot [M]^5 = [M]^4$\n\nSolving for the mass dimension of $\\kappa$:\n$[\\kappa] = [M]^{4-5} = [M]^{-1}$\n\n### 3. Determining Renormalizability\n\nA key criterion for determining whether a theory is renormalizable by power-counting is the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n*   If all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions (≥ 0), the theory is generally renormalizable (or super-renormalizable).\n*   If any coupling constant has a negative mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable. This is because interactions with negative mass dimension couplings become stronger at high energies, leading to divergences in higher-order calculations that cannot be absorbed by a finite number of counterterms.\n\nSince we found that $[\\kappa] = [M]^{-1}$, the coupling constant has a negative mass dimension. Therefore, the theory is not renormalizable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
