    "To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with parallax, we can follow these steps, assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space.\n\n1.  **Volume of a spherical shell:** Consider a thin spherical shell of space at a distance *d* from the observer with a small thickness *dd*. The volume of this shell (*dV*) is its surface area (4π*d*²) multiplied by its thickness (*dd*).\n    *   *dV* = 4π*d*² *dd*\n\n2.  **Number of stars in the shell:** If the density of stars in space is uniform (let's call it ρ), then the number of stars (*dN*) in this shell is the density multiplied by the volume of the shell.\n    *   *dN* = ρ * *dV* = 4πρ*d*² *dd*\n\n3.  **Relating distance (d) and parallax (plx):** The parallax of a star is inversely proportional to its distance. If parallax is measured in arcseconds and distance in parsecs, the relationship is:\n    *   *d* = 1 / *plx*\n\n4.  **Relating differentials dd and d(plx):** We need to find how a small change in distance (*dd*) relates to a small change in parallax (*d(plx)*). We can find this by taking the derivative of *d* with respect to *plx*.\n    *   *dd* / *d(plx)* = d(1/*plx*)/d(*plx*) = -1 / *plx*²\n    *   Therefore, *dd* = -*d(plx)* / *plx*². The negative sign indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. For star counts, we are interested in the magnitude, so we use |*dd*| = |*d(plx)*| / *plx*².\n\n5.  **Substituting into the number of stars equation:** Now, we substitute the expressions for *d* and *dd* in terms of *plx* into our equation for *dN*.\n    *   *dN* = 4πρ * (1/*plx*)² * (*d(plx)*/ *plx*²)\n    *   *dN* = (4πρ / *plx*⁴) * *d(plx)*\n\n6.  **Finding the number of stars per unit parallax:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is *dN*/*d(plx)*.\n    *   *dN* / *d(plx)* = 4πρ / *plx*⁴\n\nSince 4πρ is a constant, the number of stars per unit parallax range is proportional to 1/*plx*⁴. This relationship is also a foundational concept in understanding the Lutz-Kelker bias, which accounts for observational biases in parallax measurements based on the assumption of uniform stellar distribution.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx as ~ 1/plx⁴.\n\n<<<B>>>"
