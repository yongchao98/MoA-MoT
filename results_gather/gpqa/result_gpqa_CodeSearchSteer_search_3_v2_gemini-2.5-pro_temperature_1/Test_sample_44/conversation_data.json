    "Here is the step-by-step calculation for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\nThe energy for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L is given by the formula:\nE_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\n\nFor simplicity, we use the given energy unit E = π²ħ² / 2mL². Therefore, the energy of a single particle in the nth state is:\nE_n = n²E, where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2 particles, which means they are fermions. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. In this system, a quantum state is defined by the energy level quantum number 'n' and the spin quantum number 'm_s' (which can be +1/2 or -1/2). This means each energy level 'n' can accommodate a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**1. Ground State Energy**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest possible energy levels with the four particles, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   **Energy Level n=1:** We can place two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down). The energy for these two particles is 2 × E₁ = 2 × (1²E) = 2E.\n*   **Energy Level n=2:** We place the remaining two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down). The energy for these two particles is 2 × E₂ = 2 × (2²E) = 2 × 4E = 8E.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_ground = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n**2. First Excited State Energy**\n\nTo get the first excited state, we move one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state configuration to the next available unoccupied energy level.\n*   The ground state configuration is two particles in n=1 and two particles in n=2.\n*   We excite one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   The new configuration is:\n    *   **n=1:** Two particles, with energy 2 × (1²E) = 2E.\n    *   **n=2:** One particle, with energy 1 × (2²E) = 4E.\n    *   **n=3:** One particle, with energy 1 × (3²E) = 9E.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_first_excited = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n**3. Second Excited State Energy**\n\nTo find the second excited state, we must consider the next lowest energy configurations above the first excited state. There are a few possibilities for excitation from the ground state:\n*   **Possibility A:** Excite one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1²E) + (1 × 2²E) + (1 × 4²E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n*   **Possibility B:** Excite both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1²E) + (2 × 3²E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n*   **Possibility C:** Excite one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × 1²E) + (2 × 2²E) + (1 × 3²E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n\nComparing the energies of these possible excited states (22E, 20E, and 18E), the lowest energy after the first excited state (15E) is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the energies are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
