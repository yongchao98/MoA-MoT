    "This is a stoichiometric problem that can be solved by analyzing the products of the thermal decomposition.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Gaseous Products\n\nThe problem states that a mixture of gases was formed and passed through three tubes.\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 15.999 ≈ 18.015 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ **0.20 mol**.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. Since the weight of the tube did not change, we can conclude that no acidic gases were present in the mixture.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states that CuO was formed and the weight of the tube increased by 0.80 g. This mass increase is due to the oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   The simplest oxidizing gas containing oxygen is O₂. If the gas was O₂, this would correspond to 0.05 mol / 2 = **0.025 mol of O₂**.\n\n4.  **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   This gas did not react with a desiccant, limewater, or hot copper. This indicates it is a relatively inert gas. The most common inert gas from the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts\n\nThe initial 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B decomposed entirely into H₂O, O₂, and N₂. We can verify the law of conservation of mass:\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.025 mol * 32.00 g/mol = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = 0.10 mol * 28.02 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total Mass of Gases = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the salts, confirming our analysis of the products.\n\nNow, we calculate the total moles of each element in the original mixture:\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 0.20 mol H₂O × 2 H/H₂O = **0.40 mol H**\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** 0.10 mol N₂ × 2 N/N₂ = **0.20 mol N**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** (0.20 mol H₂O × 1 O/H₂O) + (0.025 mol O₂ × 2 O/O₂) = 0.20 + 0.05 = **0.25 mol O**\n\n### Step 3: Identify Salts A and B\n\nThe salts contain Hydrogen, Nitrogen, and Oxygen. Common salts with these elements are ammonium salts like ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). The problem states the mixture of salts A and B is equimolar (contains the same number of moles of each salt).\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the salts are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) → N₂ + 2H₂O**\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃) → N₂ + ½O₂ + 2H₂O** (This decomposition pathway for NH₄NO₃ occurs at 250-300°C and fits the products observed).\n\nLet the mixture contain `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ and `n` moles of NH₄NO₃.\n*   Total moles of N₂ produced = `n` (from A) + `n` (from B) = 2`n`\n*   Total moles of H₂O produced = 2`n` (from A) + 2`n` (from B) = 4`n`\n*   Total moles of O₂ produced = 0 (from A) + 0.5`n` (from B) = 0.5`n`\n\nFrom our product analysis, we know:\n*   Moles of O₂ = 0.025 mol. So, 0.5`n` = 0.025 mol ⇒ `n` = 0.05 mol.\n*   Let's check this with the other products:\n    *   Moles of N₂ = 2`n` = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol. (This matches our findings).\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 4`n` = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. (This also matches).\n\nThe identification is consistent. The mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in their respective chemical formulas.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen (N) atom from NH₄⁺ + 1 Nitrogen (N) atom from NO₂⁻ = 2 N atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   2 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   Total atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 2 + 4 + 2 = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen (N) atom from NH₄⁺ + 1 Nitrogen (N) atom from NO₃⁻ = 2 N atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   3 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   Total atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 2 + 4 + 3 = **9 atoms**.\n\nThe total number of atoms in both salts is the sum of the atoms in each formula:\nTotal atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
