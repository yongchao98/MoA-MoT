    "The decay of a hydrogen atom from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state is a two-photon process, as a single-photon transition is forbidden by the selection rules for electric dipole transitions. The decay must proceed through an intermediate state.\n\n**1. Selection Rules:**\nFor an electric dipole transition, the selection rules for the orbital angular momentum quantum number *l* and the magnetic quantum number *m* are:\n*   Δ*l* = *l*<sub>final</sub> - *l*<sub>initial</sub> = ±1\n*   Δ*m* = *m*<sub>final</sub> - *m*<sub>initial</sub> = 0, ±1\n\n**2. Identifying the Transition Route:**\nThe process occurs in two steps:\n*   **Step 1:** Transition from the initial state |3,0,0⟩ to an intermediate state |*n'*,*l'*,*m'*⟩.\n    *   Applying the selection rules to the initial state |*n*=3, *l*=0, *m*=0⟩:\n        *   Δ*l* = *l'* - 0 = ±1  ⇒ *l'* = 1.\n        *   Δ*m* = *m'* - 0 = 0, ±1 ⇒ *m'* can be 0, 1, or -1.\n    *   For a decay, the principal quantum number *n* must decrease. A prominent intermediate state is the *n'*=2 level. Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.\n\n*   **Step 2:** Transition from the intermediate state |*n'*,*l'*,*m'*⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩.\n    *   Let's check the validity of the options provided. All options point to the intermediate state being one of the *n'*=2, *l'*=1 levels.\n    *   Let's verify the transition from the intermediate state |2,1,0⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩:\n        *   Δ*l* = 0 - 1 = -1 (Allowed).\n        *   Δ*m* = 0 - 0 = 0 (Allowed).\n    *   This confirms that the cascade |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is a valid decay route according to the selection rules. The other possible routes through |2,1,1⟩ and |2,1,-1⟩ are also valid.\n\n**3. Determining the Transition Probability (Branching Ratio):**\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific decay route. This refers to the branching ratio of the initial decay step. The initial state |3,0,0⟩ (a 3s orbital) is spherically symmetric. When it decays, it can transition to any of the three degenerate sublevels of the 2p state: |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n\nBecause the initial state is spherically symmetric and in the absence of any external polarizing fields, the probability of transitioning to any of the available degenerate final states is equal. The 2p state has three such sublevels (*m'* = -1, 0, 1).\n\nTherefore, the total probability of 1 is distributed equally among these three channels:\n*   Probability(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩) = 1/3\n*   Probability(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = 1/3\n*   Probability(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩) = 1/3\n\nThe transition from the 2p state to the 1s state is extremely fast, so the probability of the second step is nearly 1. The overall probability of the cascade is thus determined by the branching ratio of the first step.\n\nBased on this analysis, the probability for the transition route |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is 1/3.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) Probability of 2/3 is incorrect.\n*   B) Probability of 1/4 is incorrect.\n*   C) Probability of 1/4 is incorrect.\n*   D) Proposes the route |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a probability of 1/3, which matches our derivation.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$\n\n<<<D>>>"
