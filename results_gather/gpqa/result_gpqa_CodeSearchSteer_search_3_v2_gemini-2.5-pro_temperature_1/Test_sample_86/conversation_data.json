    "To identify the correct 1H NMR data, we must first deduce the structure of the compound from the given information.\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula and Core Structure:** The compound has a 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring (C6). It is di-substituted and contains a total of 8 carbon atoms. This leaves two carbon atoms for the two substituents combined.\n2.  **Functional Groups from FTIR:** The FTIR spectrum indicates a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X).\n3.  **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X) directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining two carbons and the carbonyl group. The only common chemical group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The two substituents are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n\nNow, let's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for a haloacetophenone and compare it with the given options. The molecule has two sets of protons: those on the aromatic ring and those on the methyl group of the acetyl substituent.\n\n*   **Acetyl Protons (-COCH3):** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent and have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a singlet (s) integrating to 3H. Their chemical shift is typically around 2.3-2.6 ppm.\n*   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** A di-substituted benzene ring has four protons. Their chemical shift is in the aromatic region, typically 6.5-8.0 ppm. The splitting pattern depends on the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para).\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This option lacks signals in the typical aromatic region (6.5-8.0 ppm). The peaks at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are too far upfield. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   Similar to A, this option does not show a pattern consistent with a di-substituted aromatic ring. The integration of 2H for a singlet at 1.3 ppm is also unusual for the proposed structure. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two signals in the aromatic region, `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. Two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The electron-withdrawing acetyl group deshields the ortho protons more significantly than the halogen, which accounts for the two distinct doublets. For example, the 1H NMR spectrum for 4-chloroacetophenone shows doublets at approximately 7.9 ppm and 7.4 ppm. Likewise, 4-bromoacetophenone shows doublets around 7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm.\n    *   **Acetyl Protons:** The signal `2.3 (3H, s)` is a singlet integrating to three protons at a chemical shift consistent with a methyl group next to a carbonyl.\n    *   This option perfectly matches the expected spectrum for a *para*-haloacetophenone.\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). This would suggest a different structure, such as a *para*-halophenylacetaldehyde (-CH2CHO substituent). However, in such a structure, the methylene protons (-CH2-) and the aldehyde proton (-CHO) are adjacent and would split each other, resulting in a doublet and a triplet, respectively. Since the data shows two singlets, this option is inconsistent with the expected splitting patterns.\n\nBased on this analysis, the data in option C is the only one that correctly represents the described compound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
