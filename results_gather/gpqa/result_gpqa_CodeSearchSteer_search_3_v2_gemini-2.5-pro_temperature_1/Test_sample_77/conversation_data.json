    "The expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials describe the complete, relativistically correct electromagnetic field for a point charge in arbitrary motion.\n\nThe key principle is that electromagnetic effects propagate at the finite speed of light, *c*. Therefore, the potentials at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time *t* are determined by the state of the charge *q* at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time *tr*. The retarded time is when the electromagnetic signal was generated, such that it arrives at $\\vec{r}$ exactly at time *t*. This condition is expressed as $t - tr = d/c$, where *d* is the magnitude of the vector $\\vec{d}$ from the charge's position at the retarded time, $\\vec{s}(tr)$, to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n\nThe derivation of these potentials from Maxwell's equations yields the following expressions:\n\nThe scalar potential is given by:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nAnd the vector potential is given by:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nHere, all quantities related to the charge (its position, which determines $\\vec{d}$, and its velocity $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time *tr*.\n\nTo match these standard forms with the given options, we can manipulate the denominator:\n$d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the scalar potential V:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nSimilarly, for the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{(\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese results match the expressions provided in option D. It is also a known property of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials that the vector potential can be related to the scalar potential by $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$, which is satisfied by the expressions in option D when using the relation $c^2 = 1/(\\epsilon_o\\mu_o)$.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions are:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$ and $\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$.\n\n<<<D>>>"
