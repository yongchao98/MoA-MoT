    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The question describes the annihilation of a high-energy gamma-ray (γ) with a photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background (γ_CMB) to produce an electron-positron pair (e⁺e⁻). The reaction is:\n    γ + γ_CMB → e⁺ + e⁻\n\n2.  **Determine the threshold condition:** For this reaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the products, which are an electron and a positron. The rest mass of an electron (mₑ) is the same as a positron. Therefore, the minimum energy required is 2 * mₑc².\n\n3.  **Apply relativistic kinematics:** The threshold energy is the minimum energy the high-energy gamma-ray (E_γ) must have to create the electron-positron pair. This minimum occurs under the most efficient condition, which is a head-on collision between the high-energy gamma-ray and the CMB photon.\n\n4.  **Formulate the threshold equation:** For a head-on collision between two photons, the threshold condition for pair production is given by the equation:\n    E_γ * E_CMB = (mₑc²)²\n\n    Where:\n    *   E_γ is the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray.\n    *   E_CMB is the energy of the CMB photon.\n    *   mₑc² is the rest mass energy of an electron.\n\n5.  **Gather the required values:**\n    *   The problem states the average photon energy of the CMB (E_CMB) is 10⁻³ eV.\n    *   The rest mass energy of an electron (mₑc²) is a known physical constant, approximately 0.511 MeV.\n\n6.  **Convert units for consistency:** Since the desired answer is in GeV, it's best to work with a consistent unit of energy, such as eV.\n    *   mₑc² = 0.511 MeV = 0.511 * 10⁶ eV\n    *   E_CMB = 10⁻³ eV\n\n7.  **Calculate the threshold energy (E_γ):** Rearrange the formula to solve for E_γ:\n    E_γ = (mₑc²)² / E_CMB\n\n    Substitute the values:\n    E_γ = (0.511 * 10⁶ eV)² / (10⁻³ eV)\n    E_γ = (0.2611 * 10¹² eV²) / (10⁻³ eV)\n    E_γ = 0.2611 * 10¹⁵ eV\n    E_γ = 2.611 * 10¹⁴ eV\n\n8.  **Convert the final energy to GeV:**\n    *   1 GeV = 10⁹ eV\n    *   E_γ = (2.611 * 10¹⁴ eV) / (10⁹ eV/GeV)\n    *   E_γ = 2.611 * 10⁵ GeV\n\n9.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) 3.9 * 1e5 GeV\n    *   B) 2.6 * 1e5 GeV\n    *   C) 9.5 * 1e4 GeV\n    *   D) 1.8 * 1e5 GeV\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 2.6 * 10⁵ GeV matches option B. This process, where high-energy gamma rays are attenuated by pair production with CMB photons, sets a limit on the distance that very high-energy gamma rays can travel through the universe.\n\n<<<B>>>"
