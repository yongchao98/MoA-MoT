    "To clearly distinguish between two quantum energy levels, the difference in their energies must be greater than the inherent uncertainty, or \"width,\" of each energy level. This concept is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n**1. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**\n\nThe time-energy uncertainty principle states that the uncertainty in the energy of a state (ΔE) multiplied by the lifetime of that state (Δt) is at least on the order of the reduced Planck constant (ħ). The relationship can be expressed as:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nHere, the lifetime of the state (τ) can be considered the uncertainty in time (Δt). This means a state that exists for a shorter time has a larger uncertainty in its energy. This energy uncertainty is also known as the natural linewidth (Γ).\n\n**2. Calculating the Energy Width**\n\nWe can calculate the energy width for each state using a simplified form of the uncertainty relation, Γ ≈ ħ/τ, where ħ is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n*   **For the first state (E1):**\n    *   Lifetime (τ₁) = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width (Γ₁) ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n    *   **Γ₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n*   **For the second state (E2):**\n    *   Lifetime (τ₂) = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width (Γ₂) ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n    *   **Γ₂ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\n**3. The Resolution Condition**\n\nFor the two energy levels to be clearly resolved, the energy difference between them, |E2 - E1|, must be significantly larger than the broader of the two energy widths. The state with the shorter lifetime (τ₁) has the larger energy width (Γ₁). Therefore, the condition for the levels to be distinguishable is:\n\n|E2 - E1| > Γ₁\n|E2 - E1| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**4. Evaluating the Options**\n\nNow we compare the given options with this requirement:\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than the required energy difference.\n*   B) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much larger than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   C) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is smaller than the required energy difference.\n*   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is significantly smaller than the required energy difference.\n\nOnly option B provides an energy separation that is large enough to clearly distinguish the two energy levels, as it is several orders of magnitude greater than the natural linewidth of the broader state.\n\n<<<B>>>"
