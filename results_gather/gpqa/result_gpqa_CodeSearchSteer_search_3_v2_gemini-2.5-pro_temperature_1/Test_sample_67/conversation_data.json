    "The phenomenon described is known as Larmor precession. When a magnetic moment (in this case, arising from the particle's spin) is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes the magnetic moment vector to precess around the direction of the magnetic field. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nInitially, the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the spin is in the \"spin-up\" state along the Z-axis. When this field is switched off and a new field of the same magnitude, B, is applied in the +Y direction, the spin begins to precess around the new field direction (+Y).\n\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the spin, and thus the z-component of the magnetic moment, will oscillate as the spin vector precesses. The angular frequency of this oscillation is the Larmor frequency, which is given by the formula:\n\nω = γB\n\nHere, ω is the angular frequency, γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, and B is the magnitude of the magnetic field.\n\nThe detailed quantum mechanical calculation confirms this. The initial state is the eigenstate of the spin operator S_z. The time evolution is governed by the new Hamiltonian, H = -μ ⋅ B = -γB S_y. By solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is found to be:\n\n⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (γħ/2)cos(γBt)\n\nFrom this expression, the angular frequency of oscillation is clearly ω = γB. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
