    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\nThis reaction is the alpha-bromination of a ketone, which results in the substitution of a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group with a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\nWhen an α-halo ketone, such as 2-bromocyclohexanone, is treated with a strong base like NaOH, it undergoes a reaction known as the Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a bicyclic intermediate which then rearranges to form a ring-contracted carboxylic acid (after an acidic workup, which is implicit in such sequences). Therefore, the six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to a five-membered ring.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\nThis is a standard method to convert a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acid chloride. The thionyl chloride replaces the hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid with a chlorine atom.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce reactive acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to an alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Determining the Number of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to analyze the molecule's structure and symmetry. Chemically distinct hydrogens will appear as separate signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO). Due to the molecule's structure and the rapid conformational changes of the ring, we can identify the following sets of unique protons:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (1H):** This proton is attached to the carbonyl carbon and is in a unique chemical environment.\n2.  **The proton on C1 of the ring (1H):** This is the single hydrogen on the carbon atom to which the aldehyde group is attached. It is also in a unique environment.\n3.  **The alpha-protons (4H):** These are the four hydrogens on the two carbons adjacent to C1 (C2 and C5). Due to molecular symmetry, the two protons on C2 are equivalent to the two on C5. However, on each of these carbons, the two protons themselves are not equivalent (they are diastereotopic). This results in two distinct sets of protons.\n4.  **The beta-protons (4H):** These are the four hydrogens on the carbons further from the aldehyde group (C3 and C4). Similar to the alpha-protons, the protons on C3 are equivalent to those on C4. Within each of these CH₂ groups, the two protons are diastereotopic, creating two more distinct sets of protons.\n\nCounting these sets gives us the total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms:\n*   1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (alpha-protons sets) + 2 (beta-protons sets) = **6**\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
