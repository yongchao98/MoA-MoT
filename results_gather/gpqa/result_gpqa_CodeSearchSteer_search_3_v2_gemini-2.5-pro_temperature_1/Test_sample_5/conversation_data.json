    "To find the energy spectrum for the given potential, we first need to express the potential in Cartesian coordinates (x, y).\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²(θ)\n\nWe use the standard transformations from polar to Cartesian coordinates:\nx = r cos(θ)\ny = r sin(θ)\nr² = x² + y²\n\nSubstituting these into the potential expression:\nThe first term is `1/2 kr² = 1/2 k(x² + y²)`.\nThe second term involves `r cos(θ)`, which is simply `x`. So, `kr² cos²(θ) = k(r cos(θ))² = kx²`.\n\nNow, substitute these back into the potential V:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 kx²\nV(x, y) = 1/2 kx² + 1/2 ky² + 3/2 kx²\nCombine the terms with x²:\nV(x, y) = (1/2 k + 3/2 k)x² + 1/2 ky²\nV(x, y) = (4/2 k)x² + 1/2 ky²\nV(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky²\n\nThis potential is the sum of two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potentials, one in the x-direction and one in the y-direction:\nV(x, y) = Vₓ(x) + Vᵧ(y)\nwhere:\nVₓ(x) = 2kx² = 1/2 (4k)x²\nVᵧ(y) = 1/2 ky²\n\nThe energy eigenvalues of a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential `V(q) = 1/2 mω²q²` are given by `Eₙ = (n + 1/2)ħω`, where `ω = sqrt(k_eff/m)`.\n\nFor the motion in the x-direction:\nThe effective spring constant is `kₓ = 4k`.\nThe angular frequency is `ωₓ = sqrt(kₓ/m) = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)`.\nThe energy levels for the x-oscillator are `Eₙₓ = (nₓ + 1/2)ħωₓ = (nₓ + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m)`.\n\nFor the motion in the y-direction:\nThe effective spring constant is `kᵧ = k`.\nThe angular frequency is `ωᵧ = sqrt(kᵧ/m) = sqrt(k/m)`.\nThe energy levels for the y-oscillator are `Eₙᵧ = (nᵧ + 1/2)ħωᵧ = (nᵧ + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)`.\n\nSince the motions in the x and y directions are independent, the total energy E is the sum of the energies for each direction:\nE = Eₙₓ + Eₙᵧ\nE = (nₓ + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m) + (nᵧ + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nNow, we can factor out the common term `ħ * sqrt(k/m)`:\nE = [ 2(nₓ + 1/2) + (nᵧ + 1/2) ] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = [ 2nₓ + 1 + nᵧ + 1/2 ] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2nₓ + nᵧ + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) E = (3nₓ+2nᵧ+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nB) E = (2nₓ+3nᵧ+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nC) E = (nₓ+3*nᵧ+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nD) E = (2nₓ+nᵧ+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe calculated energy spectrum matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
