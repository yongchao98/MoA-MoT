    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1.\n\n### 1. Relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its host star and the energy it radiates. For a planet in a circular orbit, this can be expressed as:\n\nT_eq ∝ (1/d²)^(1/4)\n\nwhere 'd' is the orbital distance (semi-major axis). This simplifies to:\n\nT_eq ∝ d^(-1/2)\n\nThis relationship shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance. From this, we can express the orbital distance in terms of the equilibrium temperature:\n\nd ∝ T_eq^(-2)\n\n### 2. Relationship between Orbital Period and Orbital Distance\n\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (P) of a planet is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (d), for all planets orbiting the same star.\n\nP² ∝ d³\n\nTaking the square root of both sides gives:\n\nP ∝ d^(3/2)\n\n### 3. Combining Temperature and Period Relationships\n\nNow, we can find a direct relationship between the orbital period and the equilibrium temperature by substituting the expression for 'd' from Step 1 into the relationship from Step 2:\n\nP ∝ (T_eq^(-2))^(3/2)\nP ∝ T_eq^(-3)\n\nThis crucial result shows that the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Temperature Ratio\n\nWe are given the following ratios of equilibrium temperatures:\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 1.4\n*   T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet3 (T_eq1 / T_eq3), we can multiply the two given ratios:\n\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) = T_eq1 / T_eq3\n1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22\n\nSo, T_eq1 / T_eq3 ≈ 3.22.\n\n### 5. Calculating the Orbital Period Ratio\n\nUsing the relationship P ∝ T_eq^(-3) from Step 3, we can set up the ratio for the orbital periods of Planet3 and Planet1:\n\nP3 / P1 = (T_eq3 / T_eq1)³\n\nThis can be rewritten using the inverse of the temperature ratio we calculated in Step 4:\n\nP3 / P1 = (1 / (T_eq1 / T_eq3))³ = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)³\n\nNow, we can substitute the value calculated in Step 4:\n\nP3 / P1 = (3.22)³\nP3 / P1 ≈ 33.386\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation shows that the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 33.4.\n\nThe information regarding the planets' masses and their discovery via the Transit Timing Variation (TTV) method is not required for this calculation, which relies on the fundamental principles of radiative equilibrium and orbital mechanics. The fact that the albedo is the same for all three planets is an important condition that allows for this direct comparison.\n\n<<<B>>>"
