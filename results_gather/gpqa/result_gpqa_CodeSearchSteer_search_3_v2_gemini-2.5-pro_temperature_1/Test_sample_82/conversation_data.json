    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.\n\n### Summary of Initial Conditions\n*   **Initial Acetic Acid (HA):** 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M solution.\n*   **Dilution:** An additional 20.00 cm³ of water is added.\n*   **Titrant:** 0.1 M NaOH (a strong base).\n*   **Acid Dissociation Constant (Ka):** 1.85x10⁻⁵ for acetic acid.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Diluted Concentration of Acetic Acid\n\nFirst, determine the initial moles of acetic acid:\n*   Moles HA = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.02000 L = 0.001 moles\n\nNext, calculate the new concentration after adding 20.00 cm³ of water. The total volume becomes 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ (or 0.0400 L).\n*   New [HA] = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻). This creates a buffer solution.\n\n*   **Moles of HA reacted:** 0.25 × 0.001 moles = 0.00025 moles\n*   **Moles of A⁻ formed:** 0.00025 moles\n*   **Moles of HA remaining:** 0.001 moles - 0.00025 moles = 0.00075 moles\n\nTo find the pH of this buffer, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used.\n*   pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n\nFirst, calculate the pKa:\n*   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n\nNow, substitute the mole ratio into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (the volume is the same for both species, so the mole ratio equals the concentration ratio):\n*   pH = 4.73 + log(0.00025 / 0.00075)\n*   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n*   pH = 4.73 - 0.48\n*   **pH ≈ 4.25**\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n\nFirst, find the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point:\n*   Volume NaOH = Moles HA / Molarity NaOH = 0.001 moles / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n\nNext, calculate the total volume of the solution:\n*   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ (or 0.0500 L)\n\nNow, determine the concentration of the acetate ion (A⁻) at the equivalence point:\n*   [A⁻] = Moles A⁻ / Total Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M\n\nThe acetate ion hydrolyzes in water, acting as a weak base:\n*   CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n\nTo find the pH, we need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\n*   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\nNow, calculate the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻] produced by this hydrolysis. We can use the approximation Kb = [OH⁻]² / [A⁻]:\n*   [OH⁻]² = Kb × [A⁻] = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02\n*   [OH⁻]² ≈ 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n*   [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\nCalculate the pOH:\n*   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n\nFinally, calculate the pH (at 25 °C, pH + pOH = 14):\n*   pH = 14 - pOH\n*   pH = 14 - 5.48\n*   **pH ≈ 8.52**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   **pH at 25% titration ≈ 4.25** (closest to 4.26)\n*   **pH at equivalence point ≈ 8.52**\n\nThese values match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
