    "To determine the probability of obtaining 0 for the measurement of observable P and subsequently -1 for the observable Q, we must follow the principles of quantum mechanics regarding sequential measurements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1.  **Normalize the Initial State:**\n    The initial state of the system is given by the column matrix `|ψ⟩ = (-1, 2, 1)`. First, we need to normalize this state vector. The squared norm is:\n    `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n    The normalized state `|ψ_norm⟩` is:\n    `|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * (-1, 2, 1)`\n\n2.  **Find the Eigenvector for P = 0:**\n    The operator for observable P is the matrix:\n    `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n    The problem states that the first measurement yields a value of 0. This value must be an eigenvalue of P. We need to find the corresponding eigenvector `|p_0⟩` for the eigenvalue `λ = 0`. The eigenvector equation is `P|p_0⟩ = 0|p_0⟩`. Let `|p_0⟩ = (x, y, z)`.\n    `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] [x, y, z]ᵀ = [0, 0, 0]ᵀ`\n    This gives the system of equations:\n    *   `y/√2 = 0  => y = 0`\n    *   `x/√2 + z/√2 = 0 => x + z = 0 => x = -z`\n    The unnormalized eigenvector is of the form `(k, 0, -k)`. For normalization, we require `k² + 0² + (-k)² = 1`, which gives `2k² = 1`, so `k = 1/√2`.\n    Thus, the normalized eigenvector for P=0 is `|p_0⟩ = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability of Measuring P = 0:**\n    The probability of measuring the eigenvalue 0 for P is the squared magnitude of the projection of the normalized initial state onto the eigenvector `|p_0⟩`.\n    `Prob(P=0) = |⟨p_0|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n    `⟨p_0|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2) . (1/√6) * (-1, 2, 1) = (1/√12) * [(-1)(1) + (0)(2) + (1)(-1)] = -2/√12 = -2/(2√3) = -1/√3`\n    `Prob(P=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`\n\n4.  **State Collapse After Measurement:**\n    Upon measuring P and obtaining the value 0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding eigenvector `|p_0⟩`. The new state of the system `|ψ'⟩` is:\n    `|ψ'⟩ = |p_0⟩ = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)`\n\n5.  **Find the Eigenvector for Q = -1:**\n    The operator for observable Q is the matrix:\n    `Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n    Since Q is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements: 1, 0, and -1. The corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. We are interested in the outcome Q = -1. The normalized eigenvector `|q_{-1}⟩` for the eigenvalue -1 is:\n    `|q_{-1}⟩ = (0, 0, 1)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Probability of Measuring Q = -1:**\n    Now, we calculate the probability of measuring Q = -1, given the system is in the new state `|ψ'⟩`. This is the squared magnitude of the projection of `|ψ'⟩` onto `|q_{-1}⟩`.\n    `Prob(Q=-1) = |⟨q_{-1}|ψ'⟩|²`\n    `⟨q_{-1}|ψ'⟩ = (0, 0, 1) . (1/√2, 0, -1/√2) = (0)(1/√2) + (0)(0) + (1)(-1/√2) = -1/√2`\n    `Prob(Q=-1) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Joint Probability:**\n    The probability of the sequence of events (measuring P=0 and then Q=-1) is the product of the individual probabilities calculated in the steps above.\n    `P(P=0 and then Q=-1) = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1)`\n    `P(total) = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`\n\nThe final probability for this sequence of measurements is 1/6.\n\n<<<C>>>"
