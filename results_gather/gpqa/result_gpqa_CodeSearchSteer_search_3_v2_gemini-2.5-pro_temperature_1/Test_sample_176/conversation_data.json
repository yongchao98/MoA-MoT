    "The problem requires calculating the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, based on their physical properties.\n\nThe luminosity of a star that radiates as a black body is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The formula for luminosity (L) is:\nL = 4πR²σT⁴\nwhere:\n*   **R** is the star's radius.\n*   **σ** is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **T** is the star's effective surface temperature.\n\nTo find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) to Star_2 (L₂), we can set up the following equation:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\nThis simplifies to:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n*   The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂), so R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n*   The mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. This information is a distractor and not needed for this calculation which uses the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n*   The wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same.\n*   The radial velocities are 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2.\n\nThe temperature of a star is related to the peak wavelength (λ_max) of its emitted radiation by Wien's Displacement Law. The law states that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature (λ_max = b/T, where 'b' is a constant).\n\nThe crucial part of the problem is interpreting what \"the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest\" means. This could refer to the observed wavelength or the intrinsic (rest-frame) wavelength. The inclusion of the non-zero radial velocity for Star_2 suggests that a Doppler shift calculation is intended. A positive radial velocity indicates the star is moving away, causing its light to be redshifted to longer wavelengths.\n\nLet's assume the \"appeared brightest\" wavelength refers to the **observed** peak wavelength (λ_obs), which is the same for both stars.\n\n1.  **For Star_1**, with a radial velocity of 0, the observed peak wavelength is the same as its emitted peak wavelength (λ_em₁ = λ_obs).\n\n2.  **For Star_2**, moving away at v₂ = 700 km/s, its emitted light is redshifted. The observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength (λ_em₂) by the Doppler shift formula: λ_obs ≈ λ_em₂ * (1 + v₂/c), where 'c' is the speed of light (approximately 300,000 km/s).\n\n3.  Since the observed peak wavelengths are equal (λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂), we can say:\n    λ_em₁ = λ_em₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n\n4.  From Wien's Law, temperature is inversely proportional to the emitted peak wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_em). Therefore, the ratio of the temperatures is:\n    T₁/T₂ = λ_em₂ / λ_em₁\n\n5.  Substituting the relationship from the Doppler shift:\n    T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n6.  Now, we can substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700/300000)⁴\n\n7.  Calculating the value:\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333...)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333...)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009375\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<A>>>"
