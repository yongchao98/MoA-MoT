    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as an extension of the Standard Model, incorporating higher-dimensional operators to describe the effects of new physics at a higher energy scale. The construction of the SMEFT Lagrangian is based on a set of fundamental principles and symmetries.\n\n1.  **Lorentz and Poincare Symmetry**: The SMEFT is built upon the assumption that the underlying physics is described by a local quantum field theory that is manifestly Poincaré-invariant. Poincaré invariance includes both Lorentz invariance (invariance under boosts and rotations) and translational invariance. Therefore, all operators in the SMEFT must be constructed to respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries.\n\n2.  **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry, the combination of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P), is known to be violated in the Standard Model by the weak interaction. The SMEFT is designed to be a general framework that can parameterize not only the known physics of the Standard Model but also potential new sources of CP violation from beyond the Standard Model. For this reason, the SMEFT includes operators that are CP-violating. Consequently, not all operators in the SMEFT are required to respect CP symmetry.\n\n3.  **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry, which combines charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal (T), is a fundamental consequence of any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian, a principle known as the CPT theorem. Since the SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant theory, it must respect CPT symmetry.\n\nBased on these principles, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<D>>>"
