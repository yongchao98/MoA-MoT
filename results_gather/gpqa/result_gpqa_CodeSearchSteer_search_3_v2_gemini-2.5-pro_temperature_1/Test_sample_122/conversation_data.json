    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference:**\n    *   The Galaxy's reference frame (let's call it S).\n    *   The supernova ejecta's reference frame (let's call it S').\n\n2.  **Identify the given values:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame, `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it's measured by a clock moving with the ejecta.\n    *   The speed of light, `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame (S). Let's call this distance `d`.\n\n4.  **Apply the theory of special relativity:**\n    *   According to an observer in the Galaxy's frame (S), the time on the moving ejecta (S') appears to pass more slowly. This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n    *   The time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) is related to the proper time (`Δt'`) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`):\n        `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    *   The formula for the Lorentz factor is: `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    *   First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, substitute this into the gamma formula:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n    *   Calculating the value:\n        `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.02062`\n\n6.  **Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt):**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt' ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n    *   This means that while 50 seconds have passed for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy would measure that about 51.031 seconds have passed.\n\n7.  **Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame (d):**\n    *   The distance is the velocity multiplied by the time elapsed in the same reference frame.\n    *   `d = v * Δt`\n    *   `d ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ 3,061,860 km`\n\n    Alternatively, using the exact fraction:\n    `d = 60,000 * (50 / √(0.96)) = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n8.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    *   A) 3,060,000 km\n    *   B) 3,000,000 km\n    *   C) 2,880,000 km\n    *   D) 2,940,000 km\n\nThe calculated distance of approximately 3,061,860 km is closest to option A. The small difference is likely due to rounding in the options provided.\n\n<<<A>>>"
