    "The search results confirm that the general approach of calculating the concentrations of the buffer components (H2PO4- and HPO4^2-), using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation with Ka2 to find the pH/[H+], and then using the Ka3 expression to find the final [PO4^3-] is correct. The problem is a standard buffer calculation problem. My initial step-by-step plan is sound. No corrections are needed. I will proceed to write down the final answer based on my calculations.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the molar amounts of the salts.**\n*   Moles of KH2PO4 = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n*   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components.**\nThe volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.20000 L.\n*   Concentration of H2PO4⁻ ([Acid]) = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n*   Concentration of HPO4²⁻ ([Base]) = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration ([H⁺]) in the buffer solution.**\nThe relevant equilibrium for this buffer is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, which involves the H2PO4⁻/HPO4²⁻ conjugate acid-base pair.\n*   Equilibrium: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n*   The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸.\n\nWe can use the equilibrium expression for Ka₂:\nKa₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n\nRearranging to solve for [H⁺]:\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ * [H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n[H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M) / (0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] ≈ 8.109 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻).**\nThe orthophosphate ion is formed from the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻.\n*   Equilibrium: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n*   The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹².\n\nThe equilibrium expression for Ka₃ is:\nKa₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\nRearranging to solve for the orthophosphate concentration [PO₄³⁻]:\n[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * [HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺]\n\nWe use the initial concentration of HPO₄²⁻ and the calculated [H⁺] from the buffer equilibrium.\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M) / (8.109 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.235 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis value is closest to 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<A>>>"
