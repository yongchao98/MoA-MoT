    "### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n**Reaction I:** The reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one with lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) targets the ketone functional group at the C-3 position. This reaction creates a new stereocenter at C-3, which can have either an (R) or (S) configuration. Since the original stereocenter at C-5 remains in the (S) configuration, the products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are diastereomers of each other.\n\n**Reaction II:** The reduction of pentane-2,4-dione with excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) reduces both ketone groups at C-2 and C-4, creating two new stereocenters. The possible stereoisomers are (2R,4R), (2S,4S), and (2R,4S). The (2R,4R) and (2S,4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers. The (2R,4S) isomer is a meso compound because it has a plane of symmetry and is achiral. Thus, this reaction yields three distinct stereoisomers: the (2R,4R)-diol, the (2S,4S)-diol, and the meso-diol.\n\n### Combined Products\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the product mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso) (from Reaction II)\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC:**\nA normal-phase HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   **Constitutional Isomers:** The products from Reaction I (C7H16O2) and Reaction II (C5H12O2) have different molecular formulas and structures, so they will be separated.\n*   **Diastereomers:** These have different physical properties, including polarity, and are separable by normal-phase HPLC.\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers and will result in **two separate peaks**.\n    *   In the products from Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, the meso compound will be separated from the enantiomers, yielding **one peak for the meso compound** and **one peak for the enantiomeric pair**.\n*   **Enantiomers:** These have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated by a normal-phase column. The (2R,4R) and (2S,4S) enantiomers from Reaction II will elute together as a single peak.\n\nCombining these points, the separable entities are: the two distinct diastereomers from Reaction I, the enantiomeric pair from Reaction II, and the meso compound from Reaction II. This results in a total of **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\nAn HPLC column with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate stereoisomers, including enantiomers. It achieves this because the enantiomers interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, leading to different retention times.\n*   All five stereoisomers in the mixture are chemically distinct from one another.\n*   The chiral column will separate the two diastereomers from Reaction I.\n*   The chiral column will separate the two enantiomers from Reaction II from each other.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II is also chemically distinct and will be separated from all other isomers.\n\nTherefore, the chiral HPLC will resolve all five stereoisomers, resulting in **5 peaks** in the chromatogram.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis leads to the conclusion that there will be 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<C>>>"
