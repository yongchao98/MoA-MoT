    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct molecular weight range for substance A4.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from the Mass Percentage of A2**:\n    The substance A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y with a fluorine mass fraction (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let's assume the general formula of A2 is YFₙ. The molar mass of Y (M(Y)) can be related to the molar mass of fluorine (M(F) ≈ 19 g/mol) and the integer n by the formula:\n    ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    0.3196 = (n * 19) / (M(Y) + n * 19)\n    Rearranging for M(Y), we get:\n    M(Y) ≈ n * 40.45 g/mol\n\n2.  **Test Plausible Candidates for Y**:\n    By testing integer values for 'n', we can find potential candidates for element Y.\n    *   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 3 * 40.45 = 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the molar mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol. The calculated mass percentage of fluorine in SbF₃ is 31.88%, which is a very close match.\n    *   If n=6, M(Y) ≈ 6 * 40.45 = 242.7 g/mol. This is close to the molar mass of **Plutonium (Pu)**, which is approximately 244 g/mol. The mass percentage of fluorine in PuF₆ is about 31.84%, also a very close match.\n    *   If n=3, M(Y) is also reasonably close to **Iodine (I)** (M=126.9 g/mol). The calculated ɷF for IF₃ is about 31.0%.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Candidates based on Other Clues**:\n    *   **Antimony (Sb)**: If Y is Sb, then A2 would be SbF₃. The problem states A1 is a \"bright-red substance\" that decomposes into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine. This would imply A1 is a higher fluoride, likely SbF₅. However, SbF₅ is a colorless liquid, which contradicts the description.\n    *   **Plutonium (Pu)**: If Y is Pu, then A2 is PuF₆. The reaction where A5 is formed (Pu + A4 -> A5 in a 1:1 molar ratio) works perfectly if A4=PuF₆ and A5=PuF₃ (as Pu + PuF₆ → 2PuF₃). However, the molecular weight of A4 (PuF₆) is approximately 358 g/mol, which is far outside any of the given answer ranges.\n    *   **Iodine (I)**: This candidate presents the most consistent pathway, despite some discrepancies in the provided data.\n        *   **Y = Iodine (I)**. The known binary fluorides are IF, IF₃, IF₅, and IF₇. The problem states five are known.\n        *   **A2 = IF₃**. We accept the slight inaccuracy in the fluorine mass percentage (31.0% calculated vs. 31.96% given).\n        *   **A1** is a \"bright-red substance\" that decomposes to A2(IF₃) and fluorine. This would mean A1 is IF₅ or IF₇. Both are colorless, which is a major inconsistency in the problem statement. However, we proceed by prioritizing the chemical reaction logic.\n        *   **A3** is formed by fluorination of Y and interacts with xenon. Direct fluorination of iodine can produce IF₅ or IF₇. IF₇ is known to react with xenon, making it a plausible candidate for A3.\n        *   **A4 and A5**: A5 is formed by adding Y (Iodine) to a solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. This describes a comproportionation reaction where the oxidation state of iodine is averaged. Let's test the reaction with A4 = IF₅:\n          I + IF₅ → 2IF₃\n          This reaction is balanced and shows a 1:1 molar ratio between the reactants, Iodine (Y) and iodine pentafluoride (A4). The product would be A5 = IF₃.\n        *   **Decomposition of A5**: The problem states that A5 (IF₃) decomposes in water to form two substances. Iodine trifluoride is unstable and known to react with water, for instance through hydrolysis to form an iodine oxyfluoride and hydrofluoric acid (e.g., IF₃ + H₂O → IFO + 2HF). This fits the description.\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4**:\n    Based on the analysis, the most logical identification for A4 is iodine pentafluoride (IF₅).\n    *   Molar Mass of Iodine (I) ≈ 126.9 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.0 g/mol\n    *   Molecular Weight of IF₅ = 126.9 + 5 * 19.0 = 221.9 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Select the Correct Range**:\n    The calculated molecular weight of 221.9 g/mol falls within the range of 220-240.\n\nDespite the inconsistencies in the problem statement regarding the color of A1 and the precise mass fraction in A2, the chemical reactions and the resulting molecular weight for the iodine-based compounds provide a coherent solution that matches one of the options.\n\n<<<C>>>"
