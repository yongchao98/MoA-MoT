    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the time that will pass for the astronaut.\n\n1.  **Identify the knowns:**\n    *   Velocity of the spacecraft (v): 0.99999987 * c\n    *   Destination: Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)\n    *   Distance to the LMC: Approximately 163,000 light-years, though this can vary slightly depending on the source. Let's use a common approximation of 160,000 light-years which is also cited.\n    *   Astronaut's age: 22 years\n    *   Astronaut's average lifetime: 150 years\n\n2.  **Calculate the time of the journey from an observer's perspective on Earth (dilated time, Δt').**\n    The time it takes to travel a certain distance is calculated as distance divided by speed. Since the speed is very close to the speed of light (c), the time observed from Earth will be just slightly more than the distance in light-years.\n    *   Time (Earth) = Distance / Velocity\n    *   Time (Earth) = 160,000 light-years / (0.99999987 * c) ≈ 160,000.2 years\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    The Lorentz factor is a key component of time dilation and is calculated using the formula:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n    *   v/c = 0.99999987\n    *   v²/c² = (0.99999987)² ≈ 0.99999974\n    *   1 - v²/c² ≈ 0.00000026\n    *   √(1 - v²/c²) ≈ √0.00000026 ≈ 0.0005099\n    *   γ ≈ 1 / 0.0005099 ≈ 1961.16\n\n4.  **Calculate the time experienced by the astronaut (proper time, Δt).**\n    The time experienced by the moving observer (the astronaut) is the dilated time divided by the Lorentz factor.\n    *   Time (Astronaut) = Time (Earth) / γ\n    *   Time (Astronaut) ≈ 160,000.2 years / 1961.16 ≈ 81.58 years\n\n5.  **Determine the final answer.**\n    The journey will take approximately 81.6 years from the astronaut's perspective. The astronaut's age upon arrival would be 22 + 81.6 = 103.6 years, which is well within their 150-year lifespan. Therefore, the astronaut will not die before reaching Earth.\n\n    The calculated time of roughly 81.6 years is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
