  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental results to determine the interactions between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### Analysis of Single-Gene Mutants\nFirst, we assess the impact of each individual gene by looking at the single-mutant phenotypes:\n*   **Wild-type (Control):** 100% resistance.\n*   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. This indicates that gene G1 contributes to the resistance, but its absence is not completely detrimental. The loss of G1 function causes a 25% reduction in resistance.\n*   **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. The loss of G2 function completely abolishes resistance to the pathogen. This suggests that G2 plays a critical and essential role in the resistance pathway.\n*   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. Gene G3 has a more significant role than G1, with its loss causing a 50% reduction in resistance.\n\n### Analysis of Double-Gene Mutants\nThe double mutants reveal how the genes interact with each other, specifically showing any epistatic relationships. Epistasis occurs when the effect of one gene's mutation masks the effect of another.\n\n*   **g1g2 and g2g3 mutants:** Both of these double mutants show 0% resistance.\n    *   The phenotype of the `g1g2` double mutant (0% resistance) is identical to the phenotype of the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance). This means the `g2` mutation is **epistatic** to the `g1` mutation; it masks the effect of the `g1` mutation.\n    *   Similarly, the phenotype of the `g2g3` double mutant (0% resistance) is the same as the `g2` single mutant. Therefore, the `g2` mutation is also **epistatic** to the `g3` mutation.\n    *   When one gene is epistatic to others in a pathway, it often means the epistatic gene acts upstream of the others. Since the problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor (a gene that regulates other genes), this evidence strongly points to **G2 being the transcription factor** that activates both G1 and G3.\n\n*   **g1g3 mutant:** This double mutant shows 10% resistance.\n    *   This phenotype is different from both the `g1` (75%) and `g3` (50%) single mutants.\n    *   If the effects of G1 and G3 were simply additive, knocking out both would result in a combined loss of resistance of 25% (from G1) + 50% (from G3) = 75%, leaving 25% resistance.\n    *   However, the observed resistance is only 10%, which is a much more severe outcome than expected from a simple additive model. This type of interaction, where the double mutant shows a much stronger phenotype than the sum of the individual mutants, is called a **synergistic interaction**. Synergy often indicates that the two genes have **redundant or overlapping functions**. They likely act in parallel pathways, and when one is missing, the other can partially compensate. When both are knocked out, the system almost completely fails.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\nBased on the analysis, we have drawn two main conclusions:\n1.  **G2 is an upstream transcription factor**, as it is epistatic to both G1 and G3.\n2.  **G1 and G3 have redundant functions**, as the `g1g3` double mutant shows a synergistic effect.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given choices:\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\" is correct.\n    *   \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\" is incorrect. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n\n*   **B) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.**\n    *   \"G1 is a transcription factor\" is incorrect; G2 is the clear candidate.\n    *   \"G2 is epistatic towards G1\" is correct, but the primary assertion is wrong.\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\" is correct.\n    *   \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\" is correct, as explained by their synergistic interaction.\n    *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" is incorrect. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%).\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\" is correct.\n    *   \"G1 and G3 show pleiotropy\" cannot be determined from the experiment, as only one trait (disease resistance) was measured.\n    *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\nOption C contains two correct and crucial conclusions derived directly from the experimental data: that G2 is the transcription factor and that G1 and G3 exhibit gene redundancy. Although its third statement about epistasis between G1 and G3 is incorrect, Option C provides the best overall description of the gene interactions among the choices. The other options contain more significant errors or claims that cannot be substantiated by the data.\n\n<<<C>>>"
