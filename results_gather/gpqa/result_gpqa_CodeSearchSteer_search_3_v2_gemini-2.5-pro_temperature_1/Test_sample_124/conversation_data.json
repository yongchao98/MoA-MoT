    "The problem describes a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The energy eigenvalues for such a system are given by the formula E_n = (n + 3/2)ħω, where n = n_x + n_y + n_z is the principal quantum number (n = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n\nThe states of the system are characterized as follows:\n*   **Ground state:** n = 0\n*   **First excited state:** n = 1\n*   **Second excited state:** n = 2\n*   **Third excited state:** n = 3\n\nTo find the energy of the third excited state, we set n = 3 in the energy formula:\nE_3 = (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω.\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level n, which is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to that energy, is given by the formula g_n = (n+1)(n+2)/2.\n\nFor the third excited state (n=3), the degeneracy is:\ng_3 = (3+1)(3+2)/2 = (4)(5)/2 = 20/2 = 10.\n\nAlternatively, the degeneracy can be found by counting the number of ways the non-negative integers (n_x, n_y, n_z) can sum to n=3:\n*   Combinations like (3, 0, 0) can be arranged in 3 ways (3,0,0; 0,3,0; 0,0,3).\n*   Combinations like (2, 1, 0) can be arranged in 6 ways (2,1,0; 2,0,1; 1,2,0; 0,2,1; 1,0,2; 0,1,2).\n*   The combination (1, 1, 1) can be arranged in 1 way.\nThe total number of combinations is 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the third excited state is (9/2)ħω, and it has a degeneracy of 10.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) (9/2)ħω, 10\nB) 11π²ħ² / (2mr²), 3\nC) 11π²ħ² / (2mr²), 10\nD) (9/2)ħω, 3\n\nThe calculated values match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
