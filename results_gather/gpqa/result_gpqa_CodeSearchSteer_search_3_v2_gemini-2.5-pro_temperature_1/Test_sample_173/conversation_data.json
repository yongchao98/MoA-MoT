    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Determine Rest Masses and Q-Value\n\nFirst, we establish the rest-mass energies of the initial nucleus and the two fragments.\n\n*   **Initial Nucleus (M):**\n    The rest-mass energy is given as M*c² = 300 GeV.\n\n*   **Fragments (m1 and m2):**\n    We are given two conditions:\n    1.  The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass:\n        m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n        Multiplying by c², we get: m1c² + m2c² = 0.99 * (Mc²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.\n    2.  One fragment is twice as massive as the other:\n        m1 = 2 * m2\n        In terms of energy: m1c² = 2 * (m2c²).\n\n    Now we solve for the individual rest-mass energies:\n    Substitute the second condition into the first:\n    2*(m2c²) + m2c² = 297 GeV\n    3*(m2c²) = 297 GeV\n    **m2c² = 99 GeV** (the less massive fragment)\n\n    Then, for the more massive fragment (m1):\n    **m1c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV**\n\n*   **Q-Value (Total Kinetic Energy):**\n    The energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy. This energy is conserved and converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n    Q = T1 + T2 = Mc² - (m1c² + m2c²)\n    Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV\n\n### 2. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p² / (2m), where p is momentum.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum is zero. The two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitudes: p1 = p2 = p.\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy Ratio:** The kinetic energies of the fragments are:\n    T1_classical = p² / (2*m1)\n    T2_classical = p² / (2*m2)\n    The ratio is T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 99 / 198 = 1/2.\n    Therefore, T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical.\n\n*   **Solving for T1_classical:** We use the total kinetic energy:\n    T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV\n    T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV\n    3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV\n    **T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV**\n\n### 3. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the total energy is E = T + mc² and is related to momentum by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy of the initial nucleus is conserved.\n    E1 + E2 = Mc² = 300 GeV.\n    Here, E1 and E2 are the *total* energies (rest energy + kinetic energy) of the fragments.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** As before, the momentum magnitudes are equal: p1 = p2 = p.\n    From the energy-momentum relation, we have (pc)² = E² - (mc²)².\n    Therefore, E1² - (m1c²)² = E2² - (m2c²)².\n\n*   **Solving for E1:** We have a system of two equations:\n    1. E1 + E2 = 300 GeV  => E2 = 300 - E1\n    2. E1² - (m1c²)² = E2² - (m2c²)²\n\n    Substitute E2 from the first equation into the second:\n    E1² - (198 GeV)² = (300 GeV - E1)² - (99 GeV)²\n    E1² - 39204 = (90000 - 600*E1 + E1²) - 9801\n    Canceling E1² from both sides:\n    -39204 = 90000 - 600*E1 - 9801\n    -39204 = 80199 - 600*E1\n    600*E1 = 80199 + 39204\n    600*E1 = 119403\n    **E1 = 119403 / 600 = 199.005 GeV**\n\n*   **Solving for T1:** The relativistic kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy (T = E - mc²).\n    T1 = E1 - m1c²\n    T1 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV\n    **T1 = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV**\n\n### 4. Find the Difference\n\nFinally, we calculate the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation.\n\n*   Difference = T1 - T1_classical\n*   Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV\n*   **Difference = 5 MeV**\n\n<<<B>>>"
