    "Here is a step-by-step calculation of the total enthalpy change:\n\n**1. Write the chemical reactions:**\n\n*   **Neutralization:** H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq) → H₂O(l)\n*   **Precipitation:** Ba²⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq) → BaSO₄(s)\n\n**2. Calculate the moles of each reactant:**\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ ions:**\n    *   From HCl: 0.500 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.10 mol H⁺\n    *   From H₂SO₄: 0.300 L * 0.3 mol/L * 2 H⁺/H₂SO₄ = 0.18 mol H⁺\n    *   **Total moles of H⁺ = 0.10 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol**\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ ions:**\n    *   From Ba(OH)₂: 0.200 L * 0.5 mol/L * 2 OH⁻/Ba(OH)₂ = **0.20 mol OH⁻**\n*   **Moles of Ba²⁺ ions:**\n    *   From Ba(OH)₂: 0.200 L * 0.5 mol/L = **0.10 mol Ba²⁺**\n*   **Moles of SO₄²⁻ ions:**\n    *   From H₂SO₄: 0.300 L * 0.3 mol/L = **0.09 mol SO₄²⁻**\n\n**3. Determine the heat released from neutralization:**\n\n*   The neutralization reaction is between H⁺ and OH⁻ ions.\n*   The limiting reactant is the one with the fewer moles, which is OH⁻ (0.20 mol).\n*   Therefore, 0.20 moles of water will be formed.\n*   The standard enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and a strong base is approximately -57.1 kJ/mol or -13.7 kcal/mol.\n*   Heat of neutralization (ΔH_neut) = 0.20 mol * (-57.1 kJ/mol) = **-11.42 kJ**\n\n**4. Determine the heat released from precipitation:**\n\n*   The precipitation reaction is between Ba²⁺ and SO₄²⁻ ions.\n*   The limiting reactant is SO₄²⁻ (0.09 mol).\n*   Therefore, 0.09 moles of BaSO₄ will precipitate.\n*   The enthalpy of dissolution for BaSO₄ is +17.6 kJ/mol. The enthalpy of precipitation is the reverse of this, so it is **-17.6 kJ/mol**.\n*   Heat of precipitation (ΔH_precip) = 0.09 mol * (-17.6 kJ/mol) = **-1.584 kJ**\n\n**5. Calculate the total enthalpy of reaction:**\n\n*   Total Enthalpy (ΔH_total) = ΔH_neut + ΔH_precip\n*   ΔH_total = -11.42 kJ + (-1.584 kJ) = **-13.004 kJ**\n\n**6. Convert the final answer to the units in the options:**\n\n*   The options are given in kJ and kcal.\n*   1 kcal = 4.184 kJ\n*   -13.004 kJ / 4.184 kJ/kcal ≈ **-3.11 kcal**\n\nLet's re-examine the options based on our calculations:\nA) -16.0 kJ\nB) -2.72 kcal\nC) -11.42 kcal\nD) -3.80 kcal\n\nIt seems there might be a slight discrepancy, which could be due to the exact values used for the standard enthalpies. Let's consider the heat of neutralization alone, which was -11.42 kJ. This is very close to option D if we convert it to kcal:\n\n-11.42 kJ / 4.184 kJ/kcal = -2.73 kcal. This is close to option B.\n\nHowever, the question implicitly expects the total enthalpy change, including precipitation. If we only consider the heat of neutralization, we get -11.42 kJ. If this value was instead in kcal, it would match option C.\n\nLet's assume the standard enthalpy of neutralization is -13.7 kcal/mol.\n*   Heat of neutralization = 0.20 mol * (-13.7 kcal/mol) = -2.74 kcal. This matches option B.\n\nNow, let's include the heat of precipitation in kcal.\n*   Heat of precipitation = -1.584 kJ / 4.184 kJ/kcal = -0.379 kcal\n*   Total heat = -2.74 kcal + (-0.379 kcal) = -3.119 kcal. This is closest to option D.\n\nLet's analyze the problem again. Often in such problems, the heat of precipitation of BaSO₄ is considered negligible or is ignored. If we only consider the neutralization reaction:\n\nHeat released = moles of water formed × standard enthalpy of neutralization\nHeat released = 0.20 mol × (-13.7 kcal/mol) = -2.74 kcal. This is very close to option B.\n\nIf we use the value -57.32 kJ/mol for neutralization:\n*   Heat of neutralization = 0.20 mol * (-57.32 kJ/mol) = -11.464 kJ.\n*   In kcal: -11.464 kJ / 4.184 kJ/kcal = -2.74 kcal. This reinforces option B.\n\nIf we consider the precipitation enthalpy to be larger, let's see what value would lead to option D (-3.80 kcal).\n-3.80 kcal = -2.74 kcal + ΔH_precip\nΔH_precip = -1.06 kcal\nΔH_precip (per mole) = -1.06 kcal / 0.09 mol = -11.78 kcal/mol, which is -49.2 kJ/mol. This is a plausible, though different, value for the enthalpy of precipitation of BaSO₄.\n\nGiven the options, the calculation that results in an answer very close to one of the options is the one that only considers the heat of neutralization. It's possible the question intends for only this to be calculated, or that the precipitation effect is considered part of an experimental value that aligns with one of the choices. Based on standard values, -2.74 kcal is the most accurate calculation for the neutralization part.\n\nFinal calculation check:\nMoles H+ = 0.28 mol\nMoles OH- = 0.20 mol\nMoles H2O formed = 0.20 mol\nEnthalpy of neutralization = -13.7 kcal/mol\nHeat released = 0.20 mol * -13.7 kcal/mol = -2.74 kcal.\n\nThis value is extremely close to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
