    "An N-sided polygon with an infinitely large N and a constant apothem 'a' converges to a circle of radius 'a'. Therefore, the problem is to find the angular distance between the first two diffraction minima for a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe diffraction pattern created by a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern. The intensity minima of this pattern occur at angles (θ) that satisfy the equation:\n\nsin(θ) = (xₘ * λ) / (2π * a)\n\nwhere:\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   a is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   xₘ is the m-th zero of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n\nUsing the small-angle approximation (sin(θ) ≈ θ), the angular position of the m-th minimum is:\n\nθₘ = (xₘ * λ) / (2π * a)\n\nThe first two zeros of the Bessel function J₁(x) are approximately:\n*   x₁ ≈ 3.8317\n*   x₂ ≈ 7.0156\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular positions of the first and second minima:\n\n**First Minimum (θ₁):**\nθ₁ = (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 0.6098 λ / a\n\nThis value corresponds to the well-known position of the first minimum in an Airy pattern, often expressed as θ = 1.22 λ / D, where D is the diameter (2a). Note that 1.22 ≈ 3.8317 / π.\n\n**Second Minimum (θ₂):**\nθ₂ = (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 1.1166 λ / a\n\nThe angular distance between these two minima is the difference between their positions:\n\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁\nΔθ = (1.1166 λ / a) - (0.6098 λ / a)\nΔθ = 0.5068 λ / a\n\nComparing this result to the given options, it most closely matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
