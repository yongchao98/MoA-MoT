    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n### 1. Identification of the Reactants\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid and Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. The ¹H NMR spectrum of this anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and its ¹³C NMR spectrum shows two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon). This high degree of symmetry is characteristic of **maleic anhydride**, which is formed by the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). The two alkene protons are chemically equivalent, as are the two alkene carbons and the two carbonyl carbons, fitting the spectral data.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with two conjugated double bonds and four methyl groups on the double bond carbons (C1, C2, C3, C4). The C5 position is a CH₂ group.\n\n### 2. The Reaction: Diels-Alder Cycloaddition\n\nThe reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. Because the reactants are planar, the dienophile can approach the diene from two different faces, leading to two possible diastereomeric products:\n\n*   ***endo* product:** The anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side as) the C7 bridge of the newly formed bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton. In Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is typically the major product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions (kinetic control).\n*   ***exo* product:** The anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side of) the C7 bridge. This is usually the minor product.\n\nThe molecular formula of the product is C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (anhydride) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**, which matches the information given in the question.\n\n### 3. Structural Analysis of Products for NOESY Spectroscopy\n\nNOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak between two proton signals indicates their spatial proximity. The problem states a key cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor one. This must correspond to a spatial relationship that exists only in the *endo* isomer.\n\n*   **In the major (*endo*) product:** The protons from the maleic anhydride part (located at the C2 and C3 positions of the bicyclic system) are on the same side as the C7 bridge. This brings them very close to the protons of the CH₂ group at the C7 position. Therefore, a strong NOE cross-peak is expected between the C2/C3 protons and the C7 protons.\n\n*   **In the minor (*exo*) product:** The C2/C3 protons are on the opposite side of the C7 bridge. The distance between these protons is much larger, so the corresponding NOE cross-peak would be absent or very weak.\n\nThis confirms that the differential cross-peak connects the resonances of the **C2/C3 anhydride protons** and the **C7 bridge protons**.\n\n### 4. Assignment of ¹H NMR Signals\n\nNow, we must assign the proton signals described in the options to the specific protons in the major product.\n\n*   **Protons from the Anhydride (C2-H, C3-H):** These are two equivalent protons, each adjacent to a carbonyl group in a strained ring system. Their chemical shift is typically downfield, around 3-4 ppm. The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** is the correct assignment for these protons. They appear as a singlet due to the plane of symmetry in the molecule.\n\n*   **Protons on the C7 Bridge:** This is a CH₂ group. In the rigid bicyclic system, these two protons are diastereotopic (not chemically equivalent). They couple to each other (geminal coupling), typically resulting in a pair of doublets (an AB quartet). One of these protons, the *syn* proton, points towards the C2/C3 positions in the *endo* adduct. This proton is the one that will show the NOE. The question describes one of these signals as a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**. This is a plausible chemical shift for a bridge proton in a bicyclo[2.2.1] system and correctly identifies it as one of the two non-equivalent C7 protons.\n\n*   **Other Signals:**\n    *   **Alkene Methyls (on C5=C6):** These two equivalent methyl groups (6H total) are on a double bond, typically resonating around 1.6-2.0 ppm. This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyls (on C1, C4):** These two equivalent methyl groups (6H total) are on saturated carbons. They are more shielded and resonate further upfield, corresponding to the **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe key cross-peak in the major (*endo*) product, which is absent in the minor (*exo*) product, connects the anhydride protons (C2-H, C3-H) with the C7 bridge protons. Based on the signal assignments:\n\n*   Anhydride protons = **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   C7 bridge proton = **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connects these two resonances.\n\n<<<D>>>"
