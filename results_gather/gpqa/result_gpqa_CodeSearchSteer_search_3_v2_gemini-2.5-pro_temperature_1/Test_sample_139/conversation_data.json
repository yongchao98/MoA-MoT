    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of B is very close to 277 K (~4 °C). The normal melting point of water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C), but heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), has a melting point of 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This strongly suggests that **B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X and its Reactions:**\n    *   Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope. The identity of B as D₂O implies this isotope is deuterium.\n    *   A close analog of X is a common reagent in organic chemistry. This points to reagents like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) or Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). The deuterated analog would be Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄) or Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄).\n    *   X reacts violently with a liquid Y to release a gas W and form a precipitate G. The reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is known to be violent. Let's assume **X is LiAlD₄**.\n    *   Heating precipitate G releases B (D₂O). The reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (Y = D₂O) would be:\n        `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`\n        This reaction is violent.\n    *   The precipitate **G** would be a mix of Lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) and Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). Heating aluminum hydroxide (or deuteroxide) causes it to decompose and release water (or heavy water). `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This matches the observation that heating G releases B.\n    *   The gas **W** released is deuterium gas (D₂). A D₂ molecule consists of two deuterium atoms. Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description that it \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   The final clue is that the product of the reaction of a keto acid with substance X contains 2 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ (like its analog LiAlH₄) is a powerful reducing agent that reduces both the ketone and carboxylic acid functional groups of a keto acid to hydroxyl groups (-OH), resulting in a diol, which contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n3.  **Conclusion on Identity:** All clues consistently point to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:**\n    The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n    *   **Elements present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (Atomic Number 1).\n    *   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (Atomic Number 13).\n    *   The instruction specifies summing the masses of all instances of these elements in the molecule.\n\n    *   **Mass of the Lightest Element (Hydrogen):**\n        There are four atoms of the deuterium isotope (D) in the molecule.\n        The mass number of a single deuterium atom is 2 (1 proton + 1 neutron). Its atomic mass is approximately 2.014 amu.\n        Total mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n\n    *   **Mass of the Heaviest Element (Aluminum):**\n        There is one atom of Aluminum (Al) in the molecule.\n        The only stable isotope of aluminum is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27. Its atomic mass is approximately 26.98 amu.\n        Total mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:**\n        Sum = (Total mass of lightest element) + (Total mass of heaviest element)\n        Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<D>>>"
