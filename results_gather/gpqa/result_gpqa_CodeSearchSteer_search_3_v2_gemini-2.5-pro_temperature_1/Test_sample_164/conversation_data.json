    "Here is an analysis of each statement:\n\n**A) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.**\nTandem catalysis, where one catalyst oligomerizes ethylene (e.g., to 1-hexene) and a second catalyst copolymerizes it with remaining ethylene in a single reactor, is a known method for producing LLDPE. Industrial processes for LLDPE production, like the Univation UNIPOL process, are used on a large scale in the US. These processes often involve the copolymerization of ethylene with an alpha-olefin like 1-butene or 1-hexene. While tandem catalysis for *in-situ* comonomer generation is highly desirable and has been developed, large-scale industrial LLDPE production in the US predominantly relies on supplying the comonomer (e.g., 1-hexene) to the reactor, rather than a fully integrated tandem system where the comonomer is generated in the same reactor. The technology for tandem systems exists and is used, for instance, by companies like Chevron Phillips for 1-hexene production, but its specific implementation in a single-reactor dual-catalyst system for LLDPE on a major industrial scale in the US is not the standard method.\n\n**B) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.**\nThe essential additional step is the selective oligomerization of ethylene to form alpha-olefins like 1-hexene or 1-octene. Aluminum-based activators, such as methylaluminoxane (MAO) and various alkylaluminum compounds (e.g., triethylaluminum, Et3Al), are crucial components for activating catalysts for both polymerization and oligomerization. Specifically for chromium-based catalysts, which are highly effective for selective ethylene trimerization to 1-hexene, aluminum compounds are widely used as activators or co-catalysts. Studies explicitly show that activators like MAO are used to activate chromium complexes for ethylene trimerization and tetramerization. Therefore, the statement that aluminum-based activators do not work is incorrect.\n\n**C) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.**\nNoble metals include platinum, palladium, ruthenium, and iridium. While some late transition metals like nickel and palladium are known to catalyze ethylene polymerization to produce branched polyethylene, the use of true noble metals (Pt, Ru, Ir) for this specific application is not common. These metals are highly effective in other catalytic applications like hydrogenation and emissions control. Their extremely high cost is a well-known barrier to their use in large-scale, high-volume processes like polyethylene production. While catalytically active for certain transformations, their economic viability for this particular industrial application is prohibitive compared to catalysts based on much more abundant metals like chromium, zirconium, or titanium.\n\n**D) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.**\nGroup VIa (Group 6) of the periodic table includes Chromium (Cr). Chromium-based catalysts are exceptionally well-known for both ethylene polymerization (the famous Phillips catalyst) and for the highly selective oligomerization of ethylene. Specifically, certain chromium catalysts, when combined with specific ligands and aluminum-based activators, can efficiently trimerize ethylene to 1-hexene or tetramerize it to 1-octene. These alpha-olefins are the ideal comonomers to be incorporated into a polyethylene backbone to create regular branches (ethyl branches from 1-hexene incorporation, for example). Combining a chromium oligomerization catalyst with a polymerization catalyst (which could also be chromium-based or another type like a metallocene) is a well-established strategy in research for producing LLDPE from only ethylene in a single reactor. This makes the statement factually correct and highly relevant to the described scenario.\n\nBased on the analysis, statement D is the most accurate and well-supported claim.\n\n<<<D>>>"
