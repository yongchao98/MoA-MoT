    "To determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, each compound must be assessed for chirality. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a stereocenter, an atom bonded to four different groups. However, a molecule with stereocenters can be achiral if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound.\n\nHere is the analysis of each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** The structure is Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3. This molecule has no chiral centers. The carbon atoms of the double bond are sp2 hybridized and cannot be chiral centers. The other carbons are also not attached to four different groups. The molecule is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The IUPAC name specifies the absolute configuration at multiple stereocenters using (3aR, 7aS). The designation of a specific enantiomer (an R,S configuration) indicates that the molecule is chiral and exists as a single stereoisomer. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** Succinic acid is butanedioic acid (HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH). 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid has chiral centers at C2 and C3. The (2R,3S) stereoisomer has an internal plane of symmetry, which makes it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers and are thus **optically inactive**.\n\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The (2R,3R) configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral. As a chiral molecule, it is **optically active**.\n\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The carbon atom at position 1 is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a -CH2-CH= group (C2), and a -CH2-CH= group (C6). The paths around the ring are different, making C1 a chiral center. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer, which is a single, chiral stereoisomer. Thus, it is **optically active**.\n\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** The 's' notation indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (cis). This molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane can pass through one hydroxyl group and the opposite CH2 group, reflecting the other two hydroxyl groups onto each other. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** The structure is (CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl. There are no chiral centers in this molecule. The carbon atom at position 3 is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not chiral. The molecule has a plane of symmetry and is achiral, making it **optically inactive**.\n\nIn summary, the optically active compounds are:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds in the list.\n\n<<<C>>>"
