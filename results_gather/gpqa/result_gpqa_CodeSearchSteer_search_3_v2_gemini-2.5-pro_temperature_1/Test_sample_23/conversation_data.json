    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Substance Z\nThe problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CₓHᵧ. The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as:\nMass % H = (mass of H / total mass) * 100\n\nUsing atomic masses (C ≈ 12, H ≈ 1):\n0.1428 = (y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1)\nThis fraction (1/7 ≈ 0.1428) suggests a ratio of hydrogen mass to total mass of 1:7.\nIf the total mass is 14x (for a formula CₓH₂ₓ), then the mass of hydrogen is 2x. The ratio is 2x / 14x = 1/7.\nThus, the general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. Since Z is saturated (it does not react further with hydrogen), it must be a cycloalkane.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Mixture Y and Substance Z\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, does not decolorize bromine water, and is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X. Hydrogenation of Y yields only substance Z. One of the components of Y is Z itself.\n\nLet Y be a mixture of Z and another liquid, D.\n*   Y = {Z, D}\n*   Since Y does not decolorize bromine water, both Z and D must be saturated or aromatic. We already know Z (CₙH₂ₙ) is a saturated cycloalkane. D must also not react with bromine water, which is characteristic of saturated or aromatic compounds.\n*   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. This means hydrogenation of Z gives Z (as it's saturated), and hydrogenation of D must also give Z.\n*   For an aromatic compound D to be hydrogenated to a cycloalkane Z, they must share the same carbon skeleton.\n\nThis leads to two primary possibilities for the {Z, D} pair based on common solvents:\n1.  **The C₆ case:** The aromatic compound D is benzene (C₆H₆). Benzene does not decolorize bromine water. Its hydrogenation product is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Therefore, Z must be cyclohexane.\n    *   Y = {cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), benzene (C₆H₆)}.\n    *   Z = cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) is a widely used solvent.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y {C₆H₁₂, C₆H₆} yields {C₆H₁₂, C₆H₁₂}, which is a single substance, Z. This case is consistent.\n2.  **The C₇ case:** The aromatic compound D is toluene (C₇H₈). Toluene does not decolorize bromine water. Its hydrogenation product is methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄). Therefore, Z must be methylcyclohexane.\n    *   Y = {methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄), toluene (C₇H₈)}.\n    *   Z = methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄) is also used as a solvent.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y {C₇H₁₄, C₇H₈} yields {C₇H₁₄, C₇H₁₄}, a single substance, Z. This case also seems consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B, which decolorizes bromine water (i.e., A and B are unsaturated). When heated with platinum, X undergoes disproportionation to form the equimolar mixture Y. This suggests a 1:1 reaction:\nA + B → Z + D\n\nThis is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one molecule is hydrogenated and the other is dehydrogenated. Let's analyze the hydrogen balance for our two cases:\n\n1.  **The C₆ case:** A + B → cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B must be 12 + 6 = 18.\n2.  **The C₇ case:** A + B → methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄) + toluene (C₇H₈).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms must be 14 + 8 = 22.\n\nThe components of X (A and B) must be unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons that, upon hydrogenation, both yield Z. They also must not have conjugated double bonds.\n\n*   **For the C₆ case (Z=cyclohexane):** A and B must be unsaturated C₆ rings. With a total of 18 hydrogen atoms, plausible candidates are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   A = C₆H₁₀, B = C₆H₈. Total H = 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Cyclohexene has one double bond. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has two non-conjugated double bonds. This fits the criteria.\n    *   Hydrogenation of C₆H₁₀ gives C₆H₁₂ (Z). Hydrogenation of C₆H₈ gives C₆H₁₂ (Z). This works.\n\n*   **For the C₇ case (Z=methylcyclohexane):** A and B must be unsaturated hydrocarbons with a methylcyclohexane skeleton. With a total of 22 hydrogen atoms, plausible candidates are methylcyclohexene (C₇H₁₂) and a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (C₇H₁₀).\n    *   A = C₇H₁₂, B = C₇H₁₀. Total H = 12 + 10 = 22.\n    *   These would also fit the criteria for unsaturation, non-conjugation, and hydrogenation to Z.\n\n### Step 4: Distinguishing Between the C₆ and C₇ Cases\nWe have two plausible scenarios leading to two different answers (18 or 22). We must find a constraint that eliminates one. Let's re-examine the hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y. The problem specifies that hydrogenation of *both* mixtures gives *only* one substance, Z.\n\nConsider the C₇ case again, but without assuming Z from the start. Let's assume the components of X are based on a C₇ ring (cycloheptene C₇H₁₂ and cycloheptadiene C₇H₁₀).\n*   Hydrogenation of X {C₇H₁₂, C₇H₁₀} under normal conditions would yield cycloheptane (C₇H₁₄). So, Z would be cycloheptane.\n*   Mixture Y would be formed from the disproportionation: C₇H₁₂ + C₇H₁₀ → C₇H₁₄ (cycloheptane) + C₇H₈ (toluene). So, Y = {cycloheptane, toluene}.\n*   Now, let's test the hydrogenation of this mixture Y. Hydrogenation of cycloheptane yields cycloheptane. Hydrogenation of toluene yields methylcyclohexane.\n*   The result is a mixture of two different substances: cycloheptane and methylcyclohexane. This contradicts the condition that *only one substance* is formed.\n\nTherefore, the C₇ case built upon a cycloheptane skeleton is invalid. The only way the C₇ case could work is if Z is methylcyclohexane from the start and the \"severe conditions\" for hydrogenation are sufficient to cause skeletal isomerization of cycloheptane to methylcyclohexane.\n\nThe C₆ case, however, is perfectly consistent without requiring any extra assumptions like skeletal isomerization.\n*   Hydrogenation of X {C₆H₁₀, C₆H₈} gives only cyclohexane (Z).\n*   Hydrogenation of Y {C₆H₁₂, C₆H₆} gives only cyclohexane (Z).\n\nThe principle of Occam's razor, and the fact that the disproportionation of C₆ hydroaromatics is a classic textbook reaction (the Zelinaky-Kazansky reaction), strongly favors the C₆ scenario.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\nBased on the C₆ scenario, mixture X consists of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n\nTotal H atoms = (H atoms in C₆H₁₀) + (H atoms in C₆H₈) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the chemical transformations described, the following conclusions are drawn:\n\n1.  **Identification of Substance Z**: The hydrocarbon Z has a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%, which corresponds to the general formula CₙH₂ₙ. Since Z is a saturated substance that doesn't react further with hydrogen, it must be a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Composition of Mixture Y**: Mixture Y is equimolar, does not decolorize bromine water, and its hydrogenation yields only Z. Given that Z is a component of Y, the other component, let's call it D, must also yield Z upon hydrogenation. For D to not decolorize bromine water but still be hydrogenated, it must be an aromatic compound. The hydrogenation of D must produce Z, which implies that Z and D share the same carbon skeleton.\n\n3.  **Two Plausible Scenarios**: This leads to two main possibilities based on common cyclic hydrocarbons:\n    *   **C₆ Scenario**: If the aromatic compound is benzene (C₆H₆), its hydrogenation product is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Thus, Z would be cyclohexane. Mixture Y would be {cyclohexane, benzene}.\n    *   **C₇ Scenario**: If the aromatic compound is toluene (C₇H₈), its hydrogenation product is methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄). Thus, Z would be methylcyclohexane. Mixture Y would be {methylcyclohexane, toluene}.\n\n4.  **Analysis of the Disproportionation**: Mixture X, an equimolar mixture of two unsaturated liquids (A and B), undergoes disproportionation on a platinum catalyst to form the equimolar mixture Y. This is best described as an intermolecular hydrogen transfer reaction where A and B react in a 1:1 molar ratio to produce Z and the aromatic compound D.\n    *   **C₆ Scenario**: A + B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆). The total number of hydrogen atoms in molecules A and B is 12 + 6 = 18. The components of X would be cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and a non-conjugated cyclohexadiene like 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). Both have a cyclohexane skeleton and are unsaturated.\n    *   **C₇ Scenario**: A + B → Methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄) + Toluene (C₇H₈). The total number of hydrogen atoms is 14 + 8 = 22. The components of X would be a methylcyclohexene (C₇H₁₂) and a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (C₇H₁₀).\n\n5.  **Final Decisive Step**: The problem states that hydrogenation of *both* mixture X and mixture Y gives *only one* substance Z. Let's re-examine the C₇ case. If the components of X are based on a 7-membered ring (e.g., cycloheptene), their hydrogenation would yield cycloheptane. The disproportionation would then produce Y = {cycloheptane, toluene}. Hydrogenating this mixture Y would result in two different products: cycloheptane and methylcyclohexane. This contradicts the problem's condition. The C₆ case, however, remains consistent: hydrogenation of X {cyclohexene, cyclohexadiene} gives cyclohexane, and hydrogenation of Y {cyclohexane, benzene} also gives only cyclohexane. This reaction system is a classic example of catalytic disproportionation.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent solution is the C₆ scenario. The two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each liquid is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<B>>>"
