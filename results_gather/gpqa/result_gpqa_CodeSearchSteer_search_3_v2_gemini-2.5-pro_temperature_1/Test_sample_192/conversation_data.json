    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between distance and parallax.**\n    The parallax of a star, `plx`, is inversely proportional to its distance, `r`. This can be written as:\n    `plx ∝ 1/r` or `r ∝ 1/plx`.\n\n2.  **Interpret the given information.**\n    The problem states that \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\". In the context of star counts, this typically refers to the cumulative number of stars with a parallax greater than a certain value `plx`. Stars with a parallax greater than `plx` are those that are closer than the corresponding distance `r`.\n\n    Let `N(<r)` be the total number of stars within a distance `r`. Let `N(>plx)` be the total number of stars with a parallax greater than `plx`. These two quantities are equivalent.\n\n    So, the given information can be written as:\n    `N(>plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n3.  **Express the number of stars as a function of distance.**\n    Since `N(<r) = N(>plx)` and `plx ∝ 1/r`, we can substitute `plx` with `1/r` in the expression:\n    `N(<r) ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n    `N(<r) ∝ r^5`\n    This tells us that the total number of stars out to a distance `r` is proportional to `r^5`.\n\n4.  **Determine the number of stars per unit range of distance.**\n    The question asks how the number of stars *per unit range of distance* changes with `r`. This quantity is the rate of change of the cumulative number of stars with respect to distance, which is the derivative `dN/dr`.\n\n    We start with the proportionality `N(<r) = k * r^5`, where `k` is a constant of proportionality.\n    Now, we differentiate `N(<r)` with respect to `r`:\n    `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r^5)`\n    `dN/dr = 5 * k * r^4`\n\n5.  **State the final relationship.**\n    The derivative `dN/dr` is proportional to `r^4`.\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^4`\n    Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance changes with distance as `r^4`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ r^4\nB) ~ r^2\nC) ~ r^3\nD) ~ r^5\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
