    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Identify the Spectral Line and Calculate Redshift (z)**\n\nThe observed peak at a wavelength of 790 nm, with a significant flux drop at shorter wavelengths, is a key indicator of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line from a distant quasar. The drop in flux is due to the Lyman-alpha forest, which consists of absorption lines from intervening neutral hydrogen clouds. The rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line, which corresponds to the electron transition from n=2 to n=1 in a hydrogen atom, is approximately 121.567 nm.\n\nThe redshift (z) can be calculated using the formula:\n*   1 + z = λ_observed / λ_rest\n\nPlugging in the values:\n*   1 + z = 790 nm / 121.567 nm ≈ 6.50\n*   z ≈ 5.50\n\n**2. Determine the Comoving Distance**\n\nWith the redshift calculated, the next step is to find the comoving distance to the quasar. The comoving distance is the distance between two objects that remains constant over time if the objects are moving with the Hubble flow, accounting for the expansion of the universe.\n\nFor a flat Lambda-CDM universe, as specified in the problem, the comoving distance (D_C) is calculated using the following integral:\n\nD_C = (c / H₀) * ∫ [from 0 to z] dz' / E(z')\n\nWhere:\n*   **c** is the speed of light.\n*   **H₀** is the Hubble constant (70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹).\n*   **z** is the redshift (5.50).\n*   **E(z')** for a flat universe is √(Ω_m * (1 + z')³ + Ω_Λ).\n*   **Ω_m** is the matter density parameter (0.3).\n*   **Ω_Λ** is the dark energy density parameter (0.7).\n\n**3. Calculate the Result**\n\nThis integral is complex to solve by hand and is typically calculated using a cosmology calculator. Using the given parameters:\n*   H₀ = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n*   Ω_m = 0.3\n*   Ω_Λ = 0.7\n*   z = 5.50\n\nBy inputting these values into a standard cosmological calculator, the resulting comoving distance is approximately 9 Gpc (gigaparsecs).\n\n<<<A>>>"
