    "The chemical transformation in question is the synthesis of α-diketones from ketones using sodium nitrite (NaNO₂) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) in water. This reaction, known as nitrosation, proceeds by converting a methylene group adjacent (in the α-position) to a carbonyl group into a second carbonyl group.\n\nThe process begins with the reaction of NaNO₂ and HCl to form nitrous acid (HONO), which is then protonated to create the nitrosonium ion (NO⁺). The ketone, in its enol tautomer form, then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic nitrosonium ion. This creates an unstable α-nitroso ketone intermediate. This intermediate quickly tautomerizes to a more stable α-oxime. Finally, hydrolysis of the α-oxime yields the desired 1,2-diketone.\n\n**Analysis of Reaction A:**\n\n*   **Product:** 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione\n*   **Mechanism:** The starting material must be a ketone that has a methylene (-CH₂-) group next to the carbonyl group. For the product to be a 1,2-dione, the starting material must be a cyclohexanone derivative.\n*   **Starting Material A:** 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one is the logical precursor. The carbonyl group is at position 1, and the adjacent methylene group is at position 2. The nitrosation reaction will occur at this C-2 position to form the 1,2-dione.\n\n**Analysis of Reaction B:**\n\n*   **Product:** 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione\n*   **Mechanism:** Similar to the first reaction, this requires a ketone with an adjacent methylene group. The product is an acyclic (straight-chain) diketone.\n*   **Starting Material B:** 5-methylhexan-2-one fits the criteria. The carbonyl group is at position 2, and there is a methylene group at position 3. The reaction with NaNO₂ and HCl will introduce a new carbonyl group at the C-3 position, resulting in 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) A = 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, B = 5-methylhexan-2-one:** Compound A is an alcohol, not the required ketone.\n*   **B) A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, B = 5-methylhexan-2-one:** Both compounds are the correct ketone starting materials for their respective reactions.\n*   **C) A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, B = 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol:** Compound B is a diol. While oxidation can produce diketones from diols, it typically requires different reagents, not NaNO₂/HCl.\n*   **D) A = 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, B = 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol:** Neither compound is the correct ketone starting material for this specific transformation.\n\nBased on the established reaction mechanism, the correct starting materials are the ketones that can undergo α-nitrosation followed by hydrolysis.\n\n<<<B>>>"
