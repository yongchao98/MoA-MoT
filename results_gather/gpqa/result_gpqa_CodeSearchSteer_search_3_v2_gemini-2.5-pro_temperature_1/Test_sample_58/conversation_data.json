    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we must first calculate the moles of the acidic and basic species and then determine which species is in excess after neutralization.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of each species.\n\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n    *   Moles = Concentration × Volume\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n    *   HCl dissociates completely into H⁺ and Cl⁻.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = Moles of HCl = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol\n\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂), a strong base:**\n    *   Ba(OH)₂ dissociates completely into Ba²⁺ and 2 OH⁻.\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol\n\n### Step 2: Perform the neutralization reactions.\n\nFirst, the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) will react with the strong base (OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂).\n*   Reaction: H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n*   Initial moles of H⁺ = 0.080 mol\n*   Initial moles of OH⁻ = 0.180 mol\n*   Since there are more moles of OH⁻, all the H⁺ from HCl will be consumed.\n*   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\nNext, the remaining strong base (OH⁻) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n*   Reaction: CH3COOH + OH⁻ → CH3COO⁻ + H₂O\n*   Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n*   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.100 mol\n*   The weak acid is the limiting reactant and will be completely consumed.\n*   Moles of OH⁻ in excess = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the pH of the final solution.\n\nThe final solution contains a strong base (excess OH⁻) and the conjugate base of the weak acid (CH3COO⁻). The pH will be determined by the concentration of the excess strong base, as its contribution to the OH⁻ concentration is far greater than that from the hydrolysis of the weak conjugate base.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Calculate the concentration of the excess OH⁻ ions:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH + pOH = 14\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>"
