    "To determine the necessary Lorentz factor, we can use the formula for particle decay, which relates the fraction of surviving particles to their lifetime and the time of flight.\n\nThe fraction of particles (N/N₀) that survive after a time 't' is given by the exponential decay law:\n\nN/N₀ = exp( -t / t_lifetime )\n\nHere, 't' is the time it takes for the particles to travel from the center to the inner wall of the detector. Since they travel at nearly the speed of light (c), this time is the radius (R) divided by c (t = R/c).\n\nThe particle's lifetime in the detector's reference frame (t_lifetime) is affected by time dilation due to its high velocity. This is related to its proper lifetime (τ, the lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor (γ):\n\nt_lifetime = γ * τ\n\nCombining these, the survival fraction is:\n\nN/N₀ = exp( -(R/c) / (γτ) )\n\nWe have two scenarios:\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor (γ₁) = 20\n*   Fraction of surviving particles (N₁/N₀) = 1/3\n*   Radius (R) = 30 m\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n1/3 = exp( -30 / (c * 20 * τ) )\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * cτ)\n-ln(3) = -1.5 / (cτ)\nln(3) = 1.5 / (cτ)\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   Lorentz factor (γ₂) = ?\n*   Fraction of surviving particles (N₂/N₀) = 2/3\n*   Radius (R) = 30 m\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n2/3 = exp( -30 / (c * γ₂ * τ) )\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\nln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n\nNow, we can set up a ratio of the equations from the two scenarios to eliminate the unknown proper lifetime (τ) and the speed of light (c):\n\n( ln(3) / ln(3/2) ) = ( 1.5 / (cτ) ) / ( 30 / (γ₂ * cτ) )\nln(3) / ln(3/2) = (1.5 * γ₂ * cτ) / (30 * cτ)\nln(3) / ln(3/2) = 1.5 * γ₂ / 30\nln(3) / ln(3/2) = γ₂ / 20\n\nNow, we solve for γ₂:\nγ₂ = 20 * ( ln(3) / ln(3/2) )\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * ( 1.0986 / 0.4055 )\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709\nγ₂ ≈ 54.18\n\nThis value is approximately 54.\n\n<<<B>>>"
