    "To determine the joint probability, we must analyze the composition of the initial coupled state in terms of the uncoupled states of the individual electrons.\n\n### Key Principles\n1.  **Initial State**: The system is in a coupled angular momentum state denoted by `|l, m>`, where `l` is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number and `m` is the magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the total angular momentum. Here, the state is `|2, -1>`.\n2.  **Measurement State**: The measurement seeks to find the system in a state where the individual z-component eigenvalues are `-ħ` for both electrons. This corresponds to the uncoupled state `|m1, m2> = |-1, -1>`.\n3.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum**: A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. That is, `m = m1 + m2`. This rule is a consequence of the properties of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which relate the coupled and uncoupled bases.\n\n### Analysis\nThe initial state of the 2-electron system is `|l, m> = |2, -1>`. This means the quantum number for the z-component of the total angular momentum is `m = -1`.\n\nThe measurement is for the outcome where `L1z` gives an eigenvalue of `-ħ` (so `m1 = -1`) and `L2z` gives an eigenvalue of `-ħ` (so `m2 = -1`).\n\nAccording to the rules of angular momentum addition, the z-component of the total angular momentum must be conserved. Therefore, for any possible outcome of `m1` and `m2`, their sum must equal the initial total `m`.\n\nLet's check if the desired outcome is possible:\n*   `m1 = -1`\n*   `m2 = -1`\n*   `m1 + m2 = -1 + (-1) = -2`\n\nThe initial state has `m = -1`, while the desired final state has a total `m` of -2. Since `-1 ≠ -2`, this outcome is not physically possible. The system, being in a state with a total `m` of -1, cannot be found in a configuration where the sum of the individual `m` values is -2.\n\nThe probability of measuring an outcome is given by the square of the amplitude of that outcome's state in the expansion of the initial state. This amplitude is represented by a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. The coefficient `<l1, m1; l2, m2 | l, m>` is zero unless `m = m1 + m2`. In this case, `<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>` is zero because `-1 + (-1) ≠ -1`.\n\nTherefore, the probability of finding the system with `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1` is zero.\n\n<<<C>>>"
