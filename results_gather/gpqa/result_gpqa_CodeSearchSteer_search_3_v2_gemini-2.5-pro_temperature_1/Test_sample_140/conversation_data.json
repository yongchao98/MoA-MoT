    "The reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate. Isotopic labeling, using isotopes like deuterium (²H), is a common technique to study such reaction mechanisms.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the possible reaction pathways:\n\n1.  **Formation of Benzyne Intermediates:** The strong base, amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such positions:\n    *   **Path A: Abstraction of a proton (H) from C6:** The amide ion can remove the hydrogen atom at the C6 position. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻), forming a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains in place. This intermediate is 3-deuteriobenzyne.\n    *   **Path B: Abstraction of a deuteron (D) from C2:** The amide ion can also remove the deuterium atom from the C2 position. This also results in the elimination of the bromide ion and the formation of a benzyne intermediate, this time with the triple bond between C1 and C2. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated benzyne. Although the C-D bond is stronger than the C-H bond (a phenomenon known as the kinetic isotope effect), making this pathway slower, it is still a possible route for the reaction.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Attack and Product Formation:** The benzyne intermediates are highly reactive and will be attacked by the nucleophilic amide ion.\n\n    *   **From 3-deuteriobenzyne (Path A):** The amide ion can attack either of the two carbons of the triple bond.\n        *   Attack at C1 leads to the formation of 2-deuterioaniline after protonation by the ammonia solvent.\n        *   Attack at C6 leads to the formation of 3-deuterioaniline after protonation.\n        Therefore, Path A yields **two** distinct organic products.\n\n    *   **From benzyne (Path B):** The amide ion attacks the symmetrical benzyne intermediate.\n        *   Attack at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, results in the formation of aniline (non-deuterated).\n        Therefore, Path B yields **one** organic product.\n\nCombining the outcomes of both possible pathways, we find a total of three possible organic products:\n\n*   2-deuterioaniline\n*   3-deuterioaniline\n*   Aniline\n\nThus, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
