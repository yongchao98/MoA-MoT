    "To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we must check each option against the fundamental conservation laws of physics and the specific conditions given in the problem.\n\n### Summary of Conditions\n\n1.  **Initial State (`1S0` NN system):**\n    *   Total Spin `S(NN_initial) = 0`\n    *   Orbital Angular Momentum `L(NN_initial) = 0`\n    *   Total Angular Momentum `J(NN_initial) = 0`\n    *   Parity `P(initial) = (-1)^L(NN_initial) = (-1)^0 = +1`\n\n2.  **Particle X:**\n    *   Intrinsic Parity `P(X) = -1` (given)\n    *   We assume the spin of particle X is zero, as is common for emitted mesons in such problems. The lowercase letter (s, p, f) denotes its orbital angular momentum, `l(X)`.\n\n3.  **Final State (NN_final + X):**\n    *   The final two-nucleon state has Isospin `T(NN_final) = 0`.\n\n4.  **Selection Rules:**\n    *   **Pauli Principle:** The prompt provides the condition derived from the Pauli principle for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Since `T(NN) = 0`, this simplifies to `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` must be an odd number.\n    *   **Parity Conservation:** The total parity must be conserved. `P(initial) = P(final)`.\n        `P(NN_initial) = P(NN_final) * P(X) * P(orbital)`\n        `+1 = (-1)^L(NN_final) * (-1) * (-1)^l(X)`\n        This requires that `L(NN_final) + l(X)` must be an odd number.\n    *   **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total angular momentum must be conserved. `J(initial) = J(final)`.\n        `J(NN_initial) = J(NN_final) + l(X)` (vector sum).\n        Since `J(NN_initial) = 0`, the final angular momenta must sum to zero, which means their magnitudes must be equal: `J(NN_final) = l(X)`.\n\n### Analysis of the Options\n\nWe will test each option against these three selection rules. The transition is not permitted if it fails even one rule.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S=1`, `L=2`, `J=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `l(X)=3`.\n1.  **Pauli Principle:** `S+L = 1+2 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L+l(X) = 2+3 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Angular Momentum:** `J = l(X)` -> `3 = 3`. **OK.**\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S=1`, `L=1`, `J=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `l(X)=0`.\n1.  **Pauli Principle:** `S+L = 1+1 = 2` (even). **FAILS.**\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L+l(X) = 1+0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Angular Momentum:** `J = l(X)` -> `0 = 0`. **OK.**\n*   This transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli principle for the final T=0 state.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S=1`, `L=0`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l(X)=1`.\n1.  **Pauli Principle:** `S+L = 1+0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L+l(X) = 0+1 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Angular Momentum:** `J = l(X)` -> `1 = 1`. **OK.**\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` -> `S=3`, `L=2`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l(X)=1`.\n*   A state with total spin S=3 is not possible for a two-nucleon system, as each nucleon has spin 1/2, so the total spin can only be S=0 or S=1. Therefore, this final state cannot exist. However, the question asks to evaluate the permission of the partial wave based on the provided conservation laws. Applying the rules mechanically:\n1.  **Pauli Principle:** `S+L = 3+2 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L+l(X) = 2+1 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Angular Momentum:** `J = l(X)` -> `1 = 1`. **OK.**\n*   While the state itself is impossible, the transition *formally satisfies* all the selection rules given in the prompt. The most direct violation of the rules explicitly provided for the transition dynamics is in option B.\n\nBased on the violation of the Pauli principle as specified in the problem, option B is the partial wave that is not permitted.\n\n<<<B>>>"
