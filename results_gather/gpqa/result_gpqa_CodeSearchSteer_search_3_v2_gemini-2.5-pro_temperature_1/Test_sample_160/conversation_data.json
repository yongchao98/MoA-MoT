    "This problem requires an analysis of the mean free path (MFP) for two different scenarios within the same environment: the MFP of gas molecules colliding with each other (λ1) and the MFP of high-energy electrons colliding with those same gas molecules (λ2).\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the physics involved:\n\n1.  **Definition of Mean Free Path (MFP):** The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. It is inversely proportional to the number density of target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ), which is the effective area a target presents for a collision. A simplified formula is λ = 1 / (nσ).\n\n2.  **Number Density (n):** In the described scenario, the pressure and temperature of the gas in the sample compartment remain constant. This means the number of gas molecules per unit volume, or number density (n), is the same for both calculations.\n\n3.  **Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules (λ1):** This is the MFP for gas molecule-gas molecule collisions. A more precise formula from the kinetic theory of gases for identical particles in thermal motion is λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg), where σ_gg is the gas-gas collision cross-section. This cross-section is related to the physical size of the molecules. The √2 factor accounts for the relative motion of the colliding gas molecules.\n\n4.  **Mean Free Path of Electrons (λ2):** This is the MFP for electron-gas molecule collisions. The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, making them extremely fast (relativistic) compared to the thermal motion of the gas molecules. Therefore, the gas molecules can be considered almost stationary targets. The formula for a fast particle moving through stationary targets is λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg), where σ_eg is the electron-gas collision cross-section.\n\n5.  **Comparing the Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg):**\n    *   **σ_gg (Gas-Gas):** This is effectively a \"hard-sphere\" collision cross-section, determined by the physical radii of the interacting gas molecules.\n    *   **σ_eg (Electron-Gas):** This interaction is fundamentally different. The electron is a point-like particle, and it interacts with the gas molecule's electromagnetic field. A high-energy electron can pass very close to or even through the molecule's electron cloud without a significant interaction (scattering) that would qualify as a \"collision.\" The effective target area for a high-energy electron is significantly *smaller* than the physical cross-section of the molecule involved in molecule-molecule collisions.\n\n6.  **Conclusion on Mean Free Paths:**\n    *   λ₁ is determined by the relatively large gas-gas cross-section (σ_gg).\n    *   λ₂ is determined by the much smaller electron-gas cross-section (σ_eg).\n    *   Since λ is inversely proportional to σ, and σ_eg is much smaller than σ_gg, it follows that λ₂ must be much larger than λ₁.\n\n7.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) λ₂ = λ₁: Incorrect. The collision cross-sections are vastly different.\n    *   B) λ₂ < λ₁: Incorrect. This would imply the electron is a larger target than a molecule.\n    *   C) and D) Both suggest λ₂ > λ₁. To distinguish between them, we can use a simplified model from kinetic theory that *only* considers the relative motion and, for a moment, incorrectly assumes the cross-sections are equal. In this model, λ₂/λ₁ = [1/(nσ)] / [1/(√2 nσ)] = √2 ≈ 1.414. This simplified model already predicts λ₂ ≈ 1.414 * λ₁.\n    *   Since the physical reality is that the electron-gas cross-section (σ_eg) is much smaller than the gas-gas cross-section (σ_gg), the ratio λ₂/λ₁ will be even larger than √2.\n    *   Therefore, the condition λ₂ ≥ 1.22*λ₁ is a conservative but correct conclusion. The condition in option D, which sets an upper bound of 1.22*λ₁, is contradicted by even the most basic kinetic theory model.\n\nBased on the analysis, the mean free path for the high-energy electrons (λ2) will be significantly longer than the mean free path for the gas molecules (λ1).\n\n<<<C>>>"
