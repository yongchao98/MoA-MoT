    "To determine the correct starting materials, we must analyze how each reducing agent reacts with the functional groups present and how this affects the stereochemistry of the final product.\n\nThe potential starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule contains two functional groups that can be reduced: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-CO-O-iBu). The molecule has a chiral center at carbon 3, where the ethyl group is attached.\n\n### **Reaction A**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** A\n*   **Reagents:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride), followed by H⁺ workup.\n*   **Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one (a lactone)\n\n**Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n\n**Reaction Pathway:**\n1.  LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group remains unchanged.\n    `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu → HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`\n2.  Under acidic workup (H⁺), the resulting 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid undergoes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the six-membered ring lactone product.\n\n**Stereochemical Analysis:**\n1.  **Assigning Priorities:** We must use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules to assign priorities to the groups attached to the chiral center (carbon 3) in the starting material.\n    *   Groups on C3: -H, -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), -CH₂COOH (acid), and -CH₂COOiBu (ester).\n    *   Priorities: **1.** -CH₂COOiBu > **2.** -CH₂COOH > **3.** -CH₂CH₃ > **4.** -H.\n2.  **Transformation Effect:** The reduction converts the ester group into a -CH₂CH₂OH group. The chiral center itself is not altered, but the priorities of its adjacent groups change.\n    *   In the intermediate hydroxy acid (`HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`), the priority order becomes: **1.** -CH₂COOH > **2.** -CH₂CH₂OH > **3.** -CH₂CH₃ > **4.** -H.\n3.  **Configuration Change:** The group that was priority #1 in the starting material is now priority #2 in the intermediate, and the group that was #2 is now #1. This swap in the priority of two groups inverts the stereochemical designation (R/S). Therefore, an (S) starting material will become an (R) intermediate.\n4.  **Final Step:** The cyclization of the (R)-hydroxy acid to the (R)-lactone does not change the configuration at the chiral center.\n5.  **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the (R)-product, the starting material A must be the **(S)-enantiomer**.\n\n### **Reaction B**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** B\n*   **Reagents:** BH₃ (Borane), followed by H⁺ workup.\n*   **Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n**Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is a chemoselective reducing agent that reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n\n**Reaction Pathway:**\n1.  BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol. The isobutyl ester group remains unchanged.\n    `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu → HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`\n2.  Under acidic workup (H⁺), the resulting 5-hydroxy ester undergoes intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone product and isobutanol.\n\n**Stereochemical Analysis:**\n1.  **Assigning Priorities:** The priorities for the starting material B are the same as for A:\n    *   Priorities: **1.** -CH₂COOiBu > **2.** -CH₂COOH > **3.** -CH₂CH₃ > **4.** -H.\n2.  **Transformation Effect:** The reduction converts the carboxylic acid group into a -CH₂CH₂OH group. Let's examine the priorities in the intermediate hydroxy ester (`HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`).\n    *   Priority order: **1.** -CH₂COOiBu > **2.** -CH₂CH₂OH > **3.** -CH₂CH₃ > **4.** -H.\n3.  **Configuration Change:** The group that was priority #1 (-CH₂COOiBu) remains priority #1. The group that was priority #2 (-CH₂COOH) is reduced but the new group (-CH₂CH₂OH) is still priority #2 relative to the ethyl group. The priority order of the substituents does not change. Therefore, the stereochemical designation (R/S) is retained. An (S) starting material will give an (S) intermediate.\n4.  **Final Step:** The cyclization of the (S)-hydroxy ester to the (S)-lactone does not change the configuration.\n5.  **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the (S)-product, the starting material B must be the **(S)-enantiomer**.\n\nBoth starting materials, A and B, must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>"
