    "Here is a breakdown of the reactions to determine the correct reagents.\n\n### Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n\nThis reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone. The process involves the nucleophilic attack of a cyanide ion (CN⁻) on the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This is followed by the protonation of the resulting alkoxide intermediate to form the final hydroxyl group (-OH).\n\nThe reaction starts with the nucleophilic cyanide ion attacking the carbonyl carbon. Using sodium cyanide (NaCN) provides the necessary CN⁻ ions. After the initial attack, an alkoxide intermediate is formed. This intermediate needs a proton (H⁺) source to be converted into the stable cyanohydrin product. A common way to achieve this is through an acidic workup using a proton source like H₃O⁺. While the reaction is often buffered at a slightly acidic pH (around 4-5) to ensure the presence of both HCN and free CN⁻ ions for optimal reaction speed, the final protonation step is completed by an acid. Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺** is the suitable reagent.\n\n### Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n\nThis reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation can be catalyzed by either an acid or a base.\n\nIn acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, the nitrile is heated with a strong mineral acid, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric acid, in the presence of water. The reaction proceeds through an amide intermediate, which is then further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid. Strong acids like HCl are effective for this conversion. Weak acids like acetic acid (CH₃COOH) are generally not strong enough to efficiently catalyze this hydrolysis.\n\nGiven the options, **B = HCl** is the appropriate strong acid for the hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Reagent **A** is **H₃O⁺**.\n*   Reagent **B** is **HCl**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
