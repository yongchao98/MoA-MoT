    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift for detecting Lyman-alpha absorption from ground-based optical telescopes, we need to consider the atmospheric cutoff wavelength. Earth's atmosphere blocks most ultraviolet (UV) radiation, making ground-based observations at these wavelengths impossible. The Lyman-alpha transition of neutral hydrogen has a rest wavelength of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å), which is deep in the UV part of the spectrum.\n\nFor the light from a distant quasar to pass through the atmosphere and be detected by a ground telescope, its wavelength must be stretched by the expansion of the universe (redshifted) into the optical window. The optical window for ground-based telescopes begins at the atmospheric cutoff, which is roughly 300 to 330 nanometers (nm), or 3000 to 3300 Å, due to absorption by ozone. Some sources state that the Lyman-alpha forest becomes observable with ground-based telescopes for redshifts greater than 2.\n\nWe can calculate the minimum redshift (z) using the formula:\nz = (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1\n\nWhere:\n*   λ_observed is the wavelength observed on Earth.\n*   λ_rest is the rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line (1216 Å).\n\nTo find the *lower limit* on the redshift, we should use the shortest possible observed wavelength, which is the atmospheric cutoff. Let's use a conservative value of ~3300 Å for the atmospheric cutoff.\n\nz = (3300 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\nz ≈ 2.71 - 1\nz ≈ 1.71\n\nUsing a more optimistic cutoff of 3500 Å:\nz = (3500 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\nz ≈ 2.88 - 1\nz ≈ 1.88\n\nBased on these calculations, the redshift must be approximately 1.7 to 1.9 for the Lyman-alpha line to become visible to ground-based telescopes. This aligns with sources that state the Lyman-alpha forest is observed from the ground at redshifts of approximately z > 2.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 3\nB) 1.9\nC) 2.4\nD) 1.2\n\nA redshift of 1.9 is the most plausible lower limit among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>"
