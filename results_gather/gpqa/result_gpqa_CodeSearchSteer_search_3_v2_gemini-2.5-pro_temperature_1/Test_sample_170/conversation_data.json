    "To determine the order of substances by the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction, we must analyze the directing effects of each substituent on the benzene ring. The reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution, where a bromine atom replaces a hydrogen atom on the ring. The substituent already present on the ring dictates the position (ortho, meta, or para) where the new bromine atom will attach.\n\nThe six substances are:\n1.  **ะก6H5-CH3** (Toluene)\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5** (Ethyl benzoate)\n3.  **C6H5-Cl** (Chlorobenzene)\n4.  **C6H5-NO2** (Nitrobenzene)\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5** (Ethylbenzene)\n6.  **C6H5-COOH** (Benzoic acid)\n\nThese substituents can be classified into two main groups based on their directing effects:\n\n**1. Meta-directing groups:** These groups are deactivating, meaning they make the benzene ring less reactive towards electrophilic substitution. They direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position, resulting in very low yields of the ortho and para isomers. The stronger the deactivating effect, the lower the yield of the para-isomer.\n*   **-NO2 (4)**: This is a very strong deactivating group. Bromination of nitrobenzene yields almost exclusively the meta-isomer, with the para-isomer yield being extremely low, typically around 1%.\n*   **-COOH (6)**: This is a deactivating group, directing incoming substituents to the meta position. Its para-isomer yield is very small.\n*   **-COOC2H5 (2)**: Similar to the carboxylic acid group, the ethyl ester group is also a deactivating, meta-director. The para-isomer yield is minimal, though typically slightly higher than for nitrobenzene. For nitration, which follows similar principles, ethyl benzoate yields about 5% para product.\n\nAmong these three, the nitro group is the strongest deactivator, leading to the lowest para yield. The carboxylic acid and ethyl ester groups are also strong deactivators. Based on typical isomer distributions, the order of increasing para-yield for these meta-directors is: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n\n**2. Ortho, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. For these substances, the para-isomer is a significant product. The ratio of para to ortho product is largely influenced by steric hindrance; bulkier groups hinder substitution at the adjacent ortho positions, thus increasing the proportion of the para-isomer.\n*   **-CH3 (1)**: The methyl group is an activating, ortho, para-director. In bromination, toluene yields a significant amount of para-isomer, typically around 62-67%.\n*   **-C2H5 (5)**: The ethyl group is also an activating, ortho, para-director. It is sterically bulkier than the methyl group. This increased bulk hinders the ortho positions more, leading to a higher yield of the para-isomer compared to toluene. The para product can be as high as 94%.\n*   **-Cl (3)**: The chloro group is deactivating overall but is an ortho, para-director. Due to electronic factors and its size, it directs a very high proportion of the product to the para position, typically around 89% in bromination.\n\nComparing these three, toluene (1) has the lowest para yield. Comparing chlorobenzene (3) and ethylbenzene (5), literature data suggests that the larger steric bulk of the ethyl group leads to a slightly higher para-selectivity (around 94%) than the chloro group (around 89%). Thus, the order of increasing para yield is: Toluene (1) < Chlorobenzene (3) < Ethylbenzene (5).\n\n**Combined Ranking:**\n\nBy combining the two groups, we can establish the overall order from the lowest para-isomer yield to the highest:\n\n{Meta-directors} < {Ortho, para-directors}\n\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 3 < 5)\n\nThis gives the final sequence: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**.\n\nUpon reviewing the provided options, this exact sequence is not available. However, option C is the closest match, differing only in the final two positions.\n\nMy analysis: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**\nOption C:      **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe discrepancy lies in the relative para-isomer yield of chlorobenzene (3) versus ethylbenzene (5). While most data suggest ethylbenzene gives a slightly higher para yield due to sterics, the values are close (89% vs 94%), and slight variations in reaction conditions could potentially alter this order. Given the options, Option C correctly identifies the meta-directors as having the lowest para yields in the order 4 < 6 < 2, and correctly identifies toluene (1) as having the lowest para yield among the o,p-directors. The distinction between chlorobenzene and ethylbenzene is the most subtle point. Considering the provided choices, option C is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
