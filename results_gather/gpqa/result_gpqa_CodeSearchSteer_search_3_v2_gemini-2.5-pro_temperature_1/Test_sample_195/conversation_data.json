    "The initial derivation appears to be correct based on the principles of special relativity and energy conservation. The search results confirm that for a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the total conserved energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energy of the particle (γmc²) and the potential energy (U(x)).\n\nThe steps followed were:\n1.  Define the total energy of the system as E_total = γmc² + U(x), where U(x) = ½kx². This formulation is confirmed by physics literature.\n2.  At the point of maximum amplitude (x = A), the velocity is zero (v = 0), which means the Lorentz factor γ = 1. The total energy is therefore E_total = mc² + ½kA².\n3.  At the equilibrium position (x = 0), the potential energy is zero, and the speed is at its maximum (v = v_max). Here, the Lorentz factor is γ_max = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²). The total energy is E_total = γ_max * mc².\n4.  By the principle of conservation of energy, these two expressions for the total energy must be equal:\n    γ_max * mc² = mc² + ½kA²\n5.  Solving this equation for v_max leads to the expression:\n    v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + kA² / (2mc²))²)\n\nThis matches exactly with option D. The non-relativistic limit was also checked and found to be correct, further validating the result. The other options lead to physically impossible results (v > c) or are dimensionally incorrect.\n\n<<<D>>>"
