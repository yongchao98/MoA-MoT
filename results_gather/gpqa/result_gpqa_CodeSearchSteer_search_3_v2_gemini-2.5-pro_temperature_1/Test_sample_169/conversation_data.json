    "To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, `<S_y>`, we use the formula:\n\n<S_y> = <ψ|S_y|ψ> / <ψ|ψ>\n\nWhere:\n*   `|ψ>` is the spin state vector, given as `(3i, 4)`. We can write this as a column vector:\n    ```\n    |ψ> =  [3i]\n            [ 4]\n    ```\n*   `<ψ|` is the bra vector, which is the conjugate transpose of `|ψ>`:\n    ```\n    <ψ| = [-3i, 4]\n    ```\n*   `S_y` is the spin operator for the y-direction. It is related to the Pauli spin matrix `σ_y` by `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`.\n    Given `σ_y` is:\n    ```\n    σ_y = [0, -i]\n          [i,  0]\n    ```\n    So, `S_y` is:\n    ```\n    S_y = (ħ/2) * [0, -i]\n                 [i,  0]\n    ```\n\nFirst, let's calculate the denominator, `<ψ|ψ>`, which is the normalization factor.\n`<ψ|ψ> = [-3i, 4] * [3i] = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = -9i² + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25`\n      `[ 4]`\n\nNext, we calculate the numerator, `<ψ|S_y|ψ>`. We can start by applying `S_y` to `|ψ>`:\n`S_y|ψ> = (ħ/2) * [0, -i] * [3i] = (ħ/2) * [0*(3i) + (-i)*4] = (ħ/2) * [-4i]`\n                 `[i,  0]   [ 4]           [i*(3i) + 0*4 ]           [-3 ]`\n\nNow, we multiply this result by `<ψ|`:\n`<ψ|S_y|ψ> = [-3i, 4] * (ħ/2) * [-4i] = (ħ/2) * [(-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3)]`\n                               `[-3 ]`\n\n`<ψ|S_y|ψ> = (ħ/2) * [12i² - 12] = (ħ/2) * [-12 - 12] = (ħ/2) * [-24] = -12ħ`\n\nFinally, we compute the expectation value by dividing the numerator by the denominator:\n`<S_y> = (-12ħ) / 25 = -12ħ/25`\n\nThis result matches the one found in detailed problem solutions for the same quantum state.\n\n<<<A>>>"
