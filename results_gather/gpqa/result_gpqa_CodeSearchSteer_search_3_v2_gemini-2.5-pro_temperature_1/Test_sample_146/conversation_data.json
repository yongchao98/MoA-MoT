    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the velocity of particle A.\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe process is governed by the law of conservation of energy. The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after.\n\n*   **Initial Energy ($E_i$):** The initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which we can approximate as being at rest. To conserve momentum, we assume the annihilation happens in the center-of-mass frame where both particles are essentially at rest. Therefore, the initial energy is the sum of their rest energies.\n    *   The rest energy of a proton is approximately 938 MeV. Since a proton and an antiproton have the same mass, the rest energy of an antiproton is also 938 MeV.\n    *   $E_i = E_{proton} + E_{antiproton} = 938 \\, \\text{MeV} + 938 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n*   **Final Energy ($E_f$):** The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since they are moving, their energy is their total relativistic energy, which is the sum of their rest energy and kinetic energy.\n    *   We are given the rest energy of each particle A as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   The total energy of one particle A is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor that depends on the particle's velocity.\n    *   Since there are four identical particles produced, they will share the total energy equally.\n    *   $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n**2. Calculation**\n\nBy setting the initial energy equal to the final energy:\n$E_i = E_f$\n$1876 \\, \\text{MeV} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\, \\text{MeV})$\n\nFirst, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1876}{4 \\times 300} = \\frac{1876}{1200} \\approx 1.5633$\n\nNow, we use the formula for the Lorentz factor to find the velocity, $v$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for $v$:\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2}$\n$1 - v^2/c^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$v^2/c^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$v = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstituting the value of $\\gamma$:\n$v = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}}$\n$v = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}}$\n$v = c \\sqrt{1 - 0.4091}$\n$v = c \\sqrt{0.5909}$\n$v \\approx 0.7687c$\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated velocity is approximately 0.77c.\n\n<<<C>>>"
