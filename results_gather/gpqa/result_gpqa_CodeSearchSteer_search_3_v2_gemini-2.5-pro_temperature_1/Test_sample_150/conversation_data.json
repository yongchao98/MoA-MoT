    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the principles of quantum mechanics for measuring an observable.\n\n1.  **Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the observable operator P.**\n    The observable is given by the matrix:\n    P =  (  0    1/√2   0  )\n        ( 1/√2   0   1/√2 )\n        (  0    1/√2   0  )\n\n    To find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`, where I is the identity matrix.\n    `det(P - λI)` = det(  -λ    1/√2     0   )\n                       ( 1/√2   -λ     1/√2  )\n                       (   0    1/√2    -λ   )\n\n    = -λ((-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2)) - (1/√2)((-λ)(1/√2) - 0)\n    = -λ(λ² - 1/2) + λ/2\n    = -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2\n    = -λ³ + λ\n    = λ(1 - λ²)\n    = λ(1 - λ)(1 + λ)\n\n    Setting the determinant to zero, `λ(1 - λ)(1 + λ) = 0`, gives the eigenvalues λ = 0, λ = 1, and λ = -1.\n\n2.  **Find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue of interest (λ = 0).**\n    We need to find the vector `v` such that `Pv = 0v`, or `Pv = 0`. Let the eigenvector `v₀` be (x, y, z).\n    (  0    1/√2   0  ) (x)   (0)\n    ( 1/√2   0   1/√2 ) (y) = (0)\n    (  0    1/√2   0  ) (z)   (0)\n\n    From the first and third rows, we get `y/√2 = 0`, which implies `y = 0`.\n    From the second row, we get `x/√2 + z/√2 = 0`, which implies `x + z = 0`, or `x = -z`.\n\n    So, the eigenvector for λ=0 is of the form `(x, 0, -x)`. We can choose x=1 to get the un-normalized eigenvector `v₀ = (1, 0, -1)`.\n\n    To normalize this eigenvector, we divide by its norm:\n    Norm = √(1² + 0² + (-1)²) = √2\n    The normalized eigenvector for λ=0, which we'll call `|v₀⟩`, is `(1/√2) * (1, 0, -1)`.\n\n3.  **Normalize the state vector of the system.**\n    The state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix `|ψ⟩ = (-1, 2, 1)`.\n    We need to normalize this vector:\n    Norm = √((-1)² + 2² + 1²) = √(1 + 4 + 1) = √6\n    The normalized state vector, `|ψ_norm⟩`, is `(1/√6) * (-1, 2, 1)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the probability.**\n    The probability of measuring an eigenvalue λ is the square of the magnitude of the projection of the state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector.\n    Probability(λ=0) = |⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩|²\n\n    First, calculate the inner product `⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩`:\n    `⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩` = [ (1/√2) * (1, 0, -1) ] · [ (1/√6) * (-1, 2, 1) ]\n    = (1/√2)(1/√6) * [ (1)*(-1) + (0)*(2) + (-1)*(1) ]\n    = (1/√12) * (-1 + 0 - 1)\n    = -2 / √12\n    = -2 / (2√3)\n    = -1 / √3\n\n    Now, we square the magnitude of this result to find the probability:\n    Probability(λ=0) = | -1/√3 |² = 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t is 1/3.\n\n<<<D>>>"
