    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Compound X from the Spectral Data\n\nFirst, we must determine the structure of the starting material, Compound X, using the provided infrared (IR) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (¹H NMR) data.\n\n**IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretching in a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong peak indicates a carbonyl (C=O) group. The position is consistent with a carboxylic acid, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions are typical for C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n\nThe IR data strongly suggests that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n**¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet this far downfield is a classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are characteristic of a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield signal at 7.2 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n*   **Alkyl Group Signals:** The remaining signals define the structure of the alkyl substituent.\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for one proton, likely the benzylic proton (the one attached directly to the benzene ring).\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for two protons, likely a -CH₂- group.\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for three protons, indicating a -CH₃ group coupled to a single proton (-CH).\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for three protons, characteristic of a -CH₃ group coupled to a -CH₂- group.\n\nAssembling these pieces, the alkyl group is a **sec-butyl group**: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃). The proton at 2.9 ppm is the -CH, coupled to the adjacent -CH₃ (at 1.4 ppm) and -CH₂- (at 1.7 ppm).\n\nBased on the combined spectral data, **Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (A).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Reaction and the Final Product\n\nCompound X, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, is reacted with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus and HI form a powerful reducing agent. This combination is known to reduce carboxylic acids completely to alkanes. The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is converted into a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\n*   **Reaction:**\n    The -COOH group on the benzene ring of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid will be reduced to a -CH₃ group. The sec-butyl group and the benzene ring itself will remain unchanged under these conditions.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Product:** The -COOH is replaced by -CH₃, resulting in **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### Step 3: Match the Product with the Options\n\nComparing our deduced product with the choices provided:\n\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material.\n*   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n*   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect alkyl isomer (isobutyl vs. sec-butyl).\n*   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our predicted final product.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>"
