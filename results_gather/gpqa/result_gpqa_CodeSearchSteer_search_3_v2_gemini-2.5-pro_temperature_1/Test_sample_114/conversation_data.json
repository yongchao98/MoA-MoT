    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Conservation of Energy\n\nFirst, we establish the total energy of the system before the collision. The energy of a relativistic particle is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light.\n\n*   **Electron's Energy (E_e):**\n    *   Given Lorentz factor, γ_e = 4.\n    *   E_e = 4 * m_e * c²\n\n*   **Positron's Energy (E_p):**\n    *   Given Lorentz factor, γ_p = 2.\n    *   The positron has the same rest mass as the electron (m_e).\n    *   E_p = 2 * m_e * c²\n\nThe total initial energy (E_initial) is the sum of the electron's and positron's energies.\nE_initial = E_e + E_p = 4m_ec² + 2m_ec² = 6m_ec²\n\nAfter annihilation, two photons are produced. The problem states they have the same energy (E_γ).\nThe total final energy (E_final) is the sum of the energies of the two photons.\nE_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ\n\nAccording to the law of conservation of energy, E_initial = E_final.\n6m_ec² = 2E_γ\nE_γ = 3m_ec²\n\nSo, the energy of each photon is 3m_ec².\n\n### 2. Conservation of Momentum\n\nNext, we calculate the total momentum of the system before the collision. The momentum of a relativistic particle can be expressed as p = m_e*c*sqrt(γ² - 1).\n\n*   **Electron's Momentum (p_e):**\n    *   The electron moves from the left (positive x-direction).\n    *   p_e = m_e*c*sqrt(4² - 1) = m_e*c*sqrt(15)\n\n*   **Positron's Momentum (p_p):**\n    *   The positron moves from the right (negative x-direction).\n    *   p_p = -m_e*c*sqrt(2² - 1) = -m_e*c*sqrt(3)\n\nThe total initial momentum (P_initial) is the vector sum of the individual momenta. Since the motion is entirely along the horizontal axis, we only need to consider the x-component.\nP_initial_x = p_e + p_p = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e*c\nP_initial_y = 0\n\nNow, we consider the momentum of the final state. The two photons move away from the collision point. One moves upper-right, and the other moves lower-right. Since they have the same energy, their momentum magnitudes are also equal (p_γ = E_γ/c).\np_γ = (3m_ec²)/c = 3m_ec\n\nLet θ be the angle that each photon's path makes with the horizontal axis. Due to the conservation of momentum in the vertical direction (initial y-momentum is zero), the vertical components of the photons' momenta must cancel out. This confirms the angles must be equal and opposite (+θ and -θ).\n\n*   **Photon 1 momentum:** (p_γ * cos(θ), p_γ * sin(θ))\n*   **Photon 2 momentum:** (p_γ * cos(θ), -p_γ * sin(θ))\n\nThe total final momentum (P_final) is the sum of the photons' momenta.\nP_final_x = p_γ*cos(θ) + p_γ*cos(θ) = 2p_γ*cos(θ) = 2 * (3m_ec) * cos(θ) = 6m_ec*cos(θ)\nP_final_y = p_γ*sin(θ) - p_γ*sin(θ) = 0\n\nAccording to the law of conservation of momentum, P_initial = P_final.\n(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e*c = 6m_ec*cos(θ)\n\n### 3. Calculating the Angle\n\nWe can now solve for the angle θ.\ncos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6\n\nUsing the approximate values for the square roots:\n*   sqrt(15) ≈ 3.873\n*   sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732\n\ncos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n\nNow, we find θ by taking the arccosine:\nθ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°\n\nThe question asks for the angle *between* the directions of the two photons, which is 2θ.\nAngle = 2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°\n\nThis value is very close to 138.\n\n<<<D>>>"
