    "Here is a step-by-step determination of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step-by-step Synthesis of Product 4\n\n1.  **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n    *   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH), bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is an α-bromination of acetic acid. While the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction (using PBr₃) is more common, using a base like pyridine can facilitate the formation of an enolate from acetic acid, which then reacts with bromine. The reaction yields bromoacetic acid.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid is converted into an ethyl ester in the presence of an alcohol and a strong acid catalyst.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction (Sₙ2), where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH₂)₅Br).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a two-step alkylation process followed by a cyclization.\n        *   **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride, a strong base, removes an acidic α-proton from the carbon between the cyano and ester groups, forming a resonance-stabilized carbanion.\n        *   **First Alkylation:** The carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        *   **Second Deprotonation:** Since excess NaH is used, the remaining α-proton on the newly alkylated intermediate is removed, forming a new carbanion.\n        *   **Cyclization:** This second carbanion undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromide ion. This forms a six-membered ring (the α-carbon plus the five carbons from the pentane chain). This intramolecular cyclization is known as the Thorpe-Ziegler reaction.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### 1H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4\n\nThe structure of the final product, ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate, is a cyclohexane ring with both a cyano (-CN) group and an ethyl carboxylate (-COOCH₂CH₃) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. This creates a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ethyl carboxylate group.\n\nThis symmetry has the following consequences for the proton environments:\n*   The protons of the **ethyl group** (-OCH₂CH₃):\n    1.  The three protons of the methyl (-CH₃) group are chemically equivalent. This gives **one signal**.\n    2.  The two protons of the methylene (-CH₂) group are also chemically equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. This gives a **second signal**.\n*   The protons of the **cyclohexane ring**:\n    3.  **C2 and C6:** The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6. However, the two geminal protons on C2 (and C6) are diastereotopic (not interchangeable by symmetry) and are chemically distinct. Thus, the four protons on C2 and C6 produce **two signals**.\n    4.  **C3 and C5:** Similarly, the protons on C3 are equivalent to those on C5. The two geminal protons on C3 (and C5) are diastereotopic. This results in another **two signals**.\n    5.  **C4:** The two geminal protons on C4 are also diastereotopic and thus non-equivalent. This gives a final **two signals**.\n\n**Counting the distinct signals:**\n*   Ethyl -CH₃: 1 signal\n*   Ethyl -OCH₂-: 1 signal\n*   Ring C2/C6-H: 2 signals\n*   Ring C3/C5-H: 2 signals\n*   Ring C4-H: 2 signals\n\nTotal signals = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8.\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n<<<A>>>"
