    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Reaction**\n\nFirst, the solid iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, reacts with a strong acid (represented by H⁺) in a neutralization reaction. To dissolve the solid, enough acid must be added to react with all the hydroxide ions. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nFor the solid to remain dissolved, the ion product of its dissolution equilibrium must be less than or equal to its solubility product constant (Ksp). The dissolution equilibrium is:\n\nFe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\nKsp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n\nThe problem asks for the *minimum* volume of acid, which corresponds to the point where the solution is just saturated, meaning Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³. The pH of the resulting solution will be determined by the concentration of excess H⁺ ions needed to keep the [OH⁻] low enough to prevent precipitation.\n\n**2. Calculate Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n\n*   Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g\n*   The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is approximately 106.87 g/mol.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol = 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\n**3. Calculate Moles of H⁺ Required for Neutralization**\n\nFrom the stoichiometry of the neutralization reaction (Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺), 3 moles of H⁺ are required to react with every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n\n*   Moles of H⁺ (consumed) = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n*   Moles of H⁺ (consumed) = 3 * (9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol) = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol\n\n**4. Check the options based on stoichiometry**\n\nLet's analyze the amount of acid provided in each option to see if it's sufficient to neutralize the Fe(OH)₃.\n\n*   A) 20.40 cm³ of 0.1 M acid = 0.02040 L * 0.1 mol/L = 2.040 x 10⁻³ mol H⁺. This is less than the 2.807 x 10⁻³ moles required, so it cannot dissolve all the solid. **Option A is incorrect.**\n*   B) 32.14 cm³ of 0.1 M acid = 0.03214 L * 0.1 mol/L = 3.214 x 10⁻³ mol H⁺. This is sufficient.\n*   C) 30.09 cm³ of 0.1 M acid = 0.03009 L * 0.1 mol/L = 3.009 x 10⁻³ mol H⁺. This is sufficient.\n*   D) 28.05 cm³ of 0.1 M acid = 0.02805 L * 0.1 mol/L = 2.805 x 10⁻³ mol H⁺. This is almost exactly the stoichiometric amount, leaving virtually no excess acid to lower the pH significantly and keep the iron dissolved. It would result in a much higher pH where Fe(OH)₃ would precipitate. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\nWe are left with options B and C. Let's test option C as it provides an amount of acid just over the stoichiometric requirement.\n\n**5. Test Option C: V = 30.09 cm³, pH = 2.69**\n\n*   **Calculate Moles of H⁺ remaining:** If the final pH is 2.69, the final H⁺ concentration is:\n    *   [H⁺] = 10⁻²·⁶⁹ mol/L = 2.042 x 10⁻³ M\n    *   In a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L), the moles of H⁺ remaining are:\n    *   Moles H⁺ (remaining) = 2.042 x 10⁻³ M * 0.1 L = 2.042 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\n*   **Verify the total acid added:** The total acid added must equal the sum of the acid consumed and the acid remaining.\n    *   Total H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (consumed) + Moles H⁺ (remaining)\n    *   Total H⁺ = (2.807 x 10⁻³) + (2.042 x 10⁻⁴) = 3.0112 x 10⁻³ mol\n\n*   **Calculate the volume of acid:**\n    *   Volume = Moles / Concentration = 3.0112 x 10⁻³ mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.030112 L\n    *   Volume = 30.11 cm³\n\nThis calculated volume (30.11 cm³) is a near-perfect match for the volume given in option C (30.09 cm³). The pH and volume in option C are consistent with each other and with the initial conditions of the problem.\n\n**6. Confirmation with Ksp (Optional but recommended)**\n\nLet's confirm if a pH of 2.69 is reasonable.\n*   If pH = 2.69, then pOH = 14 - 2.69 = 11.31\n*   [OH⁻] = 10⁻¹¹·³¹ M = 4.898 x 10⁻¹² M\n*   The final concentration of Fe³⁺ is:\n    *   [Fe³⁺] = Moles / Volume = 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol / 0.1 L = 9.357 x 10⁻³ M\n*   The ion product Qsp would be:\n    *   Qsp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ = (9.357 x 10⁻³)(4.898 x 10⁻¹²)³ ≈ 1.1 x 10⁻³⁶\n*   Published Ksp values for Fe(OH)₃ vary, but often fall in the range of 10⁻³⁶ to 10⁻³⁹. The value implied by option C is physically reasonable.\n\nThe calculations for Option C are self-consistent and plausible.\n\n<<<C>>>"
