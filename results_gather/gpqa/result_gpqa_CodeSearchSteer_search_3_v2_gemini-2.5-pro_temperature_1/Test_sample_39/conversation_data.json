    "The phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other\" is common slang in a chemistry lab. It refers to a failed attempt to separate two or more compounds using chromatography. This issue is known as co-elution.\n\nIn a typical chromatography setup, such as Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) or column chromatography, separation is based on the polarity of the molecules. The stationary phase (the plate or column packing, usually silica) is very polar. A solvent, known as the mobile phase, flows through the stationary phase.\n\nHow separation works:\n*   **Polar compounds** are more strongly attracted to the polar stationary phase, so they move slowly.\n*   **Non-polar compounds** are less attracted to the stationary phase and are carried along more quickly by the mobile phase.\n\nWhen compounds are \"on top of each other,\" it means they have moved the same distance on a TLC plate or exited a column at the same time. This happens because the compounds are not being effectively separated by the chosen stationary and mobile phases, which is a direct result of them having very similar polarities.\n\nAnalyzing the other options:\n*   **Similar boiling points** would be a problem for separation by distillation, but the phrase \"on top of each other\" is characteristic of a chromatographic separation.\n*   **Similar optical rotations** are a property of chiral molecules and do not directly cause a lack of separation in standard chromatography. In fact, enantiomers (which have identical polarities) will be \"on top of each other\" in standard chromatography, but the underlying reason is their identical polarity, not their optical rotation.\n*   **Non-covalent/van der Waals interactions** are the underlying physical forces that determine a compound's polarity, but \"similar polarities\" is the direct property that describes why the separation failed.\n\nTherefore, the chemist is most likely referring to the fact that their compounds have similar polarities.\n\n<<<C>>>"
