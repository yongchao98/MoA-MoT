    "The search results confirm the approach I used. Several sources (,,,) describe the calculation of free metal ion concentration from the dissociation of a metal-EDTA complex. They all use the formation constant (K_f) and an equilibrium calculation.\n\nThe key steps are:\n1.  **Write the dissociation reaction:** [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n2.  **Use the formation constant (K_f):** K_f = [[Ca(EDTA)]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])\n3.  **Set up an equilibrium expression:** Let 'x' be the equilibrium concentration of free Ca²⁺.\n    *   [Ca²⁺] = x\n    *   [EDTA⁴⁻] = x\n    *   [[Ca(EDTA)]²⁻] = 0.02 - x\n4.  **Substitute into the K_f expression:** K_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n5.  **Solve for x:** Since K_f is very large (5x10¹⁰), the dissociation is minimal, so we can approximate [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ at equilibrium to be its initial concentration, 0.02 M.\n    *   5x10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n    *   x² ≈ 0.02 / (5x10¹⁰)\n    *   x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    *   x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe search results also highlight the importance of pH, stating that the given K_f values are typically for a high pH (pH > 10) where EDTA is fully deprotonated (Y⁴⁻) (,). The problem specifies an \"ideal pH,\" which implies we should use the given K_f without correction for protonation, validating the direct calculation.\n\nThe calculation is correct. The concentration of calcium ions, x, is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This corresponds to option B.\n\nFinal check of the steps and calculation:\n- Reaction: Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n- K_f = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])\n- Equilibrium: 5x10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / (x²)\n- Approximation: 5x10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n- x² ≈ 0.02 / (5x10¹⁰) = 4x10⁻¹³\n- x = √(40x10⁻¹⁴) = 6.32x10⁻⁷ M.\n\nThe calculation is sound. The answer is B.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex in solution.\n\nThe formation reaction for the Ca-EDTA complex is:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻\n\nThe formation constant (K_f), also known as the stability constant, is given by:\nK_f = [[Ca(EDTA)]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nWe are starting with a solution where the stoichiometric concentration of the complex, [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻, is 0.02 M. This complex will dissociate to some extent, establishing an equilibrium. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n[Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nLet 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions that form at equilibrium. According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation, the concentration of EDTA⁴⁻ will also be 'x', and the concentration of the [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ complex will decrease by 'x'.\n\nWe can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n| EDTA⁴⁻ | 0 | +x | x |\n\nNow, we substitute these equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\nK_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\nBecause the formation constant K_f is very large, the equilibrium lies far to the right (favoring the complex). This means the dissociation will be very small, and therefore 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex. We can make the approximation that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02. This simplifies the equation significantly.\n\n5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nNow, we can solve for x, which represents the concentration of calcium ions [Ca²⁺]:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This value matches option B. The assumption that 'x' is much smaller than 0.02 is valid, as 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ is indeed negligible compared to 0.02.\n\nThe problem states an \"ideal pH\", which means we can use the absolute formation constant without correcting for the pH-dependent forms of EDTA.\n\nTherefore, the correct concentration of calcium ions is 6.3x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<B>>>"
