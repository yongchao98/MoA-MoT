    "To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we must first identify the color of the light it emits.\n\n### 1. Calculate the Wavelength of Emitted Light\n\nThe energy of the emitted light is given as 2.3393 eV. The relationship between energy (E) in electron-volts (eV) and wavelength (λ) in nanometers (nm) can be approximated by the formula:\n\nλ ≈ 1240 / E\n\nUsing this formula for the emitted light:\n\nλ_emitted ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 eV ≈ 530 nm\n\nAccording to the visible light spectrum, a wavelength of 530 nm corresponds to **green** light.\n\n### 2. Relate Emitted Light to Absorbed Light\n\nWhen a substance, such as a textile dye, absorbs light, its electrons are excited to a higher energy state. They then lose some energy through non-radiative processes (like vibrations) before falling back to a lower state, emitting a photon of light in the process. This phenomenon is known as the Stokes shift.\n\nBecause of this energy loss, the emitted light always has lower energy and a longer wavelength than the absorbed light.\n\nTherefore, the dye must absorb light with a higher energy and a shorter wavelength than the green light (≈530 nm) it emits.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Options\n\nLet's examine the colors listed in the options based on their position in the electromagnetic spectrum and their corresponding energy levels.\n\n*   **A) Red:** Has a longer wavelength (~620–750 nm) and lower energy than green light.\n*   **B) Blue:** Has a shorter wavelength (~450–495 nm) and higher energy than green light.\n*   **C) Yellow:** Has a longer wavelength (~570–590 nm) and lower energy than green light.\n*   **D) Violet:** Has an even shorter wavelength (~380–450 nm) and higher energy than green light.\n\nBoth blue and violet light have higher energy than the emitted green light. However, for organic dyes, the absorption peak is typically found in the color region adjacent to the emission color, but at a shorter wavelength. A substance that emits green light most commonly absorbs blue light. This represents a typical Stokes shift for fluorescent molecules. Absorption of violet light would also result in green emission but represents a much larger, less common energy gap between absorption and emission.\n\nThus, the organic compound absorbed blue light, which has higher energy, and then emitted lower-energy green light.\n\n<<<B>>>"
