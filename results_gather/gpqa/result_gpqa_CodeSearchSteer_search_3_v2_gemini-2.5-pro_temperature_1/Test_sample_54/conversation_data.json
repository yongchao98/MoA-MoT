    "Based on the comprehensive analysis of the provided 1H NMR data, the unknown compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n1.  **Signal Analysis:**\n    *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal corresponds to the three protons of the acetate (CH₃COO-) methyl group. Its singlet nature indicates no adjacent protons, which is consistent with the acetate structure.\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This doublet represents a methyl group (CH₃-) attached to a carbon-carbon double bond. The doublet splitting pattern reveals it is coupled to a single proton.\n    *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal is from a proton on the double bond. The \"dq\" (doublet of quartets) multiplicity indicates it's coupled to one adjacent vinyl proton (\"d\") and three protons from the neighboring methyl group (\"q\").\n    *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This downfield signal is from the second proton on the double bond. It is a doublet because it's coupled to the other vinyl proton. The chemical shift is significantly downfield due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent oxygen atom.\n\n2.  **Structure Determination:**\n    *   The combination of signals—an acetate group, a methyl group on a double bond, and two distinct vinyl protons—is consistent with a propenyl acetate structure (CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃). The total proton count from the integration (3+3+1+1 = 8) matches this structure. This rules out butenyl acetate options, which would have more protons.\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n    *   The most crucial piece of information for determining the stereochemistry is the coupling constant (J value) between the two vinyl protons (at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm).\n    *   The provided data shows a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n    *   It is a well-established principle in NMR spectroscopy that the coupling constant for protons in a *trans* configuration on a double bond is typically large, in the range of 12-18 Hz.\n    *   Conversely, the coupling constant for *cis* protons is significantly smaller, usually between 6-12 Hz.\n    *   Since the observed coupling constant of 16.0 Hz falls squarely in the trans range, the double bond must have a trans geometry.\n\nTherefore, the compound is correctly identified as Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
