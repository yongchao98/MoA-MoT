    "To identify the unknown compound, we must analyze the data from each characterization technique and see which of the proposed formulas is consistent with all the observations.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR (Fourier-Transform Infrared) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration found in carboxylic acids and alcohols. The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding, which is particularly strong in carboxylic acids.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This signal is typical for ketones, aldehydes, esters, and carboxylic acids.\n    *   Another strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), suggesting the compound is an alkene.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The combination of a very broad O-H stretch and a C=O stretch strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ confirms the presence of an alkene group.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR (Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens confirms the existence of a C=C double bond within the molecule, corroborating the FTIR data. Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a key piece of evidence. This fragment is highly characteristic of the carboxyl group cation, [COOH]⁺ (mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45). While a fragment from an ether could also appear at m/z 45, the presence of strong FTIR signals for both O-H and C=O makes the carboxylic acid assignment much more likely.\n\n### Evaluating the Molecular Formulas using Degrees of Unsaturation\n\nThe degree of unsaturation (DoU) indicates the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. It can be calculated using the formula: DoU = C - (H/2) + (N/2) + 1, where C is the number of carbons, H is the number of hydrogens, and N is the number of nitrogens. For our purposes, oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation. The combined spectroscopic data indicate the presence of one C=C bond and one C=O bond, requiring a minimum DoU of 2.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 1. This is inconsistent with the presence of both a C=C and a C=O bond. Furthermore, it only has one oxygen, which contradicts the strong evidence for a carboxylic acid.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 2. This degree of unsaturation perfectly matches the required C=C and C=O bonds. The formula includes two oxygen atoms, consistent with a carboxylic acid. This formula fits all the spectral data.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 1. This is inconsistent with the evidence for two double bonds (one C=C and one C=O).\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 2. While the degree of unsaturation is correct, the formula only has one oxygen atom, which cannot form a carboxylic acid.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe spectral evidence points unambiguously to a molecule that is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The formula C₆H₁₀O₂ is the only option that contains two oxygen atoms (for the -COOH group) and has a degree of unsaturation of 2, accounting for both the alkene (C=C) and carbonyl (C=O) groups.\n\n<<<B>>>"
