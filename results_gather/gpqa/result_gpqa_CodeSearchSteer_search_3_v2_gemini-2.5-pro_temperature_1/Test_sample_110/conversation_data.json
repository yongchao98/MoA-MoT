    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition reaction. The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will deprotonate the ketone at the alpha-carbon to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate will then attack the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (an α,β-unsaturated ester).\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation**: The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. It has two alpha-carbons, C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at position 2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, the carbonyl carbon, and C3) and has no alpha-protons.\n    *   The carbon at position 6 is a tertiary carbon and has one alpha-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the base can only abstract the proton from C6 to form the enolate.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition**: The enolate formed at C6 will attack the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the carbon of ethyl acrylate that is beta to the ester group.\n\n4.  **Product Structure and Nomenclature**:\n    *   The addition of the ethyl acrylate fragment to C6 of the ketone results in a `-(CH₂CH₂COOEt)` chain being attached at this position.\n    *   To name the final product, the propanoate chain is considered the parent structure. The cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on the third carbon of the ethyl propanoate.\n    *   When naming the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent, the point of attachment (the original C6) is numbered as C1. The carbonyl carbon (original C1) becomes C2. The carbon with the ethyl and methyl groups (original C2) becomes C3.\n    *   Therefore, the substituent is named: (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   The complete name for product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a nitro-Michael addition. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the carbon alpha to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane. This carbon is acidic due to the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group. The resulting nitronate anion is a good nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The nucleophilic carbon from the 1-nitropropane anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile).\n    *   **Nucleophile**: `CH₃-CH₂-C⁻H-NO₂`\n    *   **Michael Acceptor**: `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the alpha-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the beta-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Nomenclature**:\n    *   The resulting structure is:\n        `CH₃-CH(CH(NO₂)-CH₂-CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). According to IUPAC rules, the carbon of the nitrile is C1, and we find the longest carbon chain that includes it.\n    *   The longest chain is six carbons long (hexanenitrile).\n        `⁶CH₃-⁵CH₂-⁴CH(NO₂)-³CH(CH₃)-²CH₂-¹CN`\n    *   The chain has a methyl group at position 3 and a nitro group at position 4.\n    *   Therefore, the correct IUPAC name for product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
