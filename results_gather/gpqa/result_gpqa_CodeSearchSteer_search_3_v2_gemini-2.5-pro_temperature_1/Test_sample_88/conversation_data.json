    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and its NMR spectrum.\n\n**Reaction 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240°C with an excess of potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n*   **Analysis:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a tertiary alkyl halide. Under these harsh basic and high-temperature conditions, a simple substitution to 1,3-adamantanediol is expected, followed by a rearrangement. The diol, likely protonated by trace water, can undergo a pinacol-like rearrangement. A 1,2-hydride shift from an adjacent CH₂ group to the carbocation at C-1 (formed by loss of OH) leads to a more stable secondary carbocation, which is then captured by the hydroxyl at C-3 to form a ketone. The most stable ketone on this framework is 2-adamantanone.\n*   **Product 1:** The IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a ketone in a six-membered ring, which is consistent with **2-adamantanone** (C₁₀H₁₄O). The provided NMR data in the question is unusual for 2-adamantanone and may be erroneous or belong to a different compound not relevant to the main reaction pathway; however, the chemical transformation itself strongly points to 2-adamantanone as the logical product.\n\n**Reaction 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (2-adamantanone) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, Al(O-iPr)₃.\n*   **Analysis:** This reagent is characteristic of the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which reduces ketones to alcohols. Thus, 2-adamantanone is first reduced to 2-adamantanol. The reaction is also heated, which promotes a subsequent dehydration of the alcohol. Dehydration of 2-adamantanol is known to proceed with a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement to form a more stable alkene than the one that would violate Bredt's rule. This rearrangement leads to the formation of a protoadamantane skeleton.\n*   **Product 2:** The product is **protoadamantene** (specifically, tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene), a C₁₀H₁₄ alkene isomer of adamantane.\n\n**Reaction 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (protoadamantene) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup. Ozonolysis cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. In protoadamantene, the double bond is within one of the six-membered rings. Cleaving this C=C bond opens the ring but keeps the carbon skeleton intact.\n*   **Product 3:** The ozonolysis of C₁₀-protoadamantene results in **cis-bicyclo[3.3.0]octane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde** (C₁₀H₁₄O₂). This molecule consists of two fused five-membered rings with two aldehyde groups pointing in the same direction (cis).\n\n**¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nNow we must determine the coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen atom in cis-bicyclo[3.3.0]octane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde.\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** The most deshielded protons in this molecule are the aldehyde protons (-CHO). Their chemical shift is typically in the 9-10 ppm range, far downfield from any other protons in the structure. The question excludes protons that exchange with deuterated solvent, such as -OH, but aldehyde protons do not exchange.\n\n2.  **Determine the Coupling Pattern:**\n    *   The molecule has a C₂ axis of symmetry, making the two aldehyde groups and their respective protons chemically equivalent. We only need to analyze one of them.\n    *   An aldehyde proton (H-ald) is coupled to the proton on the adjacent carbon atom to which the aldehyde group is attached. In this case, it is the proton at the C-3 position (H-3). This three-bond coupling (³J) will split the aldehyde proton's signal into a **doublet**.\n    *   However, in rigid polycyclic systems like this one, long-range coupling through sigma bonds can be significant, particularly through a \"W-shaped\" four-bond pathway (⁴J). The rigid structure of cis-bicyclo[3.3.0]octane allows for such a pathway between the aldehyde proton and two of the protons on the methylene groups at C-2 and C-4. Due to the molecule's geometry, the aldehyde proton is expected to couple with the two `endo` protons on C-2 and C-4.\n    *   Since these two `endo` protons are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry, they will split the aldehyde proton's signal into a **triplet**.\n    *   Combining these effects, the signal for the most deshielded proton (the aldehyde proton) is split into a doublet by H-3 and then each peak of the doublet is split into a triplet by the two equivalent `endo` protons.\n\nThe resulting coupling pattern is a **doublet of triplets**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
