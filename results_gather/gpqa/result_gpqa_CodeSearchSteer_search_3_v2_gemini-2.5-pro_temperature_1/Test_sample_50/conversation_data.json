    "To calculate the net potential energy of the system, we can use the method of images. This method simplifies the problem by replacing the grounded conducting sphere with an \"image charge\" that, along with the original charge, satisfies the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero.\n\n### 1. The Method of Images\n\nFor a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (where `d > R`), the sphere can be replaced by an image charge `q'` located at a distance `b` from the center, on the same line as the original charge.\n\nThe magnitude and position of the image charge are given by:\n*   Image charge: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   Position of image charge: `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe image charge is located inside the sphere.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d`. This work is done against the force exerted on `q` by the induced charges on the sphere. This force is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\nThe force on charge `q` at a distance `x` from the center is the Coulomb force between `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n*   The position of the image charge is `b = R^2/x`.\n*   The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -q * (R/x)`.\n*   The distance between `q` (at `x`) and `q'` (at `b`) is `x - b = x - R^2/x = (x^2 - R^2)/x`.\n\nThe force `F(x)` between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is:\n`F(x) = k * q * q' / (x - b)^2`\n`F(x) = k * q * [-q(R/x)] / [(x^2 - R^2)/x]^2`\n`F(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nThe potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d`. This is the negative of the work done by the electric field.\n`U = -W_field = - ∫[∞, d] F(x) dx`\n`U = - ∫[∞, d] [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n`U = k * q^2 * R * ∫[∞, d] x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, which gives `du = 2x dx`.\n`∫ [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx = (1/2) ∫ u^-2 du = -1 / (2u) = -1 / [2(x^2 - R^2)]`\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral:\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))]` from `∞` to `d`\n`U = k * q^2 * R * {[-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))] - [-1 / (2(∞^2 - R^2))]}`\nSince the term with infinity goes to zero, we are left with:\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Alternative Method (Interaction Energy)\n\nA well-established result is that the potential energy of the system is equal to half the interaction energy between the real charge and the image charge.\n\n1.  **Interaction Energy (W_int):** The potential energy between the charge `q` at distance `d` and the image charge `q'` at distance `b`.\n    *   Distance between charges = `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n    *   `W_int = k * q * q' / (d - b)`\n    *   `W_int = k * q * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    *   `W_int = -k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n2.  **System Potential Energy (U):**\n    *   `U = (1/2) * W_int`\n    *   `U = (1/2) * [-k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. Comparing this with the given options:\n\n*   A) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n*   B) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n*   C) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n*   D) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n\nThe calculated potential energy `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
