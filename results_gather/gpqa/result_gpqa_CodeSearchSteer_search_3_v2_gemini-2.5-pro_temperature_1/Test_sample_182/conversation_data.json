    "To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we first need to understand the starting material and the reaction it undergoes.\n\n**1. Reactant Structure and Molecular Formula:**\nThe starting reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down the structure:\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene:** A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and 4.\n*   **Carboxylic acid:** A -COOH group, which is the principal functional group and is located at position C1.\n*   **2-formyl:** A -CHO group is at position C2.\n*   **5-vinyl:** A -CH=CH2 group is at position C5.\n\nBased on this structure, the molecular formula is C10H12O3.\n\n**2. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Reactant:**\nThe IHD (also known as degrees of unsaturation) can be calculated from the structure. Each ring or pi (Ï€) bond contributes one degree of unsaturation.\n*   One ring: 1 IHD\n*   One C=C double bond in the cyclohexene ring: 1 IHD\n*   One C=C double bond in the vinyl group: 1 IHD\n*   One C=O double bond in the formyl group: 1 IHD\n*   One C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group: 1 IHD\nTotal IHD for the reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\n**3. The Reaction:**\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce various functional groups completely to their corresponding alkanes.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The aldehyde (formyl) group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   Carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) are also reduced to single bonds (C-C).\n\n**4. Product Structure and Molecular Formula:**\nThe reduction reaction transforms the reactant as follows:\n*   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring (C=C bond is saturated).\n*   The vinyl group (-CH=CH2) becomes an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) becomes a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) becomes a methyl group (-CH3).\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane with two methyl groups and one ethyl group. Since no carbon atoms are lost, the product will have 10 carbon atoms (C10). The parent structure is now a saturated cycloalkane. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n. Therefore, for a 10-carbon cycloalkane, the formula is C10H20.\n\n**5. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\nThe IHD for the product with the formula C10H20 is calculated as:\nIHD = C - H/2 + 1\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can analyze the structural changes. The reaction removes four pi bonds (two C=C and two C=O), which means the IHD decreases by 4.\nInitial IHD = 5\nChange in IHD = -4\nFinal IHD = 5 - 4 = 1.\n\nThe final IHD of 1 corresponds to the single ring structure of the cyclohexane backbone.\n\n<<<A>>>"
