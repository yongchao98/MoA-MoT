    "Here is a step-by-step identification of compound D:\n\n**Step 1: Identifying Compound A**\nCompound A exhibits two signals in its proton NMR spectrum: a triplet for 6 hydrogens (6H) and a quartet for 4 hydrogens (4H). This 3:2 proton ratio and splitting pattern (triplet-quartet) is a strong indicator of ethyl groups. However, the pattern described does not perfectly match a simple alkane like n-pentane. The most plausible interpretation, which aligns with the subsequent reaction steps, is that Compound A is **n-butane** (CH₃CH₂CH₂CH₃). The NMR for n-butane shows a signal for the 6 protons of the two methyl groups and a signal for the 4 protons of the two methylene groups. While the signal for the methylene (CH₂) groups is technically a more complex multiplet (a sextet), it can be simplified or misreported as a quartet in some contexts. Assuming A is n-butane allows the rest of the reaction sequence to proceed logically.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying Compound B**\nCompound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination to form Compound B. The bromination of an alkane is a free-radical substitution. In n-butane, substitution can occur at a primary carbon (C1) to form 1-bromobutane or a secondary carbon (C2) to form 2-bromobutane. The secondary free radical is more stable than the primary, so the major product of this reaction is **2-bromobutane**.\n\n**Step 3: Identifying Compound C**\nCompound B (2-bromobutane) reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH). This is a classic E2 elimination reaction, where a strong base removes a hydrogen atom and a halide from adjacent carbons to form an alkene. The elimination of HBr from 2-bromobutane can form two products: but-1-ene and but-2-ene. According to Zaitsev's rule, the more substituted alkene is the major product, which is but-2-ene. The problem states that Compound C has two geometrical isomers, which is true for but-2-ene (cis-but-2-ene and trans-but-2-ene) but not for but-1-ene. Therefore, Compound C is **but-2-ene**.\n\n**Step 4: The Diels-Alder Reaction to form Compound D**\nThe final step is a Diels-Alder reaction between the *cis-isomer* of Compound C (cis-but-2-ene) and (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol. In this [4+2] cycloaddition, the diene is the pentadienol and the dienophile is cis-but-2-ene. The reaction forms a six-membered ring with several new stereocenters.\n\nThe stereochemistry of the product is determined by the following principles of the Diels-Alder reaction:\n*   **Dienophile Stereochemistry**: Substituents that are *cis* on the dienophile's double bond will be *cis* in the final product. Here, the two methyl groups of cis-but-2-ene will be cis to each other on the newly formed ring.\n*   **Diene Stereochemistry**: For an (E,E)-diene, the two substituents on the ends (at C1 and C4) will also end up *cis* to each other in the product. In (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol, the -OH group and the -CH₃ group will be cis.\n*   **The Endo Rule**: The kinetically favored product is the *endo* adduct. This rule predicts the relative orientation of the diene's substituents versus the dienophile's substituents. For this reaction, the endo product results in the substituents from the diene (OH and CH₃) being *trans* to the substituents from the dienophile (the two CH₃ groups).\n\nCombining these rules, the final product D has the following relative stereochemistry: the -OH at C1 and the methyl group at C4 are cis to each other; the methyl groups at C5 and C6 are cis to each other; and the {C1-OH, C4-Me} pair is trans to the {C5-Me, C6-Me} pair.\n\nAssigning the absolute configuration based on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules to this specific arrangement yields the name **(1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
