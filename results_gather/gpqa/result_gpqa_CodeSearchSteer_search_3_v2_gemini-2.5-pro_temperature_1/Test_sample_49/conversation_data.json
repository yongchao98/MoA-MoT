    "To determine the number of loops in the Feynman diagram, we must analyze the structure of the mathematical expression provided. In quantum field theory, the calculation of a Feynman diagram with a specific number of loops results in an expression with characteristic factors.\n\nThe colleague's note reads: `alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`.\n\nThe key to solving this puzzle lies in the term `1/(4pi)^6`. In calculations within four-dimensional spacetime, each loop in a Feynman diagram typically introduces a factor of `1/(4π)^2` (which is equal to `1/(16π^2)`) into the final expression for the amplitude. This factor arises from the integration over the four-dimensional loop momentum.\n\nWe can express the term from the note as a power of this characteristic loop factor:\n\n`1/(4pi)^6 = (1/(4pi)^2)^3`\n\nBy comparing this to the general form for an L-loop diagram, which is proportional to `(1/(4π)^2)^L`, we can identify `L`, the number of loops. In this case, `L` is clearly 3.\n\nThe other terms in the expression are consistent with this conclusion:\n*   `alpha^3` and `g^2` are powers of the theory's coupling constants, indicating the number and type of vertices in the diagram.\n*   `(Q/M)^2` represents a ratio of energy scales (external momentum to a particle mass), which is typical for the result of a loop integral evaluation.\n*   The numerical factors `sqrt(2)` and `8` arise from symmetry factors of the diagram and the specifics of the calculation.\n\nHowever, the most direct indicator of the number of loops is the power of the `1/(4π)` factor. Therefore, the diagram that was obscured by the coffee spill contained 3 loops.\n\n<<<D>>>"
