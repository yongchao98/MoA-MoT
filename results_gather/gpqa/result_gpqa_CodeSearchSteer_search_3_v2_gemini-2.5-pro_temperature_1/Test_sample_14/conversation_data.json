    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Define Transit Probability:** The geometric probability of a planet transiting its star, assuming a circular orbit, is the ratio of the star's radius (`R_star`) to the planet's semi-major axis (`a`).\n    *   `p_transit = R_star / a`\n\n2.  **Formulate Probabilities for Both Planets:** We can write the transit probability for Planet_1 (`p_1`) and Planet_2 (`p_2`) as:\n    *   `p_1 = R_s1 / a_1`\n    *   `p_2 = R_s2 / a_2`\n    Where `R_s1` and `R_s2` are the radii of the host stars, and `a_1` and `a_2` are the semi-major axes of the planets.\n\n3.  **Find the Ratio of Probabilities:** To compare the two probabilities, we can find their ratio:\n    *   `p_1 / p_2 = (R_s1 / a_1) / (R_s2 / a_2)`\n    The problem states that both host stars have the same radii, so `R_s1 = R_s2`. This simplifies the equation to:\n    *   `p_1 / p_2 = a_2 / a_1`\n\n4.  **Use Kepler's Third Law:** To find the ratio of the semi-major axes, we use Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion. The law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`a`) and inversely proportional to the mass of its host star (`M_star`).\n    *   `P² ∝ a³ / M_star`\n    Rearranging to solve for the semi-major axis (`a`), we get:\n    *   `a ∝ (M_star * P²)^(1/3)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Now we can express the ratio `a_2 / a_1` in terms of the stellar masses and orbital periods:\n    *   `a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * P_2²) / (M_s1 * P_1²) ]^(1/3)`\n\n6.  **Substitute the Given Values:** The problem provides the following relationships:\n    *   The mass of Planet_1's host star is twice that of Planet_2's: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`\n    *   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's: `P_1 = P_2 / 3`\n    Substituting these into the equation:\n    *   `a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * P_2²) / ( (2 * M_s2) * (P_2 / 3)² ) ]^(1/3)`\n    *   `a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * P_2²) / ( 2 * M_s2 * P_2² / 9 ) ]^(1/3)`\n\n7.  **Simplify the Expression:** The terms `M_s2` and `P_2²` cancel out:\n    *   `a_2 / a_1 = [ 1 / (2 / 9) ]^(1/3)`\n    *   `a_2 / a_1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n    *   `a_2 / a_1 = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:** Calculating the cube root of 4.5 gives:\n    *   `a_2 / a_1 ≈ 1.65096`\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** Since `p_1 / p_2 = a_2 / a_1`, the transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
