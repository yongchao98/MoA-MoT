    "To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we can use the principles of the radial velocity (RV) method for exoplanet detection.\n\n### Analysis of the Radial Velocity Method\n\nThe radial velocity method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. This shift is caused by the star's \"wobble\" as it is gravitationally pulled by the orbiting planet. The magnitude of this wobble, known as the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K), is directly proportional to the observed periodic shift in the spectral line's wavelength (Δλ).\n\nThe formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) in the case of a circular orbit is:\n\nK = ( (2πG) / P )^(1/3) * (m_p) / (M_star^(2/3))\n\nWhere:\n*   **P** is the orbital period of the planet.\n*   **m_p** is the mass of the planet.\n*   **M_star** is the mass of the host star.\n*   **G** is the gravitational constant.\n\n### Applying the Formula to the Given Data\n\nWe are given the following information:\n*   The host stars have identical masses (M₁ = M₂).\n*   The planets have similar masses (m_p1 ≈ m_p2).\n*   The orbits are circular.\n*   The wavelength shift for planet #1 (Δλ₁) is 5 miliangstroms.\n*   The wavelength shift for planet #2 (Δλ₂) is 7 miliangstroms.\n\nSince the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is proportional to the wavelength shift (Δλ), we can establish a ratio of the semi-amplitudes for the two systems:\n\nK₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\nNow, let's look at the ratio of the semi-amplitudes using the formula. Since m_p and M_star are the same for both systems, they cancel out, leaving a direct relationship between K and the orbital period P:\n\nK ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is:\n\nK₂ / K₁ = (P₂)^(-1/3) / (P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n### Calculation\n\nWe can now substitute the known ratio of K₂/K₁ into the equation:\n\n1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nTo solve for the ratio of the periods, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n\n(1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 (P₂ / P₁). To find this, we take the reciprocal:\n\nP₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis result indicates that the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This makes physical sense, as a larger stellar wobble (and thus a larger wavelength shift) is caused by a planet that is closer to its star and therefore has a shorter orbital period.\n\nBased on the calculation, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
