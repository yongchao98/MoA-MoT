    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Material**\n\nFirst, we must determine the structure of the initial compound, C8H9NO, from its 1H-NMR data.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The signals at 6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H) are characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring.\n*   **Amine Group:** The broad singlet at 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H) indicates a primary amino group (-NH2) attached to the aromatic ring.\n*   **Aldehyde Group:** The signal far downfield at 9.72 ppm (t, 1H) is a classic aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet multiplicity means it is adjacent to a -CH2- group.\n*   **Alkyl Chain:** The signal at 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) corresponds to a -CH2- group. The doublet multiplicity confirms it is adjacent to the single aldehyde proton.\n\nCombining these fragments, the starting material is **2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl:** This set of reagents is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH2) on the benzene ring is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n*   **Step 2: H2O:** Adding water and typically warming the solution causes the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt. The -N2+ group is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, yielding **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves reacting the product from step 2, an aldehyde with α-hydrogens, with a strong base (KOH) and heat. These are the conditions for an aldol condensation reaction. In this reaction, two molecules of the aldehyde react with each other.\n    *   **Addition:** First, an aldol addition occurs, where one molecule acts as a nucleophile (after being deprotonated by KOH) and attacks the carbonyl carbon of the second molecule. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde intermediate, which is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option C).\n    *   **Condensation (Dehydration):** Because heat is applied, this intermediate readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). This elimination step is favored as it creates a stable, conjugated system. The final product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The dehydration of the intermediate yields **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe presence of heat in the final step drives the reaction to completion, favoring the formation of the more stable dehydrated condensation product over the simple addition product. Therefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<D>>>"
