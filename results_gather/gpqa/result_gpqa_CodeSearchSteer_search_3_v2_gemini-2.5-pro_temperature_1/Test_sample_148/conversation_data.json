    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the observations to arrive at the most likely explanation:\n\n1.  **Analyze the LC-MS Data**: The liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) results show two distinct peaks that have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected product.\n    *   The fact that both peaks have the same mass indicates they are isomers (molecules with the same chemical formula but different structures). This effectively rules out contamination with a precursor (Option A), as a precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular weight.\n    *   The two peaks are clearly separated by the liquid chromatography (LC) column. Standard (achiral) LC columns can separate molecules with different physical properties like polarity and shape. However, they cannot distinguish between enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images and have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. To separate enantiomers, a special chiral column or chiral additive is required. Since the problem doesn't specify a chiral setup, we assume a standard achiral column is used.\n    *   Diastereomers, on the other hand, are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical properties and can be separated by standard achiral chromatography.\n    *   Therefore, the LC-MS data strongly suggest the crude compound is a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Â¹H NMR Data**: The proton NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton, with roughly equal integrals.\n    *   The alpha-proton is a proton attached to the alpha-carbon of an amino acid. The presence of two peaks for what should be a single proton means this proton exists in two slightly different chemical environments.\n    *   Like with LC, in a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable and produce identical NMR spectra; you would only see one peak.\n    *   Diastereomers, being chemically distinct, will have different NMR spectra. It is very common for corresponding protons in a pair of diastereomers to have slightly different chemical shifts, resulting in separate peaks. The observation of two peaks for the alpha-proton is therefore consistent with the presence of diastereomers.\n    *   The roughly equal integrals of the two peaks indicate that the two diastereomers are present in an approximately 1:1 ratio.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options Based on Synthesis Context**: The compound is a chemically synthesized peptide.\n    *   **A) Precursor Contamination**: Ruled out by identical mass spectra.\n    *   **B) Mixture of Enantiomers**: Ruled out as they would not be resolved by standard LC or give different signals in a standard NMR spectrum.\n    *   **C) Mixture of Diastereoisomers**: This fits all observations. A common side reaction in chemical peptide synthesis is racemization (or epimerization) at the alpha-carbon of an amino acid during the coupling step. For instance, if an L-amino acid is being coupled to a growing peptide chain composed of L-amino acids, some of the activated amino acid might convert to the D-form before coupling. This results in a mixture of the desired all-L peptide and a diastereomeric L...D...L peptide. This would create two distinct molecules (diastereomers) with the same mass, which would be separable by LC and give distinct NMR signals, often in a roughly 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **D) 'Double Coupling'**: This side reaction involves the addition of two amino acid residues instead of one. The resulting product would have a higher mass than the expected molecule, which contradicts the LC-MS data showing both peaks have the same, expected mass.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe combined NMR and LC-MS evidence points conclusively to the presence of two isomers. The fact that these isomers are separable by standard LC and distinguishable by NMR rules out their being enantiomers. Therefore, they must be diastereomers, likely formed by racemization of one of the amino acid chiral centers during synthesis.\n\n<<<C>>>"
