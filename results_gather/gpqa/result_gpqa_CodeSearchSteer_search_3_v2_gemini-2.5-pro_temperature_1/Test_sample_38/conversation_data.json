    "To find the numerical value of \"a\", we must use the normalization condition of the wave function. The Born rule states that the square of the modulus of the wave function, |Ψ(x)|², represents the probability density of finding the particle at a certain position x. The total probability of finding the particle in the region where it can exist must be 1 (or 100%). This is expressed mathematically as:\n\n∫ |Ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\nThe integration is performed over the entire space where the particle can be found. According to the problem, particles were only found between x=1 and x=3.\n\nThe steps are as follows:\n\n1.  **Define the wave function:**\n    Ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\n2.  **Calculate the probability density |Ψ(x)|²:**\n    The probability density is the product of the wave function and its complex conjugate (Ψ*).\n    Ψ*(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i\n\n    |Ψ(x)|² = Ψ*(x) * Ψ(x) = [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i ] * [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i ]\n    This simplifies to:\n    |Ψ(x)|² = ( a² / (1 + x) ) - (0.5*i)² = ( a² / (1 + x) ) - 0.25*i²\n    Since i² = -1:\n    |Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n3.  **Set up and solve the normalization integral:**\n    We integrate the probability density from x=1 to x=3 and set the result to 1.\n    ∫[from 1 to 3] ( a² / (1 + x) + 0.25 ) dx = 1\n\n    We can split the integral:\n    a² ∫[from 1 to 3] (1 / (1 + x)) dx + ∫[from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = 1\n\n    The first integral evaluates to a² [ln(1 + x)] from 1 to 3.\n    The second integral evaluates to [0.25x] from 1 to 3.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the definite integral:**\n    [ a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25x ] from 1 to 3 = 1\n    ( a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3 ) - ( a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1 ) = 1\n    ( a² * ln(4) + 0.75 ) - ( a² * ln(2) + 0.25 ) = 1\n    a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5 = 1\n\n5.  **Solve for \"a\":**\n    Using the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\n    a² * ln(4/2) + 0.5 = 1\n    a² * ln(2) = 0.5\n    a² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\n    Using the value ln(2) ≈ 0.6931:\n    a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931\n    a² ≈ 0.7214\n    a = sqrt(0.7214)\n    a ≈ 0.8493\n\nThis value is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<D>>>"
