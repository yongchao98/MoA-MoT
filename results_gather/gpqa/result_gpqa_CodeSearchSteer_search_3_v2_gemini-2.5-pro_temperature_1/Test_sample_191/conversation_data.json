    "This problem deals with the concept of electrostatic shielding by a conductor.\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** The positive charge +q placed inside the cavity attracts free electrons from the conductor. A total charge of -q accumulates on the inner surface of the cavity to neutralize the field of +q within the conductor's bulk.\n2.  **Charge on Outer Surface:** Since the conductor was initially uncharged, and a charge of -q has moved to the inner surface, a charge of +q must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality.\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** The conductor isolates the region outside from the region inside the cavity. The electric field outside the conductor is produced only by the charges on its outer surface. The arrangement of the charge inside the cavity and the induced charge on the inner wall does not affect the electric field outside the conductor.\n4.  **Symmetry and Gauss's Law:** Because the outer surface is a sphere, the induced charge +q distributes itself uniformly over this outer surface. This happens regardless of the off-center position of the charge +q inside the cavity. According to the shell theorem (a result of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to that of a point charge of the same total magnitude located at its center.\n5.  **Calculating the Field:** The point P is at a distance L from the center of the spherical conductor. The total charge on the outer surface is +q. Therefore, the electric field at P is the same as that of a point charge +q located at the conductor's center. The magnitude of this field is given by Coulomb's law:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n    The parameters related to the cavity's position and size (r, s, l, Î¸) are irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor due to shielding.\n\nTherefore, the correct expression for the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
