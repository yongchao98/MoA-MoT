    "Here is a step-by-by-step derivation of the final answer.\n\n### 1. Identify the Goal\nThe objective is to calculate the mean decay distance (L) of a meson resonance X, given its production energy (E_X), mass (m_X), and decay width (Γ_X).\n\n### 2. Recall the Relevant Formulas\n*   The mean decay distance (L) of a particle is its velocity (v) multiplied by its lifetime in the lab frame (τ_lab).\n    *   L = v * τ_lab\n*   The lifetime in the lab frame is related to the proper lifetime (τ, the lifetime in the particle's rest frame) by the Lorentz factor (γ) due to time dilation.\n    *   τ_lab = γ * τ\n*   The proper lifetime (τ) is related to the decay width (Γ) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.\n    *   τ = ħ / Γ (where ħ is the reduced Planck constant).\n*   The Lorentz factor (γ) is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy (m).\n    *   γ = E / m\n*   The velocity (v) is related to the Lorentz factor (γ) and the speed of light (c) by β = v/c = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²).\n*   Combining these, the decay length formula is L = v * γ * τ = (βc) * γ * (ħ/Γ). This can also be expressed as L = (p/m) * cτ, where p is the particle's momentum.\n\n### 3. List the Given Values and Constants\n*   Production Energy (E_X): 8 GeV = 8000 MeV\n*   Mass (m_X): 1.2 GeV = 1200 MeV\n*   Width (Γ_X): 320 MeV\n*   Reduced Planck Constant times speed of light (ħc): A convenient value in these units is approximately 197.3 MeV·fm (where 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m).\n\n### 4. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**a. Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\nThis factor describes how relativistic the particle is.\nγ = E_X / m_X = 8000 MeV / 1200 MeV = 20 / 3 ≈ 6.67\n\n**b. Calculate the particle's momentum (p):**\nWe can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². In particle physics units where c=1, this is E² = p² + m².\np = sqrt(E_X² - m_X²) = sqrt(8000² - 1200²) MeV\np = sqrt(64,000,000 - 1,440,000) MeV\np = sqrt(62,560,000) MeV ≈ 7909.5 MeV\n\n**c. Calculate the mean decay distance (L):**\nA direct way to calculate the decay length is using the formula:\nL = (p / m_X) * (ħc / Γ_X)\n\nNow, plug in the values:\n*   p ≈ 7909.5 MeV\n*   m_X = 1200 MeV\n*   ħc ≈ 197.3 MeV·fm\n*   Γ_X = 320 MeV\n\nL = (7909.5 MeV / 1200 MeV) * (197.3 MeV·fm / 320 MeV)\nL ≈ 6.591 * (0.6166) fm\nL ≈ 4.064 fm\n\n**d. Convert to meters:**\nSince 1 fm (femtometer) is equal to 10⁻¹⁵ meters:\nL ≈ 4.064 x 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\n### 5. Compare with the Options\nThe calculated value L ≈ 4.064 x 10⁻¹⁵ m is extremely close to option B.\n\nA) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁶ m\nB) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\nC) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\nD) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁶ m\n\nThe minor difference between the calculated 4.064 and the option's 4.0655 is due to the precise values of constants used. The calculation robustly points to option B as the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
