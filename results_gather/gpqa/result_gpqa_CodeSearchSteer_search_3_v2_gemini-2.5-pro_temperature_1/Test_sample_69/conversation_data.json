    "This is a classic chemical puzzle that can be solved by systematically evaluating the reaction clues.\n\n**Analysis of the Reactions**\n\n1.  **Reaction 3: C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)**\n    This is the most chemically descriptive clue. The hydrolysis of a substance (C) to regenerate a starting material (A) while also producing two different acids is characteristic of the hydrolysis of a compound containing a pseudohalogen. A prime candidate for gas B, whose components form the ligands in C, is **Cyanogen Chloride (B = CNCl)**. Its hydrolysis produces a strong acid and a weak acid.\n    *   **F = Hydrochloric acid (HCl)**, a strong acid.\n    *   **G = Cyanic acid (HCNO)**, a weak acid.\n    This reaction reforms the solid A, which must be the central element of the complex C.\n\n2.  **Reaction 2: C + 2 equivalents of gas D → E (extremely hazardous product)**\n    Since C is a complex containing cyanide groups from the CNCl ligand, a plausible hazardous product (E) resulting from a reaction on C would be **Cyanogen gas (E = (CN)₂) **. Cyanogen is an extremely hazardous and toxic gas. This reaction would involve the stripping of element A and the chlorine atoms from the complex C, allowing the cyanide groups to dimerize.\n\n3.  **Reaction 4: D (gas) + B (gas) → H (solvent, 1:1 ratio)**\n    With B identified as CNCl, the reaction is **D + CNCl → H**. While not a common laboratory reaction, a known 1:1 addition reaction occurs between cyanogen chloride and sulfur trioxide (SO₃) to form chlorosulfonyl isocyanate (ClSO₂NCO), a liquid that can be used as a solvent. This identifies:\n    *   **D = SO₃** (Sulfur trioxide)\n    *   **H = ClSO₂NCO** (Chlorosulfonyl isocyanate)\n\n4.  **Reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 equivalents of gas B → C (bright red product)**\n    We have deduced that B is CNCl. The reaction is **A(s) + 8 CNCl(g) → C (bright red)**. While the exact identities of A and C are not required to determine the symmetry of E, this describes the formation of a bright red complex (C) from a solid element (A) with eight equivalents of the gaseous ligand.\n\n**Determining the Molecular Symmetry of E**\n\nBased on the analysis, the extremely hazardous product E is Cyanogen, (CN)₂.\n*   The chemical formula is **N≡C−C≡N**.\n*   The molecule is linear and symmetric, with a center of inversion located at the midpoint of the C-C bond.\n*   A linear molecule with a center of inversion belongs to the **D∞h** point group.\n\nOther possibilities can be ruled out:\n*   **D4h**: This describes a square planar geometry, such as in Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄).\n*   **C2v**: This describes a bent, planar molecule like water or Phosgene (COCl₂).\n*   **C2**: This describes a chiral molecule with a single two-fold rotation axis, such as hydrogen peroxide.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E is D∞h.\n\n<<<D>>>"
