    "The search results confirm the underlying physics principles.\n\n1.  **Spectroscopic Binaries and Mass:** For a spectroscopic binary, measuring the radial velocities of both stars (a double-lined spectroscopic binary) and the orbital period allows for the determination of the masses of the stars.\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** The total mass of a binary system is related to the orbital period (P) and the separation distance (a) by Kepler's Third Law: M1 + M2 ∝ a³/P².\n3.  **Relating Velocity to Separation:** The separation distance 'a' can be related to the observed velocities. For circular orbits, the circumference (2πa) is equal to the velocity multiplied by the period (v*P). Therefore, `a` is proportional to `v*P`.\n4.  **Total Mass Formula:** Combining these, the total mass `M_total = M1 + M2` is proportional to `(v*P)³ / P²`, which simplifies to `M_total ∝ v³ * P`. Here, `v` is the sum of the orbital speeds of the two stars (`v1 + v2`).\n5.  **Radial Velocity:** We don't observe the true orbital velocity `v`, but the radial component `vr = v * sin(i)`, where `i` is the inclination of the orbit. The peak radial velocity is denoted as `K`. So, `v` is proportional to `K / sin(i)`.\n6.  **Eclipsing Systems:** The problem states that both systems are eclipsing. This is crucial because it means the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90 degrees, which makes `sin(i)` approximately equal to 1. This removes the `sin(i)` uncertainty from the calculation.\n7.  **Final Proportionality:** Therefore, the total mass `M_total` is proportional to `(K_total)³ * P`, where `K_total = K1 + K2` is the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes.\n\nThis confirms that the formula I used, `M_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³`, is correct for this problem.\n\nNow, I will re-verify the calculation.\n\n**System 1:**\n*   P1 = 2 years\n*   K1_total = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**System 2:**\n*   P2 = 1 year\n*   K2_total = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n**Mass Ratio (M1 / M2):**\n`M1 / M2 = (P1 * (K1_total)³) / (P2 * (K2_total)³)`\n`M1 / M2 = (2 * (15)³) / (1 * (25)³)`\n`M1 / M2 = (2 * 3375) / (15625)`\n`M1 / M2 = 6750 / 15625`\n`M1 / M2 = 0.432`\n\nThe result of the calculation is robust. 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct answer.\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the total mass of each binary star system and then find the ratio. The total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) of a double-lined spectroscopic and eclipsing binary system can be found using the orbital period (P) and the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1 and K2).\n\nFor a binary system with circular orbits, the total mass is given by the formula:\n\nM_total = [P / (2πG * sin³(i))] * (K1 + K2)³\n\nWhere:\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n*   i is the inclination of the orbital plane to the line of sight.\n*   K1 and K2 are the amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n\nSince both systems are described as eclipsing, we can assume the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°, which means sin(i) ≈ 1. As we are calculating a ratio of the masses of the two systems, the constant term `1 / (2πG)` will cancel out.\n\nTherefore, the total mass of each system is directly proportional to its period multiplied by the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes:\n\nM_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³\n\nNow, we can calculate this value for each system.\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Period (P1) = 2 years\n*   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K_total_1) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n*   M1 ∝ 2 * (15)³ = 2 * 3375 = 6750\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Period (P2) = 1 year\n*   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K_total_2) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n*   M2 ∝ 1 * (25)³ = 1 * 15625 = 15625\n\nFinally, to find by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we calculate the ratio M1 / M2:\n\nRatio = M1 / M2 = 6750 / 15625\n\nRatio = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
