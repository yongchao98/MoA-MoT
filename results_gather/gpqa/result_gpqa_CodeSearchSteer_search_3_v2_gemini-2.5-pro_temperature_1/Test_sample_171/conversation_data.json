    "To determine the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the two stars, we must use the Boltzmann equation, which describes the relative populations of atomic energy levels in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\nThe Boltzmann equation is given by:\n\n(N₂ / N₁) = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   N₂/N₁ is the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state (N₂) to the number of atoms in the ground state (N₁).\n*   g₂/g₁ is the ratio of the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the two energy levels.\n*   ΔE is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nLet's denote the ratio of excited atoms for star 1 and star 2 as (N₂/N₁)₁ and (N₂/N₁)₂, respectively. Their temperatures are T₁ and T₂.\n\nFrom the problem statement:\n1.  The atoms in star 1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star 2. This means the ratio of populations in the excited state to the ground state for star 1 is double that of star 2.\n    (N₂ / N₁)₁ = 2 * (N₂ / N₁)₂\n\n2.  The energy difference, ΔE, is approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J.\n\n3.  The Boltzmann constant, k, has a value of approximately 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n\nNow, we can write the Boltzmann equation for each star:\n*   For Star 1: (N₂/N₁)₁ = (g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)]\n*   For Star 2: (N₂/N₁)₂ = (g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)]\n\nSubstitute these into the relationship from the problem statement:\n(g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)] = 2 * (g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)]\n\nThe term for the statistical weights (g₂/g₁) is the same for both stars as it concerns the same energy levels of the same atom (iron), so it cancels out:\nexp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)]\n\nTo solve for the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\nln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)])\n-ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T₂)\n\nRearranging the terms to isolate ln(2):\nΔE / (k * T₂) - ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2)\n\nFactor out the constant term (ΔE / k):\n(ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) = ln(2)\n\nCombine the fractions within the parentheses:\n(ΔE / k) * [(T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂)] = ln(2)\n\nCrucially, the problem provides that ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J, and we know that k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K. Therefore, the ratio ΔE / k is approximately 1 K.\n\nSubstituting ΔE / k ≈ 1 into the equation gives:\n1 * [(T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂)] = ln(2)\n\nThis simplifies to the final relationship:\nln(2) = (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂)\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
