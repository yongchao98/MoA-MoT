    "Based on the comprehensive analysis of the provided spectral data, the unidentified white solid is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Here is a detailed breakdown of how the data supports this conclusion:\n\n### **1. Mass Spectrometry Analysis**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 corresponds to the molecular weight of the compound. The molecular formula for 4-chlorobenzoic acid is C₇H₅ClO₂, and its molecular weight is approximately 156.57 g/mol. This is consistent with the observed molecular ion peak.\n*   **Isotopic Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158, with an abundance of about one-third of the M+ peak (32%), is a definitive indicator of the presence of a single chlorine atom. Chlorine has two stable isotopes, ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl, with natural abundances of approximately 75.8% and 24.2%, respectively. This leads to a characteristic M:(M+2) peak ratio of roughly 3:1 for chlorinated compounds.\n\n### **2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This very broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak is indicative of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. Its position is consistent with a carbonyl group in a conjugated aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n### **3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** The singlet appearing far downfield is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). Its high chemical shift is due to the strong deshielding effect of the adjacent carbonyl group.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggests a *para* (1,4) substituted benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split into two equivalent sets. The set closer to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group is more deshielded and thus appears further downfield (8.02 ppm). The set closer to the chlorine atom appears slightly more upfield (7.72 ppm). Literature data for 4-chlorobenzoic acid confirms similar chemical shifts for these protons.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAll three spectroscopic methods provide complementary evidence that points unequivocally to 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The other options are inconsistent with the provided data:\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** Would have a more complex NMR splitting pattern in the aromatic region.\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Would not show a carboxylic acid proton at 11.0 ppm in the NMR spectrum, and the IR O-H stretch would differ.\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** Lacks the carboxylic acid group and therefore would not show the characteristic broad O-H stretch in the IR or the -COOH proton in the NMR.\n\n<<<B>>>"
