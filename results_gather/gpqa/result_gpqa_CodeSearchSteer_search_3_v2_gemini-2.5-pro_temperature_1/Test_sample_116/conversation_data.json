    "**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\nThis molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Due to the bulky nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl dicarboxylate (-COOCH3) groups at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'), free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is hindered. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, makes the molecule chiral as its mirror images are non-superimposable. Such compounds can be resolved into optically active enantiomers. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\nAlso known as methyl lactate, this molecule has a central carbon atom (at position 2) bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom bonded to four different substituents is a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are optically active (unless they are part of a racemic mixture). This compound exists as two distinct enantiomers, (R)-methyl lactate and (S)-methyl lactate. Thus, it shows optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone:**\nBenzophenone's structure consists of a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings. The molecule possesses elements of symmetry, including a plane of symmetry. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral and therefore cannot be optically active. While certain complex derivatives of benzophenone can be made chiral, benzophenone itself is achiral.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate:**\nThis molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule has a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, which makes it achiral. Geometric isomerism (*cis*/*trans*) is present, but it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nCompounds that exhibit optical isomerism are dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2).\n\n<<<B>>>"
