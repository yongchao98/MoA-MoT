    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical transformations to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the diene and Diels-Alder reaction**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene and 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with sodium iodide (NaI).\n*   **Diene formation:** The reaction of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with sodium iodide is a reductive debromination. Each `-CHBr2` group is converted into a `=CH2` group. This transforms the starting material into **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**. This is a reactive diene.\n*   **Diels-Alder reaction:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene has two double bonds and acts as a dienophile. Since two equivalents of the diene precursor are used, two separate Diels-Alder reactions occur, one at each double bond of the norbornadiene skeleton. This forms a large, polycyclic adduct, which is **Product 1**.\n\n**Step 2: Deprotection of the tert-butyl ether**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Transformation:** Strong acid cleaves the tert-butyl ether. The 7-(tert-butoxy) group is converted into a 7-hydroxy (-OH) group. The resulting alcohol is **Product 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Oxidation of the alcohol**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃·pyridine complex in DMSO).\n*   **Transformation:** This is a mild oxidation that converts the secondary alcohol at the C7 position into a ketone (C=O). The resulting ketone is **Product 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Thermal decomposition (pyrolysis)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is heated to 150°C.\n*   **Transformation:** The high temperature induces a retro-Diels-Alder reaction. This reaction is the reverse of the initial cycloaddition and is favored at high temperatures because it increases entropy and releases the strain in the polycyclic system. The fragmentation of Product 3 yields two molecules of the diene (5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene) and one molecule of bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one.\n*   **Further fragmentation:** Bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one is unstable and readily undergoes a cheletropic extrusion of carbon monoxide (CO) upon heating to form benzene.\n*   **Final Products:** The overall pyrolysis of Product 3 results in three substances: benzene, carbon monoxide, and two molecules of 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on **final product 4**. We have two organic products: benzene and the diene.\n\n**Analysis of the final products:**\n\n1.  **Benzene (C₆H₆):** Due to its high D₆h symmetry, all six hydrogen atoms in benzene are chemically equivalent. It would show only **one** signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum. This is not among the options.\n2.  **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene (C₈H₈):** This molecule is one of the final products. We need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogens it has.\n    *   **Structure:** It consists of a six-membered ring with conjugated double bonds at C1-C2, C3-C4, and two exocyclic double bonds at C5 and C6. The formula is C₈H₈.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The conjugated system favors a planar geometry, which would give the molecule C₂ᵥ symmetry. Even if the ring adopts a non-planar half-chair conformation, it is expected to retain a C₂ axis of symmetry.\n    *   **Hydrogen Environments:** Due to this symmetry, the hydrogen atoms can be grouped into equivalent sets:\n        *   The two protons on the C1 and C4 positions of the ring are equivalent.\n        *   The two protons on the C2 and C3 positions of the ring are equivalent.\n        *   The four protons of the two exocyclic methylene (=CH₂) groups are of two types. The two protons \"outside\" the ring are equivalent to each other, and the two protons \"inside\" the ring are equivalent to each other. They are chemically distinct from one another.\n    *   **Counting the distinct sets:**\n        1.  {H at C1, H at C4}\n        2.  {H at C2, H at C3}\n        3.  {2 \"outer\" methylene protons}\n        4.  {2 \"inner\" methylene protons}\n    *   This gives a total of **4** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSince benzene gives 1 signal (not an option) and 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene gives 4 signals (which is an option), \"product 4\" must refer to this diene. Therefore, there are 4 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
