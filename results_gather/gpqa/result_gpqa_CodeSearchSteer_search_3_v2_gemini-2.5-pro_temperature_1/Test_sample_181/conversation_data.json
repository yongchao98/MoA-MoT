    "The Mott-Gurney law is built on a specific set of assumptions about the semiconductor device and the nature of current flow. A thorough analysis of these assumptions reveals the correct conditions for its validity.\n\n*   **Single-Carrier Device:** The model assumes that only one type of charge carrier, either electrons or holes, is mobile and contributes to the current. The presence of a second carrier type would introduce recombination, which is not accounted for in the basic equation.\n*   **Trap-Free:** The derivation assumes an ideal semiconductor with no trap states within the bandgap. If traps were present, they would capture injected carriers and alter the current-voltage relationship, requiring a modified model (like the Mark-Helfrich equation).\n*   **No Injection Barrier (Ohmic Contact):** For a space-charge region to form, the contact must be capable of injecting more carriers than the bulk of the semiconductor can transport. This requires an Ohmic contact, which has no energy barrier to carrier injection. A Schottky contact, which has an injection barrier, would limit the current in a different way and is not suitable for the Mott-Gurney model.\n*   **Drift-Dominated Current (Negligible Diffusion):** The model assumes that the applied electric field is large enough that the current is dominated by the drift of carriers. The contribution from diffusion current, which arises from carrier concentration gradients, is considered negligible.\n\nReviewing the options based on these points:\nA) This is incorrect because the law applies to single-carrier, not two-carrier, devices.\nB) This is incorrect because SCLC is a drift-dominated current; stating that drift current is negligible is a direct contradiction.\nC) This is incorrect because a Schottky contact creates an injection barrier, violating a key assumption.\nD) This statement accurately combines all the necessary conditions: a trap-free material, a single dominant carrier type, a contact with no injection barrier to allow for high injection, and a negligible diffusion current component.\n\n<<<D>>>"
