    "Here is a breakdown of the options to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This describes a planet with a density essentially identical to Earth's. The average density of Earth is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly given as about 5.5 g/cm³, which is very close to Earth's density.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** For a planet with the same composition as Earth, but less mass, the gravitational compression on its materials would be lower. This results in a lower overall density compared to Earth.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** A rocky planet that is more massive than Earth, but made of the same materials, will experience stronger gravitational forces. This increased gravity compresses the planet's material more, leading to a higher density. Scientific models show that for rocky planets with Earth-like composition, the density increases with mass. For instance, a rocky planet with five times the mass of Earth would be significantly denser than Earth due to this compression.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the options, the planet that is five times more massive than Earth but with the same composition will be the most compressed by its own gravity, resulting in the highest density.\n\n<<<D>>>"
