    "To find the kinetic energy (KE) of the product particles in the decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν), we apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nThe decay process is:\nπ⁺ → μ⁺ + ν\n\nGiven:\n*   Rest mass of π⁺ (m_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of μ⁺ (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The π⁺ is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero.\n*   The muon neutrino (ν) is considered to have negligible mass.\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy:**\nThe initial energy is the rest energy of the stationary pion:\nE_initial = m_π * c² = 139.6 MeV\n\nThe final energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino:\nE_final = E_μ + E_ν\nE_μ = KE_μ + m_μ*c² (Total energy of the muon)\nE_ν = KE_ν (Total energy of the massless neutrino is its kinetic energy)\n\nTherefore:\n139.6 MeV = (KE_μ + 105.7 MeV) + KE_ν\nKE_μ + KE_ν = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum:**\nSince the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. To conserve momentum, the muon and neutrino must be emitted in opposite directions with equal magnitude of momentum (p).\np_μ = p_ν = p\n\n**3. Calculation:**\nFor the massless neutrino, its energy is related to its momentum by E_ν = p*c. Therefore, the neutrino's kinetic energy is KE_ν = p*c.\n\nThe momentum can be calculated using the following relativistic formula derived from the conservation laws:\np*c = [ (m_π*c²)² - (m_μ*c²)² ] / [ 2 * (m_π*c²) ]\np*c = [ (139.6)² - (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]\np*c = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]\np*c = 8315.67 / 279.2\np*c ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\nSo, the kinetic energy of the neutrino is:\n**KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV**\n\nNow, we can find the kinetic energy of the muon. The total energy of the muon is given by:\nE_μ = √( (p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)² )\nE_μ = √( (29.8)² + (105.7)² )\nE_μ = √( 888.04 + 11172.49 )\nE_μ = √( 12060.53 )\nE_μ ≈ 109.8 MeV\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest mass energy:\nKE_μ = E_μ - m_μ*c²\nKE_μ = 109.8 MeV - 105.7 MeV\n**KE_μ ≈ 4.1 MeV**\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies for the muon (μ⁺) and the neutrino (ν) are approximately 4.1 MeV and 29.8 MeV, respectively. This corresponds to the values in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
