    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n### 1. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is the temperature it would have if it were a perfect blackbody heated only by its star. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_eff_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_eff_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n*   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 (T_eq1) and Planet2 (T_eq2), we can set up the following equation:\n\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [T_eff_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_eff_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\nGiven that both planets orbit the same star, `T_eff_star` and `R_star` are constant. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n\n**(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)**\n\nThis shows that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n### 2. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity\n\nThe problem provides the Doppler shifts caused by each planet, which allows us to determine the star's radial velocity (RV) amplitude, K. The RV amplitude is related to the planet's mass (M_p), the star's mass (M_star), and the semi-major axis (a). For a circular orbit, this relationship is:\n\nK = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nWhere `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n\na = (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n### 3. Calculating the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes\n\nNow we can find the ratio `a₂ / a₁`:\n\n(a₂ / a₁) = [(G * M_p₂²) / (M_star * K₂²)] / [(G * M_p₁²) / (M_star * K₁²)]\n\nThe terms for the gravitational constant `G` and the star's mass `M_star` cancel out, leaving:\n\n**(a₂ / a₁) = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²**\n\nThe radial velocity amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift `Δλ` (K = c * Δλ / λ, where c and λ are constant). Therefore, the ratio `K₁ / K₂` is equal to the ratio `Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`.\n\n### 4. Final Calculation\n\nLet's plug in the given values:\n*   Mass of Planet1 (M_p1) = 7 M_earth\n*   Mass of Planet2 (M_p2) = 5 M_earth\n*   Doppler shift for Planet1 (Δλ₁) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet2 (Δλ₂) = 0.04 Å\n\nFirst, calculate the ratios of the masses and Doppler shifts:\n*   (M_p₂ / M_p₁) = 5 / 7\n*   (K₁ / K₂) = (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂) = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nNext, substitute these ratios into the equation for `a₂ / a₁`:\n*   (a₂ / a₁) = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)² = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16) = 225 / 784\n\nFinally, substitute this value back into the temperature ratio equation:\n*   (T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(a₂ / a₁) = sqrt(225 / 784) = 15 / 28\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n*   (T_eq1 / T_eq2) ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>"
