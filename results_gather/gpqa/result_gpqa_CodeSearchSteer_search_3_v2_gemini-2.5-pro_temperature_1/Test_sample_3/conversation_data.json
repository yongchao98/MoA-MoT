    "In a universe with magnetic monopoles (isolated north or south poles), two of Maxwell's equations would be different. The presence of these magnetic \"charges\" would alter the fundamental laws describing magnetic and electric fields.\n\nThe two equations that would change are:\n\n1.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism (related to the divergence of the magnetic field):** In our universe, this law states that the divergence of the magnetic field (∇ · B) is zero. This is the mathematical expression of the fact that magnetic monopoles have never been observed; magnetic field lines are always closed loops and never start from or end on a \"magnetic charge\". If magnetic monopoles existed, this law would be modified to show that the divergence of the magnetic field is proportional to the density of magnetic charge (ρm), much like how the divergence of the electric field is proportional to electric charge density. The equation would become ∇ · B = μ₀ρm.\n\n2.  **Faraday's Law of Induction (related to the circulation of the electric field):** This law describes how a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field (a \"curl\"). The existence of magnetic monopoles would imply that their movement constitutes a \"magnetic current\" (Jm). Just as an electric current creates a circulating magnetic field (Ampere's Law), a magnetic current would create a circulating electric field. Therefore, Faraday's Law would need an additional term to account for this magnetic current. The equation ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t would be modified to become ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀Jm.\n\nTherefore, the correct option identifies the equations related to the divergence of the magnetic field and the circulation (or curl) of the electric field.\n\n<<<B>>>"
