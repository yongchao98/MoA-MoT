    "### Calculation of Relative Speed and Total Energy in a Relativistic System\n\nFor a system involving two astronauts with masses of 2m and 3m traveling at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the same direction, the relative speed and total energy can be determined using the principles of special relativity.\n\n**Relative Speed**\n\nTo find the speed of one astronaut relative to the other, the relativistic velocity subtraction formula is used. Let v1 be the velocity of the first astronaut (0.6c) and v2 be the velocity of the second astronaut (0.5c). The formula for the relative velocity (v_rel) is:\n\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c²)\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\nv_rel ≈ 0.1428c\n\nThus, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n**Total Energy**\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic system is the sum of the total energies of its individual components. The total energy (E) of a single particle is given by the equation E = γmc², where 'γ' is the Lorentz factor, 'm' is the rest mass, and 'c' is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is calculated as γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy for each astronaut:\n\n**Astronaut 1:**\n*   Mass (m1) = 2m\n*   Velocity (v1) = 0.6c\n*   Lorentz factor (γ1) = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √0.64 = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n*   Energy (E1) = γ1 * m1 * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²\n\n**Astronaut 2:**\n*   Mass (m2) = 3m\n*   Velocity (v2) = 0.5c\n*   Lorentz factor (γ2) = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √0.75 ≈ 1.1547\n*   Energy (E2) = γ2 * m2 * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.4641 mc²\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts:\n\nE_total = E1 + E2\nE_total = 2.5 mc² + 3.4641 mc²\nE_total = 5.9641 mc²\n\nSo, the total energy of the system is approximately **5.96 mc²**.\n\nBased on these calculations, the relative speed is approximately 0.14c and the total energy is 5.96 mc².\n\n<<<A>>>"
