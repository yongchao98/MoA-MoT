    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the approximate ratio of the neutrino fluxes.\n\n1.  **Identify Neutrino Sources by Energy:** The question asks for a flux ratio between two energy bands: Band 1 (700-800 keV) and Band 2 (800-900 keV). We need to identify which solar nuclear reactions produce neutrinos in these ranges.\n    *   **pp-I chain:** Produces low-energy `pp` neutrinos (up to 420 keV) and `pep` neutrinos (a sharp line at 1.44 MeV). Neither of these contributes to the 700-900 keV range.\n    *   **pp-II chain:** This branch produces neutrinos from the electron capture of Beryllium-7 (`⁷Be`). This reaction is critical as it emits neutrinos at a distinct energy line of 861 keV (0.861 MeV). This source falls squarely into **Band 2**.\n    *   **pp-III chain:** This branch produces high-energy `⁸B` (Boron-8) neutrinos with a continuous spectrum up to about 14-15 MeV. These neutrinos would normally contribute to both Band 1 and Band 2.\n    *   **CNO cycle:** This cycle, which accounts for about 1% of the Sun's energy, produces neutrinos from `¹³N` and `¹⁵O` decays. These have continuous energy spectra that extend up to 1.20 MeV and 1.73 MeV, respectively. Therefore, the CNO cycle contributes a continuous flux to **both Band 1 and Band 2**.\n\n2.  **Apply the Hypothetical Scenario:** The problem states that the pp-III branch suddenly stops. This means the flux from `⁸B` neutrinos becomes zero. All other reactions, including the pp-I, pp-II, and CNO cycle, continue as they were.\n\n3.  **Determine the Remaining Flux in Each Band:**\n    *   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):** With the `⁸B` neutrinos gone, the only remaining source of neutrinos in this energy range is the CNO cycle.\n    *   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):** This band contains two sources: the continuous flux from the CNO cycle and, crucially, the entire flux from the very strong, discrete 861 keV `⁷Be` line from the pp-II branch.\n\n4.  **Compare the Magnitude of the Fluxes:** The key to solving the problem is to compare the sizes of the remaining neutrino sources.\n    *   The flux in Band 2 is dominated by the `⁷Be` neutrino line. The total flux for these neutrinos is very large, on the order of 5 x 10⁹ neutrinos per cm² per second.\n    *   The flux in Band 1 consists only of a small portion of the total CNO neutrino flux. The total flux for all CNO neutrinos is significantly smaller, around 6.6 x 10⁸ neutrinos per cm² per second. This total flux is spread out over a wide energy range. The portion that falls within the 100 keV window of Band 1 is only a small fraction of this already smaller total.\n    *   Therefore, the flux in Band 1 is a small number (a fraction of the CNO flux), while the flux in Band 2 is a very large number (the `⁷Be` line flux) plus a small number (a fraction of the CNO flux).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio:**\n    Flux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2) = [Flux from CNO in 700-800 keV] / [Flux from `⁷Be` at 861 keV + Flux from CNO in 800-900 keV]\n\n    Since the `⁷Be` flux is about 10 times larger than the *total* CNO flux, the denominator is overwhelmingly dominated by the `⁷Be` contribution. The ratio is approximately:\n\n    (A small fraction of the total CNO flux) / (The large `⁷Be` line flux)\n\n    Let's estimate this. The total CNO flux (~7x10⁸) is roughly 1/7th of the `⁷Be` flux (~5x10⁹). The CNO flux is spread over ~1.7 MeV. The fraction in a 0.1 MeV band is roughly (0.1/1.7) of the total. So the numerator is approximately (1/7) * (1/17) ≈ 1/119 of the `⁷Be` flux. This simplifies to a value of about 0.008.\n\n    Comparing this estimate to the given options:\n    A) 10\n    B) 0.1\n    C) 1\n    D) 0.01\n\n    The calculated ratio of ~0.008 is very close to 0.01.\n\n<<<D>>>"
