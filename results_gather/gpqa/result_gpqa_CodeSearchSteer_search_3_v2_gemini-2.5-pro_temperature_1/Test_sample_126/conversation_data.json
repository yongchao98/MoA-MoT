    "When 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated, it undergoes a type of chemical reaction known as a Cope rearrangement. This reaction is a-sigmatropic rearrangement, a common transformation for molecules known as 1,5-dienes. The reaction proceeds through a concerted, cyclic transition state.\n\nTo determine the product, we can follow these steps:\n1.  **Identify the starting molecule:** The starting material is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Its structure is a 9-carbon chain with double bonds starting at carbons 2 and 6, and a butyl group attached to carbon 5.\n\n2.  **Locate the 1,5-diene system:** The core structure that participates in the rearrangement is the `C2=C3-C4-C5-C6=C7` fragment. This sequence of atoms constitutes a substituted hexa-1,5-diene, which is the necessary framework for a Cope rearrangement.\n\n3.  **Trace the bond reorganization:** In a-sigmatropic rearrangement, a sigma bond between carbons 3 and 4 of the diene system breaks, while a new sigma bond forms between carbons 1 and 6. In this specific molecule, this means:\n    *   The single bond between C4 and C5 breaks.\n    *   A new single bond forms between C2 and C7.\n    *   The double bonds shift to form new double bonds between C3-C4 and C5-C6.\n\n4.  **Determine the product's structure:** The rearrangement results in a new carbon skeleton. The original methyl group (C1) is now on a carbon adjacent to a new substituent, and the ethyl group (C8-C9) and butyl group are also repositioned relative to the new main chain.\n\n5.  **Name the new molecule:** To name the product according to IUPAC nomenclature, we must first identify the longest continuous carbon chain that contains both double bonds.\n    *   The new main chain is ten carbons long, making it a decadiene.\n    *   Numbering this chain to give the double bonds the lowest possible locants results in the name `deca-1,5-diene`.\n    *   The substituents on this chain are a methyl group at position 3 and an ethyl group at position 4.\n\nTherefore, the final product is **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
