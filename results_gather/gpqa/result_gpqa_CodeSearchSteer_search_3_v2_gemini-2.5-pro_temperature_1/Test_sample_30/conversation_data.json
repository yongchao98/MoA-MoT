    "The molecular symmetry group of product 3 is determined by following the three-step reaction sequence provided.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.**\nThis is the electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction known as nitration. The methyl group of toluene is an ortho-, para-directing activator. The reaction with a mixture of concentrated nitric and sulfuric acids adds a nitro group (NO₂) to the benzene ring, primarily at the ortho and para positions. Typically, the para isomer is the major product due to less steric hindrance. Therefore, Product 1 is p-nitrotoluene.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄, forming product 2.**\nThis step involves the oxidation of the methyl group of p-nitrotoluene. While various reagents can be used for this oxidation, the combination of manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) is a strong oxidizing medium. While some conditions might lead to the carboxylic acid, it is also known to oxidize toluenes to their corresponding aldehydes. A plausible reaction pathway, particularly in the context of a multi-step synthesis problem, is the oxidation of the methyl group to an aldehyde group, which is a common intermediate. Some literature even points to the formation of dinitrobenzaldehyde when starting from toluene with these reagents, implying oxidation of the methyl group and further nitration. A patent describes a process involving the oxidation of p-nitrotoluene to the aldehyde as a step in a larger synthesis. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that Product 2 is p-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\nThis reaction is a base-catalyzed crossed-aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation, between an aldehyde (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) and a ketone (acetone). The hydroxide ion removes an acidic α-hydrogen from acetone to form an enolate ion. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde. The resulting aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated system. The final product, Product 3, is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n**Molecular Symmetry of Product 3**\nProduct 3 is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. To determine its molecular symmetry group, we analyze its structure. The molecule consists of a p-nitrophenyl group connected to an α,β-unsaturated ketone chain (-CH=CH-CO-CH₃). For maximum π-orbital overlap and stability, the molecule tends to adopt a planar conformation. Assuming an idealized planar structure, the entire molecule lies in a single plane. This plane acts as a mirror plane (a σ plane), reflecting the top half of the atoms onto the bottom half. There are no other symmetry elements present, such as an axis of rotation (Cₙ) or a center of inversion (i). A molecule that possesses only an identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry belongs to the **Cₛ** point group. While in reality, there might be some twisting around the single bonds, for the purpose of point group classification in a typical chemistry context, the idealized, highest-symmetry conformation is considered.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of product 3 is Cₛ.\n\n<<<B>>>"
