    "Based on the principles of particle and condensed matter physics, the association of each particle with spontaneously broken symmetry is as follows:\n\n*   **A) Phonon:** Phonons are the collective excitations of atoms in a crystal lattice. A crystal breaks the continuous translational symmetry of free space by selecting a discrete set of lattice points. Phonons are the (Nambu-)Goldstone bosons that arise from this spontaneous symmetry breaking.\n\n*   **B) Magnon:** Magnons, or quantized spin waves, are excitations in magnetic materials. In a ferromagnet, for instance, the spins of the atoms align in a particular direction, spontaneously breaking the continuous rotational symmetry of spin space. Magnons are the Goldstone bosons associated with this broken symmetry.\n\n*   **D) Pion:** Pions are subatomic particles (mesons). In the theory of strong interactions (quantum chromodynamics), an approximate symmetry known as chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken. Pions are the relatively light pseudo-Goldstone bosons that result from this broken symmetry. They would be massless if the quarks were massless, but the small quark masses give the pions a small mass.\n\n*   **C) Skyrmion:** A skyrmion is a topologically stable, particle-like configuration in a field. Unlike the others, it is not a Goldstone boson. Its stability comes from its topological properties, meaning it cannot be smoothly \"unwound\" into a uniform state. While skyrmions arise in systems where symmetries are broken (for instance, they can be stabilized by interactions in materials that lack inversion symmetry), they are not the massless or light quanta that are the direct consequence of a broken continuous symmetry according to Goldstone's theorem. In fact, in some models, skyrmions are treated as solitons *of the pion field*, where the pions themselves are the Goldstone bosons.\n\nTherefore, the phonon, magnon, and pion are all effective particles that can be understood as (pseudo-)Goldstone bosons of a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry. The skyrmion is a topological soliton, a different kind of effective particle.\n\n<<<C>>>"
