    "Here's a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation.** The reaction of (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene) with mCPBA results in a *syn*-addition of the oxygen atom. This stereospecific reaction produces a trans-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is achiral, the product is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.** The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the epoxide ring via an *anti*-addition mechanism. The nucleophile (water) attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the opposite face of the oxygen atom, causing an inversion of stereochemistry at the carbon being attacked.\n    *   Opening the (4R,5R)-epoxide leads to the (4S,5R)-diol.\n    *   Opening the (4S,5S)-epoxide leads to the (4R,5S)-diol.\n    *   Both (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol are the same achiral meso compound due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation.** The reaction of (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) with mCPBA involves a *syn*-addition of oxygen, which produces a cis-epoxide. This cis-epoxide has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a single meso compound: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.** The acid-catalyzed opening of this meso-epoxide is an *anti*-addition.\n    *   Attack of water at one carbon (e.g., C4) results in the (4S,5S)-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other equivalent carbon (C5) results in the (4R,5R)-diol.\n    *   These two products, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol and (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers. Since the attack at either carbon is equally likely, they are formed in equal amounts.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction 2 produces a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n*   **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n*   **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n*   **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso-compound is a diastereomer of the two enantiomers.\n\n### **Chromatographic Observation**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Standard HPLC columns separate compounds based on physical properties like polarity but cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated.\n    *   The chromatogram will show **two peaks**: one for the meso-compound and one for the co-eluting pair of enantiomers.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC columns contain a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The column will also separate the meso-compound from the enantiomers, as they are diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **three distinct peaks**: one for the meso-compound, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<D>>>"
