    "The user wants me to solve a quantitative problem in astrophysics.\nMy initial analysis of the problem seems correct. The Google search confirms the applicability of the Boltzmann equation for stellar atmospheres under LTE. The search also confirms the formula for the ratio of populations and its dependence on temperature and energy difference. The relation between photon energy and wavelength is also confirmed.\n\nMy step-by-step derivation is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the goal**: Calculate the factor `F = R_nospots / R_spots`, where `R` is the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels.\n2.  **Determine the correct ratio**: The problem states `R` decreases as temperature decreases (when spots are present). The Boltzmann equation for the ratio of an upper level (b) to a lower level (a) is `R = N_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / kT)`. As `T` decreases, `exp(-ΔE / kT)` also decreases. This matches the problem's description. Therefore, the ratio in question is `N_upper / N_lower`.\n3.  **Formulate the factor `F`**:\n    *   `R_nospots = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots))`\n    *   `R_spots   = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))`\n    *   `F = R_nospots / R_spots = exp[(-ΔE / k) * (1 / T_nospots - 1 / T_spots)]`\n4.  **Calculate constants**:\n    *   `T_nospots = 6000 K`\n    *   `T_spots = 5500 K`\n    *   `λ = 1448 Å = 1.448 x 10^-7 m`\n    *   Calculate `ΔE` using `E = hc/λ`.\n        *   `h` (Planck's constant) = 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n        *   `c` (speed of light) = 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n        *   `ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3.00e8) / 1.448e-7 = 1.373 x 10⁻¹⁸ J`\n    *   Calculate `ΔE / k`.\n        *   `k` (Boltzmann constant) = 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n        *   `ΔE / k = 1.373e-18 / 1.381e-23 ≈ 99420 K`\n5.  **Calculate the final result**:\n    *   `1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots = 1/6000 - 1/5500 = (11 - 12) / 66000 = -1 / 66000 K⁻¹`\n    *   `Exponent = (-99420 K) * (-1 / 66000 K⁻¹) = 99420 / 66000 ≈ 1.506`\n    *   `F = exp(1.506) ≈ 4.508`\n6.  **Conclusion**: The result `~4.5` matches option C.\n\nThe extra information in the problem (stellar radius, mass, spot coverage percentage) is not needed for the calculation as the effective temperatures are provided. The assumption of LTE is crucial as it allows the use of the Boltzmann equation.\n\nThe steps and calculation are robust. I am ready to provide the final answer.To solve this problem, we need to use the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of atoms among different energy levels in a state of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The extraneous information about the star's radius, mass, and the percentage of spot coverage is not required for the calculation since the effective temperatures for both scenarios are provided directly.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n**1. The Boltzmann Equation**\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy level (`N_upper`) to the number of atoms in a lower energy level (`N_lower`) is given by the Boltzmann equation:\n\n`R = N_upper / N_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n\nwhere:\n*   `g_upper` and `g_lower` are the statistical weights of the upper and lower energy levels.\n*   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the two levels.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nThe problem states that the observed ratio decreases when the star has spots (i.e., when the temperature is lower). As the temperature `T` decreases, the term `-ΔE / (k * T)` becomes more negative, which causes the exponential term to decrease. This confirms that the ratio being measured is indeed `N_upper / N_lower`.\n\n**2. Calculating the Energy Difference (ΔE)**\n\nThe energy difference `ΔE` between the two levels corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given wavelength `λ = 1448 Å`. We can calculate this using the Planck-Einstein relation, `E = hc/λ`.\n\n*   `λ = 1448 Å = 1.448 x 10⁻⁷ m`\n*   `h` (Planck's constant) `≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s`\n*   `c` (speed of light) `≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s`\n\n`ΔE = (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s * 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s) / (1.448 x 10⁻⁷ m) ≈ 1.373 x 10⁻¹⁸ J`\n\n**3. Setting up the Factor Calculation**\n\nWe need to find the factor by which the ratio changes, which is the ratio without spots (`R_nospots`) divided by the ratio with spots (`R_spots`).\n\n*   Temperature without spots: `T_nospots = 6000 K`\n*   Temperature with spots: `T_spots = 5500 K`\n\n`Factor = R_nospots / R_spots`\n\n`Factor = [ (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) ] / [ (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]`\n\nThe statistical weight term `(g_upper / g_lower)` cancels out, leaving:\n\n`Factor = exp [ (-ΔE / k) * (1 / T_nospots - 1 / T_spots) ]`\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\nTo simplify the calculation, let's first evaluate the term `ΔE / k`:\n\n*   `k` (Boltzmann constant) `≈ 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K`\n\n`ΔE / k = (1.373 x 10⁻¹⁸ J) / (1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 99420 K`\n\nNow, substitute the values into the factor equation:\n\n`Factor = exp [ (-99420 K) * (1 / 6000 K - 1 / 5500 K) ]`\n\n`Factor = exp [ (-99420) * ( (11 - 12) / 66000 ) ]`\n\n`Factor = exp [ (-99420) * (-1 / 66000) ]`\n\n`Factor = exp [ 99420 / 66000 ]`\n\n`Factor = exp(1.5063)`\n\n`Factor ≈ 4.5099`\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.5.\n\n<<<C>>>"
