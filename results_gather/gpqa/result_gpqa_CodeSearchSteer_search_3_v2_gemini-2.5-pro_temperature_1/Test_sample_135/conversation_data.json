    "This problem requires evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a radially symmetric vector field over a sphere centered at the origin.\n\nThe vector field is given by:\n**f(r)** = (1/r²) **r̂**\nwhere **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction and r is the distance from the origin.\n\nThe integral to be evaluated is:\n∫ᵥ (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV\nwhere V is the volume of a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.\n\nA direct calculation of the divergence of **f** in spherical coordinates for r ≠ 0 yields:\n∇ ⋅ **f** = (1/r²) ∂/∂r (r² * (1/r²)) = (1/r²) ∂/∂r (1) = 0.\n\nIf the divergence were zero everywhere within the volume, the integral would be zero. However, the vector field is singular at the origin (r=0), and the divergence is undefined at this point. This singularity acts as a source for the field.\n\nTo correctly solve this, we use the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux of the field through the closed surface that bounds the volume:\n∫ᵥ (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV = ∮ₛ (**f** ⋅ d**S**)\n\nHere, S is the surface of the sphere of radius R. The differential surface area element in spherical coordinates is d**S** = R² sin(θ) dθ dφ **r̂**.\n\nOn the surface of the sphere, r = R, so the field is **f(R)** = (1/R²) **r̂**.\n\nNow, we compute the surface integral (flux):\n∮ₛ (**f** ⋅ d**S**) = ∫₀²π ∫₀π [ (1/R²) **r̂** ] ⋅ [ R² sin(θ) dθ dφ **r̂** ]\n\nThe dot product **r̂** ⋅ **r̂** = 1, and the R² terms cancel out:\n= ∫₀²π ∫₀π sin(θ) dθ dφ\n\nEvaluating the integrals:\n∫₀π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]₀π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 2\n∫₀²π dφ = [φ]₀²π = 2π\n\nThe total flux is the product of these two results:\nFlux = 2 * 2π = 4π\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to this flux. Therefore, the value of the integral is 4π. This result is independent of the radius R of the sphere, as long as it encloses the origin. This problem is a mathematical analogue to Gauss's Law in electromagnetism for a point charge at the origin.\n\n<<<B>>>"
