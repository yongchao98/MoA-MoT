    "To determine the maximum orbital period of the second planet that will exhibit both transit and occultation events, we must first establish the geometric conditions required for these phenomena to occur. A transit (when the planet passes in front of the star) and an occultation (when the planet passes behind the star) will both happen if the planet's orbit is aligned such that from our viewpoint, it crosses the disk of the star.\n\nThis analysis involves the following steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the orbital inclination.** The inclination (`i`) is the angle between our line of sight and the plane of the planet's orbit. We can find this using the information from the first planet. The impact parameter (`b`), a measure of how close to the star's center a planet appears to pass during transit, is given by the formula:\n    *   `b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s`\n    *   Where `a` is the semi-major axis of the orbit and `R_s` is the stellar radius.\n\n2.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law.** This law relates a planet's orbital period (`P`) to its semi-major axis (`a`). For two planets orbiting the same star, the relationship is:\n    *   `(P1/P2)² = (a1/a2)³`\n    *   This can be rearranged to find the semi-major axis of the second planet (`a2`) relative to the first (`a1`).\n\n3.  **Establish the transit condition for the second planet.** For a transit to occur, the planet's trajectory must intersect the star's disk. The limiting case for this to happen is a \"grazing transit,\" where the edge of the planet just touches the edge of the star. The condition for any part of the planet to transit is:\n    *   `a2 * cos(i) ≤ R_s + R_p2`\n    *   Where `R_p2` is the radius of the second planet. To find the *maximum* possible orbital period, we consider the equality, which corresponds to the largest possible orbit that still allows for a grazing transit.\n\n4.  **Combine these principles and solve for the maximum period of the second planet (`P2_max`).**\n\nHere are the given values:\n*   Star Radius (R_s) = 1.5 R_sun\n*   Planet 1 Period (P1) = 3 days\n*   Planet 1 Impact Parameter (b1) = 0.2\n*   Planet 2 Radius (R_p2) = 2.5 R_earth\n\nFrom the information on Planet 1, we can express the term `cos(i)/a1`:\n`b1 = (a1 * cos(i)) / R_s  => cos(i) / a1 = b1 / R_s`\n\nFor Planet 2, the condition for a grazing transit gives us the maximum semi-major axis (`a2_max`):\n`a2_max * cos(i) = R_s + R_p2`\n\nUsing Kepler's Third Law, we relate the semi-major axes to the periods:\n`a2 = a1 * (P2/P1)^(2/3)`\n\nNow, we substitute these relations into the transit condition for Planet 2 to solve for `P2_max`:\n`[a1 * (P2_max/P1)^(2/3)] * cos(i) = R_s + R_p2`\n`(P2_max/P1)^(2/3) * (a1 * cos(i)) = R_s + R_p2`\n`(P2_max/P1)^(2/3) * (b1 * R_s) = R_s + R_p2`\n`(P2_max/P1)^(2/3) = (R_s + R_p2) / (b1 * R_s)`\n`(P2_max/P1)^(2/3) = (1/b1) * (1 + R_p2/R_s)`\n`P2_max = P1 * [(1/b1) * (1 + R_p2/R_s)]^(3/2)`\n\nNext, we calculate the ratio of the second planet's radius to the star's radius.\n*   Radius of the Sun (R_sun) ≈ 696,000 km\n*   Radius of Earth (R_earth) ≈ 6,378 km\n*   R_s = 1.5 * 696,000 km = 1,044,000 km\n*   R_p2 = 2.5 * 6,378 km = 15,945 km\n*   `R_p2 / R_s = 15,945 / 1,044,000 ≈ 0.01527`\n\nFinally, we plug all the values into the equation for `P2_max`:\n`P2_max = 3 * [(1/0.2) * (1 + 0.01527)]^(3/2)`\n`P2_max = 3 * [5 * 1.01527]^(3/2)`\n`P2_max = 3 * [5.07635]^(3/2)`\n`P2_max = 3 * (5.07635 * sqrt(5.07635))`\n`P2_max = 3 * (5.07635 * 2.253)`\n`P2_max ≈ 3 * 11.437`\n`P2_max ≈ 34.31` days\n\nThis value is closest to 33.5.\n\n<<<C>>>"
