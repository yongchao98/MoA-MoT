    "### Calculation of Equivalent Exoplanet Radius\n\nTo determine the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same signal as the spotted star, we must first calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the star's rotation. This variation is due to one hemisphere being partially covered by cooler, dark spots.\n\n**1. Flux from the Star's Hemispheres**\n\nThe brightness of a star is related to its flux, which is governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, stating that flux is proportional to the fourth power of the effective temperature (T⁴).\n\n*   **Bright Hemisphere:** The unspotted hemisphere has a uniform temperature, Teff = 6000K. The maximum flux (F_max) observed from the star is proportional to T_eff⁴.\n*   **Spotted Hemisphere:** This hemisphere has 20% of its area (a filling factor, f = 0.2) covered by spots. These spots have a temperature of T_spot = 6000K - 1000K = 5000K. The remaining 80% of this hemisphere is at the star's effective temperature of 6000K. The minimum flux (F_min) from the star occurs when this hemisphere faces the observer. This flux is a weighted average of the flux from the spotted and unspotted areas.\n\n**2. Amplitude of Rotational Modulation**\n\nThe amplitude of the brightness variation is the relative difference between the maximum and minimum flux:\n\nAmplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n\nThis can be expressed in terms of the temperatures and the spot filling factor:\n\nAmplitude = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n*   f = 0.20\n*   T_spot = 5000 K\n*   T_eff = 6000 K\n\nAmplitude = 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴]\nAmplitude = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]\nAmplitude = 0.20 * [1 - 0.48225]\nAmplitude ≈ 0.20 * 0.51775\nAmplitude ≈ 0.10355\n\n**3. Equivalent Exoplanet Transit**\n\nAn exoplanet transiting its star causes a dip in the star's brightness. The depth of this transit is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. This is given by the formula:\n\nTransit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\nwhere R_pl is the radius of the planet and R_star is the radius of the star.\n\n**4. Equating the Signals**\n\nTo find the planet radius that produces the same signal amplitude as the starspots, we set the transit depth equal to the calculated amplitude of the rotational modulation:\n\n(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude\n(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius (R_pl / R_star):\n\nR_pl / R_star = √0.10355\nR_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<B>>>"
