    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula. Here is a step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference.**\n    *   The \"laboratory frame\" (let's call it S) is the frame of the observer.\n    *   The \"moving frame\" (let's call it S') is the rest frame of the glass. This frame is moving with a velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame S.\n\n2.  **Determine the velocity of light in the moving frame (S').**\n    The index of refraction `n` is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`).\n    *   `n = c / u'`\n    The problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum `c` should be taken as `1`.\n    *   `n = 1 / u'`\n    Therefore, the speed of light within the glass, as measured from the rest frame of the glass, is:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n\n3.  **Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula.**\n    Einstein's velocity addition formula is used to calculate how velocities combine in special relativity. For motion along a single direction, the formula is:\n    *   `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v / c^2)`\n    Where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) as seen by the observer in the laboratory frame (S).\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object as seen in the moving frame (S').\n    *   `v` is the velocity of the moving frame (S') relative to the laboratory frame (S).\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n4.  **Substitute the known values into the formula.**\n    We have:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v` (The glass moves at velocity `v` in the same direction as the beam)\n    *   `c = 1`\n    Substituting these into the formula gives:\n    *   `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) * v / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression.**\n    *   `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n    To clear the fractions in the numerator and denominator, multiply both by `n`:\n    *   `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    *   `u = (1 + nv) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result matches the expression given in option C. This effect, where the speed of light in a moving medium is not a simple addition of velocities, was experimentally observed by Fizeau and is explained by the theory of special relativity.\n\n<<<C>>>"
