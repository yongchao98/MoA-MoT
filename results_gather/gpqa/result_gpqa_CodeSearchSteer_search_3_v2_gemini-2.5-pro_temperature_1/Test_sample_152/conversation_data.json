    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each reaction to determine the correct products and reactants.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) → (A)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor**:\n    *   **Michael Donor**: Dimethyl malonate. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the acidic α-hydrogen located between the two ester groups, forming a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor**: Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, making its β-carbon electrophilic and susceptible to nucleophilic attack.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism**:\n    *   The enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks the β-carbon of the methyl acrylate derivative.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The resulting intermediate enolate is protonated by the ethanol (EtOH) solvent to yield the final product.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Name**:\n    *   The resulting structure is `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂COOCH₃`.\n    *   To name this compound as a tricarboxylate, we identify a three-carbon propane chain as the backbone: the carbon from the malonate (`C1`), the β-carbon from the acrylate (`C2`), and the α-carbon from the acrylate (`C3`).\n    *   The substituents on this chain are: two methoxycarbonyl groups at C1, a p-tolyl group at C2, and a methoxycarbonyl group at C3.\n    *   Therefore, the IUPAC name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) → (B)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor**:\n    *   **Michael Donor**: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, which serves as a nucleophile in a process known as the Stork enamine synthesis. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon of the enamine double bond (the α-carbon of the original ketone, cyclohexanone).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor**: (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism**:\n    *   The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium salt intermediate.\n    *   The subsequent workup with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium salt back into a ketone.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Name**:\n    *   The hydrolysis regenerates the cyclohexanone ring.\n    *   A new bond is formed between the α-carbon of the cyclohexanone and the β-carbon of the butanenitrile. The added group is `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   The final product is 2-(1-methyl-2-cyanoethyl)cyclohexanone.\n    *   Naming this with butanenitrile as the parent chain gives **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) → 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Identify the Product and Michael Acceptor**:\n    *   **Product**: 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor**: but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK).\n\n2.  **Retrosynthesis**:\n    *   This reaction is a Michael addition. The product is formed by creating a bond between a Michael donor (C) and the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor (MVK).\n    *   The `2-(3-oxobutyl)` group in the product comes from the MVK acceptor. The bond is at position 2 of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring.\n    *   This means the nucleophile must have been the enolate of the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring.\n\n3.  **Reactant C Structure and Name**:\n    *   The protons on the carbon between the two carbonyl groups (C2) of cyclohexane-1,3-dione are particularly acidic due to resonance stabilization of the conjugate base across both oxygen atoms.\n    *   The base (KOH) easily deprotonates this position to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   Therefore, the reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of the three reactions:\n*   Product **A** is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n*   Product **B** is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n*   Reactant **C** is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\nThis combination matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
