The exocyclic methylene group becomes a ketone.\n*   **Conclusion:** All candidate answers correctly identify Product 3 as **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nThis is the final and most important part of the question.\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** There is a consensus among all candidate answers that the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the carbinol proton (H-C3), the one on the carbon bearing the -OH group. This is due to the strong deshielding effect of the adjacent oxygen atom.\n\n2.  **Determine the Coupling Pattern:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one is highly symmetric, with a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7.\n    *   **Neighbors:** The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both are methylene (-CH₂-) groups, meaning H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    *   **Equivalence:** Due to the molecule's symmetry, the four neighboring protons can be grouped into two distinct sets of two equivalent protons:\n        *   **Set 1:** The two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n        *   **Set 2:** The two equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    *   **Splitting:** A proton coupled to two different sets of two equivalent protons (n₁=2, n₂=2) will have a (n₁+1)(n₂+1) splitting pattern.

The final structure is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one, and the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton (H-C3) exhibits a **triplet of triplets** pattern.\n\nMatching this conclusion to the given options:\nA) triplet\nB) triplet of triplets\nC) pentet\nD) doublet of triplets\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\n1.  **Reaction Conditions and Starting Material**: The reaction begins with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, a rigid tricyclic compound, which is subjected to harsh conditions: excess potassium hydroxide (KOH) at a high temperature of 240°C. These conditions are known to promote skeletal rearrangements.\n2.  **Analysis of Spectroscopic Data**: The provided data for Product 1 is crucial for determining its structure.\n    *   **IR Spectrum**: An absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a definitive indicator of a ketone (C=O) functional group.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum**: The spectrum shows signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H).\n        *   The total proton count is 14 (2+10+2), which means the molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₄O.\n        *   The signal at 4.79 ppm is in the vinylic region and its integration (2H) is characteristic of an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n3.  **Structural Deduction**: For a molecule with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O to contain both a ketone (one degree of unsaturation) and a double bond (one degree of unsaturation), the carbon skeleton must be bicyclic (two degrees of unsaturation), giving a total of four degrees of unsaturation. This confirms that the tricyclic adamantane cage has undergone a ring-opening fragmentation. The structure that perfectly fits all the data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n1.  **Reaction**: Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is treated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n2.  **Analysis**: This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction is highly selective for the reduction of ketones to alcohols and does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n3.  **Conclusion**: The ketone group at the C3 position is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Reaction**: Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by a reductive workup with dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n2.  **Analysis**: This is a standard ozonolysis reaction, which cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is converted into a ketone (=O) at the C7 position. The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n3.  **Conclusion**: The final product, Product 3, is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton**: In Product 3, the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3). The electronegativity of the adjacent oxygen atom shifts this proton's signal significantly downfield, beyond that of other protons like those alpha to the ketone.\n2.  **Determine the Coupling Pattern**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: The molecule is highly symmetric, with a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7.\n    *   **Neighboring Protons**: The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both are methylene (-CH₂-) groups, meaning H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    *   **Equivalence**: Due to the molecule's symmetry and rigid chair-chair conformation, the four neighboring protons are not all equivalent. They form two distinct pairs of equivalent protons:\n        *   **Pair A**: The two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4). These are equivalent by symmetry and will have one coupling constant, J_A.\n        *   **Pair B**: The two equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4). These are also equivalent by symmetry and will have a different coupling constant, J_B.\n    *   **Splitting**: According to the n+1 rule, coupling to two sets of two equivalent protons results in sequential splitting. The signal for H-C3 is first split by the two protons of Pair A (n=2) into a **triplet**. Each line of this triplet is then further split by the two protons of Pair B (n=2) into another **triplet**.\n    *   **Final Pattern**: The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nComparing this conclusion to the given options:\nA) pentet\nB) triplet of triplets\nC) triplet\nD) doublet of triplets\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to logically deduce the structure of each product in the multi-step synthesis and then analyze the final product's NMR spectrum.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Identify Product 1.** I will use the provided spectroscopic data (IR and ¹H NMR) for Product 1 to determine its structure.

These are harsh conditions known to induce skeletal rearrangements in rigid molecules.\n2.  **Spectroscopic Data:** The problem provides crucial data for Product 1:\n    *   **IR Spectrum:** An absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a definitive sign of a ketone (C=O) functional group.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The spectrum shows signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H).\n3.  **Analysis of Data:**\n    *   The total proton count from the NMR is 14 (2+10+2), which means the molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₄O.\n    *   The signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is in the vinylic region and is characteristic of an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n    *   The formula C₁₀H₁₄O has four degrees of unsaturation. A ketone (1) and a double bond (1) account for two degrees. This means the carbon skeleton must be bicyclic to account for the remaining two degrees of unsaturation.\n    *   This evidence points to a ring-opening reaction. The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes with a strong base is a known Grob fragmentation, which produces a bicyclic system. The structure that perfectly fits all the data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n2.  **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction is chemoselective, reducing the ketone to an alcohol without affecting the carbon-carbon double bond.\n3.  **Conclusion:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n2.  **Analysis:** This is a standard reductive ozonolysis. The reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is converted into a ketone (=O) at the C7 position. The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n3.  **Conclusion:** The final product, Product 3, is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In Product 3, the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton (excluding the -OH proton) is the one on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3). The electronegative oxygen atom shifts its signal significantly downfield, more so than the protons alpha to the ketone.\n2.  **Determine the Coupling Pattern:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule is highly symmetric, with a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7.\n    *   **Neighbors:** The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both are methylene (-CH₂-) groups, so H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    *   **Equivalence:** Due to the molecule's symmetry and its rigid chair-chair conformation, the four neighboring protons are not all equivalent. They form two distinct sets of two equivalent protons:\n        *   **Set A:** The two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n        *   **Set B:** The two equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    *   **Splitting:** The coupling constant between H-C3 and the protons in Set A (J_A) will be different from the coupling constant to the protons in Set B (J_B). Therefore, the signal for H-C3 is split sequentially. Coupling to the two equivalent protons of Set A (n=2) splits the signal into a **triplet**. Each peak of this triplet is then further split by the two equivalent protons of Set B (n=2) into another **triplet**.\n3.  **Conclusion:** The resulting overall pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.

It exists in a stable chair-chair conformation.\n    *   **Neighbors:** The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.

A ketone (1 DoU) and a double bond (1 DoU) account for two degrees. This means the carbon skeleton must be bicyclic (2 DoU) to satisfy the total of four. The original tricyclic adamantane skeleton must have undergone a ring-opening rearrangement. The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes under these harsh conditions is known to cause a Grob fragmentation.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 1:** The structure that perfectly fits all the provided data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction.

This reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The DMS works up the intermediate ozonide to yield ketones or aldehydes.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 3:** The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) at C7 is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at that position. The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected. The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nThe final task is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable hydrogen atom in Product 3.\n\n*   **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one, the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3).

These harsh conditions (strong base, high temperature) on a rigid, bridgehead-substituted molecule suggest a skeletal rearrangement rather than a simple substitution or elimination.\n2.  **Spectroscopic Data Analysis:**\n    *   **IR Spectrum:** The absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a clear indication of a ketone (C=O) functional group.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The spectrum shows signals for 14 protons in total (2H + 10H + 2H), confirming the molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₄O.

This is consistent with a known reaction called a Grob fragmentation. The structure that perfectly fits all the provided data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. All the provided candidate answers correctly deduce this pathway and structure.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces ketones to alcohols while leaving carbon-carbon double bonds unaffected.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. The structure of Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**. This conclusion is also unanimously reached by all candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at the C7 position. The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected. The final product, **3**, is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**. Again, all candidate answers are in agreement on this structure.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nThe final and most important step is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable hydrogen atom in Product 3.\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one, the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3). The electronegative oxygen atom deshields this proton, shifting its signal significantly downfield compared to all other protons on the carbon skeleton.\n\n2.  **Determine the Coupling Pattern:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through C3 and C7.\n    *   **Neighboring Protons:** The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both C2 and C4 are methylene (-CH₂-) groups, so H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    *   **Equivalence:** Due to the molecule's symmetry and its rigid chair-chair conformation, the four neighboring protons can be grouped into two distinct pairs of equivalent protons:\n        *   **Pair A:** The two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n        *   **Pair B:** The two equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    *   **Splitting:** The signal for H-C3 is first split by the two equivalent protons of Pair A. According to the n+1 rule (where n=2), this gives a **triplet**. Each peak of this triplet is then further split by the two equivalent protons of Pair B, also resulting in a **triplet**.\n\nThe resulting overall pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nBased on the provided options:\nA) triplet\nB) pentet\nC) doublet of triplets\nD) triplet of triplets\n\nThe correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\nThe reaction starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane and uses excess KOH at a high temperature (240°C). The spectroscopic data for the resulting product, **1**, is crucial for determining its structure.\n\n*   **IR Spectrum:** An absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong indicator of a ketone (C=O) functional group.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The total proton count is 2H + 10H + 2H = 14H. This means the molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₄O, as the adamantane core is C₁₀H₁₆ and two bromines have been replaced by one oxygen.\n    *   The signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is in the vinylic region and is highly characteristic of an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n*   **Structural Deduction:** A molecule with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O has four degrees of unsaturation. A ketone (1 DoU) and a double bond (1 DoU) account for two degrees. Therefore, the carbon skeleton must be bicyclic (2 DoU) to satisfy the total of four degrees of unsaturation. This indicates that the tricyclic adamantane cage has undergone a skeletal rearrangement and ring-opening. The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes under these harsh conditions is known to cause a Grob fragmentation.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 1:** The structure that perfectly fits all the provided data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction is highly selective for reducing ketones to alcohols and does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 2:** The ketone at position C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by a reductive workup with dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard ozonolysis reaction. The ozone cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 3:** The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at the C7 position. The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected. The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nThe final task is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable hydrogen atom in Product 3.\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**, the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3). The electronegative oxygen atom deshields this proton, shifting its signal significantly downfield (typically ~3.5-4.5 ppm), more so than the protons alpha to the ketone or other aliphatic protons.\n\n2.  **Determine the Coupling Pattern:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7. It exists in a stable chair-chair conformation.\n    *   **Neighbors:** The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.

Therefore, the signal for H-C3 is split by two different sets of equivalent protons.\n        *   Coupling to the two equivalent protons of Pair A (n=2) splits the signal into a **triplet** (n+1 rule).\n        *   Each peak of this triplet is then further split by the two equivalent protons of Pair B (n=2) into another **triplet**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The resulting overall pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) pentet\nB) triplet of triplets\nC) doublet of triplets\nD) triplet\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C.

The signal at 4.79 ppm is unequivocally in the vinylic region and the 2H integration is characteristic of an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n    3.  To accommodate a formula of C₁₀H₁₄O (4 degrees of unsaturation) with both a ketone (1 degree) and a double bond (1 degree), the carbon skeleton must be bicyclic (2 degrees). This confirms that the tricyclic adamantane cage has undergone a ring-opening fragmentation.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 1:** The structure that perfectly fits all the provided data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This is a known product of the Grob fragmentation of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction is highly selective for the reduction of ketones to alcohols and does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 2:** The ketone at position C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 3:** The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at position C7. The alcohol group at C3 remains unchanged. The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nThe final task is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable hydrogen atom in Product 3.\n\n*   **Structure:** bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one.\n*   **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** The proton attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3) is the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton. The electronegative oxygen atom shifts its signal significantly downfield, beyond that of the protons alpha to the ketone.\n*   **Determine the Coupling Pattern:**\n    1.  **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7.\n    2.  **Neighbors:** The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both are methylene (-CH₂-) groups, so H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    3.  **Equivalence:** Due to the molecule's symmetry and its rigid chair-chair conformation, the four neighboring protons can be grouped into two distinct pairs of equivalent protons:\n        *   **Pair A:** The two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n        *   **Pair B:** The two equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    4.  **Splitting:** The coupling constant to Pair A (J_A) will be different from the coupling constant to Pair B (J_B). According to the n+1 rule, coupling to the two equivalent protons of Pair A (n=2) splits the signal into a **triplet**. Each of these three lines is then further split by the two equivalent protons of Pair B (n=2) into another **triplet**.\n*   **Conclusion for Pattern:** The resulting overall pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nMatching this conclusion with the given options:\nA) triplet\nB) pentet\nC) triplet of triplets\nD) doublet of triplets\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
