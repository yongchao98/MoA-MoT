    "This is a common colloquialism in a chemistry lab, particularly in organic chemistry. Let's break down the context to understand what it means.\n\n1.  **The Goal:** In synthetic chemistry, after running a reaction, the primary goal is to isolate the desired product from any unreacted starting materials, byproducts, solvents, or catalysts. This process is called purification.\n\n2.  **The Main Tool for Purification/Analysis:** One of the most common techniques for both analyzing the composition of a mixture and for purifying it is **chromatography**.\n    *   **Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC):** This is a quick, analytical method. A small spot of the reaction mixture is placed at the bottom of a plate coated with a stationary phase (like silica gel). The plate is then placed in a solvent (the mobile phase). As the solvent moves up the plate, it carries the compounds with it. Different compounds travel at different rates, primarily based on their **polarity**. After the process, the compounds appear as distinct spots at different heights. If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will travel at the same rate and their spots will appear at the same heightâ€”literally \"on top of each other.\" This is a direct visual representation of the problem.\n    *   **Column Chromatography:** This is the preparative, large-scale version of TLC used for purification. The principle is the same. If two compounds have similar polarities, they will move through the column at the same rate and elute from the column at the same time, meaning they cannot be separated. The failure of the column separation is predicted by the TLC plate where the spots are \"on top of each other.\"\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) Similar boiling points:** This would be a problem for purification by **distillation**. While possible, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is much more commonly used to describe a failed chromatographic separation than a failed distillation.\n    *   **B) Non-covalent interactions:** These interactions are the fundamental reason for the differences in physical properties like polarity and boiling point, but the phrase isn't referring to the interactions themselves. It's referring to the *consequence* of those interactions on a purification technique.\n    *   **C) Similar polarities:** This is the direct cause of a failed separation by chromatography (both TLC and column). The phrase \"on top of each other\" is a perfect and common description of what is observed on a TLC plate when compounds have similar polarities. This is the most likely meaning.\n    *   **D) Similar optical rotations:** Optical rotation is a property of chiral molecules and doesn't affect most standard purification techniques like distillation or normal silica gel chromatography. While separating compounds with identical polarities and boiling points (like enantiomers) is a challenge, the phrase itself doesn't refer to optical rotation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other\" is most frequently used to describe the result of a TLC analysis where the desired product and an impurity have the same retention factor (Rf), appearing as a single, overlapping spot. This indicates they have very similar polarities and will be very difficult, if not impossible, to separate using standard column chromatography.\n\n<<<C>>>"
