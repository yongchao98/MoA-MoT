    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    The particle is spin 1/2 and is initially in a magnetic field `B` pointing in the +Z direction. The particle's magnetic moment `μ` is aligned with the field. For a spin 1/2 particle, the spin states are quantized. Alignment with the +Z direction means the particle is in the \"spin-up\" state with respect to the z-axis.\n    In Dirac notation, the initial state vector at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n    In the standard z-basis, this state is represented by the column vector `[[1], [0]]`.\n\n2.  **Identify the New Hamiltonian:**\n    At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude `B`. The Hamiltonian of a magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B_vec` is given by `H = -μ · B_vec`.\n    The magnetic moment operator is related to the spin operator `S` by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    The new magnetic field is `B_vec = B * y_hat`, where `y_hat` is the unit vector in the y-direction.\n    So, the new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is:\n    `H = - (γS) · (B * y_hat) = -γB * (S_x * 0 + S_y * 1 + S_z * 0) = -γB * S_y`\n    Here, `S_y` is the spin operator for the y-component.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution of the State:**\n    The state of the system evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. The state at a later time `t` is given by:\n    `|ψ(t)> = U(t) |ψ(0)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n    Substituting the Hamiltonian:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ) |+z> = exp(iγBt S_y/ħ) |+z>`\n    Let's define the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`. The equation becomes:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(iωt S_y/ħ) |+z>`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value:**\n    We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z(t)>`.\n    `<μ_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)>`\n    Since `μ_z = γS_z`:\n    `<μ_z(t)> = γ <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`\n    Let's calculate `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`:\n    `<S_z(t)> = <+z| exp(-iωt S_y/ħ) S_z exp(iωt S_y/ħ) |+z>`\n\n5.  **Use Spin Matrices for Calculation:**\n    For a spin 1/2 particle, the spin operators are represented by the Pauli matrices (`σ`) scaled by `ħ/2`:\n    `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    `S_z = (ħ/2) * σ_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n    The time evolution operator `U(t) = exp(iωt S_y/ħ)` becomes `exp(i(ωt/2)σ_y)`.\n    Using the identity `exp(iθσ_k) = I*cos(θ) + i*σ_k*sin(θ)`, where `I` is the identity matrix, `θ = ωt/2`, and `σ_k = σ_y`:\n    `U(t) = I*cos(ωt/2) + i*σ_y*sin(ωt/2)`\n    `U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), 0], [0, cos(ωt/2)]] + i*sin(ωt/2)*[[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    `U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), 0], [0, cos(ωt/2)]] + [[0, sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), 0]]`\n    `U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]]`\n\n    Now, let's find the state `|ψ(t)>`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = U(t) |+z> = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]] * [[1], [0]]`\n    `|ψ(t)> = [[cos(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2)]] = cos(ωt/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)|-z>`\n\n    Now we can calculate `<S_z(t)>`:\n    `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`\n    The bra vector is `<ψ(t)| = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]`.\n    `S_z |ψ(t)> = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2)]] = (ħ/2) * [[cos(ωt/2)], [sin(ωt/2)]]`\n    `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * [[cos(ωt/2)], [sin(ωt/2)]]`\n    `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * (cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2))`\n    Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n    `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`\n\n6.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    `<μ_z(t)> = γ <S_z(t)> = γ * (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`\n    This equation describes an oscillation. The term inside the cosine function is `ωt`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is `ω`.\n    We defined `ω = γB`.\n    Therefore, the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\nAn alternative, more intuitive way to think about this is through the concept of Larmor precession. The torque `τ = μ x B` on the magnetic moment causes a change in its angular momentum (which is the spin `S`). This leads to the equation of motion `dS/dt = γ(S x B)`. This equation describes the spin vector `S` precessing around the magnetic field vector `B` with an angular frequency known as the Larmor frequency, `ω_L = γB`.\nSince the spin vector is precessing around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis (`S_z`) will oscillate sinusoidally with this exact frequency.\n\n<<<D>>>"
