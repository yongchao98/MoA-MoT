    "This is a classic two-body decay problem in particle physics. We need to apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum using relativistic formulas.\n\n**1. Initial State:**\n*   The particle is a positive pion (π⁺) at rest.\n*   Initial energy (E_initial) is its rest mass energy: E_π = m_π * c² = 139.6 MeV.\n*   Initial momentum (p_initial) is zero since it is stationary.\n\n**2. Final State:**\n*   The products are a positive muon (μ⁺) and a neutrino (ν).\n*   Let the energy and momentum of the muon be E_μ and p_μ.\n*   Let the energy and momentum of the neutrino be E_ν and p_ν.\n*   The neutrino (ν) is considered to be massless (or its mass is negligible in this context).\n\n**3. Applying Conservation Laws:**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    The initial momentum is zero, so the final total momentum must also be zero.\n    p_initial = p_final\n    0 = p_μ + p_ν\n    This means the muon and the neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this magnitude `p`.\n    |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    The initial energy equals the sum of the total energies of the final particles.\n    E_initial = E_final\n    m_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n**4. Using Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relations:**\n\n*   For the muon (μ⁺), which has mass:\n    E_μ² = (p_μ * c)² + (m_μ * c²)²  =>  E_μ² = (p*c)² + (m_μ * c²)²\n\n*   For the massless neutrino (ν):\n    E_ν² = (p_ν * c)² + (m_ν * c²)²  =>  E_ν² = (p*c)² + 0  =>  E_ν = p*c\n    For a massless particle, its total energy is its kinetic energy, so KE_ν = E_ν.\n\n**5. Solving for the Energies:**\n\nWe have a system of equations. Let's solve for the energies of the product particles.\n\nFrom energy conservation: E_μ = m_π*c² - E_ν\nSubstitute E_ν = p*c: E_μ = m_π*c² - p*c  => p*c = m_π*c² - E_μ\n\nNow substitute this `p*c` into the muon's energy-momentum equation:\nE_μ² = (m_π*c² - E_μ)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n\nExpand the squared term:\nE_μ² = (m_π*c²)² - 2*(m_π*c²)*E_μ + E_μ² + (m_μ*c²)²\n\nThe E_μ² term cancels on both sides. Rearrange to solve for E_μ (the total energy of the muon):\n2*(m_π*c²)*E_μ = (m_π*c²)² + (m_μ*c²)²\nE_μ = [ (m_π*c²)² + (m_μ*c²)² ] / [ 2 * (m_π*c²) ]\n\nNow we can calculate the numerical values. Let's use a python script for precision.\n\n```python\n# Rest masses are given in MeV, which is a unit of energy (MeV/c^2 * c^2).\n# So we can use the given values directly in our energy equations.\nm_pi = 139.6  # MeV\nm_mu = 105.7  # MeV\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the muon (E_mu)\nE_mu = (m_pi**2 + m_mu**2) / (2 * m_pi)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest mass energy.\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu\n\n# Calculate the energy of the neutrino (E_nu) using energy conservation.\n# E_pi = E_mu + E_nu  =>  E_nu = E_pi - E_mu\nE_nu = m_pi - E_mu\n\n# For a massless neutrino, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy.\nKE_nu = E_nu\n\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of muon: {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of neutrino: {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\nKinetic Energy of muon: 4.12 MeV\nKinetic Energy of neutrino: 29.78 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV (rounding 29.78) for the neutrino. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This is a particle decay problem that can be solved using the principles of conservation of energy and momentum in the framework of special relativity.\n\n### **1. Initial State**\n\n*   **Particle:** A stationary positive pion (π⁺).\n*   **Initial Energy (E_initial):** Since the pion is at rest, its total energy is just its rest mass energy.\n    *   E_initial = m_πc² = 139.6 MeV\n*   **Initial Momentum (p_initial):** Since the pion is stationary, its momentum is zero.\n    *   p_initial = 0\n\n### **2. Final State**\n\n*   **Particles:** A positive muon (μ⁺) and a neutrino (ν).\n*   **Final Energy (E_final):** The sum of the total energies of the muon (E_μ) and the neutrino (E_ν).\n    *   E_final = E_μ + E_ν\n*   **Final Momentum (p_final):** The vector sum of the momenta of the muon (p_μ) and the neutrino (p_ν).\n    *   p_final = p_μ + p_ν\n\n### **3. Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after.\n    *   p_initial = p_final\n    *   0 = p_μ + p_ν\n    *   This implies that the muon and the neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let's call this magnitude `p`.\n    *   |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after.\n    *   E_initial = E_final\n    *   m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n### **4. Relativistic Calculations**\n\nWe use the energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n\n*   **For the Muon (μ⁺):**\n    *   E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    *   The kinetic energy of the muon is KE_μ = E_μ - m_μc².\n\n*   **For the Neutrino (ν):**\n    *   The rest mass of the neutrino is considered to be zero (m_ν ≈ 0).\n    *   E_ν² = (pc)² + (0)²  =>  E_ν = pc\n    *   Since its rest mass is zero, the neutrino's total energy is equal to its kinetic energy (KE_ν = E_ν).\n\n### **5. Solving for the Energies**\n\nWe have a system of equations. Let's solve for the kinetic energies.\n\n1.  From energy conservation: E_μ = m_πc² - E_ν\n2.  Substitute E_ν = pc: E_μ = m_πc² - pc  =>  pc = m_πc² - E_μ\n\nNow substitute this expression for `pc` into the muon's energy-momentum equation:\n\nE_μ² = (m_πc² - E_μ)² + (m_μc²)²\nE_μ² = (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)E_μ + E_μ² + (m_μc²)²\n\nThe E_μ² term cancels on both sides. We can now solve for E_μ (the total energy of the muon):\n\n2(m_πc²)E_μ = (m_πc²)² + (m_μc²)²\nE_μ = [ (m_πc²)² + (m_μc²)² ] / [ 2(m_πc²) ]\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n*   m_πc² = 139.6 MeV\n*   m_μc² = 105.7 MeV\n\nE_μ = [ (139.6)² + (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]\nE_μ = [ 19488.16 + 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]\nE_μ = 30660.65 / 279.2 ≈ 109.82 MeV\n\nNow, we can find the kinetic energies:\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_μ):**\n    KE_μ = E_μ - m_μc²\n    KE_μ ≈ 109.82 MeV - 105.7 MeV\n    KE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_ν):**\n    First, find the neutrino's total energy E_ν using energy conservation:\n    E_ν = m_πc² - E_μ\n    E_ν ≈ 139.6 MeV - 109.82 MeV\n    E_ν ≈ 29.78 MeV\n    Since the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy is its total energy.\n    KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are approximately **4.12 MeV** for the muon and **29.8 MeV** for the neutrino. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
