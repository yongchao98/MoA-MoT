    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n### Understanding C3h Symmetry\n\nA molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it possesses the following key symmetry elements:\n1.  **A C3 axis of rotation**: The molecule is superimposable on itself after a rotation of 360°/3 = 120°.\n2.  **A σh horizontal mirror plane**: The molecule is superimposable on itself after reflection through a mirror plane that is perpendicular to the principal axis (the C3 axis).\n\nThe C3h point group also implies the existence of an S3 improper rotation axis, but checking for C3 and σh is sufficient.\n\n### Analyzing the Molecules\n\nLet's examine each molecule's structure and symmetry.\n\n**B) triisopropyl borate, B(O-iPr)3**\n*   **Structure**: A central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms in a trigonal planar arrangement (BO3). Each oxygen is bonded to an isopropyl group [-CH(CH3)2].\n*   **C3 Axis**: An axis passing through the boron atom and perpendicular to the BO3 plane is a C3 axis. Rotating the molecule by 120° around this axis will interchange the positions of the three -O-iPr groups. If the isopropyl groups all have the same conformation (e.g., all twisted like a propeller), this C3 symmetry is maintained.\n*   **σh Plane**: For a horizontal mirror plane to exist, it would have to be the same plane as the BO3 group. Reflection through this plane would require that for every atom at a certain distance 'z' above the plane, there is an identical atom at distance '-z' below the plane. An isopropyl group, -CH(CH3)2, has a tetrahedral carbon atom and does not have this kind of internal mirror symmetry that could align with the BO3 plane. The lowest-energy conformation of this molecule is a propeller-like C3 structure, which is chiral and lacks any mirror planes.\n*   **Conclusion**: Triisopropyl borate has C3 symmetry, not C3h.\n\n**C) quinuclidine, 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane**\n*   **Structure**: A bicyclic amine with a highly symmetric cage-like structure. It consists of a nitrogen and a carbon atom at the bridgehead positions, connected by three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n*   **C3 Axis**: An axis passing through the bridgehead nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom (C4) is a C3 axis. Rotation by 120° permutes the three ethylene bridges.\n*   **σh Plane**: A horizontal plane perpendicular to this C3 axis would have to pass through the middle of the three ethylene bridges. Reflecting one half of the molecule (e.g., the part with the nitrogen) across this plane does not result in the other half (the part with the bridgehead carbon). For instance, the CH2 groups closest to the nitrogen are not equivalent to the CH2 groups closest to the carbon upon reflection. The molecule has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n*   **Conclusion**: Quinuclidine belongs to the C3v point group, not C3h.\n\n**A) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This is the IUPAC name for mellitic trianhydride. It consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups [-C(=O)-O-C(=O)-] fused to its sides.\n*   **Idealized Symmetry**: If the molecule were perfectly planar, it would have a C3 axis perpendicular to the ring and the plane of the molecule would be a σh plane. The idealized symmetry would be D3h.\n*   **Actual Structure**: However, this molecule is known to be sterically strained. The carbonyl groups of adjacent anhydride rings are very close to each other, causing significant repulsion. This forces the anhydride rings to pucker out of the plane of the central benzene ring. X-ray crystallography studies have shown that the molecule is non-planar and has C2 symmetry in the solid state.\n*   **Conclusion**: Since the actual molecule is non-planar and lacks a C3 axis, it does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n**D) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This molecule has a large, planar triphenylene core. Three anhydride groups are fused to the outer edges of this core at positions that are symmetrically equivalent.\n*   **Idealized Symmetry**: Triphenylene itself is a highly symmetric planar molecule with D3h symmetry. The anhydride groups are attached far from each other, separated by benzene rings of the triphenylene core.\n*   **Actual Structure**: Due to the large separation between the anhydride groups, there is negligible steric strain between them. The molecule is expected to be planar, or very close to planar.\n*   **Conclusion**: The molecule will possess D3h symmetry. The D3h point group contains all the symmetry elements of the C3h point group (specifically, a C3 axis and a σh plane). Therefore, this molecule *has* C3h symmetry.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nComparing the options:\n*   A is distorted and not C3h.\n*   B is C3, not C3h.\n*   C is C3v, not C3h.\n*   D is D3h, which is a higher symmetry group that contains C3h as a subgroup.\n\nTherefore, molecule D is the correct answer as it is the only one that possesses the required symmetry elements.\n\n<<<D>>>"
