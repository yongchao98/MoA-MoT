    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental Data to Identify Products and Their Quantities**\n\n*   The gas mixture is passed through three tubes sequentially.\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.02 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. The mass did not change, which means no CO₂ was produced. This implies the original salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) via the reaction 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase is due to the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Gas C did not react with a drying agent, limewater, or hot copper. The most likely candidate for such a gas, given that the original salts are likely nitrogen-based (a common component of energetic salts), is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n**2. Verify the Product Identification with a Mass Balance Check**\n\nLet's assume Gas C is N₂ and check if the total mass of the products equals the initial mass of the salt mixture.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = Moles of N₂ × Molar mass of N₂ = 0.10 mol × 28.02 g/mol ≈ 2.80 g\n*   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g), confirming that the products are indeed 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂.\n\n**3. Identify the Salts A and B**\n\n*   The products (H₂O, N₂, O₂) tell us that the original salts must contain Hydrogen (H), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O) atoms.\n*   Since they are salts, they consist of a cation and an anion. The most common cation containing N and H is the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). The most common anions containing N and O are the nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻) ions.\n*   Let's hypothesize that the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** and **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**.\n\n**4. Test the Hypothesis with Stoichiometry**\n\nLet's consider the decomposition reactions for these salts:\n*   Ammonium Nitrite: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   Ammonium Nitrate: The standard decomposition at ~200°C is to N₂O and H₂O. However, this does not produce the O₂ and N₂ observed. At higher temperatures, or under specific conditions, it can decompose as follows: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g). This reaction perfectly matches the products we identified. Let's assume this is the reaction that occurred.\n\nThe problem states the mixture of A and B is **equimolar**. Let `x` be the number of moles of salt A and `x` be the number of moles of salt B.\n\n*   From `x` mol of NH₄NO₂:\n    *   Moles of N₂ produced = `x`\n    *   Moles of H₂O produced = `2x`\n*   From `x` mol of NH₄NO₃ (using the 2:2:1:4 ratio):\n    *   Moles of N₂ produced = `x`\n    *   Moles of O₂ produced = `x/2`\n    *   Moles of H₂O produced = `2x`\n\nNow, let's sum the products:\n*   Total moles of H₂O = 2x (from nitrite) + 2x (from nitrate) = `4x`\n*   Total moles of O₂ = `x/2` (from nitrate only)\n*   Total moles of N₂ = x (from nitrite) + x (from nitrate) = `2x`\n\nWe can use our experimental data to solve for `x`:\n*   From O₂: Total moles = 0.025 mol = `x/2`  =>  `x = 0.05` mol.\n\nNow, let's verify this value of `x` with the other products:\n*   Predicted moles of H₂O = `4x` = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. (This matches our data).\n*   Predicted moles of N₂ = `2x` = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol. (This also matches our data).\n\nThe hypothesis is consistent. The mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n\n**5. Verify the Initial Mass**\n\nLet's check if the mass of this mixture is 7.20 g.\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol. Mass = 0.05 mol * 80.04 g/mol = 4.002 g.\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol. Mass = 0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol = 3.202 g.\n*   Total mass = 4.002 g + 3.202 g = 7.204 g.\nThis matches the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the **total number of all atoms in salts A and B**. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   Salt A: **NH₄NO₃** (or N₂H₄O₃)\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 3 (Oxygen) = **9 atoms**.\n*   Salt B: **NH₄NO₂** (or N₂H₄O₂)\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 2 (Oxygen) = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n```python\n# A simple python script to verify the arithmetic.\n\n# --- Molar Masses ---\nM_H2O = 18.016\nM_O2 = 32.00\nM_N2 = 28.014\nM_NH4NO3 = 80.043\nM_NH4NO2 = 64.044\n\n# --- Moles of products from experiment ---\nmoles_H2O = 3.60 / M_H2O  # ~0.2 mol\nmoles_O2 = 0.80 / M_O2   # 0.025 mol\nmoles_N2 = 2.24 / 22.4    # 0.1 mol\n\n# --- Solve for moles of salts (x) based on O2 production ---\n# Reaction: 2NH4NO3 -> 2N2 + O2 + 4H2O\n# Moles O2 = x / 2\nx = moles_O2 * 2  # x = 0.025 * 2 = 0.05 mol\n\n# --- Verify total mass ---\ntotal_mass = x * M_NH4NO3 + x * M_NH4NO2\n# total_mass = 0.05 * 80.043 + 0.05 * 64.044 = 4.002 + 3.202 = 7.204 g\n# This is consistent with the given 7.20 g.\n\n# --- Calculate total atoms ---\n# Salt A: NH4NO3 (N2H4O3) -> 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms\n# Salt B: NH4NO2 (N2H4O2) -> 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms\ntotal_atoms = 9 + 8\n\nprint(f\"The total number of all atoms in salts A and B is: {total_atoms}\")\n```\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is: 17\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "An equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, weighs 7.20 g. Upon heating to 200°C, it decomposes completely into a mixture of gases. The products are analyzed sequentially.\n\n1.  **Analysis of the products:**\n    *   The gas mixture is passed through a tube with anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂, a powerful drying agent. The mass of this tube increases by 3.60 g. This mass gain is due to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n        *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O = 1.01*2 + 16.00 = 18.02 g/mol\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol\n\n    *   Next, the gas passes through a Ca(OH)₂ solution. The mass of this tube does not change. This indicates that no acidic gas, such as CO₂, was produced. Therefore, the original salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n\n    *   Then, the gas is passed over red-hot copper (Cu). The mass of this tube increases by 0.80 g. Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen gas.\n        *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n        *   Molar mass of O₂ = 16.00 * 2 = 32.00 g/mol\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol\n\n    *   Finally, 2.24 L of a remaining gas C is collected at standard temperature and pressure (STP). At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol\n        *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper. Given that the products contain H, O, and must contain another element from the salts, the most likely candidate for this inert gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Summary of Products and Mass Conservation:**\n    *   Products are: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂.\n    *   Let's check the total mass of the products:\n        *   Mass H₂O = 0.20 mol * 18.02 g/mol = 3.60 g\n        *   Mass O₂ = 0.025 mol * 32.00 g/mol = 0.80 g\n        *   Mass N₂ = 0.10 mol * 28.02 g/mol = 2.80 g\n        *   Total mass = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g\n    *   This matches the initial mass of the salt mixture, confirming our identification of the products and their quantities.\n\n3.  **Identification of Salts A and B:**\n    *   The products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) indicate that the original salts must contain the elements H, O, and N.\n    *   Since they are salts, they are composed of a cation and an anion. A common cation containing H and N is the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). Common anions containing N and O are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n    *   Let's hypothesize that the salts are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n4.  **Stoichiometry of Decomposition:**\n    *   The decomposition of ammonium nitrite is: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   The decomposition of ammonium nitrate must produce N₂, O₂, and H₂O. The balanced equation that fits the products is: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\n5.  **Solving for the Moles of Each Salt:**\n    *   The problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let `x` be the moles of NH₄NO₃ and `x` be the moles of NH₄NO₂.\n    *   From the decomposition reactions:\n        *   Total moles of O₂ produced = `x/2` (only from NH₄NO₃)\n        *   Total moles of N₂ produced = `x` (from NH₄NO₂) + `x` (from NH₄NO₃) = `2x`\n        *   Total moles of H₂O produced = `2x` (from NH₄NO₂) + `2x` (from NH₄NO₃) = `4x`\n    *   Using the experimental moles of O₂:\n        *   moles of O₂ = `x/2` = 0.025 mol\n        *   Solving for `x`: x = 0.05 mol.\n    *   So, the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n    *   Let's verify this with the other products:\n        *   Predicted moles of N₂ = 2x = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol. (Matches)\n        *   Predicted moles of H₂O = 4x = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. (Matches)\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n    *   Salt A: NH₄NO₃\n        *   Atoms = (1 N + 4 H) + (1 N + 3 O) = 2 N + 4 H + 3 O = 9 atoms\n    *   Salt B: NH₄NO₂\n        *   Atoms = (1 N + 4 H) + (1 N + 2 O) = 2 N + 4 H + 2 O = 8 atoms\n    *   Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17\n\nThe total number of atoms in the two salt formulas is 17.\n\n<<<B>>>"
