    "This problem requires us to determine the total energy of a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n**1. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nFirst, let's recall the energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L. The energy for a given quantum number *n* (where n = 1, 2, 3, ...) is:\nE_n = (n^2 * π² * ħ²) / (2 * m * L²)\n\nThe problem provides a convenient energy unit:\nE = (π² * ħ²) / (2 * m * L²)\n\nSo, we can express the single-particle energy levels in terms of E:\n*   E₁ = 1² * E = 1E\n*   E₂ = 2² * E = 4E\n*   E₃ = 3² * E = 9E\n*   E₄ = 4² * E = 16E\n*   and so on...\n\n**2. Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\nThe particles are described as \"identical spin-1/2 particles\". This means they are fermions and must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n\nA quantum state is defined by both its spatial part (the quantum number *n*) and its spin part (spin up, mₛ = +1/2, or spin down, mₛ = -1/2). Therefore, for each energy level *n*, we can place a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**3. Calculating the Total Energies**\n\nWe have four fermions to place into the available energy levels.\n\n**Ground State (E_ground)**\nTo find the ground state energy, we fill the lowest available energy levels first.\n*   The n=1 level is the lowest. We can place two particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   The n=2 level is the next lowest. We place the remaining two particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n\nThe configuration is:\n*   2 particles in the n=1 state.\n*   2 particles in the n=2 state.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_ground = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂)\nE_ground = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 4E)\nE_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E\n\n**First Excited State (E_first_excited)**\nTo find the first excited state, we must create the lowest-energy excitation from the ground state. This is typically done by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n*   Ground state configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2.\n*   Highest Occupied Level: n=2.\n*   Lowest Unoccupied Level: n=3.\n\nWe promote one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level. The new configuration is:\n*   2 particles in the n=1 state.\n*   1 particle in the n=2 state.\n*   1 particle in the n=3 state.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_first_excited = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃)\nE_first_excited = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E)\nE_first_excited = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E\n\n**Second Excited State (E_second_excited)**\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next-lowest energy above the first excited state. We need to consider different ways to excite the system from the ground state and find which one has the second-lowest energy increase.\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E (from promoting n=2 → n=3)\n\nLet's consider other possible excitations from the ground state:\n*   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n\n*   **Possibility B:** Excite two particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n\n*   **Possibility C:** Excite one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing the energies of the possible excited states: 15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...\nThe lowest energy is the ground state (10E).\nThe next lowest is the first excited state (15E).\nThe third lowest is the second excited state, which is 18E.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe energies of the three states are:\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Second Excited State: 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
