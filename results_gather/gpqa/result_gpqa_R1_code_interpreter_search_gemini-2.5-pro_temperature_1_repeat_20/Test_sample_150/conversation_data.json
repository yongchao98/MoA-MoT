    "Here is a breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the given state vector and the observable operator.**\n    The state of the system at time t is given by the column vector `|ψ⟩`:\n    ```\n    |ψ⟩ = \n    [-1]\n    [ 2]\n    [ 1]\n    ```\n    The observable `P` is represented by the matrix:\n    ```\n    P = \n    [0,   1/√2, 0  ]\n    [1/√2, 0,   1/√2]\n    [0,   1/√2, 0  ]\n    ```\n\n2.  **Determine if the value of interest (0) is an eigenvalue of the observable `P`.**\n    To do this, we find the eigenvalues of `P` by solving the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`, where `I` is the identity matrix and `λ` represents the eigenvalues.\n    ```\n    det | -λ    1/√2   0    |\n        | 1/√2  -λ    1/√2  | = 0\n        | 0     1/√2  -λ    |\n    ```\n    Expanding the determinant:\n    ` -λ((-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2)) - (1/√2)((1/√2)(-λ) - 0) + 0 = 0 `\n    ` -λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = 0 `\n    ` -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = 0 `\n    ` -λ³ + λ = 0 `\n    ` λ(1 - λ²) = 0 `\n    This gives the eigenvalues `λ = 0`, `λ = 1`, and `λ = -1`.\n    Since 0 is one of the eigenvalues, it is a possible outcome of the measurement.\n\n3.  **Find the normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.**\n    We need to find the vector `|v₀⟩` such that `P|v₀⟩ = 0|v₀⟩ = 0`. Let `|v₀⟩ = [x, y, z]ᵀ`.\n    ```\n    [0,   1/√2, 0  ] [x]   [0]\n    [1/√2, 0,   1/√2] [y] = [0]\n    [0,   1/√2, 0  ] [z]   [0]\n    ```\n    This results in a system of linear equations:\n    *   `y/√2 = 0`  => `y = 0`\n    *   `x/√2 + z/√2 = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `x = -z`\n\n    So, the eigenvector is of the form `[x, 0, -x]ᵀ`. To normalize it, the sum of the squares of its components must be 1:\n    `x² + 0² + (-x)² = 1`\n    `2x² = 1`\n    `x = 1/√2`\n    The normalized eigenvector for `λ = 0` is:\n    ```\n    |v₀⟩ = \n    [ 1/√2]\n    [  0  ]\n    [-1/√2]\n    ```\n\n4.  **Calculate the probability.**\n    The probability `Prob(λ)` of measuring an eigenvalue `λ` is given by the formula:\n    `Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|² / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩`\n    Where `|v_λ⟩` is the eigenvector for eigenvalue `λ`, `|ψ⟩` is the state vector, `⟨v_λ|ψ⟩` is the inner product, and `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` is the squared norm of the state vector.\n\n    *   First, calculate the inner product `⟨v₀|ψ⟩`:\n        `⟨v₀|ψ⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2] · [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ`\n        `⟨v₀|ψ⟩ = (1/√2)*(-1) + (0)*(2) + (-1/√2)*(1)`\n        `⟨v₀|ψ⟩ = -1/√2 - 1/√2 = -2/√2 = -√2`\n        The squared magnitude is `|⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² = (-√2)² = 2`.\n\n    *   Next, calculate the squared norm of the state vector `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`:\n        `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n\n    *   Finally, compute the probability:\n        `Prob(0) = 2 / 6 = 1/3`\n\nThe probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t is 1/3.\n\n<<<C>>>"
