    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess KOH at 240°C.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a reaction under harsh basic and high-temperature conditions. While simple substitution to a diol (1,3-adamantanediol) is possible, the conditions are severe enough to cause rearrangements. The spectral data for Product 1 are key.\n*   **IR Spectrum:** A strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone. This rules out products like alcohols or ethers.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The formula is consistent with C₁₀H₁₄O (14 protons), which corresponds to an adamantanone isomer (C₁₀H₁₆ adamantane -> C₁₀H₁₄O ketone). The chemical shifts are given as 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H).\n*   The signal at 4.79 ppm is highly unusual for a saturated ketone and suggests a complex, strained, or rearranged structure. While the exact structure that perfectly matches this spectrum is difficult to determine without further information (it may correspond to a lesser-known isomer or contain an error), the reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes under these conditions is known to cause cage rearrangements. A plausible product is a rearranged ketone like **protoadamantan-4-one**. For the purpose of solving the multi-step synthesis, we will proceed assuming Product 1 is a rearranged C₁₀H₁₄O ketone.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (a ketone) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide (Al(O-iPr)₃).\n*   **Analysis:** This reagent is used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which reduces ketones to alcohols. However, the problem states the reaction is heated, and the subsequent step involves ozonolysis, which cleaves C=C double bonds. This strongly implies that the alcohol formed from the reduction undergoes dehydration (elimination of water) under the heated reaction conditions to form an alkene.\n*   **Conclusion:** The overall transformation is a reduction followed by dehydration.\n    *   Product 1 (Ketone) → Intermediate Alcohol → Product 2 (Alkene)\n*   If Product 1 is protoadamantan-4-one, reduction gives protoadamantan-4-ol. Dehydration of this alcohol would lead to an alkene, most likely **protoadamant-4-ene** (also named protoadamant-5-ene depending on numbering). This is Product 2, a C₁₀H₁₄ alkene.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (an alkene) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide ((CH₃)₂S).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup. This procedure cleaves a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) and replaces it with two carbonyl groups (C=O).\n*   The alkene, protoadamant-4-ene, has a double bond between two methine carbons (CH=CH). Ozonolysis with reductive workup cleaves this bond to form two aldehyde groups (-CHO).\n*   Cleaving the C4=C5 bond of the tricyclic protoadamantene skeleton results in a bicyclic dialdehyde. The resulting structure is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde.\n*   **Symmetry:** This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (Cs symmetry) that passes through C1, C5, and C9. This symmetry makes the two halves of the molecule equivalent. Therefore, the aldehyde group at C3 is equivalent to the one at C7, and the methine proton H3 is equivalent to H7.\n*   **Identify the most deshielded proton:** The question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom, excluding those that exchange with deuterated solvent (like OH or NH protons).\n    *   The most deshielded protons in the molecule are the aldehyde protons (-CHO) at δ ≈ 9-10 ppm. They are not exchangeable. An aldehyde proton is typically coupled to the proton on the carbon it's attached to (H3/H7 in this case), which would make its signal a doublet. Since \"doublet\" is not among the more complex options, the question is likely referring to the most deshielded proton *on the carbon skeleton*.\n    *   The most deshielded protons on the carbon skeleton are H3 and H7, which are alpha to the electron-withdrawing aldehyde groups. Their chemical shift would be around δ ≈ 2.5-3.5 ppm.\n*   **Determine the coupling pattern of H3 (or H7):**\n    *   The proton H3 is a methine proton (CH). It is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, which are C2 and C4. Both C2 and C4 are methylene groups (CH₂).\n    *   Therefore, H3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons: two on C2 (H2ax, H2eq) and two on C4 (H4ax, H4eq). (It is also coupled to the aldehyde proton, but this is often a smaller coupling and may be ignored for identifying the main pattern, or the question implies ignoring it).\n    *   In the chair-like six-membered ring, the axial and equatorial protons are in different chemical environments and will have different coupling constants to H3.\n        *   H3 couples to H2ax and H4ax (diaxial couplings, J large).\n        *   H3 couples to H2eq and H4eq (axial-equatorial couplings, J small).\n    *   Assuming the two diaxial couplings are similar (J_A), the two Hax protons will split the H3 signal into a triplet.\n    *   Assuming the two axial-equatorial couplings are similar (J_B), the two Heq protons will also split the H3 signal into a triplet.\n    *   The resulting pattern for the H3 signal is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The most deshielded proton on the carbon skeleton is H3/H7. Its signal is split into a triplet by the two neighboring axial protons and into another triplet by the two neighboring equatorial protons, resulting in a triplet of triplets pattern.\n\nLet's check the options:\nA) pentet: Would require coupling to four equivalent protons. Unlikely here.\nB) doublet of triplets: Would require coupling to one proton and a pair of equivalent protons. Does not fit.\nC) triplet of triplets: Fits the analysis of H3 coupled to two pairs of protons (H2ax/H4ax and H2eq/H4eq).\nD) triplet: Would require coupling to two equivalent protons. Does not fit.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is triplet of triplets.\n\n<<<C>>>"
