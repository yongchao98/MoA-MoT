    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Initial State and Dilution**\n\n*   First, we calculate the initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) before dilution.\n    *   Volume of acetic acid = 20.00 cm³ = 0.02000 L\n    *   Concentration of acetic acid = 0.05 M\n    *   Initial moles of CH₃COOH = Volume × Concentration = 0.02000 L × 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol.\n\n*   Next, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n    *   Total volume after dilution = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L.\n    *   The number of moles of acetic acid remains the same (0.001 mol).\n    *   New concentration of CH₃COOH = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M.\n\n**2. Titration Reaction**\n\nThe titration reaction is between a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (NaOH):\nCH₃COOH (aq) + NaOH (aq) → CH₃COONa (aq) + H₂O (l)\nThis is a 1:1 molar reaction.\n\n**3. pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   **Equivalence Point:** First, let's determine the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point. At this point, moles of NaOH added equals the initial moles of CH₃COOH.\n    *   Moles of NaOH needed = 0.001 mol.\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n\n*   **25% Titration Point:** This is the point where 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized.\n    *   Moles of NaOH added = 0.25 × 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol.\n    *   This amount of NaOH reacts with 0.00025 mol of CH₃COOH to produce 0.00025 mol of the conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH remaining = Initial moles - Reacted moles = 0.001 mol - 0.00025 mol = 0.00075 mol.\n    *   Moles of CH₃COO⁻ formed = 0.00025 mol.\n\n*   At this stage, the solution contains a mixture of a weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻), which forms a buffer. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH:\n    pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n    where [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid. The ratio of concentrations is equal to the ratio of moles.\n\n*   First, calculate pKa:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n\n*   Now, calculate the pH:\n    pH = 4.733 + log(moles of CH₃COO⁻ / moles of CH₃COOH)\n    pH = 4.733 + log(0.00025 / 0.00075)\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    pH ≈ 4.256\n\n**4. pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   At the equivalence point, all 0.001 mol of CH₃COOH has reacted with 0.001 mol of NaOH to form 0.001 mol of sodium acetate (CH₃COONa).\n*   The total volume of the solution is the initial volume of the diluted acid plus the volume of NaOH added:\n    Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L.\n*   The concentration of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) in the solution is:\n    [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.05000 L = 0.02 M.\n*   The acetate ion is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water, increasing the pH:\n    CH₃COO⁻ (aq) + H₂O (l) ⇌ CH₃COOH (aq) + OH⁻ (aq)\n*   We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate, which can be calculated from the Ka of acetic acid and the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C):\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n*   We can set up an ICE table to find the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻]:\n|             | CH₃COO⁻ | CH₃COOH | OH⁻   |\n|-------------|---------|----------|-------|\n| Initial (I) | 0.02 M  | 0        | ~0    |\n| Change (C)  | -x      | +x       | +x    |\n| Equil. (E)  | 0.02-x  | x        | x     |\n\n*   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n*   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02\n    x² = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Now, calculate pOH and then pH:\n    pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   The pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.\n*   The pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Part 1: pH at 25% Titration ---\n\n# The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).\n# At 25% titration, 25% of the acid (HA) has been converted to its conjugate base (A-).\n# This means the ratio [A-]/[HA] is 25/75, or 1/3.\n\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\nratio = 1/3\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(ratio)\n\n# --- Part 2: pH at the Equivalence Point ---\n\n# Initial conditions\nV_acid_initial = 0.02000  # L\nC_acid_initial = 0.05  # M\nC_base = 0.1 # M\n\n# Moles of acid\nmoles_acid = V_acid_initial * C_acid_initial  # 0.001 mol\n\n# Volume of diluted acid solution\nV_acid_diluted = 0.04000  # L\n\n# At the equivalence point, moles of base added = moles of acid\nmoles_base_eq = moles_acid\nV_base_eq = moles_base_eq / C_base # 0.01 L\n\n# Total volume at equivalence point\nV_total_eq = V_acid_diluted + V_base_eq # 0.05 L\n\n# Concentration of conjugate base (acetate) at equivalence point\nC_conj_base = moles_acid / V_total_eq # 0.02 M\n\n# Hydrolysis of acetate: A- + H2O <=> HA + OH-\n# Calculate Kb for the conjugate base\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Calculate [OH-] from Kb = [OH-]^2 / [A-]\n# We assume [OH-] is x, so Kb = x^2 / (C_conj_base - x)\n# Since Kb is small, we approximate C_conj_base - x ≈ C_conj_base\nOH_conc = math.sqrt(Kb * C_conj_base)\n\n# Calculate pOH and pH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(OH_conc)\npH_eq = 14.0 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
