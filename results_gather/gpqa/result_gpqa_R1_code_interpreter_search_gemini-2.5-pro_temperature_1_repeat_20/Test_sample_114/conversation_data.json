    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the System and Principles**\n\nThis problem involves an electron-positron annihilation, a classic example of relativistic physics. The key principles to apply are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum. Since the particles are moving at relativistic speeds (indicated by Lorentz factors greater than 1), we must use the relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n*   **Electron:** Mass `m_e`, charge `-e`.\n*   **Positron:** Mass `m_e` (same as electron), charge `+e`.\n*   **Photon:** Massless particle of light.\n\n**Coordinates:**\n*   Let the collision occur along the x-axis.\n*   The electron moves from left to right, so its velocity is in the `+x` direction.\n*   The positron moves from right to left, so its velocity is in the `-x` direction.\n\n**2. Calculate Initial Energy and Momentum**\n\nWe need to find the total energy and total momentum of the electron-positron system *before* the collision. The energy-momentum relation for a particle with rest mass `m` is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. A more direct way to find momentum from the Lorentz factor (γ) is `p = γmv`, but we can also use `p = sqrt(E² - (mc²)²)/c`.\n\nLet `m_e` be the rest mass of the electron (and positron) and `c` be the speed of light.\n\n*   **For the electron (γ_e = 4):**\n    *   Energy: `E_e = γ_e * m_e * c² = 4 * m_e * c²`\n    *   Momentum: We can find the momentum `p_e` using the energy-momentum relation.\n        *   `p_e²c² = E_e² - (m_e c²)²`\n        *   `p_e²c² = (4 m_e c²)² - (m_e c²)² = 16(m_e c²)² - 1(m_e c²)² = 15(m_e c²)²`\n        *   `p_e = sqrt(15) * m_e * c`\n    *   Since the electron moves in the `+x` direction, its momentum vector is `(p_e, 0)`.\n\n*   **For the positron (γ_p = 2):**\n    *   Energy: `E_p = γ_p * m_e * c² = 2 * m_e * c²`\n    *   Momentum: We find the momentum `p_p` similarly.\n        *   `p_p²c² = E_p² - (m_e c²)²`\n        *   `p_p²c² = (2 m_e c²)² - (m_e c²)² = 4(m_e c²)² - 1(m_e c²)² = 3(m_e c²)²`\n        *   `p_p = sqrt(3) * m_e * c`\n    *   Since the positron moves in the `-x` direction, its momentum vector is `(-p_p, 0)`.\n\n*   **Total Initial System:**\n    *   Total Energy `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c² + 2 m_e c² = 6 m_e c²`\n    *   Total Momentum `P_initial_x = p_e - p_p = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c`\n    *   Total Momentum `P_initial_y = 0`\n\n**3. Analyze the Final State and Apply Conservation Laws**\n\nThe final state consists of two photons.\n\n*   **Photons:**\n    *   They are massless, so their energy `E_γ` and momentum `p_γ` are related by `E_γ = p_γ * c`.\n    *   The problem states their energies are equal: `E_γ1 = E_γ2 = E_γ`.\n    *   One photon moves \"upper-right\" and the other \"lower-right\". Let's say the first photon moves at an angle `θ` to the x-axis, and the second at an angle `φ`.\n\n*   **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   `E_initial = E_final`\n    *   `6 * m_e * c² = E_γ1 + E_γ2 = 2 * E_γ`\n    *   `E_γ = 3 * m_e * c²` (This is the energy of each photon).\n\n*   **Apply Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   The momentum of each photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c = 3 * m_e * c`.\n    *   **y-direction:**\n        *   `P_initial_y = P_final_y`\n        *   `0 = p_γ * sin(θ) + p_γ * sin(φ)`\n        *   `sin(θ) = -sin(φ)`, which means `θ = -φ`. This confirms our intuition: the angles with the horizontal axis are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, which matches the \"upper-right\" and \"lower-right\" description.\n    *   **x-direction:**\n        *   `P_initial_x = P_final_x`\n        *   `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(-θ)`\n        *   Since `cos(-θ) = cos(θ)`, the equation becomes:\n        *   `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)`\n\n**4. Solve for the Angle**\n\nNow we substitute the value of `p_γ` into the momentum conservation equation.\n\n*   `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 2 * (3 * m_e * c) * cos(θ)`\n*   `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ)`\n\nWe can cancel `m_e * c` from both sides:\n\n*   `sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 6 * cos(θ)`\n*   `cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`\n\nNow, we compute the value of `θ`. The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is `θ - (-θ) = 2θ`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of cos(theta)\ncos_theta = (math.sqrt(15) - math.sqrt(3)) / 6\n\n# Calculate theta in radians\ntheta_rad = math.acos(cos_theta)\n\n# Convert theta to degrees\ntheta_deg = math.degrees(theta_rad)\n\n# The angle between the photons is 2*theta\nangle_between_photons = 2 * theta_deg\n\nprint(angle_between_photons)\n```\n>138.1920703632902\n\nThe calculated angle between the two photons is approximately 138.19 degrees. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",

The core principles to apply are the conservation of total energy and the conservation of total momentum. Since the speeds are relativistic (indicated by Lorentz factors γ > 1), we must use relativistic formulas.\n\n2.  **Define the Initial State (Before Annihilation):**\n    *   The system consists of an electron (e-) and a positron (e+).\n    *   Rest mass of electron = Rest mass of positron = `m_e`.\n    *   Speed of light = `c`.\n    *   Let the motion be along the x-axis.\n\n    **Electron (e-):**\n    *   Moves left to right (+x direction).\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ_e = 4`.\n    *   Relativistic energy: `E_e = γ_e * m_e * c² = 4 * m_e * c²`.\n    *   Relativistic momentum `p_e`: We use the energy-momentum relation `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\n        *   `p_e² * c² = E_e² - (m_e * c²)² = (4 * m_e * c²)² - (m_e * c²)² = 16(m_e*c²)² - 1(m_e*c²)² = 15(m_e*c²)²`\n        *   `p_e = sqrt(15) * m_e * c`.\n        *   Momentum vector: `P_e = (sqrt(15) * m_e * c, 0)`.\n\n    **Positron (e+):**\n    *   Moves right to left (-x direction).\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ_p = 2`.\n    *   Relativistic energy: `E_p = γ_p * m_e * c² = 2 * m_e * c²`.\n    *   Relativistic momentum `p_p`:\n        *   `p_p² * c² = E_p² - (m_e * c²)² = (2 * m_e * c²)² - (m_e * c²)² = 4(m_e*c²)² - 1(m_e*c²)² = 3(m_e*c²)²`\n        *   `p_p = sqrt(3) * m_e * c`.\n        *   Momentum vector: `P_p = (-sqrt(3) * m_e * c, 0)`.\n\n    **Total Initial System:**\n    *   Total Energy `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4*m_e*c² + 2*m_e*c² = 6 * m_e * c²`.\n    *   Total Momentum `P_initial = P_e + P_p`.\n        *   x-component: `P_initial_x = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c`.\n        *   y-component: `P_initial_y = 0`.\n\n3.  **Define the Final State (After Annihilation):**\n    *   The system consists of two photons (γ1, γ2).\n    *   The problem states their energies are equal: `E_γ1 = E_γ2 = E_γ`.\n    *   One photon moves upper-right, the other lower-right. Let the angle of the first photon with the +x axis be `θ`, and the second be `-θ`. This is because the initial y-momentum is zero, so the final y-momenta must cancel out.\n    *   For a photon, energy and momentum are related by `E = pc`. So, the magnitude of momentum for each photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c`.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n\n    **Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   `E_initial = E_final`\n    *   `6 * m_e * c² = E_γ1 + E_γ2 = 2 * E_γ`\n    *   This gives the energy of each photon: `E_γ = 3 * m_e * c²`.\n\n    **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   The momentum of each photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c = 3 * m_e * c`.\n    *   `P_initial = P_final`\n    *   **y-component:**\n        *   `0 = p_γ * sin(θ) + p_γ * sin(-θ) = p_γ * sin(θ) - p_γ * sin(θ) = 0`. This is consistent with our choice of angles `θ` and `-θ`.\n    *   **x-component:**\n        *   `P_initial_x = P_final_x`\n        *   `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(-θ)`\n        *   Since `cos(-θ) = cos(θ)`, this becomes: `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)`.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Angle:**\n    *   Substitute the value of `p_γ = 3 * m_e * c` into the momentum equation:\n        *   `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 2 * (3 * m_e * c) * cos(θ)`\n    *   Cancel `m_e * c` from both sides:\n        *   `sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 6 * cos(θ)`\n    *   Solve for `cos(θ)`:\n        *   `cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`\n\n    The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is `θ - (-θ) = 2θ`. We first find `θ` and then double it.\n\n    **Calculation:**\n    *   `sqrt(15) ≈ 3.873`\n    *   `sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732`\n    *   `cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568`\n    *   `θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1` degrees.\n    *   The angle between the photons is `2θ ≈ 2 * 69.1 = 138.2` degrees.\n\n    This value is very close to option B. Let's use the exact values for a precise calculation.\n    (The code execution confirms the calculation)\n    `cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`\n    `θ = arccos((sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6)`\n    `Angle = 2 * θ = 2 * arccos((sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6) ≈ 138.19°`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The calculated angle is approximately 138 degrees.\n\n<<<B>>>"
