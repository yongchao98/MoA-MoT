  "response_list": [
    "*   **Step 1: Identify the structure of Compound X from the spectroscopic data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   The very broad absorption from **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid dimer.\n        *   The strong absorption at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the C=O bond stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The absorptions at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are typical for C=C stretches within an aromatic ring.\n        *   Conclusion from IR: The compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This signal, being a broad singlet and very far downfield, is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-CO**H**). This confirms the IR data.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm), each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the 7.2 ppm doublet corresponds to the protons adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   **Alkyl Group Analysis (from 0.9 to 2.9 ppm):**\n            *   Let's piece together the alkyl chain based on the signals and their splitting patterns.\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3H is a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-). So we have a -CH₂-CH₃ fragment (an ethyl group).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3H is a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-). So we have a -CH-CH₃ fragment.\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** This multiplet corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) from the ethyl fragment. It's a multiplet because it's split by both the adjacent -CH₃ (from the ethyl group) and the methine (-CH-) group it must also be attached to.\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** This multiplet corresponds to the methine group (-CH-). Its downfield shift indicates it is the benzylic proton (directly attached to the aromatic ring). It's a multiplet because it is being split by the protons of the two groups attached to it: the methyl group (-CH₃ at 1.4 ppm) and the methylene group (-CH₂- at 1.7 ppm).\n            *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** The benzylic carbon (-CH- at 2.9 ppm) is attached to both a methyl group (-CH₃ at 1.4 ppm) and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃ at 1.7 and 0.9 ppm). This structure is -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃), which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:**\n        *   Combining all the pieces, Compound X is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl group in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n        *   The structure is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the product of the reaction.**\n\n    *   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reaction:** This combination of reagents is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to methyl groups (-CH₃). It will also reduce alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones to alkanes, but it does not typically reduce the aromatic ring itself under these conditions.\n    *   **Transformation:** The starting material, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, will undergo reduction of its carboxylic acid group.\n        *   -COOH group is converted to a -CH₃ group.\n        *   The sec-butyl group and the aromatic ring remain unchanged.\n    *   **Final Product:** The product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Match the final product to the given options.**\n\n    *   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material, not the product.\n    *   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n    *   C) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: This matches our predicted product.\n    *   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: This structure is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
