    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Analyze the concept of density.** Density is defined as mass divided by volume (ρ = M/V). For a spherical planet, the volume is V = (4/3)πR³, where R is the radius.\n\n2.  **Evaluate each option:**\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is our reference point. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. Let's denote its mass as M_E and its radius as R_E. The density is ρ_E = M_E / V_E.\n\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The problem explicitly states its density is ~5.5 g/cm³, which is almost identical to Earth's density.\n\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This describes a \"Super-Earth\". A key principle in planetary science is that for planets with the same composition, increasing the mass leads to greater gravitational compression. The planet's gravity pulls its own material inward more strongly, squeezing the rock and metal into a smaller volume than they would otherwise occupy. This effect increases the overall density. Therefore, a 5-Earth-mass planet with the same composition as Earth will be significantly denser than Earth. Its radius will be larger than Earth's, but not proportionally larger to its mass, resulting in a higher density.\n\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** This describes a \"sub-Earth\". Following the same logic as in (c), a less massive planet will have weaker gravity and therefore less gravitational compression. Its material will be less squeezed together. Consequently, a planet with half of Earth's mass but the same composition will be less dense than Earth.\n\n3.  **Compare the densities:**\n    *   Planet (a): Density ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Planet (b): Density ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   Planet (c): Density will be > 5.51 g/cm³ due to gravitational compression.\n    *   Planet (d): Density will be < 5.51 g/cm³ due to lower gravitational compression.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The planet in option (c) is the most massive among those with Earth-like composition. This higher mass results in greater gravitational compression, leading to the highest density. The planet in option (b) has a similar density to Earth, and the planet in option (d) has a lower density.\n\nTherefore, the planet with 5 Earth masses has the highest density.\n\n<<<B>>>"
