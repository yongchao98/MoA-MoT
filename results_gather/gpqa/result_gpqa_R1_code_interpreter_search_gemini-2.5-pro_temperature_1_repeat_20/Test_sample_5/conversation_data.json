    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Potential:**\n    The given potential is in polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$:\n    $V(r, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} kr^2 + \\frac{3}{2} kr^2 \\cos^2(\\theta)$\n\n    The Schrödinger equation is generally difficult to solve directly in this form. A common strategy is to switch to Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$ to see if the potential simplifies.\n\n2.  **Convert to Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    The relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\n    $x = r \\cos(\\theta)$\n    $y = r \\sin(\\theta)$\n    $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$\n\n    Substitute these into the potential expression:\n    $V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} k(x^2 + y^2) + \\frac{3}{2} k(r \\cos(\\theta))^2$\n    Since $x = r \\cos(\\theta)$, we have $x^2 = r^2 \\cos^2(\\theta)$.\n    $V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} k(x^2 + y^2) + \\frac{3}{2} kx^2$\n\n    Now, group the terms with $x^2$ and $y^2$:\n    $V(x, y) = (\\frac{1}{2} k + \\frac{3}{2} k)x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} ky^2$\n    $V(x, y) = (\\frac{4}{2} k)x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} ky^2$\n    $V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \\frac{1}{2} ky^2$\n\n3.  **Identify the Separable System:**\n    The potential in Cartesian coordinates, $V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \\frac{1}{2} ky^2$, is the sum of two independent potentials: one that depends only on $x$ and one that depends only on $y$.\n    $V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)$\n    where:\n    $V_x(x) = 2kx^2$\n    $V_y(y) = \\frac{1}{2}ky^2$\n\n    Both $V_x(x)$ and $V_y(y)$ are the potentials of a simple harmonic oscillator. This means the system is a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator.\n\n4.  **Solve the Schrödinger Equation:**\n    Because the potential is separable, the time-independent Schrödinger equation is separable. The total Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ is the sum of two independent one-dimensional Hamiltonians:\n    $\\hat{H} = \\hat{H}_x + \\hat{H}_y$\n    where $\\hat{H}_x = \\frac{\\hat{p}_x^2}{2m} + V_x(x)$ and $\\hat{H}_y = \\frac{\\hat{p}_y^2}{2m} + V_y(y)$.\n\n    The total energy $E$ is the sum of the energies of the two independent oscillators:\n    $E = E_x + E_y$\n\n5.  **Find the Energy Spectrum for Each Oscillator:**\n    The energy spectrum for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with potential $V(q) = \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2q^2$ is given by $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n=0, 1, 2, ...$.\n\n    *   **For the x-oscillator:**\n        $V_x(x) = 2kx^2 = \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega_x^2x^2$\n        Comparing the two forms, we get:\n        $\\frac{1}{2}m\\omega_x^2 = 2k \\implies \\omega_x^2 = \\frac{4k}{m} \\implies \\omega_x = \\sqrt{\\frac{4k}{m}} = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n        The energy eigenvalues for the x-motion are:\n        $E_{n_x} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega_x = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar \\left(2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}\\right)$\n\n    *   **For the y-oscillator:**\n        $V_y(y) = \\frac{1}{2}ky^2 = \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega_y^2y^2$\n        Comparing the two forms, we get:\n        $\\frac{1}{2}m\\omega_y^2 = \\frac{1}{2}k \\implies \\omega_y^2 = \\frac{k}{m} \\implies \\omega_y = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n        The energy eigenvalues for the y-motion are:\n        $E_{n_y} = (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega_y = (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\n6.  **Combine for the Total Energy Spectrum:**\n    The total energy $E$ is the sum of $E_{n_x}$ and $E_{n_y}$:\n    $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar \\left(2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}\\right) + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\n    Factor out the common term $\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$:\n    $E = \\left[ 2(n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\right] \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n    $E = \\left[ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + \\frac{1}{2} \\right] \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n    $E = \\left( 2n_x + n_y + \\frac{3}{2} \\right) \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived energy spectrum is $E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) \\hbar\\sqrt{k/m}$.\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) $E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) \\hbar\\sqrt{k/m})$\n    B) $E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) \\hbar\\sqrt{k/m})$\n    C) $E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)\\hbar\\sqrt{k/m}$\n    D) $E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) \\hbar\\sqrt{k/m})$\n\n    The result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
