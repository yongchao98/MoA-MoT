    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the best answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein, which is encoded by the target gene. To eliminate the compound, we need to inactivate the protein. The most effective way to do this is to introduce a mutation that makes the gene produce a non-functional or completely absent protein.\n\n2.  **Understand the Gene and Translation:** The gene sequence starts with `5’-ATG...`, which is the start codon for translation (coding for Methionine). It ends with `...TGA-3’`, which is a stop codon, signaling the end of translation. The protein is built by reading the DNA sequence in groups of three bases (codons) from `ATG` to `TGA`.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Types of Mutations and Their Impact:**\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** A single base change that results in a codon for a *different* amino acid. This might change the protein's function, or it might have little to no effect. It's not a guaranteed way to eliminate function.\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** A base change that results in a *stop codon* (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This causes translation to halt prematurely, resulting in a shortened (truncated) protein that is almost always non-functional. This is a very effective way to knock out a gene.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation (Insertion/Deletion):** The insertion or deletion of a number of bases that is not a multiple of three. This shifts the entire reading frame for the rest of the gene. All codons after the mutation are read incorrectly, leading to a completely different and usually non-functional amino acid sequence, which typically ends in an early, unintended stop codon. This is also a very effective way to knock out a gene.\n\n4.  **Analyze Each Mutant:** We will determine the type and effect of each mutation by comparing it to the intact gene. We'll read the sequences in codons (groups of three).\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:** `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...`\n        *   Amino Acid Sequence: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `ATG TTC TAC GCT...`\n        *   Comparison: The second codon `TTT` becomes `TTC` (both code for Phe, a silent change). The third codon `CTC` (Leu) becomes `TAC` (Tyr).\n        *   Mutation Type: **Missense mutation**.\n        *   Effect: It changes one amino acid (Leucine to Tyrosine). This might inactivate the protein, but it is not guaranteed.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `ATG TTC TAA GCT...`\n        *   Comparison: The third codon `CTC` (Leu) has been changed to `TAA`.\n        *   Mutation Type: **Nonsense mutation**. `TAA` is a stop codon.\n        *   Effect: Translation will stop after the second amino acid (Phe). The resulting \"protein\" will be just two amino acids long (Met-Phe). This protein will be completely non-functional. This is a definitive knockout.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n        *   Comparison: This sequence is 3 bases longer than the intact sequence fragment. An insertion of 3 bases (one codon) would not cause a frameshift but would add an extra amino acid. However, the sequence itself shows multiple other changes besides a clean insertion. Regardless of the exact mechanism, it causes major changes to the protein sequence. It is likely a knockout, but the nature of the mutation is complex.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n        *   Comparison: This sequence is 1 base shorter than the intact sequence fragment. This indicates a deletion of one base.\n        *   Mutation Type: **Frameshift mutation**.\n        *   Effect: Deleting a single base will shift the reading frame, garbling all subsequent amino acids. This is also a definitive knockout.\n\n5.  **Conclusion - Selecting the Best Option:**\n    We have three mutations that are very likely to eliminate the protein's function: Mutant 2 (Nonsense), Mutant 3 (complex/insertion), and Mutant 4 (Frameshift). Mutant 1 (Missense) is the least likely to work.\n\n    Between the three strong candidates, the nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most direct and unambiguous way to terminate protein production. It introduces a clear STOP signal (`TAA`) at the very beginning of the gene (the third codon). This guarantees that only a useless dipeptide is formed. While frameshifts are also effective, the nonsense mutation is the most straightforward and certain \"off switch\" among the choices. Therefore, it is the mutation that will *most probably* let you eliminate the compound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
