    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Geometry of the Aperture:**\n    The problem describes an N-sided regular polygon where all apothems have the same length 'a'. The apothem is the line segment from the center of a regular polygon to the midpoint of a side. As the number of sides, N, becomes infinitely large (N → ∞), a regular polygon approaches a circle. In this limit, the apothem 'a' of the polygon becomes the radius of the circle.\n    Therefore, the aperture can be treated as a circular aperture of radius `R = a`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Physical Phenomenon:**\n    When monochromatic light passes through an aperture and the diffraction pattern is observed in the far-field region (or at the focal plane of a lens), this phenomenon is known as Fraunhofer diffraction. For a circular aperture, the resulting diffraction pattern is called an Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n\n3.  **Determine the Positions of Intensity Minima:**\n    The intensity distribution for Fraunhofer diffraction by a circular aperture of radius `R` is given by:\n    `I(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(k * R * sin(θ)) / (k * R * sin(θ))]²`\n    where:\n    *   `I₀` is the maximum intensity at the center.\n    *   `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n    *   `k = 2π / λ` is the wave number, with `λ` being the wavelength of the light.\n    *   `R` is the radius of the aperture (which is `a` in our case).\n    *   `θ` is the angular position from the central axis.\n\n    The intensity minima (dark rings) occur when the numerator is zero, which means `J₁(k * R * sin(θ)) = 0`. Let `u = k * R * sin(θ)`. The minima correspond to the zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(u)`.\n\n4.  **Find the Zeros of the Bessel Function:**\n    We need the first two non-zero roots of the equation `J₁(u) = 0`. These values are well-known:\n    *   First zero: `u₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n    *   Second zero: `u₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Angular Positions of the First Two Minima:**\n    The condition for the n-th minimum is `k * R * sin(θₙ) = uₙ`.\n    Substituting `k = 2π / λ` and `R = a`, we get:\n    `(2π / λ) * a * sin(θₙ) = uₙ`\n    Solving for `sin(θₙ)`:\n    `sin(θₙ) = (uₙ * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\n    The problem states we can use the small-angle approximation, `sin(θ) ≈ θ`.\n    So, the angular position of the n-th minimum is:\n    `θₙ = (uₙ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n    *   **Angular position of the first minimum (θ₁):**\n        `θ₁ = (u₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a) = (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n\n    *   **Angular position of the second minimum (θ₂):**\n        `θ₂ = (u₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a) = (7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Angular Distance Between the First Two Minima:**\n    The angular distance is the difference between the angular positions of the second and first minima:\n    `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`\n    `Δθ = [1.1166 * (λ / a)] - [0.6098 * (λ / a)]`\n    `Δθ = (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ / a)`\n    `Δθ = 0.5068 * (λ / a)`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated angular distance is approximately `0.5068 λ / a`. This value is closest to option B.\n\nTo get a more precise value, we can use a Python script to find the zeros of the Bessel function and perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport scipy.special\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Get the first two zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, order 1 (J1)\n# The function jn_zeros returns the first 'n' positive zeros.\nzeros = scipy.special.jn_zeros(1, 2)\nu1 = zeros[0]\nu2 = zeros[1]\n\n# The angular position of the n-th minimum is given by theta_n = (u_n / (2*pi)) * (lambda / a)\n# We need to calculate the coefficient for the angular distance.\n# The angular distance is delta_theta = theta_2 - theta_1 = ((u2 - u1) / (2*pi)) * (lambda / a)\ncoefficient = (u2 - u1) / (2 * np.pi)\n\nprint(f\"{coefficient:.3f}\")\n```\n<execute_output>\n0.507\n</execute_output>\n\nThe calculation gives a coefficient of 0.507. Comparing this with the given options:\n\nA) 0.610 λ / a\nB) 0.506 λ / a\nC) 0.500 λ / a\nD) 1.220 λ / a\n\nThe value 0.507 is closest to 0.506. The slight difference is due to rounding in the option. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture Geometry:**\n    The problem describes an N-sided regular polygon where the apothem (the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side) is a constant length 'a'. We are asked to consider the case where the number of sides, N, becomes infinitely large (N → ∞).\n    As N approaches infinity, a regular polygon with a constant apothem approaches a circle. The apothem of the polygon becomes the radius of this limiting circle.\n    Therefore, the aperture can be modeled as a circular aperture of radius `R = a`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Physical Phenomenon:**\n    The problem describes a monochromatic light wave passing through an aperture and forming an intensity pattern in the \"far-field region\". This is the classic setup for Fraunhofer diffraction. The diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central spot (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n\n3.  **Locate the Intensity Minima:**\n    The intensity distribution for Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture of radius `R` is given by the formula:\n    `I(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(k * R * sin(θ)) / (k * R * sin(θ))]²`\n    where:\n    *   `I₀` is the maximum intensity at the center of the pattern (θ = 0).\n    *   `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n    *   `k = 2π / λ` is the wave number of the light.\n    *   `R` is the radius of the circular aperture (in our case, `R = a`).\n    *   `θ` is the angular position measured from the central axis.\n\n    The intensity minima (the dark rings) occur at angles `θ` where the numerator is zero, i.e., `J₁(k * R * sin(θ)) = 0`.\n    Let `x = k * R * sin(θ)`. The minima correspond to the values of `x` that are the zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`, excluding `x=0`.\n\n4.  **Find the Zeros of the Bessel Function:**\n    We need to find the first two positive zeros of the `J₁(x)` function. These are well-established mathematical constants:\n    *   First zero (`x₁`): `x₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n    *   Second zero (`x₂`): `x₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Angular Positions of the Minima:**\n    The condition for the n-th minimum is `k * R * sin(θₙ) = xₙ`.\n    Substituting `k = 2π / λ` and `R = a`, we get:\n    `(2π / λ) * a * sin(θₙ) = xₙ`\n    The problem states we can use the small-angle approximation, `sin(θ) ≈ θ`. So:\n    `(2π / λ) * a * θₙ = xₙ`\n    Solving for the angular position `θₙ`:\n    `θₙ = (xₙ * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\n    *   The angular position of the **first minimum** (`θ₁`) is:\n        `θ₁ = (x₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a) = (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n        *(Note: `1.22/2 = 0.61`, which is why the diameter `D=2a` is often used in the formula `θ₁ ≈ 1.22 λ/D`)*\n\n    *   The angular position of the **second minimum** (`θ₂`) is:\n        `θ₂ = (x₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a) = (7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Angular Distance:**\n    The angular distance between the first two minima is the difference between their angular positions:\n    `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`\n    `Δθ = [ (x₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ] - [ (x₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ]`\n    `Δθ = ( (x₂ - x₁) / (2π) ) * (λ / a)`\n    `Δθ = ( (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π) ) * (λ / a)`\n    `Δθ = ( 3.1839 / (2π) ) * (λ / a)`\n    `Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)`\n\n7.  **Compare with Code Output and Options:**\n    The previous Python code execution calculated the coefficient `(x₂ - x₁) / (2π)` more precisely and returned `0.507`.\n    So, the angular distance is `Δθ ≈ 0.507 * (λ / a)`.\n    Let's compare this result with the given options:\n    A) 0.610 λ / a\n    B) 0.506 λ / a\n    C) 0.500 λ / a\n    D) 1.220 λ /a\n\n    The calculated value `0.507 λ / a` is extremely close to `0.506 λ / a`. The minor discrepancy is due to the rounding of the value in the option. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
