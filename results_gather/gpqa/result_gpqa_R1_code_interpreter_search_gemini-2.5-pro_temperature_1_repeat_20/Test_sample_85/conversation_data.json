    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Product and its Precursor**\n\n*   The product in both reactions is a substituted lactone: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   \"pyran\" indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   \"tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\" (also known as δ-valerolactone or oxan-2-one) is a saturated six-membered ring lactone.\n*   The structure is: a ring made of O(1)-C(2)(=O)-C(3)H2-C(4)H(Et)-C(5)H2-C(6)H2-. The chiral center is C4.\n*   Lactones are formed by the intramolecular esterification of hydroxycarboxylic acids. A six-membered lactone (a δ-lactone) is formed from a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid.\n*   To find the precursor, we conceptually break the ester bond in the lactone (between O(1) and C(2)). This adds a hydroxyl group (-OH) to C6 and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to C2.\n*   The resulting open-chain hydroxycarboxylic acid is: HOOC(at C2)-C(3)H2-C(4)H(Et)-C(5)H2-C(6)H2-OH.\n*   Renumbering this according to IUPAC rules for carboxylic acids (C in COOH is C1), the structure is: HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)-OH.\n*   The name of this precursor is **3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid**. The chiral center is at C3.\n*   Lactonization is an intramolecular reaction that does not affect the stereocenter. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the lactone product is the same as the stereochemistry of the hydroxy acid precursor (i.e., (R)-lactone from (R)-hydroxy acid, and (S)-lactone from (S)-hydroxy acid).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Starting Material and Reagents**\n\n*   The starting materials given in the options are enantiomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   This name describes a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid.\n*   The structure is: HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOR' (where R' = isobutyl, -CH2CH(CH3)2).\n*   The starting material has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an ester group (-COOR'). It has one chiral center at C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group).\n*   The two reactions use different reducing agents with different selectivities:\n    *   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride):** Selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **BH3 (Borane):** Selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Product goal:** (R)-lactone, which requires the formation of (R)-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid.\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH4 reduces the ester group (-COOR') of the starting material to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), leaving the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) intact.\n    HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOR'  --(LiBH4)--> HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction itself does not change the atoms bonded to the chiral center, but it changes one of the substituent groups, which can change its Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority, potentially inverting the R/S designation.\n    *   **Starting Material (A):** HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOR'. The groups at the chiral center C3 are: -H, -Et, -CH2COOH, and -CH2COOR'. The CIP priorities are: P1: -CH2COOR' > P2: -CH2COOH > P3: -Et.\n    *   **Hydroxy Acid Product:** HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH. The groups at C3 are: -H, -Et, -CH2COOH, and -CH2CH2OH. The CIP priorities are: P'1: -CH2COOH > P'2: -CH2CH2OH > P'3: -Et.\n    *   **Analysis:** The group that was priority 2 in the starting material (-CH2COOH) becomes priority 1 in the product. The group that was priority 1 (-CH2COOR') becomes part of the group that is now priority 2 (-CH2CH2OH). This swapping of the top two priorities inverts the stereochemical designation.\n    *   Therefore: (S)-Starting Material → (R)-Hydroxy Acid → (R)-Lactone.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Product goal:** (S)-lactone. Lactonization will occur during the acidic workup (H+). The intermediate formed after BH3 reduction must lead to the (S)-lactone.\n*   **Mechanism:** BH3 selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), leaving the ester group (-COOR') intact.\n    HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOR' --(BH3)--> HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOR'\n    This intermediate is a hydroxy-ester. Upon H+ workup, it undergoes intramolecular transesterification (lactonization) to form the same lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Let's analyze the priority changes.\n    *   **Starting Material (B):** HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOR'. Priorities at C3: P1: -CH2COOR' > P2: -CH2COOH > P3: -Et.\n    *   **Hydroxy-Ester Intermediate:** HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOR'. The groups at C3 are: -H, -Et, -CH2CH2OH, and -CH2COOR'. The CIP priorities are: P''1: -CH2COOR' > P''2: -CH2CH2OH > P''3: -Et.\n    *   **Analysis:** The group that was P1 (-CH2COOR') remains P''1. The group that was P2 (-CH2COOH) becomes P''2 (-CH2CH2OH), but the priority order P''1 > P''2 is maintained. Since the relative priority order of the substituents does not change, the stereochemical designation is retained.\n    *   Therefore: (S)-Starting Material → (S)-Hydroxy-Ester → (S)-Lactone.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material A must be the (S)-enantiomer.\n*   Starting material B must also be the (S)-enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
