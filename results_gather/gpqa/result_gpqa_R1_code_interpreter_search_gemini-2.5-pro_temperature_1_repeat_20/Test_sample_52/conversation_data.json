    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **Compound Type:** The problem states we have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This is a benzene ring with two substituents.\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** An absorption peak for an ester group (-COO-) is present.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** This provides the most detailed structural information.\n    *   **Six signals total:** This is the total number of distinct proton environments in the molecule.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons (C₆H₄). For these 4 protons to give only two signals, there must be symmetry. This strongly indicates a **para (1,4) substitution pattern**, where protons opposite each other are equivalent.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H:** Vinyl protons are attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n        *   One signal is a **doublet (d)**. This means it's coupled to only one adjacent proton.\n        *   The other is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. This means it's coupled to one adjacent proton (giving the doublet splitting) and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet splitting). A group of three equivalent protons is a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n        *   This splitting pattern (d and dq) is characteristic of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**.\n            *   `Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH₃`\n            *   H(a) is split by H(b) into a doublet.\n            *   H(b) is split by H(a) into a doublet, and by the -CH₃ group into a quartet, resulting in a doublet of quartets. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups:**\n        *   One -CH₃ signal belongs to the propenyl group we just identified.\n        *   The second -CH₃ signal must belong to the ester group.\n    *   **No signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a crucial constraint. It eliminates possibilities like an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or other longer alkyl chains.\n\n**2. Piece Together the Molecular Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis, we can assemble the molecule's components:\n\n*   A **para-substituted benzene ring** (C₆H₄).\n*   **Substituent 1:** A **propenyl group** (-CH=CH-CH₃). This accounts for one of the -CH₃ signals and the two vinyl-H signals. Its formula fragment is C₃H₅.\n*   **Substituent 2:** An **ester group** that contains the second -CH₃ signal but no -CH₂ group. There are two main possibilities:\n    1.  A **methyl ester group** attached to the ring: `-COOCH₃`.\n    2.  An **acetoxy group** attached to the ring: `-O-CO-CH₃`.\n\nBoth of these ester fragments contain one methyl group and no methylene group, fitting the data.\n\n**3. Determine the Molecular Formula**\n\nNow, let's calculate the total molecular formula by summing the atoms from the core and the substituents. We can use either of the two possible structures derived in the previous step, as they will be isomers and have the same formula.\n\n*   **Core:** para-substituted benzene ring → `C₆H₄`\n*   **Substituent 1:** propenyl group → `C₃H₅`\n*   **Substituent 2:** ester fragment with one methyl group (e.g., `-COOCH₃` or `-O-CO-CH₃`) → `C₂H₃O₂`\n\n**Total Formula Calculation:**\n\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester's methyl) = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester) = **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**4. Verify with the Options**\n\nLet's check this result against the given choices:\nA) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\nB) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\nC) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\nD) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n\nOur calculated formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, matches option D.\n\n**Verification using Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n\nThe DBE for a formula CₐHₙOₙ is calculated as `DBE = a - b/2 + 1`.\n*   For our deduced structure: 1 aromatic ring (4 DBE) + 1 C=C double bond (1 DBE) + 1 C=O double bond (1 DBE) = **6 DBE**.\n*   For the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂: `DBE = 11 - 12/2 + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = 6`.\nThe DBE matches, confirming our structural analysis and the resulting formula are consistent. The other options either have the wrong DBE (A and C) or cannot be reconciled with the NMR data without violating the given constraints (B).\n\n<<<D>>>"
