    "This problem requires us to calculate the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) from the dissociation of a Ca-EDTA complex solution.\n\n**1. Understand the Equilibrium**\n\nWe start with a solution of 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. This complex will partially dissociate into its constituent ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA (which we'll denote as $Y^{4-}$ for simplicity, assuming ideal pH where it's fully deprotonated).\n\nThe formation reaction is:\n$Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$\n\nThe formation constant ($K_f$) for this reaction is given as:\n$K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\nSince we are starting with the complex and want to find the concentration of the free ions, it's more intuitive to consider the dissociation reaction, which is the reverse of the formation:\n$[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this dissociation ($K_d$) is the inverse of the formation constant:\n$K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n**2. Set up an ICE Table**\n\nWe can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations. Let 'x' be the change in concentration due to dissociation.\n\n| Species         | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|-----------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| $[CaY]^{2-}$    | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$       | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $Y^{4-}$        | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n**3. Solve the Equilibrium Expression**\n\nNow, we plug the equilibrium concentrations into the dissociation constant expression:\n$K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}{[[CaY]^{2-}]}$\n$2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{0.02 - x}$\n\n**4. Make a Simplifying Assumption**\n\nBecause the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large, the dissociation constant ($K_d$) is very small. This implies that the complex barely dissociates, and 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. Therefore, we can simplify the denominator:\n$0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\nThe equation becomes:\n$2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\n**5. Calculate x**\n\nNow, we solve for 'x', which represents the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$.\n\n$x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times 0.02$\n$x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n$x \\approx \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n$x \\approx \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}}$\n$x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches option B.\n\nLet's confirm the calculation with a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Formation constant\nK_f = 5e10\n# Initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex\ninitial_conc = 0.02\n\n# The dissociation constant is the inverse of the formation constant\nK_d = 1 / K_f\n\n# The equilibrium expression for dissociation is Kd = x^2 / (initial_conc - x)\n# We assume x is very small, so Kd ≈ x^2 / initial_conc\n# Therefore, x^2 ≈ Kd * initial_conc\n# And x = sqrt(Kd * initial_conc)\n\nx_squared = K_d * initial_conc\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"The concentration of calcium ions is approximately {x:.2e} M.\")\n```\nThe code confirms the manual calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The reasoning and calculation are as follows:\n\n1.  **Define the Chemical Equilibrium:** The problem involves the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex, represented by the formula $[CaY]^{2-}$, where Y represents the EDTA tetra-anion. The equilibrium reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Determine the Equilibrium Constant:** The problem provides the formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$), which is for the reaction $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$.\n    $K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n    The equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction ($K_d$) is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n3.  **Set Up an ICE Table:** We use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the concentrations of the species at equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ that forms from the dissociation of the complex.\n\n| Species         | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|-----------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| $[CaY]^{2-}$    | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$       | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $Y^{4-}$        | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n4.  **Write the Equilibrium Expression:** We write the expression for the dissociation constant, $K_d$, using the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table.\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}{[[CaY]^{2-}]}$\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{0.02 - x}$\n\n5.  **Simplify and Solve for x:** Because the formation constant is very large, the dissociation constant $K_d$ is extremely small. This indicates that the equilibrium lies far to the left, and very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the simplifying assumption that $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n    Now, solve for x:\n    $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (0.02)$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x \\approx \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is x, which is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This value matches option B. The code output confirmed this calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
