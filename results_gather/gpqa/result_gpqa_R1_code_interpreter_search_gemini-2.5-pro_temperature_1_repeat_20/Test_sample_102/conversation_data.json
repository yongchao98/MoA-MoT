    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent ring is benzene.\n*   It has three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   All three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), existing substituents on the benzene ring direct incoming electrophiles to specific positions.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and *meta*-directing.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating and *ortho, para*-directing.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and *meta*-directing.\n\n**3. Evaluate Potential Synthetic Strategies**\n\nThe goal is a \"high-yield synthesis,\" which means each step should be efficient and selective, avoiding the formation of significant amounts of isomeric byproducts.\n\nA logical direct approach would be to introduce the groups one by one onto the benzene ring. The order is crucial.\n\n*   **Strategy 1: Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination**\n    1.  **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 -> Acetophenone:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 -> m-Nitroacetophenone:** The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the meta position (C3). Now we have two groups (-COCH3 and -NO2) that are meta to each other.\n    3.  **m-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 -> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** In m-nitroacetophenone, both the acetyl group (at C1) and the nitro group (at C3) are *meta*-directors. They both direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the same position, C5. This step is highly selective and leads directly to the target product. Although the ring is heavily deactivated, making the reaction slow, the high selectivity makes this a very good route.\n\nThis three-step synthesis is the most logical and high-yield direct route. However, this exact sequence is not presented as an option. The options are longer and more complex, suggesting a different strategy is intended, or that the direct route has a perceived problem.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nLet's analyze each option based on established principles of organic reactions.\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n    1.  Benzene -> Nitrobenzene\n    2.  Nitrobenzene -> Aniline\n    3.  **Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction **fails**. The basic amino group (-NH2) of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring, preventing the acylation reaction. Therefore, **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n    1.  Benzene -> Bromobenzene\n    2.  Bromobenzene -> p-Bromonitrobenzene (major product, as -Br is o,p-directing). This already creates the wrong (para) relationship between Br and NO2.\n    3.  **p-Bromonitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a ring containing a strongly deactivating nitro group. Such reactions are extremely difficult and do not provide good yields. Therefore, **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...**\n    1.  Benzene -> Nitrobenzene\n    2.  Nitrobenzene -> Aniline (reduction)\n    3.  Aniline -> Benzenediazonium salt (diazotization)\n    4.  Benzenediazonium salt -> Benzene (deamination)\n    This sequence of steps (i-iv) starts with benzene and ends with benzene, achieving nothing. Therefore, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n    1.  **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 -> Acetophenone:** This step is correct.\n    2.  **Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 -> m-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group is a *meta*-director, so this step correctly produces the meta-isomer.\n    3.  **m-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 -> ???:** This is the critical step. We have two directing groups on the ring: -COCH3 (at C1, *meta*-directing) and -Br (at C3, *ortho, para*-directing).\n        *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 to position C5.\n        *   The -Br group directs the incoming -NO2 to positions C2, C4, and C6.\n        Because the directing effects are in conflict, this reaction will produce a mixture of isomers (e.g., 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone, 3-bromo-2-nitroacetophenone, 3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone). It is not a high-yield reaction for a single product.\n    However, compared to the other options, this is the only sequence that does not involve a reaction that completely fails (like in A and C) or is logically circular (like in D). The issue with option B is one of selectivity and yield, not impossibility. The additional steps (iv-vii) listed in option B are nonsensical in the context of creating the target molecule and appear to be extraneous or part of a flawed question construction.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy eliminating options A, C, and D, which contain fundamental flaws, Option B remains as the only plausible, albeit imperfect, choice. The synthetic pathway in B is chemically possible, even if it is not optimal for a high-yield synthesis due to the formation of isomers in the nitration step. Given the choices, it is the \"best\" answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
