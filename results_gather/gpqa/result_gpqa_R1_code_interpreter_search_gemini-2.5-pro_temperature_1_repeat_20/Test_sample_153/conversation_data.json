    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with its most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units heavier than the molecular ion peak. The relative abundance ratio of the M+ peak (m/z=156) to the M+2 peak (m/z=158) is 100% to 32%, which is approximately a 3:1 ratio.\n*   **Conclusion:** This characteristic 3:1 ratio for M+ and M+2 peaks is a definitive indicator for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of the isotopes ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%)). The molecular weight of the compound containing the ³⁵Cl isotope is 156 g/mol.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extensive hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers causes this significant broadening.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Given the presence of the broad O-H peak, this carbonyl group is part of the carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Conclusion:** The IR spectrum strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Signal at 11.0 ppm (s, 1H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** A signal appearing far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**).\n    *   **Splitting:** It is a singlet ('s'), which is expected as this proton does not couple with other nearby protons.\n    *   **Integration:** It integrates to one proton ('1H').\n*   **Signals at 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** Both signals are in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). The downfield positions suggest the aromatic ring is attached to electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   **Splitting & Integration:** The pattern of two doublets ('d'), each integrating to two protons ('2H'), is the classic signature of a *para* (1,4-) disubstituted benzene ring. The symmetry of the molecule makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to each other, and the two protons on the other side equivalent to each other, resulting in this simple pattern.\n*   **Conclusion:** The ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid and a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\n**Putting It All Together & Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **From MS:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 (for ³⁵Cl) and contains one chlorine atom.\n*   **From IR & NMR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid.\n*   **From NMR:** The compound contains a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nCombining these findings, the unknown compound is a benzoic acid with a chlorine atom in the *para* (4-) position. This is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\nLet's check why the other options are incorrect:\n*   **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the very broad O-H stretch down to 2700 cm⁻¹ and the carboxylic acid proton signal at 11.0 ppm. Its aromatic ¹H NMR spectrum would also be much more complex (3 signals, not 2).\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted isomer. While it is a carboxylic acid, its ¹H NMR spectrum would show four distinct signals in the aromatic region, not two doublets of 2H each, due to the lack of symmetry.\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an acid chloride. It lacks an O-H group, so it would not show the broad IR peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ or the NMR signal at 11.0 ppm. The carbonyl IR stretch would also be at a much higher frequency (>1770 cm⁻¹).\n\nTherefore, the only structure that fits all the provided spectral data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>"
