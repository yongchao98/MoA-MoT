    "This problem asks for the partition function Z of a system of three spins (S1, S2, S3), where each spin can be +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. The partition function is defined as Z = Σ_states e^(-βE), where β = 1/(kT).\n\nThe system has 3 spins, and each can take 2 values (+1 or -1). Therefore, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states for the system. We need to calculate the energy for each state and then sum their Boltzmann factors (e^(-βE)).\n\nLet's list all 8 possible configurations of (S1, S2, S3) and calculate the corresponding energy for each.\n\nThe energy expression is E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3).\n\nWe can categorize the states by the number of +1 spins.\n\n**Case 1: All spins are the same.**\n*   **(S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1):**\n    The sum of products is S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.\n    The energy is E = -J(3) = -3J.\n*   **(S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1):**\n    The sum of products is S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.\n    The energy is E = -J(3) = -3J.\n\nSo, there are 2 states with energy E = -3J. The contribution of these two states to the partition function is 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) = 2e^(3Jβ).\n\n**Case 2: Two spins are the same, and one is different.**\nThis can be broken down into two sub-cases: two spins are +1 and one is -1, or two spins are -1 and one is +1.\n\n*   **Two spins are +1, one is -1:**\n    Let's take the state (+1, +1, -1) as an example.\n    S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1.\n    The energy is E = -J(-1) = J.\n    There are three such configurations: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), and (-1, +1, +1). All three have the same energy E = J.\n\n*   **Two spins are -1, one is +1:**\n    Let's take the state (-1, -1, +1) as an example.\n    S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1.\n    The energy is E = -J(-1) = J.\n    There are three such configurations: (-1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, -1), and (+1, -1, -1). All three also have the same energy E = J.\n\nIn total, there are 3 + 3 = 6 states with energy E = J. The contribution of these six states to the partition function is 6 * e^(-β(J)) = 6e^(-Jβ).\n\n**Calculating the Partition Function Z:**\nThe total partition function is the sum of the contributions from all possible states.\nZ = (Contribution from states with E = -3J) + (Contribution from states with E = J)\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\n\nOur calculated partition function Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ) matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
