    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2, which is $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2d}}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's bond albedo.\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the radius of the star.\n    *   $d$ is the orbital distance of the planet from the star.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio of Temperatures:** We need to find the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A_1)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2d_1}}}{T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A_2)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2d_2}}}$\n    The problem states that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$), and they orbit the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constant). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/d_1}}{\\sqrt{1/d_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{d_2}{d_1}}$\n    This shows that the ratio of equilibrium temperatures depends on the square root of the inverse ratio of their orbital distances.\n\n4.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Observational Data:** The orbital distances ($d_1$ and $d_2$) are not given directly. We need to derive them from the provided radial velocity (RV) data (the Doppler shifts).\n\n5.  **Radial Velocity Formula:** The maximum radial velocity of the star induced by an orbiting planet (the semi-amplitude, $K$) is given by:\n    $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{1-e^2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{M_{star} + M_p}} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}$\n    Given that the orbits are circular, the eccentricity $e=0$. The problem also states that the planets were detected by the transit method, which implies the inclination angle $i$ is close to 90°, so $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. Also, the planet mass $M_p$ is much smaller than the star's mass $M_{star}$, so $M_{star} + M_p \\approx M_{star}$.\n    The formula simplifies to:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{d}}$\n\n6.  **Derive the Ratio of Orbital Distances:** We can rearrange the simplified formula to solve for $d$:\n    $K^2 \\approx \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_{star} d} \\implies d \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_{star} K^2}$\n    Now, we can find the ratio $d_2 / d_1$:\n    $\\frac{d_2}{d_1} \\approx \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_{star} K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_{star} K_1^2)} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2}{K_2^2} \\cdot \\frac{K_1^2}{M_{p1}^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n7.  **Relate RV Semi-Amplitude (K) to Doppler Shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$):** The Doppler shift formula relates the change in wavelength to the velocity of the source:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$\n    The maximum observed Doppler shift corresponds to the maximum radial velocity, which is the semi-amplitude $K$. So, $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$.\n    The ratio of the semi-amplitudes is therefore:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{c \\cdot \\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\lambda_0}{c \\cdot \\Delta\\lambda_2 / \\lambda_0} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n8.  **Combine the Ratios:** Substitute the ratio of $K$ back into the equation for the ratio of distances:\n    $\\frac{d_2}{d_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2$\n\n9.  **Final Calculation:** Now substitute this expression for $d_2/d_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from step 3:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{d_2}{d_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n    Now, plug in the given values:\n    *   $M_{p1} = 7 M_{earth}$\n    *   $M_{p2} = 5 M_{earth}$\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\frac{5}{7} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n10. **Numerical Result:**\n    $\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n    This value is closest to option A.\n\nLet's confirm the calculation with a short Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\n# Planet 1\nMp1 = 7.0  # Mass in Earth masses\nd_lambda1 = 0.03  # Doppler shift in Angstroms\n\n# Planet 2\nMp2 = 5.0  # Mass in Earth masses\nd_lambda2 = 0.04  # Doppler shift in Angstroms\n\n# Calculate the ratio of masses (Mp2 / Mp1)\nmass_ratio = Mp2 / Mp1\n\n# Calculate the ratio of Doppler shifts (d_lambda1 / d_lambda2)\ndoppler_ratio = d_lambda1 / d_lambda2\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is given by:\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (Mp2 / Mp1) * (d_lambda1 / d_lambda2)\ntemp_ratio = mass_ratio * doppler_ratio\n\nprint(f\"{temp_ratio=}\")\n```\n>>>\nout: temp_ratio=0.5357142857142857\n>>>\n\nThe calculation confirms that the ratio is approximately 0.536.

    "**Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Goal:** Find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet 1 and Planet 2 ($T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$).\n    *   **Given Information:**\n        *   Star properties: Mass ($M_{star} = 1.5 M_{sun}$), Radius ($R_{star} = 1.2 R_{sun}$), Temperature ($T_{star} = 6300 K$).\n        *   Planet 1 properties: Mass ($M_{p1} = 7 M_{earth}$), Radius ($R_{p1} = 1.7 R_{earth}$), max Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å).\n        *   Planet 2 properties: Mass ($M_{p2} = 5 M_{earth}$), Radius ($R_{p2} = 1.3 R_{earth}$), max Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å).\n        *   Shared properties: Both orbit the same star, have circular orbits ($e=0$), and have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). The Doppler shifts are measured on the same spectral line ($\\lambda_0 = 6300$ Å). The detection via the transit method implies we can assume the inclination angle $i \\approx 90°$, so $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio:**\n    *   The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature is: $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2d}}$\n    *   We need the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$:\n        $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A_1)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2d_1}}}{T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A_2)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2d_2}}}$\n    *   Since $T_{star}$, $R_{star}$, and the albedo ($A_1=A_2=A$) are the same for both, they cancel out:\n        $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1 - A)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{1/d_1}}{(1 - A)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{1/d_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{d_2}{d_1}}$\n    *   The problem now boils down to finding the ratio of the orbital distances, $d_2/d_1$.\n\n3.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity (RV) Data:**\n    *   The orbital distances ($d_1$, $d_2$) are not given, but we have information about the Doppler shifts they cause. The maximum Doppler shift is caused by the maximum radial velocity of the star, also known as the RV semi-amplitude, $K$.\n    *   The formula for the RV semi-amplitude is:\n        $K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{(M_{star} + M_p)^{2/3}} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-e^2}}$\n    *   This formula seems complex. Let's try a different approach relating $K$ directly to the orbital distance $d$. The orbital velocity of the planet is $v_p = \\sqrt{G(M_{star}+M_p)/d}$. By conservation of momentum, $M_{star}v_{star} = M_p v_p$. The observed stellar velocity is $v_{star} \\sin(i)$, which is the semi-amplitude $K$. So, $K = \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} v_p \\sin(i)$. For circular orbits, $v_p$ is constant.\n    *   Substituting $v_p$: $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G(M_{star}+M_p)}{d}}$.\n    *   Given that $M_p \\ll M_{star}$, we can approximate $M_{star}+M_p \\approx M_{star}$. Also, since the planets transit, $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n        $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{d}} = \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{\\sqrt{M_{star} d}}$\n    *   Let's solve for $d$:\n        $K^2 \\approx \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_{star} d} \\implies d \\approx \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_{star} K^2}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Distances ($d_2/d_1$):**\n    *   Using the expression for $d$:\n        $\\frac{d_2}{d_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 G / (M_{star} K_2^2)}{M_{p1}^2 G / (M_{star} K_1^2)}$\n    *   The terms $G$ and $M_{star}$ are constant and cancel out:\n        $\\frac{d_2}{d_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n5.  **Relate RV Semi-amplitude ($K$) to the Doppler Shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$):**\n    *   The non-relativistic Doppler shift formula is $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$, where $v_r$ is the radial velocity.\n    *   The maximum Doppler shift corresponds to the maximum radial velocity, so $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$.\n    *   The ratio of the semi-amplitudes is:\n        $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{c \\cdot \\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\lambda_0}{c \\cdot \\Delta\\lambda_2 / \\lambda_0} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n6.  **Combine the Ratios to Find the Final Expression:**\n    *   Substitute the expression for $K_1/K_2$ into the expression for $d_2/d_1$:\n        $\\frac{d_2}{d_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2$\n    *   Now substitute this into the temperature ratio formula from Step 2:\n        $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{d_2}{d_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2}$\n    *   The square root and the squares cancel, leaving a simple expression:\n        $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n    *   Notice that the star's properties ($M_{star}, R_{star}, T_{star}$), planet radii, and even the resting wavelength $\\lambda_0$ were not needed for the final ratio.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   Plug in the given values:\n        *   $M_{p1} = 7 M_{earth}$\n        *   $M_{p2} = 5 M_{earth}$\n        *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n        *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\frac{5}{7} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n    *   $\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated value is ~0.536.\n    *   Option A is ~0.53.\n    *   The result matches option A.\n\nThe Python code generated in the initial step confirms this calculation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe ratio of the equilibrium temperatures, $T_{eq1}/T_{eq2}$, is given by the formula $\\sqrt{d_2/d_1}$, where $d_1$ and $d_2$ are the orbital distances of the planets.\n\nThe orbital distance $d$ is related to the planet mass $M_p$ and the induced stellar radial velocity semi-amplitude $K$ by the approximate relation $d \\propto (M_p/K)^2$.\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$.\n\nCombining these relationships, we find that:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\times \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{5 \\, M_{earth}}{7 \\, M_{earth}} \\times \\frac{0.03 \\, Å}{0.04 \\, Å} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>"
