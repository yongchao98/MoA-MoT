    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Compound's Description:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us we have a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituent groups attached.\n    *   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms (8 - 6 = 2).\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) as well as an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X)\"**: This identifies the nature of the two substituents. One is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) attached directly to the ring. The other substituent must contain the two carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must have the formula C2O. The most common and stable functional group with this composition is an acetyl group: -C(=O)CH3.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a halo-acetophenone.\n\n3.  **Determine the Overall Structure and Isomers:**\n    *   The molecule has the structure X-C6H4-COCH3. The total number of protons is 4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group, for a total of 7 protons.\n    *   The two substituents can be arranged in ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) positions on the benzene ring. We need to analyze the expected 1H NMR for these possibilities.\n\n4.  **Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Acetyl Group (-COCH3):** This methyl group is adjacent to a carbonyl and has no neighboring protons. It will always appear as a **singlet** integrating to **3H**. Its typical chemical shift is in the range of 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are 4 protons on the ring. Their splitting pattern depends on the substitution pattern:\n        *   **Para (1,4-substitution):** This isomer is symmetrical. It has two sets of chemically equivalent protons. This typically results in two signals, each appearing as a **doublet**, and each integrating to **2H**. This is a very characteristic pattern for para-substitution.\n        *   **Ortho (1,2-substitution):** All 4 aromatic protons are unique. This would give a complex pattern, likely with four separate signals (or overlapping multiplets), each integrating to 1H.\n        *   **Meta (1,3-substitution):** All 4 aromatic protons are also unique. This would also lead to a complex pattern of four 1H signals.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given NMR Data Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This lacks signals in the typical aromatic region (~7-8 ppm). It is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde (-CHO), not a methyl ketone (-COCH3). This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signals and integrations (e.g., 1.3 ppm for a 2H singlet) do not match our predicted structure. It is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic Region:** `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This pattern of two doublets, each for 2 protons, is the classic signature of a **para-substituted** aromatic ring. The chemical shifts are appropriate for a ring substituted with an electron-withdrawing acetyl group and a halogen.\n        *   **Aliphatic Region:** `2.3 (3H, s)`. This is a singlet for 3 protons at 2.3 ppm, which is a perfect match for the methyl protons of an **acetyl group**.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This spectrum perfectly matches the structure of a para-haloacetophenone.\n\nTherefore, the correct 1H NMR data is described in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
