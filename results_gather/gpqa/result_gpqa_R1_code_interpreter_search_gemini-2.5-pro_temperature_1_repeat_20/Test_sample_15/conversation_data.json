    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral. Generally, this means it should not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** The molecule has a double bond between C1 and C2. The structure is `ClCH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral. It does not have any chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The name itself provides the key information.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS,E)`. The `R` and `S` designations specify the absolute configuration at chiral centers 3a and 7a. The `E` specifies the geometry at the double bond of the chloromethylene group. The naming of a specific enantiomer (using R/S) implies that the molecule is chiral and that this is one of its non-superimposable mirror images. A single enantiomer is always optically active. The structure is complex and lacks any obvious symmetry elements.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** Succinic acid is a four-carbon dicarboxylic acid. 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid has the structure `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. There are two chiral centers, at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** This molecule has two chiral centers with the same set of four substituents (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group). This arrangement allows for the existence of a meso compound. The `(2R,3S)` stereoisomer is this meso compound. It possesses a center of inversion, which makes it superimposable on its mirror image. A meso compound is achiral despite having chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a diastereomer of the compound above, with the structure `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The `(2R,3R)` configuration does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` compound. A pure sample of the `(2R,3R)` enantiomer will rotate plane-polarized light.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's examine C1. It is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring (C2-C3 path), and 4) the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` part of the ring (C6-C5-C4 path). Since the two paths around the ring are different, C1 is a chiral center. The molecule does not have any plane of symmetry. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer, which is a single, pure enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The `1s,3s,5s` designation (related to cis/trans) indicates that all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's visualize the molecule. With all three -OH groups pointing 'up', the molecule has three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one of the C-OH groups and the CH2 group directly opposite it in the ring. For example, the plane containing C1 and C4 bisects the molecule into two identical halves (C2 reflects onto C6, and C3 reflects onto C5). Since the molecule has planes of symmetry, it is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** The IUPAC name is slightly unconventional, but the most plausible structure is a ketone where the carbonyl group is bonded to a cyclopentyl ring and an isobutyl group (`-CH2-CH(CH3)2`). The structure is `Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's search for chiral centers. The carbon atoms in the isobutyl group are not chiral (C3 of the butanoyl chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups). The carbon in the cyclopentyl ring attached to the carbonyl is bonded to two identical `-CH2-` groups within the ring. There are no chiral centers. The molecule as a whole can adopt a conformation that has a plane of symmetry. This plane would bisect the cyclopentyl ring and the isobutyl group. Therefore, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically inactive.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: **Inactive**\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Inactive** (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: **Inactive** (achiral)\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: **Inactive** (achiral)\n\nCounting the number of optically active compounds, we find there are 3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
