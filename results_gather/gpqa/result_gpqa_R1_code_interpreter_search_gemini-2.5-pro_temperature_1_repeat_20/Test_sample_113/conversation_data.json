    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   **Type:** This is a nucleophilic addition reaction, specifically the formation of a cyanohydrin.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The cyanide ion (CN⁻), a strong nucleophile from NaCN, attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n    *   **Role of A:** The negatively charged alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final stable product, which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group. Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺).\n    *   **Evaluating options for A:**\n        *   **H3O⁺:** This represents an acidic aqueous solution (e.g., from HCl or H2SO4). It is a strong proton source and is used to protonate the alkoxide. While practically, adding strong acid directly to NaCN is hazardous (produces toxic HCN gas), the overall transformation requires an acid for the protonation step, often added as a workup. Therefore, H3O⁺ is the chemically correct choice for the required proton source.\n        *   **NaHSO₃:** Sodium bisulfite is used for forming bisulfite addition products with aldehydes and some ketones, which is a different purification/separation reaction, not for cyanohydrin formation.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   **Type:** This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-C≡N) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Mechanism:** Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either strong acid or strong base, usually with heating. The presence of water (H₂O) indicates a hydrolysis reaction.\n    *   **Role of B:** Reagent B acts as a catalyst for the hydrolysis.\n    *   **Evaluating options for B:**\n        *   **HCl:** A strong acid. Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis is a standard method to convert nitriles directly to carboxylic acids. HCl provides the necessary H₃O⁺ ions in water to protonate the nitrile and facilitate the attack by water molecules.\n        *   **CH₃COOH:** Acetic acid. This is a weak acid. While it might catalyze the reaction to a very small extent, it is generally not strong enough to achieve the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid under typical conditions. This transformation requires harsh conditions, meaning a strong acid or a strong base.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   For the first reaction, the required proton source is H₃O⁺ (A).\n    *   For the second reaction, the required strong acid catalyst is HCl (B).\n    *   Combining these findings, the correct pair of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
