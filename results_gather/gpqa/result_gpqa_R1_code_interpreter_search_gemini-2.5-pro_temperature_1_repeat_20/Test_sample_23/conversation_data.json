    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the hydrocarbon Z.**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by: `(y * AtomicMass_H) / (x * AtomicMass_C + y * AtomicMass_H) = 0.1428`.\n*   Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n*   Let's calculate the ratio of C to H atoms. Mass fraction of Carbon = 100% - 14.28% = 85.72%.\n*   Ratio of moles `C:H = (85.72 / 12) : (14.28 / 1) = 7.14 : 14.28`.\n*   Dividing by the smaller number (7.14), we get the ratio `1 : 2`.\n*   The empirical formula of Z is CH2. The molecular formula is (CH2)n, or CnH2n.\n*   Let's verify the mass fraction for CnH2n: `MassFraction(H) = (2n * 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857...`, which matches the given 14.28%.\n*   The problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen). A saturated hydrocarbon with the general formula CnH2n must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   Z is also described as being \"widely used as a solvent\". The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane. This assumption will be verified against the other conditions.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the components of mixture Y.**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from X.\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane, C6H12).\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Let the two components of Y be Y1 and Y2. We know Y1 is Z, so Y1 is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n*   The other component, Y2, must also produce only cyclohexane upon hydrogenation under severe conditions. It also must not decolorize bromine water. A very common C6 hydrocarbon that fits this description is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene is aromatic and does not react with bromine water, and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane.\n*   So, let's propose that Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**. This fits all the properties described for Y.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the components of mixture X and the reaction.**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n*   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning at least one component (and likely both) is an unsaturated hydrocarbon (contains C=C or C≡C bonds).\n*   The molecules in X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both X1 and X2 have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n*   Mixture Y = {cyclohexane, benzene} is formed from mixture X = {X1, X2} via disproportionation. This suggests a hydrogen transfer reaction where one component of X is hydrogenated and the other is dehydrogenated.\n*   Since the product mixture Y is equimolar, the reaction stoichiometry must be 1:1:1:1.\n    `X1 + X2 --(Pt, heat)--> Y1 + Y2`\n    `X1 + X2 --> C6H12 + C6H6`\n*   By conservation of atoms, the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms must be the same on both sides. Both X1 and X2 have a C6 skeleton.\n    `C6Ha + C6Hb --> C6H12 + C6H6`\n    This means the total number of hydrogen atoms must balance: `a + b = 12 + 6 = 18`.\n*   We need to find two unsaturated, non-conjugated C6-ring compounds, C6Ha and C6Hb, such that their hydrogen counts sum to 18.\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)** is a C6-ring with one double bond. It is not conjugated. `a=10`.\n    *   **Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)** is a C6-ring with two double bonds. The double bonds are at positions 1 and 4, so they are isolated, not conjugated. `b=8`.\n*   Let's check if this pair works: `a + b = 10 + 8 = 18`. This is a perfect match.\n*   So, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**.\n*   The overall reaction is a hydrogen transfer:\n    `Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) + Cyclohexene (C6H10) --> Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12)`\n    Here, cyclohexene is reduced (hydrogenated) to cyclohexane, and cyclohexa-1,4-diene is oxidized (dehydrogenated) to benzene. All conditions are satisfied.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final answer.**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   The two liquids are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene) + (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexa-1,4-diene)\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 18. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
