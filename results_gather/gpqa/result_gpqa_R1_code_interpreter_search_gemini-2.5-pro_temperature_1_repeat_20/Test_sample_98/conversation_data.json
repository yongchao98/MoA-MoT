    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The broadness is a key indicator.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group but does not help differentiate between the isomers.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe ¹H NMR data provides the structural details needed to distinguish between the isomers.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of any C=C double bonds in the molecule. All four options are saturated alkanoic acids, consistent with this information.\n*   **Key Splitting Patterns:** The problem states that the spectrum contains two particularly complex and informative signals:\n    1.  A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    2.  A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nLet's break down what these splitting patterns mean in terms of neighboring protons:\n*   **Doublet of Triplets of Quartets (dtq):** For a proton to be split into a dtq, it must be coupled to three distinct sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (CH) to cause the **doublet (d)** splitting (n+1 = 1+1=2).\n    *   A set of two equivalent protons (a CH₂ group) to cause the **triplet (t)** splitting (n+1 = 2+1=3).\n    *   A set of three equivalent protons (a CH₃ group) to cause the **quartet (q)** splitting (n+1 = 3+1=4).\n*   **Doublet of Triplets of Triplets (dtt):** For a proton to be split into a dtt, it must be coupled to three distinct sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (CH) to cause the **doublet (d)** splitting (n+1 = 1+1=2).\n    *   A set of two equivalent protons (a CH₂ group) to cause one **triplet (t)** splitting (n+1 = 2+1=3).\n    *   Another, chemically non-equivalent set of two protons (another CH₂ group) to cause the second **triplet (t)** splitting.\n\n### **3. Evaluating the Candidate Structures**\n\nNow we must examine each of the four proposed structures to see which one has protons in the specific environments required to produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal. The condensed formulas are written ambiguously, so we will interpret them into their most likely IUPAC structures.\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    *   This structure has a proton at C3 that could be a `dtq`, but it lacks a proton that could be a `dtt`.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    *   This structure has a proton at C3 that could be a `dtt`, but it lacks a proton that could be a `dtq`.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    *   This structure has a proton at C3 that could be a `dtq`, but it lacks a proton that could be a `dtt`.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**\n    *   Let's interpret the ambiguous formula as `(CH₃)(C₂H₅)CH-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH`. The longest carbon chain containing the COOH group determines the parent name. This chain is 6 carbons long (hexanoic acid), with a methyl group at C4 and an ethyl group at C3.\n    *   **Structure:**\n        ```\n                      CH₃ (methyl on C4)\n                      |\n        CH₃-CH₂-CH-CH-CH₂-COOH\n                         |\n                         CH₂CH₃ (ethyl on C3)\n        Carbon number: 6   5   4  3  2    1\n        ```\n    *   **Let's check for the `dtt` signal:**\n        *   Consider the proton on **C3**.\n        *   Its neighbors are: the proton on C4 (1H), the protons on C2 (2H), and the protons on the ethyl group's CH₂ (2H).\n        *   Splitting: `doublet` (from C4-H) of `triplets` (from C2-H₂) of `triplets` (from ethyl-H₂).\n        *   This proton gives a **dtt** signal.\n\n    *   **Let's check for the `dtq` signal:**\n        *   Consider the proton on **C4**.\n        *   Its neighbors are: the proton on C3 (1H), the protons on C5 (2H), and the protons of the methyl group at C4 (3H).\n        *   Splitting: `doublet` (from C3-H) of `triplets` (from C5-H₂) of `quartets` (from methyl-H₃).\n        *   This proton gives a **dtq** signal.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe structure corresponding to option C, **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**, is the only one that contains both a proton environment that would result in a `doublet of triplets of triplets` and a different proton environment that would result in a `doublet of triplets of quartets`. Therefore, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
