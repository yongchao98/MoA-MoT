As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nB) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\nC) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nD) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct conclusion:\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of each gene based on single-mutant phenotypes.**\n    *   The wild-type (control) has 100% resistance.\n    *   `g1` mutant has 75% resistance. This means G1 contributes to resistance, but its loss is only partially detrimental.\n    *   `g3` mutant has 50% resistance. G3 has a more significant role in resistance than G1.\n    *   `g2` mutant has 0% resistance. This means G2 is absolutely essential for the resistance pathway. Loss of G2 function leads to complete susceptibility.\n\n2.  **Analyze gene interactions using the double-mutants (epistasis analysis).** Epistasis is when the phenotype of one gene mutation masks the phenotype of another gene mutation. The gene whose phenotype is expressed is called \"epistatic\".\n    *   `g1g2` has 0% resistance. This is the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant (0%). The `g2` mutation's effect (0% resistance) masks the `g1` mutation's effect (75% resistance). Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**.\n    *   `g2g3` has 0% resistance. This is the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant (0%). The `g2` mutation's effect masks the `g3` mutation's effect (50% resistance). Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G3**.\n    *   `g1g3` has 10% resistance. This phenotype is different from both the `g1` (75%) and `g3` (50%) phenotypes. In fact, it's much more severe than either single mutant. This indicates a **synergistic interaction**, not a simple epistatic masking. When two genes have a synergistic effect, it often implies they function in parallel pathways or have overlapping, partially compensatory roles. This concept is known as **gene redundancy**.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the findings and identify the transcription factor.**\n    *   We know at least one gene is a transcription factor (TF) that acts \"upstream.\"\n    *   G2 is the most critical gene. Its knockout eliminates all resistance, and it is epistatic to both G1 and G3. This strongly suggests G2 is a central component of the resistance mechanism. A common role for such a critical gene is to be a master transcription factor that regulates other downstream genes required for resistance. So, it's highly plausible that **G2 is the transcription factor**. If it were G1 or G3, their single-mutant phenotypes would likely be as severe as the G2 mutant, which is not the case.\n    *   The synergistic interaction between G1 and G3 strongly supports the idea of **gene redundancy**.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the given options based on our conclusions.**\n\n    *   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n        *   `G2 is a TF`: Plausible.\n        *   `G1 and G3 show pleiotropy`: Pleiotropy means one gene affects multiple traits. We only have data for one trait (resistance), so we cannot conclude this.\n        *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: False. The double mutant phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` mutant phenotype (75%).\n\n    *   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n        *   `G2 is a TF`: Plausible.\n        *   `G1 and G3 has the same promoter`: This is a specific molecular hypothesis that cannot be concluded from this phenotypic data.\n        *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: False. The double mutant phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g3` mutant phenotype (50%).\n\n    *   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n        *   `G2 is a TF`: Plausible and the most logical conclusion for the key gene.\n        *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: Correct. This is strongly supported by the synergistic phenotype of the `g1g3` double mutant.\n        *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: False, as explained for option A.\n        *   *Analysis*: This option contains two strongly supported conclusions and one incorrect statement. Compared to other options, this one captures the most important aspects of the gene interactions.\n\n    *   **D) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n        *   `G1 is a TF`: Unlikely. G2 is the more critical gene and thus the better candidate for the TF.\n        *   `G2 and G3 show pleiotropy`: Unsupported, as explained for option A.\n        *   `G2 is epistatic towards G1`: True, as determined in our analysis.\n        *   *Analysis*: While this option contains one true statement, its primary assertion (`G1 is a TF`) is less plausible than the one in option C.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nOption C provides the best overall description of the genetic system. It correctly identifies G2 as the most likely transcription factor due to its critical role and correctly describes the relationship between G1 and G3 as gene redundancy based on their synergistic interaction. The third clause (\"G1 is epistatic towards G3\") is incorrect based on the data, but the first two clauses are the most significant and accurate conclusions that can be drawn from the experiment, making it the best choice among the given options.\n\n<<<C>>>"
