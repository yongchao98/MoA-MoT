    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Crystal System and Parameters:**\n    *   The crystal system is rhombohedral.\n    *   The lattice parameter is `a = b = c = 10` Angstrom.\n    *   The interaxial angles are `α = β = γ = 30°`.\n    *   The Miller indices of the plane are `(h, k, l) = (1, 1, 1)`.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Interplanar Spacing:**\n    The general formula for the interplanar distance `d_hkl` in a crystal system with lattice parameters `a, b, c` and angles `α, β, γ` is quite complex. For a rhombohedral system, where `a = b = c` and `α = β = γ`, the formula simplifies. The standard formula for the reciprocal squared distance is:\n    `1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²)sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα) ] / [ a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ]`\n\n3.  **Simplify the Formula for the (111) Plane:**\n    For the specific case of the (111) plane, we have `h = 1`, `k = 1`, and `l = 1`. Let's substitute these values into the formula.\n    *   `h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3`\n    *   `hk + kl + lh = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3`\n\n    Now, substitute these into the numerator of the `1/d²` equation:\n    Numerator = `(3)sin²α + 2(3)(cos²α - cosα)`\n    Numerator = `3sin²α + 6cos²α - 6cosα`\n    Using the identity `sin²α = 1 - cos²α`:\n    Numerator = `3(1 - cos²α) + 6cos²α - 6cosα`\n    Numerator = `3 - 3cos²α + 6cos²α - 6cosα`\n    Numerator = `3 + 3cos²α - 6cosα`\n    Factor out the 3:\n    Numerator = `3(1 + cos²α - 2cosα)`\n    This is a perfect square:\n    Numerator = `3(1 - cosα)²`\n\n    Now let's look at the denominator term `(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)`. This can be factored as `(1 - cosα)²(1 + 2cosα)`.\n\n    Substituting the simplified numerator and the factored denominator back into the main equation:\n    `1/d² = [ 3(1 - cosα)² ] / [ a²(1 - cosα)²(1 + 2cosα) ]`\n\n    Assuming `cosα ≠ 1` (i.e., `α ≠ 0°`), we can cancel the `(1 - cosα)²` term from the numerator and denominator. This gives a much simpler formula for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal:\n    `1/d²(111) = 3 / [ a²(1 + 2cosα) ]`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    Now, we plug in the given values: `a = 10` Angstrom and `α = 30°`.\n    *   `cos(30°) = sqrt(3) / 2`\n    *   `a² = 10² = 100`\n\n    `1/d² = 3 / [ 100 * (1 + 2 * (sqrt(3) / 2)) ]`\n    `1/d² = 3 / [ 100 * (1 + sqrt(3)) ]`\n\n    Now, solve for `d`:\n    `d² = [ 100 * (1 + sqrt(3)) ] / 3`\n    `d = sqrt([ 100 * (1 + sqrt(3)) ] / 3)`\n    `d = 10 * sqrt( (1 + sqrt(3)) / 3 )`\n\n    To get the final numerical answer, I will use a python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\na = 10.0  # Angstrom\nalpha_degrees = 30.0\n\n# Convert angle to radians\nalpha_radians = math.radians(alpha_degrees)\n\n# Use the simplified formula for the (111) plane\n# d = a * sqrt((1 + 2*cos(alpha)) / 3) is incorrect.\n# 1/d^2 = 3 / (a^2 * (1 + 2*cos(alpha)))\n# d^2 = (a^2 * (1 + 2*cos(alpha))) / 3\n# d = sqrt((a**2 * (1 + 2*math.cos(alpha_radians))) / 3)\nd_squared = (a**2 * (1 + 2 * math.cos(alpha_radians))) / 3\nd = math.sqrt(d_squared)\n\nprint(d)\n```\n<execute_code>\n9.542983243115967\n</execute_code>\nThe calculated value is approximately 9.54 Angstrom. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) 9.54 Angstrom\nB) 8.95 Angstrom\nC) 10.05 Angstrom\nD) 9.08 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The user wants to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane of a rhombohedral crystal.\n\n**1. Understand the parameters of a rhombohedral crystal:**\nIn a rhombohedral crystal system, the lattice parameters are defined by:\n*   `a = b = c` (the lengths of the primitive lattice vectors are equal)\n*   `α = β = γ` (the angles between the primitive lattice vectors are equal)\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have:\n*   `a = 10` Angstrom (given as the interatomic distance, which corresponds to the lattice parameter `a` in this context).\n*   `α = 30°`.\n*   The plane of interest is `(hkl) = (111)`.\n\n**2. Recall the formula for interplanar spacing (d-spacing):**\nThe general formula for the interplanar spacing `d_hkl` in a crystal system is given by the square root of the inverse of the squared magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector `G_hkl`. For a rhombohedral system, this is given by the formula:\n\n`1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²)sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα) ] / [ a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ]`\n\n**3. Simplify the formula for the (111) plane:**\nFor the `(111)` plane, we have `h = 1`, `k = 1`, and `l = 1`. Let's substitute these values into the formula.\n*   `h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3`\n*   `hk + kl + lh = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3`\n\nSubstitute these into the numerator:\nNumerator = `3 * sin²α + 2 * 3 * (cos²α - cosα)`\nNumerator = `3sin²α + 6cos²α - 6cosα`\nUsing the trigonometric identity `sin²α = 1 - cos²α`:\nNumerator = `3(1 - cos²α) + 6cos²α - 6cosα`\nNumerator = `3 - 3cos²α + 6cos²α - 6cosα`\nNumerator = `3 + 3cos²α - 6cosα`\nFactoring out the 3, we get `3(1 - 2cosα + cos²α)`, which is a perfect square:\nNumerator = `3(1 - cosα)²`\n\nNow, let's look at the term in the denominator: `(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)`. This polynomial can be factored as `(1 - cosα)²(1 + 2cosα)`.\n\nNow, substitute the simplified numerator and the factored denominator back into the `1/d²` equation:\n`1/d² = [ 3(1 - cosα)² ] / [ a²(1 - cosα)²(1 + 2cosα) ]`\n\nAssuming `α` is not 0, `cosα ≠ 1`, so we can cancel the `(1 - cosα)²` term from the numerator and denominator. This yields a much simpler formula specifically for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal:\n`1/d² = 3 / [ a²(1 + 2cosα) ]`\n\n**4. Calculate the numerical value:**\nNow we can solve for `d` and plug in the given values: `a = 10` Angstrom and `α = 30°`.\n\n`d² = [ a²(1 + 2cosα) ] / 3`\n`d = sqrt( [ a²(1 + 2cosα) ] / 3 )`\n`d = a * sqrt( (1 + 2cosα) / 3 )`\n\nWe know that `cos(30°) = sqrt(3) / 2`.\n`d = 10 * sqrt( (1 + 2 * (sqrt(3)/2)) / 3 )`\n`d = 10 * sqrt( (1 + sqrt(3)) / 3 )`\n\nLet's use a Python script to get a precise numerical value.\n```python\nimport math\n\na = 10.0  # Angstrom\nalpha_degrees = 30.0\n\n# Convert angle to radians for use in math functions\nalpha_radians = math.radians(alpha_degrees)\n\n# Calculate the interplanar distance using the derived formula\n# d = a * sqrt((1 + 2*cos(alpha)) / 3)\nd_squared = (a**2 * (1 + 2 * math.cos(alpha_radians))) / 3\nd = math.sqrt(d_squared)\n\nprint(d)\n\n```\n<execute_code>\n9.542983243115967\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation gives `d ≈ 9.543` Angstrom.\n\n**5. Compare with the options:**\nA) 9.54 Angstrom\nB) 8.95 Angstrom\nC) 10.05 Angstrom\nD) 9.08 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated value of 9.543 Angstrom matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
