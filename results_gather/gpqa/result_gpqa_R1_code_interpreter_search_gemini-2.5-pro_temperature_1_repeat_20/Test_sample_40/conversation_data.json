    "Here's my thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We have a beam of light.\n    *   It's traveling through a medium (glass) with a refractive index `n`.\n    *   The glass itself is moving with a velocity `v`.\n    *   The light and the glass are moving in the *same direction*.\n    *   There is an observer in a stationary \"laboratory\" frame.\n    *   We need to find the speed of the light beam *relative to the observer in the laboratory*.\n    *   A key piece of information is that the speed of light in a vacuum, `c`, is set to `1`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Physics Principle:**\n    This problem involves adding velocities. In classical (Galilean) relativity, you would simply add the velocities: `speed_in_lab = speed_in_glass + speed_of_glass`. However, because the problem deals with the speed of light, this is a scenario where Albert Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity must be used. The correct tool is the **relativistic velocity addition formula**.\n\n3.  **Define the Frames of Reference:**\n    To use the formula correctly, I need to define two frames of reference:\n    *   **Frame S (The Laboratory Frame):** This is the observer's frame. It is considered \"stationary\".\n    *   **Frame S' (The Glass Frame):** This is the frame of reference that is moving along with the glass. In this frame, the glass is stationary.\n\n4.  **List the Known Velocities:**\n    *   **`v`**: The velocity of the moving frame (S', the glass) as measured in the stationary frame (S, the lab). This is given as `v`.\n    *   **`u'`**: The velocity of the object (the light beam) as measured in the *moving* frame (S', the glass). The speed of light in a medium with refractive index `n` is given by `c/n`. Since the problem states `c=1`, the speed of light within the glass (as measured by someone moving with the glass) is `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   **`u`**: The velocity of the object (the light beam) as measured in the *stationary* frame (S, the lab). This is the value we need to find.\n\n5.  **Recall the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    For objects moving along the same axis, the formula is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n6.  **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula:**\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1` (so `c^2 = 1`)\n\n    Plugging these in:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n7.  **Simplify the Algebraic Expression:**\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n    This expression looks a bit messy with fractions inside a fraction. A good way to clean it up is to multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * ( (1/n) + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n    Distribute the `n` in both the top and bottom:\n    *   Numerator: `n*(1/n) + n*v = 1 + n*v`\n    *   Denominator: `n*1 + n*(v/n) = n + v`\n\n    So, the simplified expression is:\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n8.  **Compare the Result with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) (1-n*v)/(n+v) - Incorrect sign in the numerator.\n    *   B) (1+n*v)/(n+v) - **This matches my result.**\n    *   C) 1 - Incorrect. The speed would only be 1 (or `c`) in a vacuum, not in a moving piece of glass.\n    *   D) (1+n*v)/(n-v) - Incorrect sign in the denominator.\n\n9.  **Final Conclusion:** The correct answer is B, based on the direct application and simplification of the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\n<<<B>>>"
