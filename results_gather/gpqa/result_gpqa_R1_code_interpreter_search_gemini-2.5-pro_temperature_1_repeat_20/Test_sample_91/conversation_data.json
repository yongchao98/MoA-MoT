    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe objective is to calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) of the given organic molecule, (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. The enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states. The reaction is:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nWe can calculate this using Hess's Law by considering a hypothetical two-step process:\n*   **Step A:** Atomize the elements in their standard state into gaseous atoms. The enthalpy change for this is the sum of the enthalpies of atomization of the elements.\n    12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)\n*   **Step B:** Combine the gaseous atoms to form one mole of the product molecule. The enthalpy change for this is the negative of the molecule's total bond energy (or its enthalpy of atomization).\n    12 C(g) + 22 H(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the sum of the enthalpy changes of these two steps:\nΔHf = (Enthalpy of atomization of elements) - (Enthalpy of atomization of the molecule)\n\n**2. Analyze the Molecule's Structure and Bonds:**\nFirst, we need to determine the molecular formula and count the number of each type of bond in the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:**\n    *   Carbons (C): 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 1 + 2 (from CH(CH3)) + 1 + 1 + 3 (from C(CH3)2) = 12 Carbon atoms.\n    *   Hydrogens (H): 6 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 2 + 4 (from CH(CH3)) + 2 + 1 + 6 (from C(CH3)2) = 22 Hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The formula is **C12H22**.\n\n*   **Bond Count:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, each bonded to a carbon, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly shows two double bonds (`=CH-` and `-CH=C`), so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** We count the single bonds between carbon atoms:\n        *   2 bonds in the initial (CH3)2C group.\n        *   5 bonds in the main chain: C-C-C-C-C-C.\n        *   1 bond for the CH3 side group.\n        *   2 bonds in the final C(CH3)2 group.\n        *   Total: 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 = **9 C-C bonds**. (The main chain has 6 C-C single bonds, but two of these are part of the double bond notation, so we count the single linkages: C-C, C-C, C-C, C-C. That's 4. Plus the side chains: 2+1+2 = 5. Total = 4+5 = 9).\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Molecule (ΔHa, molecule):**\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the molecule.\nΔHa, molecule = (No. of C-C bonds × BE_C-C) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE_C=C) + (No. of C-H bonds × BE_C-H)\nΔHa, molecule = (9 × 200 kJ/mol) + (2 × 300 kJ/mol) + (22 × 400 kJ/mol)\nΔHa, molecule = 1800 + 600 + 8800\nΔHa, molecule = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements (ΔHa, elements):**\nThis is the energy needed to convert the elements from their standard states (12 moles of solid Carbon, 11 moles of H2 gas) to gaseous atoms.\nΔHa, elements = (No. of C atoms × ΔH_atom(C)) + (No. of H2 moles × BE_H-H)\nΔHa, elements = (12 × 1000 kJ/mol) + (11 × 100 kJ/mol)\nΔHa, elements = 12000 + 1100\nΔHa, elements = **13100 kJ** (for the formation of one mole of the product)\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf):**\nΔHf = ΔHa, elements - ΔHa, molecule\nΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\nΔHf = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**6. Check the Options and Units:**\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's examine the options:\nA) 11200 kJ/mol\nB) 67.4 kJ/mol\nC) 1900 kJ/g\nD) 11.44 kJ/g\n\nOur calculated molar enthalpy (1900 kJ/mol) matches the numerical value in option C, but the unit is kJ/g, which is incorrect. Option D has units of kJ/g. Let's convert our result to these units to check.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:**\n    M = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n*   **Convert ΔHf to kJ/g:**\n    ΔHf (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol)\n    ΔHf (kJ/g) ≈ **11.4457... kJ/g**\n\nThis value matches option D. Although enthalpy of formation is typically requested in molar units (kJ/mol), given the options, the question is asking for the specific enthalpy of formation (per gram).\n\n```python\n# Given values\nH_atom_C = 1000  # Enthalpy of atomization of carbon in kJ/mol\nBE_HH = 100      # Bond energy of H-H in kJ/mol\nBE_CC_single = 200 # Bond energy of C-C in kJ/mol\nBE_CC_double = 300 # Bond energy of C=C in kJ/mol\nBE_CH = 400      # Bond energy of C-H in kJ/mol\n\n# Molecular composition of (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\n\n# Number of bonds in the molecule\nnum_bonds_CC_double = 2\nnum_bonds_CC_single = 9\nnum_bonds_CH = 22\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n\n# 1.

    "**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nThe molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nLet's determine its molecular formula and count the number of each type of bond.\n\n*   **Carbon atoms (C):** 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 1 + 1 (from CH) + 1 (from CH3 side group) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 (from (CH3)2) = 12 carbon atoms.\n*   **Hydrogen atoms (H):** 6 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 (from CH3 side group) + 2 + 1 + 6 (from (CH3)2) = 22 hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C12H22\n\nNow, let's count the bonds:\n*   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly indicates two carbon-carbon double bonds, so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:** We count the single bonds between carbon atoms. Total carbon atoms are 12. The total number of bonds involving carbon is (4 * 12) = 48 (valency). Each H forms one bond, and each double bond counts as two. So, total single C-C bonds = (sum of valencies - bonds to H - 2*double bonds)/2. Let's count them directly from the structure to be sure:\n    *   (CH3)-C and (CH3)-C: 2 bonds\n    *   C=C-(CH2): 1 bond\n    *   (CH2)-(CH): 1 bond\n    *   (CH)-(CH2): 1 bond\n    *   (CH2)-C=C: 1 bond\n    *   (CH)-(CH3): 1 bond\n    *   C=C-(CH3) and C=C-(CH3): 2 bonds\n    *   Total C-C single bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**2. Calculate the Enthalpy Change for Atomization of the Molecule**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the C12H22 molecule.\nΔHa(molecule) = (No. of C-C bonds × BE_C-C) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE_C=C) + (No. of C-H bonds × BE_C-H)\nΔHa(molecule) = (9 mol × 200 kJ/mol) + (2 mol × 300 kJ/mol) + (22 mol × 400 kJ/mol)\nΔHa(molecule) = 1800 kJ + 600 kJ + 8800 kJ = **11200 kJ**\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy Change for Atomization of the Elements**\n\nThis is the energy required to form gaseous atoms from the elements in their standard states (12 moles of solid Carbon and 11 moles of H2 gas).\nThe formation reaction is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22\nΔHa(elements) = (12 × Enthalpy of atomization of C) + (11 × Bond energy of H-H)\nΔHa(elements) = (12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol) + (11 mol × 100 kJ/mol)\nΔHa(elements) = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the energy required to atomize the elements minus the energy released when forming the molecule from its gaseous atoms (which is equal to the enthalpy of atomization of the molecule).\nΔHf = ΔHa(elements) - ΔHa(molecule)\nΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**5. Convert to kJ/g**\n\nThe options are given in kJ/g, so we need to convert our answer from kJ/mol to kJ/g.\n*   Molar mass of C12H22 = (12 × 12.01 g/mol) + (22 × 1.01 g/mol) ≈ 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n*   Specific enthalpy = ΔHf / Molar Mass\n*   Specific enthalpy = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.45 kJ/g**\n\nThis value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
