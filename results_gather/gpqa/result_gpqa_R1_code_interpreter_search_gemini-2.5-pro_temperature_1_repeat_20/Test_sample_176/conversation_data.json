    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to compute the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, denoted as $L_1 / L_2$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Luminosity Formula:** The luminosity of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L = A \\cdot \\sigma \\cdot T^4$\n    where:\n    *   $A$ is the star's surface area ($A = 4\\pi R^2$, with $R$ being the radius).\n    *   $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   $T$ is the surface temperature of the star.\n\n3.  **Set up the Luminosity Ratio:** We can write the luminosity for each star and then find their ratio:\n    $L_1 = 4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4$\n    $L_2 = 4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4$\n\n    Dividing $L_1$ by $L_2$, the constants $4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ cancel out:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1^2 / R_2^2) \\cdot (T_1^4 / T_2^4) = (R_1 / R_2)^2 \\cdot (T_1 / T_2)^4$\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information:**\n    *   **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So, $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, which means $R_1 / R_2 = 1.5$.\n    *   **Temperature Ratio:** This is the trickiest part. We need to find the ratio $T_1 / T_2$. The information we have is that \"the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest... are the same.\" This refers to the peak wavelength of the star's emission spectrum.\n        *   The phrase \"appeared brightest\" refers to the wavelength observed by the astronomers. Let's call this $\\lambda_{obs}$. So, $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n        *   The intrinsic peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$), which is determined by the star's temperature, is given by Wien's Displacement Law: $\\lambda_{rest} = b / T$, where $b$ is Wien's constant. This means $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{rest}$.\n        *   The observed wavelength is affected by the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) due to the Doppler effect. The formula relating observed and rest wavelengths is: $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest} (1 + v_r/c)$, where $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   **Irrelevant Information:** The mass ratio ($M_1/M_2 = 1.5$) is not needed for this calculation, as the luminosity is determined by radius and temperature based on the black body assumption.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Temperature Ratio ($T_1 / T_2$):**\n    *   From the Doppler and Wien's laws, we can express the temperature in terms of the observed wavelength and velocity:\n        $\\lambda_{rest} = \\lambda_{obs} / (1 + v_r/c)$\n        $T = b / \\lambda_{rest} = b / (\\lambda_{obs} / (1 + v_r/c)) = (b / \\lambda_{obs}) \\cdot (1 + v_r/c)$\n    *   Now, let's find the ratio $T_1 / T_2$:\n        $T_1/T_2 = \\frac{(b / \\lambda_{obs,1}) \\cdot (1 + v_{r1}/c)}{(b / \\lambda_{obs,2}) \\cdot (1 + v_{r2}/c)}$\n    *   Since $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, the terms $(b/\\lambda_{obs})$ cancel out:\n        $T_1/T_2 = \\frac{1 + v_{r1}/c}{1 + v_{r2}/c}$\n    *   Substitute the given velocities: $v_{r1} = 0$ km/s and $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s.\n        $T_1/T_2 = \\frac{1 + 0/c}{1 + (700 \\text{ km/s})/c} = \\frac{1}{1 + (700 \\text{ km/s})/c}$\n\n6.  **Combine and Compute the Final Ratio:**\n    *   Substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n        $L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + (700 \\text{ km/s})/c} \\right)^4$\n        $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / (1 + (700 \\text{ km/s})/c)^4$\n    *   Now, we need to plug in the values and calculate.\n        *   $v_{r2} = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 700,000 \\text{ m/s}$\n        *   $c$ (speed of light) $\\approx 2.99792458 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$\n        The calculation is as follows:\n\n```python\n# Speed of light in m/s\nc = 299792458\n# Radial velocity of Star_2 in m/s\nv_r2 = 700 * 1000\n\n# Calculate the redshift factor for Star_2\nz = v_r2 / c\n\n# The radius ratio squared\nR_ratio_sq = 1.5**2\n\n# The temperature ratio is 1 / (1+z)\n# The temperature ratio to the fourth power is (1 / (1+z))^4\nT_ratio_4 = (1 / (1 + z))**4\n\n# The luminosity ratio\nL_ratio = R_ratio_sq * T_ratio_4\n\nprint(L_ratio)\n```\n\nThe computed value is approximately 2.229. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2 ($L_1/L_2$).\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Fundamental Formula for Luminosity:**\n    The luminosity (L) of a star that radiates as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L = A \\cdot \\sigma \\cdot T^4$\n    where:\n    *   A is the surface area of the star ($A = 4\\pi R^2$, where R is the radius).\n    *   $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the star's surface temperature.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio:**\n    We can set up the ratio of the luminosities for Star_1 and Star_2:\n    $L_1 = 4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4$\n    $L_2 = 4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4$\n\n    Dividing $L_1$ by $L_2$, the constants $4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ cancel out:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n\n3.  **Determining the Ratios from Given Information:**\n    *   **Radius Ratio ($R_1/R_2$):** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So, $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, which gives us $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$.\n    *   **Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$):** This requires more steps. We are told that the *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{obs}$) are the same for both stars. This peak wavelength is related to the star's surface temperature by Wien's Displacement Law, but it is also affected by the Doppler shift due to the star's radial velocity.\n        *   **Wien's Law:** The intrinsic (rest) peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$) is inversely proportional to the temperature: $\\lambda_{rest} = \\frac{b}{T}$, where b is Wien's constant. Thus, $T = \\frac{b}{\\lambda_{rest}}$.\n        *   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) is related to the rest wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$) and the radial velocity ($v_r$) by the formula: $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest} \\left(1 + \\frac{v_r}{c}\\right)$, where c is the speed of light.\n        *   **Combining the laws:** We can express the rest wavelength in terms of the observed wavelength: $\\lambda_{rest} = \\frac{\\lambda_{obs}}{1 + v_r/c}$. Now substitute this into the temperature formula:\n            $T = \\frac{b}{\\frac{\\lambda_{obs}}{1 + v_r/c}} = \\frac{b}{\\lambda_{obs}} \\left(1 + \\frac{v_r}{c}\\right)$\n        *   **Calculating the temperature ratio:** Now we can find the ratio $T_1/T_2$:\n            $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\frac{b}{\\lambda_{obs,1}} \\left(1 + \\frac{v_{r1}}{c}\\right)}{\\frac{b}{\\lambda_{obs,2}} \\left(1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c}\\right)}$\n        *   Since we are given $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, the term $b/\\lambda_{obs}$ cancels out:\n            $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1 + v_{r1}/c}{1 + v_{r2}/c}$\n        *   Substitute the given velocities: $v_{r1} = 0$ km/s and $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s.\n            $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1 + 0/c}{1 + (700 \\text{ km/s})/c} = \\frac{1}{1 + (700 \\text{ km/s})/c}$\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Now we substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into our luminosity ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + (700 \\text{ km/s})/c}\\right)^4$\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700 \\times 10^3 \\text{ m/s}}{c}\\right)^4}$\n\n    To get a precise value, we use a Python script.\n\n```python\n# The speed of light in meters per second\nc = 299792458\n# The radial velocity of Star_2 in meters per second\nv_r2 = 700 * 1000\n\n# The ratio of the radii squared\nR_ratio_squared = 1.5**2\n\n# The Doppler factor for Star_2\nz = v_r2 / c\n\n# The ratio of the temperatures is T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + z)\n# The ratio of the temperatures to the fourth power is (1 / (1 + z))^4\nT_ratio_fourth_power = (1 / (1 + z))**4\n\n# The final luminosity ratio is the product of the two ratios\nLuminosity_ratio = R_ratio_squared * T_ratio_fourth_power\n\nprint(Luminosity_ratio)\n```\nThe calculated value is approximately 2.229. When rounded to two decimal places, this is 2.23. This matches option C. Note that the information about the stars' masses was not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>",
