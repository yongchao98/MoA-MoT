    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of the Radial Velocity (RV) Method**\n\nThe RV method detects exoplanets by measuring the periodic Doppler shift of spectral lines from their host star. This shift is caused by the star's motion as it orbits the common center of mass with the planet.\n\n*   The observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_{r,star}$) along our line of sight: $\\Delta \\lambda \\propto v_{r,star}$.\n*   The maximum wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$) corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as $K_{star}$.\n*   Therefore, $K_{star} \\propto \\Delta \\lambda_{max}$.\n\n**2. Relate the Given Data to the Physical Quantities**\n\nWe are given the maximum periodic wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n*   $\\Delta \\lambda_{max,1} = 5$ miliangstrom\n*   $\\Delta \\lambda_{max,2} = 7$ miliangstrom\n\nFrom the proportionality above, we can find the ratio of the stellar RV semi-amplitudes:\n$\\frac{K_{star,2}}{K_{star,1}} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_{max,2}}{\\Delta \\lambda_{max,1}} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n**3. Derive the Relationship between RV Amplitude ($K_{star}$) and Orbital Period (T)**\n\nThe formula for the stellar RV semi-amplitude ($K_{star}$) for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n$K_{star} = v_{star} \\sin(i)$\nwhere $v_{star}$ is the speed of the star in its orbit around the center of mass and $i$ is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n\nFrom conservation of momentum (in the center of mass frame, where $M_{star}$ is the star's mass and $m_p$ is the planet's mass):\n$M_{star} v_{star} = m_p v_p$\n$v_{star} = \\frac{m_p}{M_{star}} v_p$\n(This is an approximation assuming $M_{star} \\gg m_p$, which is valid here as the star is Sun-like and the planet is Neptune-like).\n\nSo, $K_{star} = \\frac{m_p}{M_{star}} v_p \\sin(i)$.\n\nThe planet's orbital speed ($v_p$) is related to its orbital period ($T$) and the semi-major axis ($a$) by $v_p = \\frac{2\\pi a}{T}$.\n\nWe can relate $a$ and $T$ using Kepler's Third Law:\n$T^2 \\propto a^3 \\implies a \\propto T^{2/3}$\n\nNow substitute this into the expression for $v_p$:\n$v_p \\propto \\frac{T^{2/3}}{T} = T^{-1/3}$\n\nFinally, substitute this back into the expression for $K_{star}$:\n$K_{star} \\propto \\frac{m_p}{M_{star}} T^{-1/3} \\sin(i)$\n\n**4. Formulate the Ratio for the Two Systems**\n\nWe want to find the ratio $T_2 / T_1$. Let's write the ratio of the RV amplitudes:\n$\\frac{K_{star,2}}{K_{star,1}} = \\frac{\\frac{m_{p,2}}{M_{star,2}} T_2^{-1/3} \\sin(i_2)}{\\frac{m_{p,1}}{M_{star,1}} T_1^{-1/3} \\sin(i_1)}$\n\n**5. Apply the Problem's Conditions and Assumptions**\n\n*   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star,1} = M_{star,2}$.\n*   The planets have similar masses: $m_{p,1} = m_{p,2}$.\n*   The inclinations ($i_1$, $i_2$) are not given. In such problems, it is a standard and necessary assumption that the conditions are comparable, so we assume $\\sin(i_1) = \\sin(i_2)$.\n\nWith these conditions, the mass terms and the sine terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n$\\frac{K_{star,2}}{K_{star,1}} = \\frac{T_2^{-1/3}}{T_1^{-1/3}} = (\\frac{T_2}{T_1})^{-1/3} = (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^{1/3}$\n\n**6. Solve for the Ratio of the Periods**\n\nWe already calculated $\\frac{K_{star,2}}{K_{star,1}} = 1.4$.\nSo, $1.4 = (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^{1/3}$.\n\nTo solve for the ratio of periods, first cube both sides of the equation:\n$1.4^3 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2}$\n$2.744 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2}$\n\nThe question asks for \"How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\", which is the ratio $T_2 / T_1$. So, we need to take the reciprocal of our result:\n$\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{2.744}$\n\nNow, we perform the final calculation.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio T2/T1\n# The ratio of RV amplitudes K2/K1 is 7/5 = 1.4\n# We derived the relationship (K2/K1) = (T1/T2)^(1/3)\n# So, T1/T2 = (K2/K1)^3 = 1.4^3\n# The desired ratio T2/T1 is the reciprocal of this value.\nratio_T2_T1 = 1 / (1.4**3)\nprint(ratio_T2_T1)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.3644314868804665\n</execute_code>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.3644.\n\n**7. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated ratio $T_2 / T_1 \\approx 0.3644$. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.36\nB) ~ 1.40\nC) ~ 1.96\nD) ~ 0.85\n\nThe result most closely matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\n**Reasoning Breakdown:**\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity:** The radial velocity (RV) method relies on the Doppler effect. The periodic shift in a spectral line's wavelength ($\\Delta \\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's velocity ($K_{star}$) along our line of sight. Therefore, the ratio of the maximum wavelength shifts is equal to the ratio of the stars' maximum velocities (RV semi-amplitudes):\n    $ \\frac{K_{star,2}}{K_{star,1}} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_{max,2}}{\\Delta \\lambda_{max,1}} = \\frac{7 \\text{ miliangstrom}}{5 \\text{ miliangstrom}} = 1.4 $\n\n2.  **Relate Stellar Velocity to Orbital Period:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the stellar velocity semi-amplitude ($K_{star}$) can be described by the following relationship (assuming the planet's mass $m_p$ is much smaller than the star's mass $M_{star}$):\n    $ K_{star} \\propto \\frac{m_p}{M_{star}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{T^{1/3}} $\n    where T is the orbital period.\n\n3.  **Apply Problem Conditions:** The problem states that the stars have the same mass ($M_{star,1} = M_{star,2}$) and the planets have similar masses ($m_{p,1} \\approx m_{p,2}$). Therefore, the mass terms cancel out when we take the ratio of the two systems:\n    $ \\frac{K_{star,2}}{K_{star,1}} = \\frac{T_1^{1/3}}{T_2^{1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3} $\n\n4.  **Solve for the Period Ratio:** We can now substitute the known velocity ratio into the equation and solve for the period ratio ($T_2/T_1$).\n    $ 1.4 = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3} $\n    Cube both sides:\n    $ 1.4^3 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2} $\n    $ 2.744 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2} $\n    The question asks how many times longer the period of planet #2 is than planet #1, which is the ratio $T_2/T_1$. So, we take the reciprocal:\n    $ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{2.744} \\approx 0.3644 $\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<A>>>"
