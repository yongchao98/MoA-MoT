    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem involves the decay of relativistic particles. The key concepts are:\n    *   **Exponential Decay:** The number of particles `N` remaining from an initial sample `N₀` after a time `t` is given by `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / T)`, where `T` is the mean lifetime of the particle.\n    *   **Time Dilation:** A moving particle's internal clock runs slower as observed from a stationary frame (the lab/detector frame). Its mean lifetime in the lab frame, `T_lab`, is dilated by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `T_lab = γ * τ`, where `τ` is the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's own rest frame).\n    *   **Relativistic Travel:** The particles are ultra-relativistic, meaning their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. The time it takes for them to travel the detector radius `R` in the lab frame is `t_travel = R / v ≈ R / c`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equation:** We need to use the exponential decay law in the lab frame. The time elapsed is the travel time `t_travel`, and the mean lifetime is the dilated lifetime `T_lab`.\n    The fraction of particles `f = N/N₀` that reach the detector is:\n    `f = exp(-t_travel / T_lab)`\n    Substituting the expressions from step 1:\n    `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ))`\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    `f = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n3.  **Use the Initial Condition:** We are given that for the first case, `γ₁ = 20` and the fraction of surviving particles is `f₁ = 1/3`. The radius `R` is 30 m.\n    `1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * c * τ))`\n    To solve for the unknown `c * τ`, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * c * τ)`\n    `-ln(3) = -1.5 / (c * τ)`\n    `ln(3) = 1.5 / (c * τ)`\n    This equation relates the known quantities to the constant `c * τ`. We don't need to calculate `c * τ` explicitly; we can use this relationship.\n\n4.  **Solve for the New Lorentz Factor:** We want to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, for which the fraction of surviving particles is `f₂ = 2/3`.\n    `2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * c * τ))`\n    Again, take the natural logarithm:\n    `ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n    `-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n    `ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n\n5.  **Combine the Equations:** We now have two equations:\n    (1) `ln(3) = 1.5 / (c * τ)`\n    (2) `ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n    A simple way to solve this is to find the ratio of the two equations. Let's rearrange both to solve for the constant term `1 / (c * τ)`:\n    From (1): `1 / (c * τ) = ln(3) / 1.5`\n    From (2): `1 / (c * τ) = (γ₂ * ln(3/2)) / 30`\n    Now, set the expressions equal to each other:\n    `ln(3) / 1.5 = (γ₂ * ln(3/2)) / 30`\n    Solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = (30 * ln(3)) / (1.5 * ln(3/2))`\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Result:** Now, we can compute the numerical value for `γ₂`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We derived the formula for the new Lorentz factor (gamma2) as:\n# gamma2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\n\ngamma2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\nprint(gamma2)\n```\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 54.19. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 28\nB) 68\nC) 54\nD) 40\n\nThe closest answer is 54.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Let's break down the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of Particle Decay**\n\nThe survival of particles over a distance is governed by an exponential decay law. In the lab frame (the detector's frame of reference), the fraction of particles `f` that survive after traveling a time `t` is given by:\n\n`f = N/N₀ = exp(-t / T_lab)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `N` is the number of particles remaining.\n*   `N₀` is the initial number of particles.\n*   `t` is the time of flight in the lab frame.\n*   `T_lab` is the mean lifetime of the particles in the lab frame.\n\n**2. Incorporate Special Relativity**\n\n*   **Time Dilation:** The lifetime of a moving particle is extended due to time dilation. The lifetime in the lab frame (`T_lab`) is related to its proper lifetime (`τ`, the lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`):\n    `T_lab = γ * τ`\n\n*   **Time of Flight:** The particles are ultra-relativistic, meaning their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. The time it takes them to travel the detector radius `R` is:\n    `t = R / v ≈ R / c`\n\n**3. Set up the Equations**\n\nSubstituting the relativistic expressions into the decay formula, we get:\n\n`f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ))`\n`f = exp(-R / (γ * cτ))`\n\nThe term `cτ` is a constant for this type of particle, known as its mean decay length in its rest frame.\n\n**4. Use the Given Information (Case 1)**\n\nWe are given:\n*   Radius `R = 30` m\n*   Initial Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`\n*   Fraction of surviving particles `f₁ = 1/3`\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n`1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * cτ))`\n\nTo solve for the constant term `cτ`, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * cτ)`\n`-ln(3) = -1.5 / (cτ)`\n`ln(3) = 1.5 / (cτ)`  (Equation 1)\n\n**5. Solve for the Unknown (Case 2)**\n\nWe need to find the new Lorentz factor (`γ₂`) that results in a survival fraction `f₂ = 2/3`.\n*   Radius `R = 30` m\n*   Fraction of surviving particles `f₂ = 2/3`\n*   New Lorentz factor `γ₂ = ?`\n\nPlugging these values into the general equation:\n`2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * cτ))`\n\nAgain, take the natural logarithm:\n`ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n`-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n`ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)` (Equation 2)\n\n**6. Combine the Equations to Find γ₂**\n\nThe easiest way to solve for `γ₂` is to take the ratio of the two equations we derived. Let's divide Equation 1 by Equation 2:\n`ln(3) / ln(3/2) = (1.5 / cτ) / (30 / (γ₂ * cτ))`\n\nThe `cτ` terms cancel out:\n`ln(3) / ln(3/2) = (1.5) * (γ₂ / 30)`\n`ln(3) / ln(3/2) = γ₂ / 20`\n\nNow, solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\n**7. Calculate the Value**\n\nUsing the python script, the calculation was performed:\n`γ₂ = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5) ≈ 54.19`\n\nThis value is very close to 54.\n\n<<<C>>>"
