    "*   **Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO) from the NMR data.**\n\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula is C8H9NO. The DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4 = 5. A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (DoU=4) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O or C=C).\n\n    *   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n        *   **δ 9.72 (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-), as per the n+1 rule (2 protons on the adjacent carbon, so 2+1=3 peaks).\n        *   **δ 6.98 (d, 2H) and δ 6.51 (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The relatively upfield shifts suggest the ring is substituted with an electron-donating group.\n        *   **δ 6.27 (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2). An amine group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield aromatic signals.\n        *   **δ 3.66 (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). The doublet (d) multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a methine group (-CH-), (1 proton on the adjacent carbon, so 1+1=2 peaks).\n\n    *   **Assembling the Structure:**\n        1.  We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n        2.  One substituent is an amino group (-NH2).\n        3.  The other substituent must account for the remaining atoms: C2H3O. This corresponds to a `-CH2-CHO` group (an acetaldehyde group).\n        4.  Let's assemble these fragments: `H2N - C6H4 - CH2 - CHO`. The amino group is at one end of the para-substituted ring, and the `-CH2-CHO` group is at the other.\n        5.  Let's verify the NMR couplings with this structure: `p-H2N-C6H4-CH2-CHO`.\n            *   The aldehyde proton (-CHO) is adjacent to the -CH2- group, so it should be a triplet. This matches the signal at 9.72 ppm.\n            *   The methylene protons (-CH2-) are adjacent to the aldehyde -CH, so they should be a doublet. This matches the signal at 3.66 ppm.\n            *   The structure is consistent with all the data.\n        6.  The starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n    *   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n    *   **Reagents 1 & 2: 1. NaNO2 + HCl; 2. H2O**\n        *   This is a two-step process to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n        *   Step 1 (Diazotization): The primary amine (-NH2) reacts with nitrous acid (formed from NaNO2 and HCl) at low temperature to form a diazonium salt (`-N2+Cl-`).\n        *   Step 2 (Hydrolysis): The diazonium salt is unstable and reacts with water (usually upon warming) to replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH), releasing nitrogen gas (N2).\n        *   The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n        *   Structure: `HO - C6H4 - CH2 - CHO`\n\n    *   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n        *   This reagent combination signifies a base-catalyzed reaction with heat. The substrate is 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which is an aldehyde with two acidic α-hydrogens (the hydrogens on the -CH2- group).\n        *   This is a classic setup for an **Aldol Condensation**.\n        *   **Mechanism:**\n            1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an α-hydrogen from one molecule of the aldehyde to form an enolate ion.\n            2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate ion acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n            3.  **Protonation:** An intermediate alkoxide is formed, which is protonated by water to give an aldol addition product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option D).\n            4.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is performed with **heat**. This provides the energy for the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The α-hydrogen and the β-hydroxyl group are eliminated to form a double bond between the α and β carbons. This dehydration is driven by the formation of a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n            \n            *   Aldol addition product: `HO-C6H4-CH(CHO)-CH(OH)-CH2-C6H4-OH`\n            *   Dehydration removes the -OH from C3 and an -H from C2.\n            *   Final Condensation Product: `HO-C6H4-C(CHO)=CH-CH2-C6H4-OH`\n\n    *   **Step 3: Identify the final product.**\n\n        *   The structure formed after dehydration is named as follows:\n            *   The main chain is a butenal (a four-carbon chain with an aldehyde and a double bond).\n            *   The double bond is between C2 and C3, so it's a but-2-enal.\n            *   There is a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group at position C2 and another at position C4.\n            *   The systematic name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n        *   This matches option A. Since the reaction is heated, the condensation product is the final, most stable product, rather than the intermediate aldol addition product (option D).\n\n<<<A>>>"
