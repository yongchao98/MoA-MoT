    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reference Frames:**\n    *   Let S be the reference frame of the Galaxy (considered stationary).\n    *   Let S' be the reference frame of the supernova ejecta (considered moving).\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`. From the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving at this speed.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame (S') is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it is measured in the frame where the clock (in this case, the process of the ejecta moving) is at rest.\n    *   The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance `d` that the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n\n4.  **Formulate the Plan:**\n    *   The distance `d` in the Galaxy frame is given by the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (S).\n    *   We are given the time in the ejecta's frame (`Δt'`), not the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`). We need to relate these two time intervals using the time dilation formula from special relativity.\n    *   The time dilation formula is: `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n5.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n\n    *   **Step A: Calculate the ratio `v/c` (also known as beta, `β`).**\n        `β = v / c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    *   **Step B: Calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`.**\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n    *   **Step C: Calculate the time `Δt` in the Galaxy's reference frame.**\n        `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n    *   **Step D: Calculate the distance `d` in the Galaxy's reference frame.**\n        `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n        `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n    *   **Step E: Compute the final numerical value.**\n        To get the final number, we can use a calculator or the following Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # km/s\nc = 300000  # km/s\ndt_prime = 50  # s\n\n# Calculate beta\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Calculate Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Calculate time in the Galaxy frame (dt)\ndt = gamma * dt_prime\n\n# Calculate distance in the Galaxy frame (d)\nd = v * dt\n\nprint(d)\n```\n**Execution Output:**\n```\n3061862.178478442\n```\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.

    "The problem asks for the distance the supernova ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame. This requires using the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n**1. Understand the Setup**\n\n*   **Galaxy Frame (S):** This is the stationary reference frame.\n*   **Ejecta Frame (S'):** This is the moving reference frame.\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** The ejecta moves at `v = 60,000 km/s` relative to the Galaxy.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt'):** The time elapsed in the ejecta's own frame is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is called the \"proper time\" because it's measured by a clock that is at rest in the ejecta's frame.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**2. The Physics Principle: Time Dilation**\n\nAccording to special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object (the ejecta). The time measured in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) will be longer than the time measured in the ejecta's frame (`Δt'`). This effect is called time dilation.\n\nThe formula for time dilation is:\n`Δt = γ * Δt'`\n\nwhere `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n**3. Calculation Steps**\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n    First, find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light, often denoted as `β` (beta):\n    `β = v / c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    Now, calculate γ:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - β²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n    `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt)**\n    Use the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt' ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n    This means that while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy measures about 51.03 seconds passing.\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d)**\n    The distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is the ejecta's velocity (as measured in the Galaxy's frame) multiplied by the time elapsed (also as measured in the Galaxy's frame).\n    `d = v * Δt`\n\n    We can combine the formulas from the previous steps for a more precise calculation:\n    `d = v * (γ * Δt') = v * (1 / √(1 - v²/c²)) * Δt'`\n    `d = 60,000 km/s * (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s`\n    `d = (60,000 * 50) / √(0.96) km`\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) km`\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.979796 km`\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately `3,061,862 km`. Comparing this to the given options:\n\n*   A) 3,060,000 km\n*   B) 3,000,000 km (This would be the non-relativistic answer: `60,000 km/s * 50 s`)\n*   C) 2,940,000 km\n*   D) 2,880,000 km\n\nThe calculated value `3,061,862 km` is extremely close to option A. The small difference is due to the rounding of the value in the option.\n\n<<<A>>>"
