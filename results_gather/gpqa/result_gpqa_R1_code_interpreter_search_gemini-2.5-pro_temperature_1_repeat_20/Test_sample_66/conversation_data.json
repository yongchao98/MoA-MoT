    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the initial state:** The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. This means the orbital angular momentum quantum number for each electron is $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$. The system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. This is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum squared operator, $L^2$, and its z-component, $L_z$, with quantum numbers $l=2$ and $m=-1$. The corresponding eigenvalues are $l(l+1)\\hbar^2 = 2(2+1)\\hbar^2 = 6\\hbar^2$ for $L^2$ and $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$ for $L_z$.\n\n2.  **Understand the measurement:** A measurement of the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed. These operators act on the individual particle states. The eigenstates of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ are the uncoupled states, denoted by $|m_1, m_2\\rangle \\equiv |l_1, m_1\\rangle \\otimes |l_2, m_2\\rangle$. For $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$, the possible values for $m_1$ and $m_2$ are $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\n3.  **Identify the target state:** The question asks for the probability of getting the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. This corresponds to finding the system in the state where electron 1 has $m_1 = -1$ and electron 2 has $m_2 = -1$. The uncoupled state corresponding to this outcome is $|m_1, m_2\\rangle = |-1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Relate the bases:** The core of the problem is to find the probability of finding the system in the final state $|-1, -1\\rangle$ given that it starts in the initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$. In quantum mechanics, this probability is given by the square of the magnitude of the inner product of the two state vectors:\n    $P = |\\langle \\text{final state} | \\text{initial state} \\rangle|^2$\n    $P = |\\langle m_1=-1, m_2=-1 | l=2, m=-1 \\rangle|^2$\n\n5.  **Use Clebsch-Gordan coefficients:** The inner product $\\langle m_1, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ is known as a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. These coefficients represent the transformation between the uncoupled basis $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ and the coupled basis $|l, m\\rangle$. The initial state can be expressed as a superposition of uncoupled states:\n    $|l, m\\rangle = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} \\langle m_1, m_2 | l, m \\rangle |m_1, m_2\\rangle$\n\n6.  **Apply the selection rule:** A fundamental property (or selection rule) of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are non-zero only if the z-components of angular momentum are conserved, i.e., $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n\n7.  **Calculate the specific coefficient:** In our case, we need the coefficient for:\n    *   Initial state: $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$\n    *   Final state projection: $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$\n\n    Let's check the selection rule:\n    *   $m = -1$\n    *   $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$\n\n    Since $m_1 + m_2 \\neq m$ (i.e., $-2 \\neq -1$), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle -1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ is exactly zero.\n\n8.  **Determine the probability:** Because the coefficient is zero, the probability is:\n    $P = |\\langle -1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle|^2 = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nThis means that the state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ is a superposition of uncoupled states where $m_1+m_2 = -1$ (specifically, $|0, -1\\rangle$ and $|-1, 0\\rangle$). It has no component of the state $|-1, -1\\rangle$. Therefore, it is impossible to measure $m_1=-1$ and $m_2=-1$ simultaneously if the system is in the state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$. The probability is zero.\n\n<<<D>>>"
