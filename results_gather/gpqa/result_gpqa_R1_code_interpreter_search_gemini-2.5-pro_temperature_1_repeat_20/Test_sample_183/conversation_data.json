    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   It is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring.\n*   Substituents:\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), an ortho,para-director, strongly activating.\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu), an ortho,para-director, weakly activating.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2), a meta-director, strongly deactivating.\n*   The relative positions are:\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are ortho to each other.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are ortho to each other.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are meta to each other.\n\n**2. General Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe 1,2,3-substitution pattern is often challenging to achieve directly because the directing effects of the groups can conflict. A common strategy involves:\n*   Introducing groups in a specific order to control regiochemistry.\n*   Using \"blocking groups\" (like -SO3H) to temporarily occupy a position, force a substituent into another desired position, and then remove the blocking group.\n*   Converting one functional group into another (e.g., -NH2 -> -N2+ -> -OH -> -OEt).\n\nThe final step is likely the Williamson ether synthesis (conversion of a phenol to an ether), as this is a reliable reaction that doesn't affect the other substituents. This means the penultimate intermediate is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n**3. Devise a Plausible Synthesis for 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**\n\nLet's work backward to create this key intermediate.\n*   The ortho relationship between the -tBu and -NO2 groups, and their meta relationship to the -OH group, is difficult to achieve directly.\n*   A known method for such substitutions involves starting with **o-tert-butylphenol**.\n*   The synthesis from o-tert-butylphenol proceeds as follows:\n    a.  **Sulfonation**: React o-tert-butylphenol with H2SO4. The bulky -tBu group and the directing power of the -OH group lead to sulfonation at the para-position (position 4). This gives **2-tert-butylphenol-4-sulfonic acid**. This step introduces a blocking group.\n    b.  **Nitration**: Now, nitrate the blocked phenol. The -OH is a strong o,p-director, and -SO3H is a m-director. The para position (to OH) is blocked. The ortho position (position 6) is sterically hindered by the adjacent t-Bu group. This steric hindrance makes nitration at position 3 (meta to -OH, ortho to -tBu) favorable. This is a key, non-obvious step that yields **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol-4-sulfonic acid**.\n    c.  **Desulfonation**: The sulfonic acid blocking group is removed by heating with dilute acid (e.g., dilute H2SO4 or steam distillation) to give **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n**4. Devise a Plausible Synthesis for o-tert-butylphenol from Benzene**\n\nThe above synthesis starts from o-tert-butylphenol. We need to make this from benzene. A high-yield laboratory synthesis would be:\n    a.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation**: Benzene reacts with tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 to give **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    b.  **Nitration**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives a mixture of o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene and p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The para isomer is the major product due to the bulkiness of the t-Bu group. For a high-yield synthesis of the ortho product, we must assume separation of the minor **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** isomer is possible.\n    c.  **Reduction**: The nitro group of o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene is reduced (e.g., with Fe/HCl) to an amino group, yielding **o-tert-butylaniline**.\n    d.  **Diazotization**: The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+) using NaNO2/HCl at low temperatures.\n    e.  **Hydrolysis**: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed by heating in water (H3O+/Heat) to replace the -N2+ group with an -OH group, yielding **o-tert-butylphenol**.\n\n**5. Assemble the Full Sequence and Compare with Options**\n\nCombining all the steps, the complete, logical sequence from benzene is:\n\n1.  **Alkylation** (tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3)\n2.  **Nitration** (HNO3/H2SO4) (to get o-nitro isomer)\n3.  **Reduction** (Fe/HCl)\n4.  **Diazotization** (NaNO2/HCl)\n5.  **Hydrolysis** (H3O+, H2O/Heat) (to make the phenol)\n6.  **Sulfonation** (SO3/H2SO4) (blocking step)\n7.  **Nitration** (HNO3/H2SO4) (to add the second nitro group)\n8.  **Desulfonation** (dilute H2SO4)\n9.  **Etherification** (NaOH/EtBr)\n\nThis full sequence uses two nitration steps and all the other reaction types listed in the options. Now let's analyze the given options to see which one matches this logically derived sequence.\n\n*   **My Derived Sequence of reaction *types***: Alkylation -> Nitration -> Reduction -> Diazotization -> Hydrolysis -> Sulfonation -> Nitration -> Desulfonation -> Etherification.\n\nLet's examine the options as written:\n*   **A)** Starts with Nitration. Incorrect.\n*   **B)** i) Alkylation ; ii) Sulfonation. Incorrect. The second step should be nitration.\n*   **C)** i) Alkylation ; ii) Nitration ; iii) Sulfonation. Incorrect. The third step should be reduction. Also, step iv) is impossible as there is no amine to diazotize.\n*   **D)** i) **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3** (Alkylation) ; ii) **HNO3/H2SO4** (Nitration) ; iii) **Fe/HCl** (Reduction). This sequence correctly describes the first three steps of our derived synthesis to make the key intermediate, o-tert-butylaniline (assuming separation of the ortho isomer).\n\nAlthough the subsequent steps in option D (iv: Nitration, v: Diazotization, etc.) are in the wrong order to complete the synthesis logically, it is the only option that presents a valid initial sequence of reactions for the first three crucial steps. The other options are incorrect from the second step (B, C) or the very first step (A) in the context of this specific synthesis. Given the likely presence of errors in the options, the one with the longest correct initial sequence is the most plausible answer.\n\nFinal check of path D:\n*   i) Benzene -> tert-butylbenzene\n*   ii) tert-butylbenzene -> o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (minor product)\n*   iii) o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene -> o-tert-butylaniline\nThis is a chemically valid route to a key intermediate. The rest of the sequence in D is flawed, but it provides the best starting point among the choices.\n\n<<<D>>>"
