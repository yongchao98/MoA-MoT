    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the area of a surface defined by the given metric. The area $A$ is found by integrating the area element $dA$ over the domain of the coordinates.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Metric and Area Element\n\nThe given metric is:\n$ds^{2}=\\frac{32}{\\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)}\\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\\right)$\n\nThis is a 2-dimensional metric of the form $ds^2 = g_{xx}dx^2 + 2g_{xy}dxdy + g_{yy}dy^2$.\nBy comparing the general form with the given metric, we can identify the components of the metric tensor $g$:\n$g_{xx} = \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}$\n$g_{yy} = \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}$\n$g_{xy} = g_{yx} = 0$\n\nThe metric tensor in matrix form is:\n$g = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe area element $dA$ is given by the formula $dA = \\sqrt{\\det(g)} \\, dx \\, dy$.\nFirst, we calculate the determinant of the metric tensor:\n$\\det(g) = g_{xx}g_{yy} - g_{xy}^2 = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right) - 0^2 = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right)^2$\n\nNow, we find the square root of the determinant:\n$\\sqrt{\\det(g)} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right)^2} = \\left|\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right|$\n\n### 2. Determining the Domain of Integration\n\nThe term \"pseudosphere of radius r=2\" and the denominator of the metric, $(4-x^2-y^2)$, suggest that the surface is defined for coordinates $(x,y)$ within a disk of radius 2. The metric becomes singular when $x^2+y^2=4$. The physically meaningful domain for this metric is the open disk $D$ where $x^2+y^2 < 4$. In this domain, the term $4-x^2-y^2$ is always positive.\nTherefore, the area element simplifies to:\n$dA = \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\n### 3. Setting up the Area Integral\n\nThe total area $A$ is the integral of the area element $dA$ over the domain $D$:\n$A = \\iint_D \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\, dx \\, dy$\nwhere $D = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\,|\\, x^2+y^2 < 4\\}$.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Integral using Polar Coordinates\n\nThis integral is best evaluated by switching to polar coordinates. Let:\n$x = \\rho \\cos\\theta$\n$y = \\rho \\sin\\theta$\nThis implies $x^2+y^2 = \\rho^2$. The differential area element in Cartesian coordinates, $dx\\,dy$, is replaced by $\\rho \\, d\\rho \\, d\\theta$ in polar coordinates.\n\nThe domain of integration in polar coordinates becomes:\n$0 \\le \\rho < 2$\n$0 \\le \\theta \\le 2\\pi$\n\nSubstituting these into the area integral:\n$A = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32}{4-\\rho^2} \\, \\rho \\, d\\rho \\, d\\theta$\n\nWe can separate the integral into two parts, one for $\\theta$ and one for $\\rho$:\n$A = \\left( \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta \\right) \\left( \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} \\, d\\rho \\right)$\n\nThe integral with respect to $\\theta$ is straightforward:\n$\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta = [\\theta]_0^{2\\pi} = 2\\pi$\n\nSo, the area is:\n$A = 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} \\, d\\rho$\n\nThe integral with respect to $\\rho$ is an improper integral because the integrand $\\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2}$ is undefined at the upper limit $\\rho=2$. We must evaluate it using a limit:\n$A = 64\\pi \\lim_{R \\to 2^-} \\int_{0}^{R} \\frac{\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} \\, d\\rho$\n\nTo solve the integral, we use the substitution $u = 4-\\rho^2$. This gives $du = -2\\rho \\, d\\rho$, or $\\rho \\, d\\rho = -\\frac{1}{2}du$. The limits of integration for $u$ are:\n- When $\\rho = 0$, $u = 4 - 0^2 = 4$.\n- When $\\rho = R$, $u = 4 - R^2$.\n\nThe integral becomes:\n$\\int_{0}^{R} \\frac{\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} \\, d\\rho = \\int_{4}^{4-R^2} \\frac{1}{u} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}du\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{4}^{4-R^2} \\frac{1}{u} \\, du = -\\frac{1}{2} [\\ln|u|]_4^{4-R^2}$\n$= -\\frac{1}{2} (\\ln|4-R^2| - \\ln|4|) = -\\frac{1}{2} (\\ln(4-R^2) - \\ln(4))$\n(since $4-R^2 > 0$ for $R<2$)\n\nNow we take the limit as $R \\to 2^-$:\n$\\lim_{R \\to 2^-} \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} (\\ln(4-R^2) - \\ln(4)) \\right)$\nAs $R \\to 2^-$, the term $4-R^2$ approaches $0^+$, and $\\ln(4-R^2)$ approaches $-\\infty$.\nSo, the limit is:\n$-\\frac{1}{2} (-\\infty - \\ln(4)) = +\\infty$\n\nThe integral diverges to positive infinity.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe total area is:\n$A = 64\\pi \\times (+\\infty) = +\\infty$\n\nThe area of the surface is infinite. Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) $+\\infty$\nB) $4\\pi\\left(x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)$\nC) $0$\nD) $4\\pi\\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\\right)$\n\nOptions B and D are not constant values, so they cannot represent the total area of the surface. Option C is incorrect as the area element is strictly positive over the domain. Our calculation shows that the area is infinite.\n\n<<<A>>>"
