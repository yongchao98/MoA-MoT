    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. This reaction selectively brominates the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group) of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 1:** The α-carbon of acetic acid is the methyl carbon. Brominating it yields bromoacetic acid.\n    *   Structure of Product 1: **Br-CH2-COOH**\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification reaction, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** The carboxyl group of bromoacetic acid reacts with ethanol.\n    *   Structure of Product 2: **Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3** (Ethyl bromoacetate)\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻), which is a good leaving group, from the α-carbon.\n*   **Product 3:**\n    *   Structure of Product 3: **NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3** (Ethyl cyanoacetate)\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a two-step process involving deprotonation and a double alkylation that results in cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes a proton from the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate. This proton is particularly acidic because the resulting negative charge is stabilized by resonance with both the adjacent cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups. This forms a carbanion (enolate).\n        *   NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **Alkylation & Cyclization:** The carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        *   [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n        Since excess NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining acidic proton on the α-carbon of this newly formed intermediate.\n        *   NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n        This new carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular SN2 reaction, attacking the carbon at the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a six-membered ring. This is a favorable ring-forming reaction.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group and an ethoxycarbonyl group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n    *   Structure of Product 4: **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of ¹H NMR signals for Product 4**\nTo count the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n*   **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This results in a time-averaged structure that possesses a plane of symmetry (a Cₛ plane). This plane passes through C1 (the carbon with the substituents), C4 (the carbon opposite C1), the cyano group, and the ethoxycarbonyl group.\n*   **Consequences of Symmetry:** This plane of symmetry makes pairs of carbons and their attached protons chemically equivalent:\n    *   C2 is equivalent to C6.\n    *   C3 is equivalent to C5.\n\nNow, let's count the unique proton environments:\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are adjacent to the rest of the molecule. For the purpose of this type of problem, they are considered chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   We must consider that geminal protons (the two protons on the same CH₂ group) on a substituted ring are typically diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent and give separate signals.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** These two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic. The same is true for C6. The symmetry makes the corresponding protons on C2 and C6 equivalent. Therefore, the four protons on these two carbons split into two distinct sets. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** Similarly, these two carbons are equivalent. The four protons on these two carbons are also split into two distinct, diastereotopic sets. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. The two protons on C4 are diastereotopic because the plane does not bisect the H-C-H angle, and their relationship to the substituents on C1 is different. They are not equivalent to each other. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\n*   From ethyl group: 1 (CH₃) + 1 (CH₂) = 2 signals\n*   From cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = 6 signals\n*   **Total = 2 + 6 = 8 distinct hydrogen signals.**\n\n<<<A>>>"
