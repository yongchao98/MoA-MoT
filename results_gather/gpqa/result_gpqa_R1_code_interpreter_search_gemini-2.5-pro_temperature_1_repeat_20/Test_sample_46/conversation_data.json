    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2 from the given spectroscopic data.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Molecular Formula\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The DBE indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n    *   DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a substituted benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBE: 1 ring + 3 double bonds) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Analyze the IR Spectrum\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** This pair of sharp peaks in the N-H stretching region is the characteristic signature of a primary amine (-NH2). A primary amide (-CONH2) would also show two bands, but secondary amides (-NHR) would only show one. This suggests the presence of an -NH2 group.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region.\n    *   An ester C=O stretch typically appears around 1735-1750 cm⁻¹, but conjugation with an aromatic ring lowers this frequency to about 1715-1730 cm⁻¹.\n    *   An amide C=O stretch (Amide I band) is usually at a lower frequency, around 1630-1690 cm⁻¹.\n    *   Therefore, the 1720 cm⁻¹ band strongly indicates an **aromatic ester**.\n\n*   **IR Conclusion:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH2) group and an aromatic ester group.\n\n### 3. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   These two signals (triplet at 1.20 ppm and quartet at 4.5 ppm) together confirm the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**.\n    *   The high chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates the methylene group is attached to a very electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen atom, as in an ester (-O-CH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is typical for the exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH2) group. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The ring has two different substituents. One is electron-donating, and the other is electron-withdrawing.\n    *   The electron-donating group (the -NH2 group) shields the protons ortho to it, shifting them upfield (to a lower ppm value).\n    *   The electron-withdrawing group (the ester group, -COOR) deshields the protons ortho to it, shifting them downfield (to a higher ppm value).\n    *   Therefore, the doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons next to the -NH2 group, and the doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons next to the ester group.\n\n### 4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options\nBased on the analysis, the unknown compound has the following pieces:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3)\n*   A primary amine group (-NH2)\n\nAssembling these pieces leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's verify this against the given options:\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is a phenyl ester. The NMR signal for the -CO-CH2- protons would be a quartet around 2.4 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the data:\n    *   Formula: C9H11NO2 (Correct)\n    *   IR: Primary amine and aromatic ester (Correct)\n    *   NMR: Ethyl group attached to ester oxygen, primary amine protons, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring with the correct electronic effects. (Correct)\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide, so its IR C=O stretch would be ~1680 cm⁻¹, not 1720 cm⁻¹. It is also 1,3-disubstituted (meta), which would give a more complex NMR splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two doublets. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR and have only one N-H proton in the NMR. This is incorrect.\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly supports ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
