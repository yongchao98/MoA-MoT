    "This problem requires us to calculate two quantities in the framework of special relativity: the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.\n\n**Part 1: Calculating the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nSince the astronauts are moving at relativistic speeds, we cannot simply subtract their velocities. We must use the Lorentz velocity addition formula. For two objects moving in the same direction with velocities v1 and v2, their relative velocity is given by:\n\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nGiven:\n*   Velocity of the first astronaut, v1 = 0.6c\n*   Velocity of the second astronaut, v2 = 0.5c\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3c^2 / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7`\n`v_rel = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c`\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n**Part 2: Calculating the Total Energy (E_total)**\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the formula E = γmc², where γ (the Lorentz factor) is `1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\nWe need to calculate the energy for each astronaut and then add them together.\n\n**Energy of the first astronaut (E1):**\n*   Mass, m1 = 2m\n*   Velocity, v1 = 0.6c\n*   First, calculate its Lorentz factor (γ1):\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n*   Now, calculate its energy (E1):\n    `E1 = γ1 * m1 * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²`\n\n**Energy of the second astronaut (E2):**\n*   Mass, m2 = 3m\n*   Velocity, v2 = 0.5c\n*   First, calculate its Lorentz factor (γ2):\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547`\n*   Now, calculate its energy (E2):\n    `E2 = γ2 * m2 * c² = (1.1547) * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.464 mc²`\n\n**Total Energy of the system (E_total):**\n*   The total energy is the sum of the individual energies:\n    `E_total = E1 + E2`\n    `E_total = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc²`\n    `E_total = 5.964 mc²`\n\nSo, the total energy is approximately **5.96 mc²**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe calculated relative speed is v_rel ≈ 0.14c and the total energy is E ≈ 5.96 mc². Comparing these results with the given options, we find that option D matches our calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Part 1: Relative Speed\nv1 = 0.6\nv2 = 0.5\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - v1 * v2)\nprint(f\"Relative speed = {v_rel:.2f}c\")\n\n# Part 2: Total Energy\n# Astronaut 1\nm1_factor = 2\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v1**2)\nE1_factor = gamma1 * m1_factor\n\n# Astronaut 2\nm2_factor = 3\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v2**2)\nE2_factor = gamma2 * m2_factor\n\n# Total Energy\nE_total_factor = E1_factor + E2_factor\nprint(f\"Total energy = {E_total_factor:.2f}mc^2\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem involves two key concepts from special relativity: the relativistic velocity addition formula and the formula for total relativistic energy.\n\n**1. Calculation of Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nWhen dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, we cannot simply subtract the velocities. We must use the relativistic velocity addition formula (in this case, for subtraction). For two objects moving in the same direction with velocities $v_1$ and $v_2$ as measured from a stationary frame, their relative velocity is given by:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nGiven:\n*   Velocity of the first astronaut, $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Velocity of the second astronaut, $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n\n$v_{rel} \\approx 0.1428c$\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n**2. Calculation of Total Energy ($E_{total}$)**\n\nThe total energy of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by the equation:\n\n$E = \\gamma mc^2$\n\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts ($E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$).\n\n**Energy of the first astronaut ($E_1$):**\n*   Mass, $m_1 = 2m$\n*   Velocity, $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n*   Energy, $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) \\times c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**Energy of the second astronaut ($E_2$):**\n*   Mass, $m_2 = 3m$\n*   Velocity, $v_2 = 0.5c$\n*   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx 1.1547$\n*   Energy, $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx 1.1547 \\times (3m) \\times c^2 \\approx 3.464 mc^2$\n\n**Total Energy of the system ($E_{total}$):**\n*   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.464 mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2$\n\nSo, the total energy is approximately **5.96 mc²**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately 0.14c, and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc². This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
