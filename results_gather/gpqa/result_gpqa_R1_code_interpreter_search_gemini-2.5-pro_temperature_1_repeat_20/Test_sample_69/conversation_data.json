    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical riddle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:**\n    *   Reaction 1: `Solid A + 8 Gas B -> Bright red product C`\n    *   Reaction 2: `C + 2 Gas D -> Extremely hazardous product E`\n    *   Reaction 3: `C + H₂O -> A + Acid F (strong) + Acid G (weak)`\n    *   Reaction 4: `D + B (1:1 ratio) -> H (solvent)`\n    *   Question: What is the molecular symmetry group of E?\n\n2.  **Identify the Compounds Starting with Reaction 4:**\n    *   Reaction 4 describes two gases, B and D, reacting in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\n    *   A very common reaction between two simple gases that fits this description is the formation of phosgene from carbon monoxide and chlorine:\n        `CO (gas, B) + Cl₂ (gas, D) -> COCl₂ (phosgene, H)`\n    *   Phosgene (COCl₂) is a liquid at lower temperatures (b.p. 8 °C) and is used as a reagent and sometimes a solvent in organic chemistry.\n    *   Let's hypothesize:\n        *   **B = CO** (carbon monoxide)\n        *   **D = Cl₂** (chlorine)\n        *   **H = COCl₂** (phosgene)\n\n3.  **Verify with Reaction 1:**\n    *   `Solid A + 8 Gas B -> Bright red product C`\n    *   Substituting B = CO: `Solid A + 8 CO -> C`\n    *   This suggests the formation of a metal carbonyl complex. The stoichiometry of 8 CO molecules points towards a dimeric complex. A well-known reaction is:\n        `2Co (solid, A) + 8CO (gas, B) -> Co₂(CO)₈ (C)`\n    *   Let's check the properties. **A = Co** (Cobalt) is a solid. **C = Co₂(CO)₈** (dicobalt octacarbonyl) is an orange-red crystalline solid, which matches the \"bright red product\" description.\n    *   The stoichiometry in the riddle is `A + 8B`. This might be a simplification, referring to the fundamental reacting unit of solid A (a Co atom) reacting with 4 CO molecules, with the overall reaction involving 2 Co atoms and 8 CO molecules. This fit is very strong.\n\n4.  **Verify with Reaction 3:**\n    *   `C + H₂O -> A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)`\n    *   Substituting C = Co₂(CO)₈ and A = Co. The reaction is the hydrolysis of dicobalt octacarbonyl.\n    *   While simple hydrolysis doesn't cleanly reform cobalt metal (A), the reaction of Co₂(CO)₈ with a base (like aqueous OH⁻) causes disproportionation:\n        `3Co₂(CO)₈ + 12OH⁻ -> 2Co(OH)₂ + 4[Co(CO)₄]⁻ + 8CO₃²⁻`\n    *   The products are a Co(II) species, the tetracarbonylcobaltate(-1) anion, and the carbonate anion.\n    *   The conjugate acid of `[Co(CO)₄]⁻` is **HCo(CO)₄**, which is a **strong acid (F)**.\n    *   The conjugate acid of `CO₃²⁻` is **H₂CO₃** (carbonic acid), which is a **weak acid (G)**.\n    *   This fits the \"strong acid F and weak acid G\" clue perfectly. The \"reforms A\" part is likely a simplification in the riddle, where the formation of a simple cobalt salt is considered akin to reforming the starting element.\n\n5.  **Identify E from Reaction 2:**\n    *   `C + 2 D -> Extremely hazardous product E`\n    *   Substituting C = Co₂(CO)₈ and D = Cl₂:\n        `Co₂(CO)₈ + 2 Cl₂ -> E`\n    *   Chlorine is an oxidizing agent that will break the Co-Co bond and oxidize the cobalt from the 0 oxidation state. The known reaction with this exact stoichiometry is:\n        `Co₂(CO)₈ + 2 Cl₂ -> 2 CoCl₂ + 8 CO`\n    *   The problem states this reaction \"produces the extremely hazardous product E\". The products are cobalt(II) chloride (CoCl₂) and carbon monoxide (CO). CO is gas B. It is unlikely that E is the same as B. Therefore, E is most likely CoCl₂.\n    *   **E = CoCl₂** (cobalt(II) chloride).\n    *   Is CoCl₂ \"extremely hazardous\"? It is classified as possibly carcinogenic to humans (IARC Group 2B) and may cause genetic defects and damage fertility. For a riddle, this level of toxicity can be described as \"extremely hazardous\".\n\n6.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E:**\n    *   The question asks for the **molecular** symmetry group of E, which is CoCl₂. This implies we should consider the structure of a single CoCl₂ molecule, as it would exist in the gas phase.\n    *   A triatomic molecule of the form ABA, like CoCl₂, is predicted by VSEPR theory to be **linear**. The structure is Cl—Co—Cl.\n    *   Let's determine the point group for a linear molecule with a center of inversion:\n        *   It has a principal axis of infinite order, **C∞**.\n        *   It has an infinite number of C₂ axes perpendicular to the principal axis.\n        *   It has a horizontal mirror plane, **σh**, perpendicular to the C∞ axis and passing through the Co atom.\n        *   The presence of these elements defines the **D∞h** point group.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The chemical riddle leads to the identification of E as cobalt(II) chloride, CoCl₂. The molecular symmetry group for the linear CoCl₂ molecule is D∞h. This corresponds to option A.\n\n```python\n# This is a conceptual problem and does not require computation.\n# The reasoning identifies the compounds based on the chemical clues provided.\n# A = Cobalt (Co)\n# B = Carbon Monoxide (CO)\n# C = Dicobalt octacarbonyl (Co2(CO)8)\n# D = Chlorine (Cl2)\n# E = Cobalt(II) chloride (CoCl2)\n# F = Hydridocobalt tetracarbonyl (HCo(CO)4)\n# G = Carbonic acid (H2CO3)\n# H = Phosgene (COCl2)\n# The question asks for the molecular symmetry group of E (CoCl2).\n# In the gas phase, CoCl2 is a linear molecule (Cl-Co-Cl).\n# A linear molecule with a center of inversion belongs to the D∞h point group.\n# The options are: A) D∞h, B) D4h, C) C2, D) C2v.\n# The correct option is A.\n\nprint(\"A\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here's the step-by-step thinking process to solve the chemical riddle:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   Clue 1: `Solid A + 8 Gas B -> Bright red product C`\n    *   Clue 2: `C + 2 Gas D -> Extremely hazardous product E`\n    *   Clue 3: `C + H₂O -> A + Acid F (strong) + Acid G (weak)`\n    *   Clue 4: `D + B (1:1 ratio) -> H (solvent)`\n    *   Question: What is the molecular symmetry group of E?\n\n2.  **Start with the Most Definitive Clue (Clue 4):**\n    *   `D + B (1:1 ratio) -> H (solvent)` describes a 1:1 reaction between two gases to form a substance used as a solvent.\n    *   A very common and simple reaction that fits this description is the synthesis of phosgene from carbon monoxide (CO) and chlorine (Cl₂).\n    *   `CO(g) + Cl₂(g) -> COCl₂(g)`\n    *   This leads to the hypothesis:\n        *   **B = CO** (carbon monoxide)\n        *   **D = Cl₂** (chlorine gas)\n        *   **H = COCl₂** (phosgene)\n\n3.  **Verify the Hypothesis with Clue 1:**\n    *   `Solid A + 8 Gas B -> Bright red product C`\n    *   Substituting B = CO: `Solid A + 8 CO -> C`\n    *   This reaction signature strongly suggests the formation of a metal carbonyl. The stoichiometry of 8 CO molecules points towards a dimeric complex. A well-known metal carbonyl synthesis is:\n        `2 Co(s) + 8 CO(g) -> Co₂(CO)₈(s)`\n    *   Let's check the properties:\n        *   **A = Co** (Cobalt) is a solid metal. This fits.\n        *   **C = Co₂(CO)₈** (dicobalt octacarbonyl) is described as an orange-red crystalline solid. This fits \"bright red product\".\n    *   This confirms our assignments for A, B, and C.\n\n4.  **Verify with Clue 3:**\n    *   `C + H₂O -> A + Acid F (strong) + Acid G (weak)`\n    *   Substituting C = Co₂(CO)₈ and A = Co.\n    *   The hydrolysis of metal carbonyls can be complex. However, the acid products are very telling.\n    *   The tetracarbonylcobaltate anion, `[Co(CO)₄]⁻`, is a common species derived from Co₂(CO)₈. Its conjugate acid is **HCo(CO)₄** (hydridotetracarbonylcobalt). HCo(CO)₄ is known to be a **strong acid**. This is an excellent match for **F**.\n    *   The carbon monoxide ligands (from C) can react with water (or more specifically, hydroxide ions) to form carbonate (CO₃²⁻). The conjugate acid is **H₂CO₃** (carbonic acid), a classic **weak acid**. This is an excellent match for **G**.\n    *   The clue \"reforms A\" is a simplification, but the formation of the expected strong and weak acids provides strong validation for our identified compounds.\n\n5.  **Identify E using Clue 2:**\n    *   `C + 2 D -> Extremely hazardous product E`\n    *   Substituting C = Co₂(CO)₈ and D = Cl₂.\n    *   `Co₂(CO)₈ + 2 Cl₂ -> E`\n    *   Chlorine is an oxidizing agent that reacts with the cobalt center. The reaction with this specific 2:1 stoichiometry is known to break the Co-Co bond and displace all the CO ligands.\n    *   `Co₂(CO)₈ + 2 Cl₂ -> 2 CoCl₂ + 8 CO`\n    *   The reaction produces cobalt(II) chloride and carbon monoxide. Since the riddle asks for the identity of product E, it refers to the newly formed, non-gaseous product.\n    *   Therefore, **E = CoCl₂** (cobalt(II) chloride).\n    *   CoCl₂ is listed as possibly carcinogenic to humans and is toxic, fitting the description \"extremely hazardous\" in the context of a riddle.\n\n6.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E:**\n    *   The question asks for the **molecular** symmetry group of E (CoCl₂). This implies we should consider the geometry of a single, isolated CoCl₂ molecule, as it exists in the gas phase.\n    *   According to VSEPR theory, a central atom (Co) bonded to two other atoms (Cl) with no lone pairs on the central atom will have a **linear** geometry.\n    *   The structure is Cl—Co—Cl.\n    *   Let's determine the point group for this linear, centrosymmetric molecule:\n        *   It has an axis of infinite rotational symmetry (C∞) along the Cl-Co-Cl bond.\n        *   It has an infinite number of two-fold rotation axes (C₂) perpendicular to the main C∞ axis. This makes it a D-type point group.\n        *   It has a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that is perpendicular to the C∞ axis and passes through the Co atom.\n        *   The combination of a C∞ axis and a perpendicular σh plane defines the **D∞h** point group.\n\n7.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    *   The calculated point group for the CoCl₂ molecule is D∞h.\n    *   Comparing this to the given options:\n        *   A) D∞h\n        *   B) D4h\n        *   C) C2\n        *   D) C2v\n    *   The correct option is A.\n\n```python\n# Based on the chemical reasoning:\n# E is identified as Cobalt(II) chloride (CoCl2).\n# In its molecular (gas-phase) form, CoCl2 is a linear molecule.\n# A linear molecule with a center of symmetry (like Cl-Co-Cl) belongs to the D∞h point group.\n# Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\nprint(\"A\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
